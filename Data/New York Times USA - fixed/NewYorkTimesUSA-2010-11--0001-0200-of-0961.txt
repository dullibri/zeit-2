HEADLINE: Debt Collectors Face a Hazard: Writer's Cramp

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL; Andrew Martin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When Michael Gazzarato took a job that required him to sign hundreds of affidavits in a single day, he had one demand for his employer: a much better pen.
''They tried to get me to do it with a Bic, and I wasn't going -- I wasn't having it,'' he said. ''It was bad when I had to use the plastic Papermate-type pen. It was a nightmare.''
The complaint could have come from any of the autograph marathoners in the recent mortgage foreclosure mess. But Mr. Gazzarato was speaking at a deposition in a 2007 lawsuit against Asset Acceptance, a company that buys consumer debts and then tries to collect.
His job was to sign affidavits, swearing that he had personally reviewed and verified the records of debtors -- a time-consuming task when done correctly. 
Sound familiar?
Banks have been under siege in recent weeks for widespread corner-cutting in the rush to process delinquent mortgages. The accusations have stirred outrage and set off investigations by attorneys general across the country, prompting several leading banks to temporarily cease foreclosures.
But lawyers who defend consumers in debt-collection cases say the banks did not invent the headless, assembly-line approach to financial paperwork. Debt buyers, they say, have been doing it for years.
''The difference is that in the case of debt buyers, the abuses are much worse,'' says Richard Rubin, a consumer lawyer in Santa Fe, N.M.
''At least when it comes to mortgages, the banks have the right address, everyone agrees about the interest rate. But with debt buyers, the debt has been passed through so many hands, often over so many years, that a lot of time, these companies are pursuing the wrong person, or the charges have no lawful basis.''
The debt in these cases -- typically from credit cards, auto loans, utility bills and so on -- is sold by finance companies and banks in a vast secondary market, bundled in huge portfolios, for pennies on the dollar. Debt buyers often hire collectors to commence a campaign of insistent letters and regular phone calls. Or, in a tactic that is becoming increasingly popular, they sue.
Nobody knows how many debt-collection affidavits are filed each year, but a report by the nonprofit Legal Aid Society found that in New York City alone more than 450,000 were filed by debt buyers, from January 2006 to July 2008, yielding more than $1.1 billion in judgments and settlements.
Problems with this torrent of litigation are legion, according to the Federal Trade Commission, led by Jon Leibowitz. The agency issued a report on the subject, ''Repairing a Broken System,'' in July. In some instances, banks are selling account information that is riddled with errors.
More often, essential background information simply is not acquired by debt buyers, in large part because that data adds to the price of each account. But court rules state that anyone submitting an affidavit to a court against a debtor must have proof of that claim -- proper documentation of a debt's origins, history and amount.
Without that information it is hard to imagine how any company could meet the legal standard of due diligence, particularly while churning out thousands and thousands of affidavits a week.
Analysts say that affidavit-signers at debt-buying companies appear to have little choice but to take at face value the few facts typically provided to them -- often little more than basic account information on a computer screen.
That was made vividly clear during the deposition last year of Jay Mills, an employee of a subsidiary of SquareTwo Financial (then known as Collect America), a debt-buying company in Denver.
''So,'' asked Dale Irwin, the plaintiff's lawyer, using shorthand for Collect America, ''if you see on the screen that the moon is made of green cheese, you trust that CACH has investigated that and has determined that in fact, the moon is made of green cheese?''
''Yes,'' Mr. Mills replied.
Given the volume of affidavits, even perfunctory research seems impossible. Cherie Thomas, who works for Asta Funding, a debt buyer in Englewood Cliffs, N.J., said in a 2007 deposition that she had signed 2,000 affidavits a day. With a half-hour for lunch and two brief breaks, that's roughly one affidavit every 13 seconds.
Executives at debt-buying firms say they have systems to ensure the accuracy of their affidavits. Robert Michel, chief financial officer at Asta Funding, says his company hires outside lawyers to read over affidavits, then has staff employees check their work.
''The people who work in this area are well trained, and they know that when they sign a statement they have to follow certain procedures,'' he said. ''They know what they are doing.''
He added that the pace of affidavits filed by Asta had dwindled since 2007 and was now closer to ''several hundred'' a day, rather than 2,000.
Even if debt buyers purchase the requisite information directly from a bank, it may be flawed. Linda Almonte oversaw a team of advisers, analysts and managers at JPMorgan Chase last year, when the company was preparing the sale of 23,000 delinquent accounts, with a face value of $200 million. With the debt sold at roughly 13 cents on the dollar, the sale was supposed to net $26 million.
As the date of the sale approached, Ms. Almonte and her employees started to notice mistakes and inconsistencies in the accounts.
''We found that with about 5,000 accounts there were incorrect balances, incorrect addresses,'' she said. ''There were even cases where a consumer had won a judgment against Chase, but it was still part of the package being sold.''
Ms. Almonte flagged the defects with her manager, but he shrugged them off, she says, and he urged her and her colleagues to complete the deal in time for the company's coming earnings report. Instead, she contacted senior legal counsel at the company. Within days, she was fired. She has since filed a wrongful termination suit against Chase.
A Chase spokesman declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.
The majority of lawsuits filed in debt collection cases go unanswered, which is why most end with default judgments -- victories for creditors that allow them to use court officers or sheriffs to garnish wages or freeze bank accounts, among other remedies.
There is a persistent argument about why so few consumers respond in these cases. Consumers often know they owe the debt and conclude that fighting about it is pointless, said Barbara Sinsley, general counsel at DBA International, a trade group of debt buyers.
Lawyers for consumers, on the other hand, contend that few debtors ever learn about the legal action until it is too late, often because the process server charged with alerting them never actually delivered a notification. In those instances when a consumer hires a lawyer, the consumer often prevails.
''I've lost four and I've taken about 5,000 cases,'' said Jerry Jarzombek, a consumer lawyer in Fort Worth. ''If the case goes to trial, I say to the judge, 'Your honor, imagine if someone came in here to give eyewitness testimony in a traffic accident case and they didn't actually see the crash. They just read about it somewhere. Well, this is the same thing.' The debt buyers don't know anything about the debt. They just read about it.''
Every plaintiff's lawyer and consumer advocate in this field has a theory about why there has been so much fury over mortgage paperwork abuses but so little about debt collections. The stakes in collections cases are smaller, and of course, debt buyers were never given a taxpayer bailout.
''But what people don't realize,'' said Daniel Edelman, a plaintiff's lawyer in Chicago, ''is that the mortgage issue and debt collections are intimately connected. The millions of default judgments out there -- you better believe that's one reason that homeowners can't afford their homes.''

HEADLINE: A Donation Clouds Fox News Report

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
The Fox Business Network focused on what it called ''The War on Business'' all last week, but on Tuesday its coverage was decidedly more focused -- with a series of reports about a California ballot initiative that its parent company, the News Corporation, had spent $1.3 million to defeat.
Call it the War on Proposition 24. 
The News Corporation is one of the many major media companies that have spent more than $1 million each seeking to defeat the proposition, which supporters say would repeal $1.7 billion in corporate tax breaks to help close the state's budget gap.
Executives at media companies, which employ tens of thousands in the entertainment industry, say defeating the proposition is one of their biggest priorities in the midterm elections, and they question how they would continue to operate in the state if taxes go up.
In five consecutive hours of live reports on Tuesday, a Fox Business correspondent, Adam Shapiro, was stationed at Cambridge of California, a small furniture manufacturing facility in Gardena. Mr. Shapiro repeatedly said the proposition could drive businesses -- specifically small businesses, not media titans -- out of California, and he said ''332,000 jobs'' were ''on the line.''
Tracy Byrnes, the anchor for one of the reports, expressed the opinion that ''the proposition was setting up businesses to be destroyed, quite frankly.''
Yet in its expanded coverage of the issue, Fox did not disclose the News Corporation's donation to a group working to defeat Proposition 24. Nor did Fox report that the small-business man it featured in the news reports was asked to do the interview by the same group, No on 24 -- Stop the Jobs Tax.
A Fox Business executive said he had not known about the parent company's donation. Industry observers, however, said the News Corporation's contribution to the group, and the organization's role in arranging the interview, raised a potential conflict of interest that warranted disclosure.
''There's a trust between you and your audience, no matter what the medium is,'' said Kevin Z. Smith, who holds the ethics chair for the Society of Professional Journalists and is a past president of that organization. ''Not disclosing conflicts, to me, severely undermines your credibility.''
The News Corporation, the Walt Disney Company, Time Warner, Viacom, CBS and General Electric, the owner of NBC, make up six of the nine biggest donors to No on 24. The companies declined to comment about the proposition. The three other contributors of more than $1 million are Cisco, Genentech and Qualcomm.
Asked why media companies had been so opposed to the proposition, Scott Macdonald, a spokesman for No on 24, said it ''would return California to an outdated way of taxing multistate companies that would be especially harmful for those with a large number of facilities and employees here,'' like Hollywood studios.
Mr. Macdonald said the proposition ''would mean these companies' income taxes would increase when they added a new facility or hired a new employee.''
The ballot initiative is chiefly supported by the state's teachers unions.
Local stations in California, including those owned by CBS and NBC, have covered the proposition without disclosing their corporate contributions. But no news outlet has covered the issue as aggressively as Fox Business, the three-year-old sibling of Fox News.
Kevin Magee, an executive vice president at Fox Business, said in an interview on Friday, ''We didn't know that News Corporation had made a contribution to No for 24.'' He said such disclosures were normal ''if you know it and if it's germane to the story.'' He said that had he known in this case, he thought the network would have disclosed the donation.
Mr. Magee said ''The War on Business'' was one of the channel's weekly themes to focus attention on business issues. Other themes have included ''They're Burning Your Money'' and ''Is the World Broke?''
He said the network's tone was not ''pro-business'' per se, but that it was ''making sure that businesses get heard.''
The owner of Cambridge of California, Ben Nielsen, who was featured in the reports, said the people who brought him in for the interview ''were the people that are handling the campaign,'' No on 24.
Mr. Nielsen reiterated in an interview on Friday that Proposition 24 would have devastating consequences for his business. Closing his facility is one option he is considering if the proposition passes, he said, and in that case ''20 people are going on unemployment.''
The reports on Fox Business did not include any interviews with teachers or other people supporting the proposition.
The disclosure of the News Corporation's contributions has already come up in this election cycle.
When the company donated $1 million to the Republican Governors Association this summer, there were calls by the Democratic Governors Association for Fox News to disclose that donation in news coverage about governors' races.
The network at first rebuffed the Democratic group, claiming it was just trying to gain publicity. But in October a Fox News correspondent, James Rosen, disclosed the donation, ''by way of full disclosure,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Awaiting Fed's Plans, The Markets Are in Limbo

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Sewell Chan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Everyone on Wall Street is waiting on the Fed.
Whatever the outcome of Tuesday's midterm elections, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to take new steps this week to spur the nation's snail-paced recovery.
Indeed, investors are counting on the Fed. The stock market has been rallying since August in part on expectations that the central bank would embark on another round of what is known as quantitative easing. Equities and gold are up. The dollar and market interest rates are down. 
Because official rates are already near zero, the Fed is expected to buy United States Treasury securities, and perhaps other investments, to pump more money into the financial system.
The question is how aggressively the Fed will act, and whether it can actually make a difference to the broader economy.
Analysts expect the central bank to buy securities on the open market in an effort to the unlock the flow of credit to the economy. Estimates of the size of the program range from $500 billion to $2 trillion. As usual, analysts will parse every word of any statement from the Fed. An announcement is expected Wednesday.
But while investors have been staking out their positions for weeks, the announcement -- and the potential ramifications -- remain fraught with uncertainty. Given that the Fed's news is expected to land as Wall Street is digesting Tuesday's election results, analysts are bracing for a volatile day, particularly if the Fed underwhelms investors.
''There is not going to be a headline-grabbing number,'' said David Semmens, the United States economist for Standard Chartered Bank. ''It will cause the market significant concern.''
At the end of 2008, the Fed began a program to buy $1.7 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The purchases were announced in advance and came in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Now investors are waiting for a second round of such quantitative easing. Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has hinted that the central bank is likely to act.
''The market is the world's largest forecasting mechanism,'' said Stephen Wood, senior portfolio strategist for Russell Investments. ''Markets tend to move before things happen.''
There have been plenty of signals to feed expectations. The annual inflation rate is running below 2 percent, while unemployment remains stubbornly high. The latest estimated gross domestic product pace of 2 percent for the third quarter and the core personal consumption expenditures rise of 0.8 percent, released on Friday, only added to what many saw as further justification for action.
If the government spends $500 billion to $2 trillion on quantitative easing, the securities purchases are expected to be spread out over months. The Fed might spend $80 billion to $100 billion a month, constantly assessing whether the program is having the desired effect.
''The Fed loves ranges because that gives them more options,'' said Mr. Wood. ''They will set expectations but not tip their hands. It will want to keep its powder dry, its options open.''
But with quantitative easing already expected by the markets, such an announcement could disappoint investors. Treasuries and equities could modestly sell off in the short term if the amount is less than expected.
''If there is any sign of a more cautious approach, or a smaller scale, you could see long-term bond rates rise, the dollar strengthen and perhaps stocks selling off a bit,'' said Adrian Cronje, the chief investment officer of Balentine. ''I think that is probably the area that is most likely to cause any correction to recent trends -- if there is a sense that the Federal Reserve might back off.''
Many analysts expect the second round of purchases to be mostly of two- and 10-year Treasuries, although the Goldman Sachs Group recently predicted that the Fed might include 30-year Treasury bonds in its program. Guy LeBas, the chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott, said his firm expected $100 billion in monthly asset purchases, with the final amount contingent on future inflation.
The dollar has been weakening against major currencies in recent weeks on the expectation of the Fed's move. Gold, already at a high above $1,300 an ounce, could benefit even more if investors read an aggressive move by the Fed as a sign that inflation may eventually accelerate, said Jeffrey Nichols, senior economic adviser to Rosland Capital, in a recent speech.
The stock market treaded water on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing virtually unchanged at 11,118.49. The broad stock market has gained about 9.5 percent since Sept. 1.
''People have taken positions, and they are waiting to see what the trifecta is,'' said Howard Silverblatt, the senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's, referring to this week's elections, Fed meeting and monthly national unemployment report. The question, he said, is whether the Fed's expected action produces a yawn or a sigh of relief.

HEADLINE: And Now They Think They're Important

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
Thirty-five years ago, New York's newly elected governor, Hugh Carey, confronted a feckless inaugural audience -- the State Legislature -- with a bold announcement: ''Now the times of plenty, the days of wine and roses, are over.'' The reaction from cynical solons out on the Assembly floor: Oh, yeah, sure; we'll follow him and what army of lobbyists? 
The times could not be more ripe for invoking the wine-and-roses mantra of Mr. Carey, who went on to serve eight years as a governor of historic accomplishments. He stunned and delighted reporters like me as he whipped and coaxed responsibility from the indolent Legislature to deliver New York City from the brink of bankruptcy and the state from economic stagnation.
''Every day that passes, Hugh Carey grows taller,'' says Richard Ravitch, New York's current lieutenant governor (by emergency appointment), who has been battling another runaway state budget mess. Mr. Ravitch was one of the many outside specialists recruited into public service by Mr. Carey.
He reports that his mentor, at 91 years and wheelchair-bound, is ever curious about what fresh hell is in the hands of the latest politicians. The once unstoppably loquacious governor doesn't say much these days; his signature wit before life's foibles is not so ready as it was. But he sees, like the rest of us, the budget scams, the greed and scandals and hears the placebos and bromides passed off as high debate.
A new book -- ''The Man Who Saved New York'' -- is a tribute to Governor Carey's mastery over the city's fiscal collapse. In a bold stroke, he brought Wall Street together with government unions, leveraging their self-interests against survival of the commonweal. When he left office, this page saluted Hugh Carey as ''A Governor for Hard Winters.''
As he departed Albany, Mr. Carey pointed across to the office tower built by Gov. Nelson Rockefeller to ensconce the state's lawmakers in marble-clad grandiosity. ''He built them that building and now they think they're important,'' he said. His wit prophetic.

HEADLINE: Mugged by the Moralizers

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor's mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can't pay their bills?'' That's the question CNBC's Rick Santelli famously asked in 2009, in a rant widely credited with giving birth to the Tea Party movement.
It's a sentiment that resonates not just in America but in much of the world. The tone differs from place to place -- listening to a German official denounce deficits, my wife whispered, ''We'll all be handed whips as we leave, so we can flagellate ourselves.'' But the message is the same: debt is evil, debtors must pay for their sins, and from now on we all must live within our means. 
And that kind of moralizing is the reason we're mired in a seemingly endless slump.
The years leading up to the 2008 crisis were indeed marked by unsustainable borrowing, going far beyond the subprime loans many people still believe, wrongly, were at the heart of the problem. Real estate speculation ran wild in Florida and Nevada, but also in Spain, Ireland and Latvia. And all of it was paid for with borrowed money.
This borrowing made the world as a whole neither richer nor poorer: one person's debt is another person's asset. But it made the world vulnerable. When lenders suddenly decided that they had lent too much, that debt levels were excessive, debtors were forced to slash spending. This pushed the world into the deepest recession since the 1930s. And recovery, such as it is, has been weak and uncertain -- which is exactly what we should have expected, given the overhang of debt.
The key thing to bear in mind is that for the world as a whole, spending equals income. If one group of people -- those with excessive debts -- is forced to cut spending to pay down its debts, one of two things must happen: either someone else must spend more, or world income will fall.
Yet those parts of the private sector not burdened by high levels of debt see little reason to increase spending. Corporations are flush with cash -- but why expand when so much of the capacity they already have is sitting idle? Consumers who didn't overborrow can get loans at low rates -- but that incentive to spend is more than outweighed by worries about a weak job market. Nobody in the private sector is willing to fill the hole created by the debt overhang.
So what should we be doing? First, governments should be spending while the private sector won't, so that debtors can pay down their debts without perpetuating a global slump. Second, governments should be promoting widespread debt relief: reducing obligations to levels the debtors can handle is the fastest way to eliminate that debt overhang.
But the moralizers will have none of it. They denounce deficit spending, declaring that you can't solve debt problems with more debt. They denounce debt relief, calling it a reward for the undeserving.
And if you point out that their arguments don't add up, they fly into a rage. Try to explain that when debtors spend less, the economy will be depressed unless somebody else spends more, and they call you a socialist. Try to explain why mortgage relief is better for America than foreclosing on homes that must be sold at a huge loss, and they start ranting like Mr. Santelli. No question about it: the moralizers are filled with a passionate intensity.
And those who should know better lack all conviction.
John Boehner, the House minority leader, was widely mocked last year when he declared that ''It's time for government to tighten their belts'' -- in the face of depressed private spending, the government should spend more, not less. But since then President Obama has repeatedly used the same metaphor, promising to match private belt-tightening with public belt-tightening. Does he lack the courage to challenge popular misconceptions, or is this just intellectual laziness? Either way, if the president won't defend the logic of his own policies, who will?
Meanwhile, the administration's mortgage modification program -- the program that inspired the Santelli rant -- has, in the end, accomplished almost nothing. At least part of the reason is that officials were so worried that they might be accused of helping the undeserving that they ended up helping almost nobody.
So the moralizers are winning. More and more voters, both here and in Europe, are convinced that what we need is not more stimulus but more punishment. Governments must tighten their belts; debtors must pay what they owe.
The irony is that in their determination to punish the undeserving, voters are punishing themselves: by rejecting fiscal stimulus and debt relief, they're perpetuating high unemployment. They are, in effect, cutting off their own jobs to spite their neighbors.
But they don't know that. And because they don't, the slump will go on.

HEADLINE: With Time Short, Parties Advance Last Arguments

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Reporting was contributed by David M. Herszenhorn in Chillicothe, Ohio; Dan Frosch in Espanola, N.M.; and Ashley Parker in Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Republicans made their closing argument on Sunday for capturing control of Congress, assailing President Obama as a champion of wasteful and excessive government, as Democrats countered that returning power to Republicans would embolden corporations and the wealthy with disastrous results for middle-class Americans.
Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. converged on Ohio in hopes of rekindling the passion Democrats displayed two years ago in sending the pair to the White House.
''In two days, you have a chance to once again say, 'Yes, we can,' '' Mr. Obama said at a rally in Cleveland, reprising the theme of his 2008 campaign. ''There is no doubt that this is a difficult election.''
But Representative John A. Boehner, who is poised to become speaker if Republicans win the House, offered a rebuttal as he crisscrossed the state, warning voters not to be taken in by familiar promises of changing Washington. 
''Washington hasn't been listening to the American people; I think it's been disrespecting the American people,'' Mr. Boehner said, firing up Republicans in Columbus. He flashed a sign of confidence, saying: ''We're going to have a big night on Tuesday night -- a really big night.''
Republicans are positioned to reach or surpass the number of House seats that they picked up in 1994, according to strategists and independent analysts, when the party gained 54 and ended four decades of Democratic dominance in the House.
The ranks of vulnerable Democrats deepened, with House seats in Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island becoming susceptible to a potential Republican wave that could exceed the 39 seats needed to win control. Democrats clung to hope that they could hold on to the Senate by at least a seat or two.
As the White House prepared for widespread losses on Tuesday, it sought to minimize the political damage to the party and to Mr. Obama's re-election chances in two years by urging its supporters to work even harder to help narrow the gap in tight races.
Former President Bill Clinton began a nine-state sweep to help preserve the Democratic majority, rallying voters along the Eastern Seaboard from Maine to Florida. The focus on Democratic-leaning states, including Congressional races in New York and Connecticut and races for governor in Maine and New Hampshire, underscored the degree to which Democrats are almost entirely on defense against Republicans at a time when the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high and the nation is deeply divided over issues like health care.
The most expensive Congressional contest in the country's history, with spending of nearly $4 billion, drew to a close with a presidential-style deployment of campaign volunteers from Alaska to Florida intended to get out the vote, even though more than half of Americans participating in the election have already cast early ballots.
Few states were spared a last barrage of television advertisements, many of which featured Republicans trying to capitalize on the suggestion of change.
In California, the Republican candidate for the Senate, Carly Fiorina, said, ''We can change Washington, but not unless we change the people we send there.'' In Nevada, the Republican nominee for the Senate, Sharron Angle, said, ''They promised change, now it's our turn.''
In New Jersey, John Runyan, a Republican candidate for the House, declared: ''If you're tired of the way this country is run, then let's change the people who run it.''
Democrats were bracing for substantial losses across the ballot, from state legislative races to governorships to Congress, with incumbents imploring voters to give them more time to create jobs, improve the economy and control state and federal spending. It remained an open question whether the party's extensive get-out-the-vote operation could diminish what party leaders fear could be widespread defeats.
''This is not a year to sit on your hands,'' said Diane Denish, the lieutenant governor of New Mexico, a Democrat who is in an uphill fight to win the governor's race. ''It's more important than ever to get off your behind and get out of the shade and get into the heat, as we say in the oil fields.''
In the House, 29 Democratic-held seats are either leaning Republican or are all but lost to Republican candidates, according to the latest analysis of Congressional races by The New York Times, while 42 seats held by Democrats are seen as tossups. Even if Republicans win only half of the tossup seats, they will have passed the threshold of 39 they need to win control.
Democrats were also fighting to preserve their majority in the Senate. The five Senate contests considered tossups will help determine if the party holds control, according to the analysis by The Times, with Republicans trying to capture Democratic-held seats in Colorado, Illinois, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Washington.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, is in one of the closest races in the country against Ms. Angle. After a year of combative and piercing television ads, Mr. Reid's closing message to voters was not an argument on issues, but rather a plea to voters to reject his opponent.
''Harry Reid, fighting for us,'' an announcer says, with images of Mr. Reid appearing with workers across Nevada. ''Sharron Angle: pathological.''
Republicans were looking for new patches of opportunity, scouring districts that only weeks ago would have been unthinkable. The First Congressional District of Rhode Island, which for 16 years has been represented by Patrick J. Kennedy, was suddenly seen as winnable terrain for Republicans. Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and an aspiring Republican presidential candidate, was scheduled to visit the district on Monday.
Republicans sent party leaders across the country on Sunday on behalf of their candidates. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, campaigned in northern Wisconsin for Sean Duffy, a former reality television star who is running for the seat held by David R. Obey, a Democrat who is retiring after 41 years in Congress. Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota traveled to Iowa to build support for legislative candidates.
The most heavily-traveled state on Sunday, though, was Ohio, where Republicans are trying to win up to six Congressional districts, one Senate contest and the governor's race. After the president and vice president appeared together in Cleveland, Mr. Biden stopped in Toledo for an evening rally for Gov. Ted Strickland, who is in a race that is too close to call with John Kasich, a former Republican congressman.
For weeks, the White House has put more emphasis on Ohio than nearly any other state, but over the weekend, signs of a Republican revival were underscored by Mr. Boehner's rare public appearances in his own state. He zipped from district to district as he worked to expand the Republican advantages in the House and deliver a counterargument to the president.
''They have been coming here for months? Why? You might think it's to help Ted Strickland. What he is really coming for is to help himself,'' Mr. Boehner said on Sunday evening at his final stop, in Chillicothe. ''He knows that in 2012 if he doesn't have Ted Strickland in office, his re-election chances are seriously damaged.
''So if you want to send President Obama a message about spending and about takeovers and bailouts and all the nonsense,'' Mr. Boehner added, ''go out there on Tuesday and vote for John Kasich.''

HEADLINE: More on the Mortgage Mess

 BODY:
Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said recently that federal regulators are ''looking intensively'' at banks' foreclosure practices. An investigation is long overdue, though it shouldn't take a lot of digging.
Consumer advocates, the press, investors and homeowners have already compiled a compelling list of transgressions: conflicts of interest that have banks pushing foreclosures, without a good-faith effort to modify troubled loans. Dubious fees that inflate mortgage balances. The hundreds of thousands of flawed foreclosure affidavits that violated homeowners' legal protections. The misplaced documents. And it goes on.
For years these problems have been the focus of research reports, Congressional testimony and court cases. Regulators, however, looked the other way, which is how we got into the mortgage mess. 
What makes the latest scandals so outrageous is that even after the financial meltdown and taxpayer bailout-- and all those vows about accountability -- the regulators are still behind the curve. The fundamental problem is that the banks' drive to profit from the foreclosure process is all too often at odds with the interests of mortgage investors, homeowners and the economy's health.
That is a big reason that the Obama administration's antiforeclosure effort, with its voluntary participation by banks, has fallen so short.
Here is the background. The big banks -- Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, Wells Fargo -- service most of the nation's home mortgages for investors who own the loans. They are paid a fee by the investors and also make money from fees on delinquent loans.
Servicers are obligated to manage the loans in the best interest of the investors. That means modifying a troubled loan, if reduced payments would bring in more money over time than a foreclosure. Or foreclosing if a borrower cannot make the payments on a modified loan.
If only it worked that way in practice.
Take, for example, underwater borrowers -- the millions of Americans who owe more on their loans than their homes are worth. For them, the best modification is often to reduce the loan's principal balance, lowering the monthly payment and restoring some equity. That could be best for investors too, because even reduced payments are often better than a foreclosure sale. A bank's servicing fee is based on the principal balances of the loan -- a strong incentive not to reduce a troubled borrower's balance.
Another conflict occurs when the bank that services a primary mortgage is also the owner of a second lien on the same property. Resolving a troubled first mortgage generally requires a write-down of the second lien, a step that banks have been loath to take.
Banks also profit from late fees and other default-related charges assessed on borrowers. And there is an additional incentive to pile on charges, since the bigger the loan balance, the higher the fee to manage the loan. A group of prominent investors -- including Freddie Mac, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Pimco, the world's largest bond fund -- recently accused Bank of America of fee-padding. The bank denies wrongdoing.
High default charges harm homeowners because they make it increasingly difficult to catch up on late payments and avoid foreclosure. They also disadvantage investors, because the servicer collects the charges from the foreclosure sale before the investors see any money. Everyone loses, except the bank.
Mr. Bernanke said that the regulators' findings would be released in November. What is also needed is real enforcement -- and new rules and possibly new laws -- to make banks change their ways.

HEADLINE: How We Got Here

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
From the early 1990s through the 2008 election, Americans grew steadily more liberal. Voters became more supportive of government spending and more sympathetic toward the poor. They were increasingly secular and increasingly likely to favor gay marriage. They were more worried about climate change and more inclined to support universal health care. And not surprisingly, they were more and more likely to identify as Democrats.
This trend wasn't just a blip created by the Bush administration's unpopularity, as some conservatives hopefully suggested. It was a significant, long-running shift, pushed along by deeper demographic forces. Reliable conservative constituencies (white Christians, married couples) were shrinking. Liberal-leaning ones (Hispanics, single parents, the unchurched) were expanding. And the next generation seemed to be in the bag for liberalism. Younger voters weren't just more liberal than their parents (as young people usually are); they were more liberal than the previous generation had been at the same age, suggesting a more enduring shift. 
But since Barack Obama took the oath of office, the country's leftward momentum has reversed itself. In some cases, nearly 20 years of liberal gains have been erased in 20 months. Americans are more likely to self-identify as conservative than at any point since Bill Clinton's first term. They've become more skeptical of government and more anxious about deficits and taxes. They're more inclined to identify as pro-life and anti-gun control, more doubtful about global warming, more hostile to regulation. And, not surprisingly, they're more likely to consider voting Republican on Tuesday.
So what happened to the brave new liberal era? Well, a few things. The Wall Street bailout made big government seem like a corrupt racket. The unemployment rate made activist government appear helpless in a crisis. The yawning deficits made a free-spending government look like a luxury the country might not be able to afford.
These were all difficulties that Obama inherited, in one sense or another. But the Democrats swiftly created further problems for themselves. The central premise of the White House's policy-making, the assumption that an economic crisis is a terrible thing to waste (as Rahm Emanuel famously put it), turned out to be a grave tactical mistake. It drew exactly the wrong lesson from earlier liberal eras, when the most enduring expansions of government -- Social Security in the 1930s, Medicare in the 1960s -- were achieved amid strong economic growth, rather than at the bottom of a recession.
The Obama Democrats, by contrast, tried to push through health care reform and climate legislation with the unemployment rate stuck at a 28-year high. On health care, they won a costly victory. On cap-and-trade, they forced vulnerable congressmen to cast a controversial vote, and came away with nothing to show for it. In both cases, they reaped a backlash, while defining themselves as ideological and intensely out-of-touch.
At the same time, their legislative maneuverings -- the buy-offs and back-room deals, the inevitable coziness with lobbyists -- exposed the weakness of modern liberal governance: it tends to be stymied and corrupted by the very welfare state that it's seeking to expand. Many of Barack Obama's supporters expected him to be another Franklin Roosevelt, energetically experimenting with one program after another. But Roosevelt didn't have to cope with the web of interest groups that's gradually woven itself around the government his New Deal helped build. And while Obama twisted in these webs, the public gradually decided that it liked bigger government more in theory than in practice.
Nor have Obama's political instincts helped him through these difficulties. Presidents always take more blame than they deserve for political misfortune, but Obama's style has invited disillusionment. His messianic campaign raised impossible hopes (particularly among Comedy Central viewers, apparently), and he has made a habit of baldly overpromising, whether the subject is the unemployment rate or the health care bill. Obama seems as if he would have been a wonderful chief executive in an era of prosperity and consensus, when he could have given soaring speeches every week and made us all feel tingly about America. But he's miscast as a partisan scrapper, and unpersuasive when he tries to feel the country's economic pain.
Thus his sagging poll numbers; thus the debacle that probably awaits his party on Tuesday. It will not be as grave a defeat as many conservatives would like to think: the health care bill may yet be remembered by liberals as a victory worth the price, the demographic trends are still with the Democrats, and the Republicans will return to power unprepared to wield it. But nonetheless, an opportunity has opened for the Right that would have been unimaginable just two years ago -- a chance to pre-empt a seemingly inevitable liberal epoch with an unexpected conservative revival.
Now they just have to seize it.

HEADLINE: Rally To Shift The Blame

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR. 
E-mail: carr@nytimes.com; twitter.com/carr2n

 BODY:
In his new role as a political leader, which is what you call somebody if he hosts a rally on the Washington Mall for over 200,000 people, Jon Stewart was a little hemmed at the Rally to Restore Sanity on Saturday. Because sanity should know no party, partisan rhetoric was not on the teleprompter.
So instead the host of ''The Daily Show'' took steady aim on the one American institution that everyone can agree to hate: The Media. Within the first minute of his deft, very articulate stump speech at the end of the rally, Mr. Stewart turned his gun sights on the, um, fake news, which he called, ''the country's 24-hour political pundit perpetual panic conflictinator,'' which, he added, ''did not cause our problems, but its existence makes solving them that much harder.'' 
''The press can hold its magnifying glass up to our problems bringing them into focus, illuminating issues heretofore unseen or they can use that magnifying glass to light ants on fire and then perhaps host a week of shows on the sudden, unexpected dangerous, flaming ant epidemic,'' he said, to roars of approval from the crowd.
It was a beautiful day on the Mall, and who doesn't like kicking the press around, but speaking of ants, media bias and hyperbole seem like pretty small targets when unemployment is near 10 percent, vast amounts of unregulated cash are being spent in the election's closing days, and no American governing institution -- not the Senate, not the House of Representatives, not even the Supreme Court -- seems to be above petty partisan bickering. Mr. Stewart couldn't really go there and instead suggested it was those guys over there in the press tent who had the blood of democracy on their hands.
Distrust of the media was laid down throughout the rally by video montages of ranting broadcast bobble heads. Even with the vast gulf between their faux respective beliefs, Mr. Stewart and his co-host, Stephen Colbert, found common ground in the failings of the press. Mr. Colbert awarded some media outlets a medal for helping keep fear alive; Mr. Stewart gave out his awards to average Americans who go about their business every day in lives built on compromise and comity.
''We work together to get things done every damn day! The only place we don't is here,'' he said, gesturing toward the Capitol, ''or on cable TV.''
It's a compelling, sharply delivered critique that went down well on the Mall and on television, all amid a forest of hilarious signs and some pretty funny stuff that preceded it.
Gabriel Snyder, formerly of Newsweek and Gawker, said on Twitter, ''the Rally to Restore Sanity turns out to be history's largest act of press criticism.'' My colleague Brian Stelter was in the press tent in Washington and described a hilarious scene in which some of the attendees, blocked by the crush from seeing the event, watched the monitors from the doorway of the press tent, laughing and applauding over the shoulders of the suddenly quiet people sitting there.
But here's the problem: Most Americans don't watch or pay attention to cable television. In even a good news night, about five million people take a seat on the cable wars, which is less than 2 percent of all Americans. People are scared of what they see in their pay envelopes and neighborhoods, not because of what Keith Olbermann said last night or how Bill O'Reilly came back at him.
''If we amplify everything, we hear nothing,'' Mr. Stewart said, and then went on to say, ''not being able to distinguish between real racists and Tea Partiers or real bigots and Juan Williams and Rick Sanchez is an insult, not only to those people but to the racists themselves who have put in the exhausting effort it takes to hate,'' he said.
All due respect to Mr. Williams and Mr. Sanchez, not many people know or care who they are.
True, any poll of American attitudes toward the press would suggest a lot of people share Mr. Stewart's distrust of media, and if they had a Rally to Restore Respect for the Media, it would draw two people. And one of them would be a hot dog vendor.
True also that the pushback by the news media here and elsewhere is predictable. On the day of the rally, James Poniewozik of Time magazine said, ''don't be surprised to see some defensive media responses to the critiques over the next few days.''
It's not as if this is a new theme for Mr. Stewart, who first stepped out of comic character to build a withering assault on the ''Crossfire'' shouters back in 2004. On Saturday, he returned to media-induced pathology: ''The media is like our immune system. If it overreacts to everything, we actually get sicker -- or perhaps eczema.''
But personally, I enjoy Mr. Stewart in his regular seat where he is less reasonable, less interested in obvious targets and less willing to suggest that all political ideas and movements are like kindergartners, worthy of understanding and respect if only the media would get out of the way. His barrage against the news media Saturday stemmed from the fact that, on this day, attacking the message would have been bad manners, so he stuck with the messengers.

HEADLINE: Spotlight in a Senate Race Won't Leave the Ring

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HARTFORD
''Good afternoon, W.W.E. Universe!'' roared the ring announcer.
And for more three hours, from the opening 24-wrestler Battle Royale, to the Diva Dance-Off, the thrilling appearance of the World Wrestling Entertainment's reigning superstar, John Cena, and the final all-hands-on-deck brawl, it wasn't hard to identify the universe at the XL Center in Hartford on Saturday.
Yes, it might have been a Rand Paul rally, but this pre-election extravaganza was yet another sideshow to the Senate race in Connecticut between Linda E. McMahon, the Republican former chief executive of the W.W.E., and Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic attorney general. 
You could take many questions away from W.W.E.'s Fan Appreciation Day, which sold out the 15,000 reduced-price seats. Who is the most evil member of the Nexus, a six-man international cabal with black-on-yellow logos that make the creeps seem like a really odious multinational corporation? Can you come up with a better wrestling duo than the good-natured Big Show, billed at seven feet tall and 441 pounds, and his feisty Irish buddy, Hornswoggle, at 4-foot-4 and 129 pounds?
But the main question is this: Did the McMahon campaign really want the last two weeks of the campaign to seem like all-wrestling-all-the-time?
The event on Saturday, which was scheduled a month ago, instead of the year or so common for planning most W.W.E. events, was only the most recent of a blur of wrestling-related issues, initiated by one side or the other. In no particular order, they included a news conference by Mike Benoit, father of Chris Benoit, a former wrestling star with a history of steroid abuse who in 2007 killed his wife and son and then himself. The elder Benoit focused on accusations of steroid abuse and brain injuries in wrestling. The McMahon campaign said the event was ''gutter politics'' that turned off voters.
Ms. McMahon's husband, Vince McMahon, tried to rally wrestling fans with a pre-election Stand-Up for W.W.E. campaign. The Blumenthal camp complained that it was illegal coordination between the campaign and the business. The McMahon campaign made a similar accusation of illegal coordination between the Blumenthal campaign and Planned Parenthood in connection with the use of W.W.E. pictures deemed degrading to women.
Last week, Mr. McMahon went to court objecting to a directive from the secretary of state in Connecticut, Susan Bysiewicz, telling local election officials that the prohibition against political paraphernalia at polling places could be extended to W.W.E. gear. A court ruled in his favor, and Mr. McMahon then announced the company would be giving away W.W.E. gear outside selected polling places.
Ms. McMahon had been expected to attend the event on Saturday but did not. Mr. McMahon did speak briefly. ''Some people may think I was going to talk about politics today,'' he said. ''Nothing could be further from the truth. I do encourage you to vote this Tuesday, and while you're voting, feel free to wear a W.W.E. T-shirt.''
Ms. McMahon's campaign buttons were given out at the exits. But aside from a stray ''Linda'' T-shirt and one sign brandished by supporters, there was almost nothing overtly political. And the people in the crowd, it turned out, were not all potential McMahon voters. Many were from out of state. Some who were inclined to support her said they seldom voted.
And there were plenty of Blumenthal voters: Elijah Hill of Waterbury, who always votes Democratic; Kim Shelton of Seymour, who didn't like Ms. McMahon's position on the minimum wage; Joann Foley of Waterbury, who, like many others, said she differentiated politics and amusement. ''This is entertainment,'' she said. ''It has nothing to do with my vote.''
Ms. McMahon's campaign agreed with that sentiment. ''Voters at this point are exclusively focused on the state of the economy and job creation,'' said Ed Patru, a spokesman for Ms. McMahon.
But chances are that if Ms. McMahon wants to be viewed as a serious candidate, a two-week barrage of W.W.E. stories on steroids, smackdowns and swag won't help much.
Mr. McMahon has always followed his own compass, and an in-your-face wrestling event is just his style, particularly in the face of criticism, said Dave Meltzer, who edits the newsletter Wrestling Observer News. ''If she doesn't win, they've spent a lot of money and got a lot of bad publicity in exchange,'' he said. ''It's not what they expected.''
Still, particularly this year, the marriage of wrestling and politics had the feel of inevitability. On Saturday, the women danced, and the men fought. Everyone agreed to blur the lines between illusion and reality. The music was loud, the bodies were buff and the good guys mostly won. Absent the last part, it sounds like more than wrestling.
If the event did more for the W.W.E. than for the campaign, that probably makes sense, too. Campaigns come and go. Wrestling is forever.

HEADLINE: Johnny Meatballs Plans An Over-the-Top Wedding

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
It has been suggested that the French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss could not have spent more than a few weeks each with the different native peoples observed in his 1955 book, ''Tristes Tropiques.'' If true, this would mean that cable television has already devoted more time documenting meathead Italian-Americans of the New York metropolitan area than a celebrated researcher spent studying tribes of Brazil and beyond for one of the classic texts of 20th-century social science.
Reality TV now does what ethnography used to, bringing the folkways of foreign subcultures to a broad, popular audience. Increasingly these folkways belong to people with names like Joey, who say things like ''a base tan is crucial'' and who live in South Jersey or those parts of Long Island where Steven Spielberg is unlikely to have a summer place. The latest submission to this stereotyping-within-a-niche category is ''My Big Friggin' Wedding.'' It is at once a spiritual sequel to the ongoing singles' night that is ''Jersey Shore,'' whose producers devised the show, and a metaphoric back story to ''The Real Housewives of New Jersey'' -- bookends in an unstoppable 21st-century genre. 
At the center of the series, beginning on Monday on VH1, are five couples who are about to get married and who are planning receptions in which the white-hydrangea visions of the upper middle class have been replaced by Bentley-limo wishes and ice-cream-station dreams. For the most part the budgets do not support the fantasies, which are invariably spun by the women and bitterly contested by the men, as has been the way since the dawn of matrimony. Johnny, for instance, can't understand why his fiancee, Megin, wants invitations that would seem to require the postage of extensive tax returns. ''So,'' Megin says in peevish riposte, ''you're looking toward more of a flier.''
The ''Jersey Shore'' provenance is immediately evident not only in the landscape and in such bits of conversational genius but also in the portrayals of excessive consumption both material and liquid; in the hair volume and self-aggrandizement; and in the use, both implied and literal, of the term ''goombah.'' As Alyssa, a 22-year-old who is marrying the father of her little girl, puts it: People always want to judge, ''but the fact is, I'm rocking a Juicy Couture stroller, I've got a Louis Vuitton bag, I drive a Benz.'' (She also mentions her big house.)
While it might sound like the musing of someone both drugged and comatose, this show is more ambitious than its predecessor. The theme of event planning is merely the pretext for a show that is really about the ways in which people so demographically well matched that they might as well have been brought together by a census taker can still find themselves at opposite ends of rough water.
Money is a contentious issue, but so are drinking and work ethic. Megin, who is pregnant, doesn't understand why she is clocking long hours doing something in sales while Johnny is sitting around the house dreaming up a food venture that would go by the name Johnny Meatballs. When she asks him why he isn't doing something productive, possibly in an office between the hours of 9 and 5, Johnny says, ''Dean Martin never had a normal job.''
He also probably never could have mustered up Johnny's enthusiasm for this particular kind of theater, which results in a performance of goombahness so seemingly studied that it would not be a surprise if we all eventually learned that Johnny is really a graduate student at the Yale School of Drama who comes from Colorado. He appears to have internalized Joe Pesci in ''Goodfellas'' the way previous generations looked toward Richard Burton's ''Hamlet.''
The difference between ''The Real Housewives'' franchise and this latest escapade from VH1 is the difference between programming that asks us to make fun of people with lots money but no taste or position and programming that asks us to make fun of people who have neither. ''My Big Friggin' Wedding'' and ''Jersey Shore,'' for that matter, offer a world of aluminum siding and above-ground pools, of people who seem like relics of the doomed credit-based economy. You think that's funny?
MY BIG FRIGGIN' WEDDING
VH1, Monday nights at 9, Eastern and Pacific times; 8, Central time.
Produced by 495 Productions. SallyAnn Salsano, executive producer for 495 Productions; Shelly Tatro, Rick Hankey, Kari McFarland and Jeff Olde, executive producers for VH1. Sean Gottlieb, supervising producer.

HEADLINE: In Albany, Democrats Face Losing The Senate

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Two years after seizing control of the State Senate for the first time in more than four decades, New York Democrats are in grave danger of losing their narrow majority on Tuesday.
Despite a huge financial advantage and a popular candidate for governor at the top of the ticket, a half-dozen Democratic incumbents are trying to stave off defeat and help the party hang on to its 32-to-30 advantage.
The Democratic victory in 2008 opened the door for a tide of left-leaning policies; Senate Democrats voted to enshrine rights for domestic workers, legalize no-fault divorce and ease Rockefeller-era drug laws.
But they have found themselves on the defensive in recent weeks, facing Republican accusations of overspending and abandoning upstate New York, and a series of scandals involving the Senate Democratic leadership. 
Republican advertisements hammer the message that one-party rule -- Democrats also control the governor's office and the State Assembly -- has led to a tide of corruption and incompetence that has made the state a laughingstock.
''The economy, taxes and spending, that's what's resonating with people,'' said Senator Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, leader of the Republican caucus. ''But they're also not happy when you have every top leader within one conference under state or federal investigation now. It's breathtaking.''
A poll released by Siena College on Saturday suggested that Republicans may have the edge heading into the election, with Democrats in danger in four of the most competitive races, including two seats held by Democrats. On Long Island, Senator Brian X. Foley, whose victory over a 36-year incumbent, Caesar Trunzo, in 2008 helped propel Democrats to power, has fallen behind his challenger, Lee M. Zeldin.
In northern New York, Senator Darrel J. Aubertine, another Democrat elected in 2008, is also trailing his Republican challenger, Patricia A. Ritchie, though the gap was within the poll's margin of sampling error.
''Foley crushed Trunzo in 2008,'' said Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for the Siena Research Institute. ''Voters were ready for a change. Now voters are saying maybe they made a mistake here, time to get this guy out.''
Because the new Legislature will redraw the lines of New York's Congressional districts for the next decade, the national Republican Party has made retaking the Senate a priority, mobilizing donors in all 50 states to spend about $1.3 million to win a legislative chamber in New York.
''We look at this as a significant investment,'' said Thomas N. Reynolds, the former Buffalo congressman who is the vice chairman of the Republican State Leadership Committee, a national party organization dedicated to financing state races. ''I am always cautious, and I know a week is a lifetime in politics, but I like our candidates.''
Despite the interest, Senate Democrats have exploited their majority and amassed money from practically every special interest in Albany, and so far have outspent Republicans $31.1 million to $23.5 million, according to an analysis by the New York Public Interest Research Group.
Democrats are spending heavily on ''get out the vote'' efforts, along with advertising and relying on the help of their union allies to help mobilize voters.
Noting that Republicans have raised less money, Austin Shafran, a spokesman for Senate Democrats, said: ''The only thing they have going for themselves is the anti-incumbent political climate and the fact Democrats are the party in power. But they have never had the political operations in New York to draw massive amounts of voters to the polls.''
Republicans were given fresh ammunition on Oct. 21, when the state inspector general, a Democratic appointee, released a report accusing the Senate leadership of manipulating the bidding process for the right to build a casino at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens. The inspector general, Joseph Fisch, said he lost count of the number of times the Senate leader, John L. Sampson of Brooklyn, said ''I don't recall'' in his testimony; Mr. Fisch referred the case to federal and local prosecutors.
In the campaign's closing days, Republicans are trying to tar all Democrats by association with the leadership; a recent advertisement from Mr. Zeldin highlighted the hundreds of thousands of dollars his opponent had received from party leaders to aid his campaign. The 30-second spot also twice used a clip of one of Mr. Foley's colleagues, Senator Eric Adams of Brooklyn, bellowing, ''Show me the money!'' on the Senate floor, a clip that has been used many times, out of context, since Mr. Adams made the comment during a debate about pay increases for lawmakers.
The Aqueduct report is only the latest embarrassment for Democrats: one senator, Hiram Monserrate, was expelled after a domestic violence episode, and the majority leader, Pedro Espada Jr., was engulfed by a host of scandals.
Republicans, to be sure, have had their own troubles. Last year, Joseph L. Bruno, the longtime Senate majority leader, was convicted on two federal corruption charges. During his trial, prosecutors revealed that rank-and-file Senate Republicans were encouraged to hand-deliver ethics forms to state regulators in order to avoid running afoul of federal mail fraud charges.
While the battles to decide the Senate are generally outside Democratic-dominated New York City, in Queens, former City Councilman Anthony Como, a Republican, has seized on the Aqueduct report, which depicts the incumbent Democrat, Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., as out of touch with the bidding process for a casino in his own district.
Another Democrat, Senator Darrel J. Aubertine, has his hands full in the 48th Senate District, a heavily Republican district that stretches over three counties north of Syracuse. His opponent, Patricia A. Ritchie, the St. Lawrence County clerk, has been playing up her opposition to a canceled plan by the Paterson administration to require New Yorkers to buy new license plates.
One of her recent advertisements also shows a photograph of Mr. Aubertine surrounded by photos of Gov. David A. Paterson and the Senate president, Malcolm A. Smith of Queens, who is also implicated in the Aqueduct scandal.
''Albany politicians say they've raised and created jobs?'' a narrator says, over ominous-sounding music. ''The truth: they've raised taxes that kill jobs.''
Two years ago, there was a sense of elation and purposefulness among Democrats when they took over from Republicans, who had run the State Senate since 1965.
They were able to move legislation that had been blocked for years, even allowing the chamber's first vote on same-sex marriage. (It failed to pass.) They promised to reform Senate rules and allow the minority party a modicum of influence for the first time, but it did not take long before the two parties were squabbling over resources and rules much as they had before.
Certainly, there are a number of crosscurrents this year. On the one hand, Republicans nationally are expected to put up a strong showing. On the other, the Republican nominee for governor, Carl P. Paladino, has run what many political analysts see as a disastrous campaign against the Democratic nominee, Andrew M. Cuomo, and Democrats are expected to comfortably keep the governor's mansion and the state's two United States Senate seats.
And, of course, the battle for the Senate does not necessarily have to have a winner. What happens if the chamber is left in a 31-to-31 tie?
''Everybody asks that question,'' Mr. Skelos said. ''I don't think it's going to happen, but if it does, we'll figure out a way to govern.''

HEADLINE: Last-Minute Sprint To Rally the Faithful

BYLINE: By GARY FINEOUT

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Rick Scott and Alex Sink sprinted across the state.
Polls have continued to show that neither candidate has been able to build a lead in the bitter race for governor, which has been dominated by a barrage of television ads about each other's character and ethics, or lack thereof. 
But Mr. Scott, the Republican, and Ms. Sink, the Democrat, toned down some of the negative language this final weekend and instead emphasized their plans for education and argued that they were the best candidate to turn around the state's moribund economy. Florida has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation and close to 12 percent unemployment.
''We create jobs by getting government out of your life, lower regulation, lower taxes, lower fees and an attitude that business people are the lifeblood of this country,'' Mr. Scott said during a rally held by the Republican Party of Florida at a commercial air hangar near downtown Orlando.
The event in Orlando -- which was crowded with nearly 200 ardent Republican supporters -- was just one in a steady stream of campaign stops for Mr. Scott. He went to three rallies on Saturday, including a Tea Party event in northeast Florida. Along the way he continued to castigate the federal stimulus and ''Obamacare,'' as he calls the federal health care overhaul, as reasons to vote for him and other Republicans.
On Sunday, both candidates hopped from church services in the morning to barbecues in the afternoon.
The weekend campaigning saw Ms. Sink performing the coin toss at the Saturday homecoming game at Florida A & M University, the state's public historically black college in Tallahassee -- a sign that her fate will hang on African-American turnout. Decked out in a polo shirt featuring the school colors of orange and green, she spent time before the game greeting tailgating fans.
Earlier, Ms. Sink received a roaring reception when she talked to members of the Florida Education Association, the state's teacher union, at their annual delegate assembly. Ms. Sink, who opposed a controversial teacher tenure bill that was vetoed this past spring by Gov. Charlie Crist, vowed to work with teachers, as opposed to letting ''Tallahassee politicians and bureaucrats'' dictate how schools should work.
''We cannot build a stronger economy without a stronger public education system,'' Ms. Sink said.
After her speech, an excited group of teachers from Orange County posed with her and handed Ms. Sink a shirt that read: ''Without Sink we are sunk.''
Ms. Sink's weekend stops appeared aimed at trying to rally traditional Democratic supporters to help stem a potential Republican tide. She was joined on her stops in central Florida by Representative Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat who came to Florida to help rally Hispanic voters.
Mr. Scott had political stars of his own. He was joined at rallies in Orlando and Tampa by former Gov. Jeb Bush and Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi. Mr. Bush contended that Mr. Scott would be a ''principled centered'' governor who would lift the ''cloud'' that he said had descended on Florida.

HEADLINE: Portraits of Hollywood's Founding Power Players

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
Those of us who hold Turner Classic Movies dear -- who consider it the one indispensable channel among the 200 or 500 or 1,000 snaking into our televisions -- don't necessarily watch it very often. It can be enough to know it's there, commercial-free and aspect-ratio-conscious, showing a silent movie in the wee hours of every Monday morning or classing up Halloween with ''The Leopard Man'' and ''Cat People'' (Jacques Tourneur, 1942, as if you had to ask).
That may represent food for the soul, but it's not much of a business model for TCM. So you really can't complain when the channel does something a little different to drum up publicity, exploiting the finite resource of its movie library -- as in the mostly dreary 31 Days of Oscar programming stunt each February -- or creating its own content, like original documentaries about Chuck Jones or Clint Eastwood. 
Or when it does something a whole lot different, like ''Moguls & Movie Stars: A History of Hollywood,'' a seven-week series (beginning Monday night) that represents the channel's most ambitious venture yet into original programming.
The prominence of the word ''Moguls'' (it's twice as tall as ''Movie Stars'' in the program's logo) is no mistake: this is a business history of Hollywood, and even more than that it's a kind of family album of the men, mostly hard-driving Eastern European immigrants, who created the American film industry and dominated it well into the 20th century. The Bogarts and Hepburns make their appearances, but the important names are Zukor, Laemmle, Loew, Warner, Fox (born Fried) and Goldwyn (born Gelbfisz, later Goldfish).
Strengthening the all-in-the-family vibe is the fact that many of the interview subjects are in fact family members: Adolf Zukor's grandson, Carl Laemmle's niece (Carla!), William Fox's great-granddaughter, Louis B. Mayer's grandson and so on. Some are well-known producers in their own right. It all fits, since TCM is part of the family itself, a division of Time Warner.
As with most programs in the illustrated-lecture format (the lecturer in this case being the narrator, Christopher Plummer), the early material is the best. TCM, bless its soul, spends three of the seven hours just getting from Thomas Edison, Georges Melies and the Lumiere brothers through the silent era, and those first three episodes are a treat. Haven't you always wanted to impress your friends by being able to distinguish among Kinetoscope, Vitascope, Cinematographe and nickelodeon?
After the late 1920s the history becomes more familiar and the anecdotes more well worn. The narrative also fragments, with the original studios splintering and changing hands and the outside world impinging, from the Depression to war to the blacklist to the counterculture. The later episodes begin to resemble laundry lists (Fred Astaire? Check; Shirley Temple? Check) or, as the original moguls and stars begin to die off, extended versions of those Oscar-night memorial montages. The series ends in 1970, with the surviving studios being absorbed by conglomerates and the traditional production system all but dead.
Joining the Hollywood scions and insiders in the ranks of the program's commentators is a seemingly inexhaustible supply of ''film historians,'' shocking in their abundance during a time of high unemployment. Among the more recognizable are David Thomson, Molly Haskell, Mark Harris, the biographer A. Scott Berg and TCM's own indefatigable host, Robert Osborne.
Film critics are not featured (though the final episode discusses Pauline Kael and Andrew Sarris and gives a condescending kiss-off to Bosley Crowther of The New York Times). When the series does dabble in criticism, or at least favoritism, you might wish it hadn't. There's a strange fetish for the films of Lon Chaney (''a majority of them were unforgettable,'' Mr. Plummer intones) and penetrating statements like this, regarding Cecil B. DeMille: ''His use of light and shadow gave a visual elegance to his work.''
The real value of ''Moguls & Movie Stars'' may lie less with the series itself than with the ancillary material -- the extra reading, as it were -- that TCM can provide. On Monday night, after the initial episode, the channel will show two hours of Thomas Edison shorts, two hours of D. W. Griffith's Biograph shorts and two hours of Melies films. Anyone can make a history of Hollywood, but only Turner Classic Movies will show you ''The Kiss,''''The Musketeers of Pig Alley'' and ''A Trip to the Moon'' in one night.

HEADLINE: In Neck-and-Neck Race, Chasing the Swing Voters

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY; Kathie Durbin contributed reporting from Vancouver, Wash.

 BODY:
AUBURN, Wash. -- Give Dino Rossi points for political efficiency. It was only in late May that the Republican announced he would challenge Senator Patty Murray, a popular three-term Democratic incumbent. Barely five months later, he is in one of the closest Senate races in the country.
A former state senator and a two-time candidate for governor, Mr. Rossi even speed-speaks his final pitch. 
''If you like the high unemployment rates, if you like her bailout, if you like her stimulus, if you like her government-controlled health care -- she's been there 18 years, she'll give you 6 more years of the same, guaranteed,'' Mr. Rossi said in an interview after greeting a small group of campaign workers in this Seattle suburb. ''Vote for her.''
''If you want to go in a different direction,'' he added, ''if you really want to give people's freedom back, if you don't like the idea of government-controlled health care, if you really want to get full employment and allow entrepreneurs to be successful again, come with me. I'm going in a very different direction. It's simple.''
Of course, it has not been. The Republican Party's hope that the Washington race could help it win control of the Senate has waned somewhat because of shifts toward Democrats in Senate races elsewhere. But money has continued to pour in from outside groups, nearly $20 million going into the weekend before Election Day, and polls have shown the race to be tight. A win here, political analysts say, might still help the Republicans achieve a 50-50 Senate, where Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would have the deciding vote. Republicans could also argue that they should share the leadership of committees as well as Senate resources.
After months of attack ads -- Mr. Rossi's supporters have cast Ms. Murray as a fiscally irresponsible establishment liberal with strong links to lobbyists; Ms. Murray's supporters have portrayed Mr. Rossi as a callous conservative pawn of wealthy, mysterious donors -- both sides also broadcast newer ''positive'' commercials over the weekend. Not that anyone declared a truce.
''My opponent wants to repeal Wall Street reform,'' Ms. Murray told a boisterous crowd of about 150 at a union hall in Vancouver, Wash., on Sunday. She lumped Mr. Rossi in with Senate Republicans who she said were ''holding hostage your middle-class tax cuts today.''
Referring to the flood of campaign money, the senator said, ''We have to show them that we are more powerful than Karl Rove and all of his millions of dollars in this state.''
Both candidates hopscotched the state, traveling from conservative rural areas east of the Cascades to more Democratic cities west of the mountains. Ms. Murray will end a three-day bus tour with a free concert Monday night in Seattle, her stronghold. Mr. Rossi will hold a rally in Puyallup, a more rural, working-class area south of the city, where experts say he must do well.
For all the intensity, the drama on Election Day may not be as great here as elsewhere. Most voters in the state cast their ballots by mail, and they can mail them as late as the night of the election. If the race is close, it could be several days before the results are known, as Washington -- and possibly the country -- waits on the mail. WILLIAM YARDLEY

HEADLINE: A Difficult Final Weekend on the Trail

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
CLEVELAND -- The upper deck was mostly empty when President Obama closed out the campaign season Sunday afternoon with a rally on the campus of Cleveland State University here. His aides looked grim, fiddling with their BlackBerrys as Democratic National Committee staffers scurried to get a crowd estimate from fire marshals: 8,000 in a hall built for 13,000.
It was a fitting coda to the waning days of a brutal election season for the president and his party. Mr. Obama spent the final, frenetic weekend of Midterms 2010 hopscotching the East Coast and Midwest trying to close the ''enthusiasm gap'' in key states. The task required him, at times, to confront the minor indignities that come with being demoted from rock star to mortal politician. 
He traded high-dollar fund-raisers for free rallies; in his hometown of Chicago on Saturday night, 35,000 turned out to see him in an outdoor park. He doffed his tie and shouted himself hoarse, tweaking his standard stump speech -- the one with the laugh lines about Republicans ''drinking a Slurpee'' and driving the economy ''into a ditch'' -- into a more affirmative, upbeat vision of why voters should elect Democrats, and not just reject Republicans. He suffered hecklers. He persevered.
''We've seen a lot of enthusiasm, but it's going to be tight,'' the president told reporters Sunday morning during an impromptu breakfast stop at a Chicago cafeteria. He ordered pancakes, eggs and turkey sausage ''to go.'' Another stop -- Cleveland -- was on the agenda.
''These are close races,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It's true here, it's true in Ohio, it's true in every state where we're competing. And obviously the other side is enthusiastic. We've got to make sure our side is too.''
But with dissatisfaction running high on the left, Mr. Obama also encountered hostility from his own side. In Bridgeport, Conn., on Saturday, the president was in the thick of his usual riff on Republicans (''They realize, 'Boy, we really made a mess of the economy.' '') when a chant came from the top of the arena: ''Fund global AIDS!'' He had heard it before; AIDS protesters have been dogging him for weeks.
''You've been appearing at every rally we've been doing,'' Mr. Obama said, sounding irked. ''And we're funding global AIDS. And the other side is not. So I don't know why you think this is a useful strategy to take.''
The hecklers, dressed in Yale and Harvard T-shirts, persisted; the crowd looked perplexed. For a moment, the rally seemed to spin out of Mr. Obama's control. He tried pleading: ''Now look, let me just understand -- everybody -- we're all right. Come on, guys.'' He tried cajoling: ''Hey, listen up, listen up, listen up, listen up.'' Finally, the intruders were silenced -- when the police escorted them out.
They were, as it turns out, just the kind of voters Mr. Obama is trying to reach -- university students with a streak of idealism. One of them, David Carel, a 19-year-old Yale student, said afterward that he would have voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 had he been old enough to do so. Now, he is not so sure.
''What he does over these next two years is going to determine my thoughts,'' Mr. Carel said.
The two-day, four-state weekend swing took Mr. Obama to Philadelphia, Bridgeport, Chicago and Cleveland -- cities in states that are critical to Democrats' prospects. In each, Democrats are in neck-and-neck races. Mr. Obama used his closing argument to remind voters that it was time to ''finish what we started,'' a phrase his wife, Michelle Obama, has been using in her own stump speech. Harking back to his own election, he conceded that times have changed.
''Some of the excitement of Inauguration Day -- you know, Beyonce was singing and Bono was up there and everybody was feeling good -- I know that good feeling starts slipping away,'' he said Saturday night in Chicago. The crowd interrupted him, shouting, ''Nooooo!''
The Chicago homecoming was clearly a treat for the president -- ''I'm going to sleep in my own bed tonight!'' he announced. Throughout the weekend, Mr. Obama found comfort in familiar things. A cocoon of his closest advisers -- David Axelrod, his senior adviser; Jim Messina, the deputy White House chief of staff; Patrick Gaspard, the political director; Reggie Love, his longtime body man; and Marvin Nicholson, his trip director -- spent the weekend with him aboard Air Force One.
''You know,'' Mr. Axelrod said, ''he is a very centered person, he understands the ups and downs of these things. I don't think he's consumed by reflections on what this means for him. I think he's very focused on making the case and helping folks get elected.''
To that end, Mr. Obama took on the tenor of a salesman at times, making a pitch wherever he went for Democrats to knock on doors and make phone calls, and for voters to get to the polls -- as early as possible. In Philadelphia, he implored a crop of Democratic canvassers to knock on ''20,000 doors.'' Here in Cleveland, he came prepared with directions to the nearest polling spot.
''There is early voting just a few blocks from here,'' the president announced, ''so you can go right after this rally if you haven't voted. Because if everyone who fought for change in 2008 shows up to vote in 2010, we will win this election. I am confident of that.''
As a politician, Mr. Obama has always done best with his back against the wall. Still, this weekend, a sense of inevitability was in the air. Looking around the half-empty arena in Cleveland, the rally's organizers said the president was competing with forces beyond him -- church, football, Halloween. When Mr. Axelrod was asked Saturday night if the White House believes Democrats can keep control of the House, he did not say yes.
He said, ''I think we've got a great shot.''

HEADLINE: THE CAUCUS; With Victory, Republicans Would Face Uncertainty

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
MIAMI -- If voters engineer the Congressional makeover that strategists in both parties now expect, the implications for governance over the next two years, and for America's political future, remain a mystery. Ascendant Republicans will have to juggle the Tea Party's determination to block President Obama's agenda with centrist voters' desire for the two parties to work together on jump-starting the economy.
''The looming victories for Republican candidates next Tuesday is not a validation of the Republican Party at all,'' former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said in an interview. Instead, he argued, they would reflect ''a repudiation of the massive overreach'' by Mr. Obama and Democrats and ''disgust with the political class'' for its failure to cooperate and deliver results. 
''It could create a middle ground,'' Mr. Bush concluded. ''Or it could create a dismemberment of our political parties.''
In this fractious environment, the Senate race in Florida may represent the best-case situation for Republicans. After insurgent conservative Marco Rubio overtook Gov. Charlie Crist for the Republican nomination and built a general election lead, top Democrats were reduced to trying vainly to persuade their own nominee, Representative Kendrick B. Meek, to abandon the race to help Mr. Crist's independent candidacy stop Mr. Rubio.
The equally chaotic Alaska Senate race could become the worst case. After Joe Miller, a Tea Party favorite backed by former Gov. Sarah Palin, defeated the incumbent, Lisa Murkowski, for the Republican Senate nomination, party leaders swung behind Mr. Miller and threatened to strip Ms. Murkowski of her position as the ranking member of the Senate energy committee after she announced that she was still running.
Now that missteps by Mr. Miller have left him plummeting in the polls, some Republican strategists are openly rooting for Ms. Murkowski's unorthodox write-in campaign as their best hope for preventing an upset by the Democrat Scott McAdams.
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, reflecting the fervor of his party's base, recently declared that ''the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.''
But former Governor Bush said Republicans must make clear that their top priority is increasing employment and economic growth. In particular, he advised Republicans to seek common ground with Mr. Obama and Democrats on trade and energy policy.
Mr. Obama, in turn, faces decisions on his approach. A Republican rout on Tuesday might quiet some of the grousing he has faced from liberals over compromises he struck with Congress on the economic stimulus, health care and financial regulation.
That will not, however, resolve the strategic choices the White House must make as the issues of taxes and deficit reduction move higher on Washington's agenda.
In the lame-duck session of Congress later this month, the parties will wrestle over the extension of former President George W. Bush's tax cuts -- which Republicans favor for all taxpayers, but Mr. Obama favors only for families earning less than $250,000.
Next month, a report by a deficit reduction panel will accelerate the overlapping debate over whether America's long-term fiscal imbalance can be remedied through spending cuts alone (as many Republican leaders argue) or only through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases (as Mr. Obama and many Democrats believe).
What's clear, after Republican defeats in 2006 and 2008 and Democrats' travails this year, is that both parties remain at risk so long as Americans suffer from high unemployment and weak economic growth. As the political world begins looking ahead to the 2012 elections, that means the widest opening for an independent candidacy since Ross Perot's 1992 campaign.
''I think it's possible,'' Jeb Bush said. Meantime, he added, just as Mr. Obama has hit ''the reset button'' on foreign policy endeavors, ''We should maybe try to reset the political climate in Washington.''

PERSON: Theodore C. Sorensen 

HEADLINE: THEODORE SORENSEN, 1928-2010; Kennedy Wordsmith and More

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER; Jeff Zeleny and Joseph Berger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Theodore C. Sorensen, one of the last links to John F. Kennedy's administration, a writer and counselor who did much to shape the president's narrative, image and legacy, died Sunday in Manhattan. He was 82.
His death, at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, was from complications of a stroke he suffered a week ago, his wife, Gillian Sorensen, said.
Mr. Sorensen once said he suspected that the headline on his obituary would read ''Theodore Sorenson, Kennedy Speechwriter,'' misspelling his name and misjudging his work, but he was much more. He was a political strategist and a trusted adviser on everything from election tactics to foreign policy.
''You need a mind like Sorensen's around you that's clicking and clicking all the time,'' Kennedy's archrival, Richard M. Nixon, said in 1962. He said Mr. Sorensen had ''a rare gift'': the knack of finding phrases that penetrated the American psyche. 
He was best known for working with Kennedy on passages of soaring rhetoric, including the 1961 inaugural address proclaiming that ''the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans'' and challenging citizens: ''Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.'' Mr. Sorensen drew on the Bible, the Gettysburg Address and the words of Thomas Jefferson and Winston Churchill as he helped hone and polish that speech.
First hired as a researcher by Kennedy, a newly elected senator from Massachusetts who took office in 1953, Mr. Sorensen collaborated closely -- more closely than most knew -- on ''Profiles in Courage,'' the 1956 book that won Kennedy a Pulitzer Prize and a national audience.
After the president's assassination, Mr. Sorensen practiced law and politics. But in the public mind, his name was forever joined to the man he had served; his first task after leaving the White House was to recount the abridged administration's story in a 783-page best seller simply titled ''Kennedy.''
He held the title of special counsel, but Washington reporters of the era labeled him the president's ''intellectual alter ago'' and ''a lobe of Kennedy's mind.'' Mr. Sorensen called these exaggerations, but they were rooted in some truth.
Kennedy had plenty of yes-men. He needed a no-man from time to time. The president trusted Mr. Sorensen to play that role in crises foreign and domestic, and he played it well, in the judgment of Robert F. Kennedy, his brother's attorney general. ''If it was difficult,'' Robert Kennedy said, ''Ted Sorensen was brought in.''
Mr. Sorensen was proudest of a work written in haste, under crushing pressure. In October 1962, when he was 34 years old, he drafted a letter from Kennedy to the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, which helped end the Cuban missile crisis. After the Kennedy administration's failed coup against Fidel Castro at the Bay of Pigs, the Soviets had sent nuclear weapons to Cuba. They were capable of striking most American cities, including New York and Washington.
''Time was short,'' Mr. Sorensen remembered in an interview with The New York Times that was videotaped to accompany this obituary. ''The hawks were rising. Kennedy could keep control of his own government, but one never knew whether the advocates of bombing and invasion might somehow gain the upper hand.''
Mr. Sorensen said, ''I knew that any mistakes in my letter -- anything that angered or soured Khrushchev -- could result in the end of America, maybe the end of the world.''
The letter pressed for a peaceful solution. The Soviets withdrew the missiles. The world went on.
Theodore Chaikin Sorensen was born in Lincoln, Neb., on May 8, 1928 -- Harry S. Truman's 44th birthday, as he was fond of noting. He described himself as a distinct minority: ''a Danish Russian Jewish Unitarian.'' He was the son of Christian A. Sorensen, a lawyer, and Annis Chaikin, a social worker, pacifist and feminist. His father, a Republican who had named him after Teddy Roosevelt, ran for public office for the first time that year; he served as Nebraska's attorney general from 1929 to 1933.
Lincoln, the state capital, was named for the 16th president. Near the Statehouse stood a statue of Abraham Lincoln and a slab with the full text of the Gettysburg Address. As a child, Mr. Sorensen read it over and over. The Capitol itself held engraved quotations; one he remembered was ''Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.''
Mr. Sorensen earned undergraduate and law degrees at the University of Nebraska and, on July 1, 1951, at the age of 23, he left Lincoln to seek his fortune in Washington. He knew no one. He had no appointments, phone numbers or contacts. Except for a hitchhiking trip to Texas, he had never left the Midwest. He had never had a cup of coffee or written a check.
Eighteen months later, after short stints as a junior government lawyer, he was hired by John F. Kennedy, the new Democratic senator from Massachusetts. Kennedy was ''young, good-looking, glamorous, rich, a war hero, a Harvard graduate,'' Mr. Sorensen recalled. The new hire was none of those, save young. They quickly found that they shared political ideals and values.
''When he first hired me,'' Mr. Sorensen recalled, Kennedy said, '' 'I want you to put together a legislative program for the economic revival of New England.' '' Kennedy's first three speeches on the Senate floor -- late in the evening, when nobody was around -- presented the program Mr. Sorensen proposed.
Kennedy made his mark with ''Profiles in Courage,'' published in January 1956. It was no great secret that Mr. Sorensen's intellect was an integral part of the book. ''I've tried to keep it a secret,'' he said jokingly in his interview with The Times. But Mr. Sorensen drafted most of the chapters, and Kennedy paid him for his work. ''I'm proud to say I played an important role,'' Mr. Sorensen said.
He spent most of the next four years working to make his boss the president of the United States. ''We traveled together to all 50 states,'' Mr. Sorensen wrote in his book ''Counselor: A Life at the Edge of History,'' a memoir published in 2008, ''most of them more than once, initially just the two of us.'' There was no entourage until Kennedy won the Democratic nomination in 1960. It was not clear at the outset that he could do that, much less capture the White House.
''It was only after we had crisscrossed the country and began to build support at the grass roots, largely unrecognized in Washington, where Kennedy was dismissed as being too young, too Catholic, too little known, too inexperienced,'' Mr. Sorensen said in the interview.
In those travels, Mr. Sorensen found his own voice as well as Kennedy's. ''Everything evolved during those three-plus years that we were traveling the country together,'' he said. ''He became a much better speaker. I became much more equipped to write speeches for him. Day after day after day after day, he's up there on the platform speaking, and I'm sitting in the audience listening, and I find out what works and what doesn't, what fits his style.''
The Kennedy White House was never a Camelot: ''Neither Kennedy nor any of us who worked with him were mythical characters who had magical powers,'' Mr. Sorensen said, ''and we obviously had our share of mistakes.'' But Mr. Sorensen was not ashamed to say he worshipped Kennedy. He was devastated by his assassination in November 1963.
''It was a feeling of hopelessness,'' he said, ''of anger, of bitterness. That there was nothing we could do. There was nothing I could do.''
For more than 40 years after he left the White House, Mr. Sorensen practiced law, mostly as a senior partner at the New York firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. He counseled leaders like Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Anwar Sadat of Egypt.
His life went on, in public and private; he was writing and making speeches well past his 80th birthday. But it was never the same.
In 1970, two years after Senator Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated on the presidential campaign trail, Mr. Sorensen ran for the Senate seat that Robert Kennedy had held in New York. The run was a mistake, he conceded. ''I simply thought that if I were to carry on the Kennedy legacy, if I were to perpetuate the ideals of John Kennedy, as Robert Kennedy tried to do, that I would need to be in public office,'' he said. ''Frankly, it was an act of hubris on my part.''
In December 1976, out of the blue, President-elect Jimmy Carter offered Mr. Sorensen the post of director of central intelligence.
''I had to make a very quick decision,'' Mr. Sorensen remembered. ''I did not know whether a lawyer and a moralist was suitable for a position that presides over all kinds of law-breaking and immoral activities. But I wanted to be involved. I wanted to be back in government at a position where I could help things in a sound and progressive way, and so I said, 'Yes, I accept.' ''
Opponents of the nomination pointed out a potential problem. More than 30 years before, after the end of World War II, Mr. Sorensen, not yet 18, had registered with his draft board as a conscientious objector to combat. President-elect Carter's top aide, Hamilton Jordan, placed an angry call to Mr. Sorensen, asking why he had not mentioned this suddenly salient fact before accepting the nomination.
''I said, 'I didn't know that the C.I.A. director was supposed to kill anybody,' '' Mr. Sorensen recalled. ''He wasn't too happy with that answer.''
The nomination was withdrawn. That ended Mr. Sorensen's ambition to return to work in Washington.
A stroke in 2001 took away much of his eyesight, but afterward Mr. Sorensen continued to lead ''a very full life, speaking, writing, creating new enterprises and mentoring many young people,'' his wife said.
Mr. Sorensen remained active in Democratic politics and took a particular liking to a freshman senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, when he arrived in Washington in 2005. When Mr. Obama began running for president two years later, Mr. Sorensen endorsed his candidacy and campaigned across the country, particularly to audiences who were opposed to the Iraq war.
''It reminds me of the way the young, previously unknown J. F. K. took off,'' Mr. Sorensen said in an interview with The Times in 2007.
A year after Mr. Obama took office, Mr. Sorensen acknowledged frustration with his presidency, particularly the decision to send more troops to Afghanistan, a conflict that he called ''Obama's Vietnam.'' But, Mr. Sorensen said, ''The foreign policy problems are more difficult than they were in Kennedy's day.''
''I still think it was amazing that a man with his skin color -- and also he was a liberal Democrat, let's face it -- was elected,'' Mr. Sorensen said in a 2009 interview in his Manhattan apartment, where a photograph of Mr. Obama joined a tableau of images from the Kennedy administration. ''I haven't the slightest doubt that there are a lot of white men who still find it difficult to accept the fact, the reality, that we have a black president in this country.''
President Obama said Sunday in a statement, ''I know his legacy will live on in the words he wrote, the causes he advanced, and the hearts of anyone who is inspired by the promise of a new frontier.''
Mr. Sorensen's 1949 marriage to Camilla Palmer and his 1964 marriage to Sara Elbery ended in divorce. In 1969 he married Gillian Martin. Besides his wife, he is survived by their daughter, Juliet Sorensen Jones; three sons from his first marriage, Eric, Stephen and Phil; a sister, Ruth Singer; a brother, Phillip; and seven grandchildren.
Despite his stroke in 2001 and his diminishing eyesight, Mr. Sorensen worked on and completed ''Counselor,'' his memoir, over the next six years. ''I still believe that the mildest and most obscure of Americans can be rescued from oblivion by good luck, sudden changes in fortune, sudden encounters with heroes,'' he concluded. ''I believe it because I lived it.''

HEADLINE: Both Parties Play the Wall Street Card, Sometimes From the Bottom of the Deck

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Anger at the financial services industry has been so high this election cycle that a viewer of campaign advertisements might be forgiven for thinking that Wall Street itself was on the ballot.
As campaigning draws to a close, a review of scores of recent ads suggests that the anti-Wall Street messages have frequently used a loose interpretation of the facts.
Outrage over the Wall Street bailout has been a prevailing theme, even though it was passed at the urging of President George W. Bush, has been credited by most economists with averting a financial collapse, and is expected to ultimately cost taxpayers a tiny fraction of the original $700 billion authorized by Congress. 
Contributions from the financial services industry have also been a target of criticism, even though both parties rely heavily on Wall Street for donations. And few candidates in either party are mentioning the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul signed into law by President Obama in July -- with almost no Republican support -- perhaps because of its complexity.
It is understandable that Democrats are taking heat for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, as the bailout is formally known, said Judith Stein, a historian at the City University of New York Graduate Center.
''That Bush initiated TARP is for many Republicans irrelevant because they are now anti-Bush,'' she said. ''That the big banks are doing relatively well, while the regional banks and, more important, the average citizens are not, offers an opportunity for every Republican insurgent. And the Obama defense of TARP and the Wall Street-oriented people in his administration make its origins irrelevant.''
The back-and-forth attacks have often given way to exaggeration, as in the Senate race in Pennsylvania, where Pat Toomey, a Republican, and Joe Sestak, a Democrat, are vying to replace Senator Arlen Specter, a Republican-turned-Democrat.
''As a Wall Street trader, Toomey pioneered derivatives, and derivatives nearly wrecked our economy,'' a Democratic attack ad says.
While Mr. Toomey did work on Wall Street after college, his focus was foreign-exchange swaps, not the credit default swaps that were at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis.
(Another Democratic ad notes that Mr. Toomey, while serving in the House, called derivatives ''an enormous good'' during a 2000 hearing. But both parties overwhelmingly agreed that year to exempt over-the-counter derivatives from strict regulation, in what is now commonly regarded as a mistake.)
Mr. Toomey, who has held a small lead in most polls, says in an attack ad of his own: ''Congressman Joe Sestak voted for the Wall Street bailout. Then he voted to keep the bailouts going, even opposing bipartisan efforts to stop them.''
That claim could also be viewed as misleading. Mr. Sestak, like most House Democrats, opposed a largely symbolic resolution in January 2009 to block the release of $350 billion, the second half of the bailout money. (The resolution was essentially meaningless because the Senate had already voted not to hold up the release of the money.)
The anger over TARP is so fierce that at least seven first-term House Democrats -- Kathy Dahlkemper of Pennsylvania, Mary Jo Kilroy of Ohio, Frank Kratovil Jr. of Maryland, Betsy Markey of Colorado, Glenn Nye of Virginia, Mark Schauer of Michigan and Dina Titus of Nevada -- have claimed in ads that they voted against bailing out Wall Street, even though they did not take office until January 2009. That was nearly three months after President Bush signed the bailout legislation into law.
Asked about those claims, which were reported by FactCheck.org, a Web site managed by the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, aides to the lawmakers pointed to their support for the symbolic resolution.
There have also been misleading ads portraying Democrats who voted for the Obama administration's $787 billion stimulus package -- like Ms. Kilroy, Ann Kirkpatrick of Arizona, Paul E. Kanjorski of Pennsylvania and Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota -- as having voted for Wall Street bonuses.
The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, as the 2009 stimulus package is known, did not hand out any bonuses, though an earlier version contained more stringent restrictions on executive compensation that were subsequently weakened after the Treasury Department raised legal and practical concerns.
Few of the anti-Wall Street ads offer any context about the financial crisis, and Republican candidates generally avoid mentioning that their party controlled both houses of Congress and the presidency for most of the period when the housing bubble peaked and then burst.
One exception to the Republican silence on Mr. Bush is Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who is a favorite of the Tea Party movement. ''I voted against the Bush Wall Street bailout, the failed Pelosi trillion-dollar stimulus and Obama's government takeover of health care,'' she says in an ad that criticizes the last two presidents, as well as the current House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.
''Anger at Wall Street is the highest since the early and mid-1930s,'' said Charles R. Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan College and an authority on the history of Wall Street. ''That anger remained until the 1950s, when the postwar prosperity set in.''
Mr. Geisst said the rage against financial interests could linger for several more election cycles, because economies tend to recover much more slowly after financial crises than after other downturns.
So for now, any link to Wall Street is being cast as a liability.
Representative Jason Altmire, a Pennsylvania Democrat seeking a third term, claims in an ad that his Republican opponent, Keith Rothfus, ''represented a Wall Street bank that took taxpayer-funded bailout money.'' Mr. Rothfus, a lawyer, says his firm negotiated procurement agreements for the institution, the Bank of New York Mellon, and was not involved in the TARP bailout.
Representative Bill Foster, a first-term House Democrat from Illinois, says his Republican opponent, State Senator Randy Hultgren, worked for an investment management company that ''set up a Cayman Islands hedge fund that used taxpayer bailout money and made a profit buying toxic mortgages,'' and ''fueled the housing crisis by selling risky mortgage investments, sometimes with no income verification.''
Republicans have called the attack misleading, saying that Mr. Hultgren was not involved with the fund and that the company did not underwrite or originate risky mortgage products.

HEADLINE: In Ads, Candidates Make Final Pitches to Voters

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Sharron Angle, the Republican candidate for Senate in Nevada, wants the state's voters to know that Harry Reid had his chance, but it's her turn now.
This is the final pitch Ms. Angle makes in a political ad released Thursday and titled ''Our Turn,'' which argues that two years ago, Democrats ''promised change--but they delivered unprecedented spending, overwhelming debt, heartbreaking job loss,'' and a laundry list of other economic woes.
''They promised change,'' the ad concludes. ''Now, it's our turn.'' 
With Election Day on Tuesday, candidates across the nation are turning to political ads to make their closing arguments -- often a last-ditch plea to win over voters by either reintroducing themselves , tearing down their opponent one last time , or something in between. And this year, both Democrats and Republicans are trying to harness the anti-Washington sentiment to push different versions of the same theme: That the nation's capital must change, and with their independent voice and close ties to their home state, the candidate currently approving this ad is just the person for the job.
''At a very base level, once again, and ironically, we are in a 'change' environment,'' said Mark McKinnon, a Republican strategist who made ads for President George W. Bush and Senator John McCain of Arizona. ''Which means challengers and incumbents, Republicans and Democrats, are all arguing that they are fighting the system and that Washington is the problem.''
Republicans especially are running as outsiders and pushing a message of bringing change to Washington. Carly Fiorina, the Republican Senate candidate in California,has a closing ad that talks ominously about ''the legacy of Barbara Boxer,'' the incumbent senator and Ms. Fiorina's Democratic opponenet, before a narrator says, ''We can change Washington, but not unless we change the people we send there.'' And many Republicans are making a similar pitch, from Jon Runyan, who is running for Congress in New Jersey's Third Congressional District (''If you're tired of the way this country is run, then let's change the people who run it,'' Mr. Runyan says) to Kristi Noem, who is running for Congress against incumbent Democrat Stephanie Herseth Sandlin in South Dakota (''Stephanie Herseth Sandlin -- Washington really changed her,'' a narrator warns.)
''Republicans have a tailor-made message, which is that we're not Democrats, basically,'' said Michael Franz, an associate professor of government at Bowdoin College and co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project. ''You always see something like that from challengers who are outsiders trying to enter the system. You have a lot of newcomers on the Republican side who have a chance of winning so they can make that case quite clearly, that Obama and the Democrats have had control for two years and their policies aren't working, so we need change, we need to change that leadership.''
Democrats, too, are doing a final anti-Washington dance, promising to ''shake up Washington'' if elected, in the case of West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin, and talking about their ties to their home states. Earl Pomeroy, an incumbent Democratic congressman from North Dakota, for instance, acknowledges that ''I know you're angry with Washington,'' but says that he travels ''home to North Dakota every weekend'' and adds, ''my values are formed right here in Valley City where I grew up.'' Mr. Manchin opens his ad by saying, ''I'm as mad as you are with what's going on in Washington,'' and distances himself from both parties.
''Every Democrat is running their own race, and hopes to be judged on their connection to their state and district,'' said John Del Cecato, a partner at AKPD, a Democratic media firm.
Running against Washington, however, is trickier for Democrats. ''The fact is, the Democrats own the current situation,'' said Ken Goldstein, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin.
''Democrats are really trying to disqualify Republicans, and in some ways throwing anything against the wall,'' Mr. Goldstein said. (Case in point? The ad by Charlie Melancon, the Democratic congressman from Louisiana who is running for Senate against Senator David Vitter, which opens by stating, ''Our tax dollars pay David Vitter's salary, and he used it for prostitutes. You're welcome, senator.'')
But after such a bitterly divisive and negative campaign season, an increasing number of candidates are sounding a positive note in the final stretch. Cue the spouses, the kids, and the fuzzy biographical spots.
Marco Rubio, the Republican candidate for Senate in Florida, is airing a special two-minute ad that talks about his personal story -- he is the son of a bartender and a maid -- and what he believes the election is about. Alexi Giannoulias, who has called his opponent a liar and whose opponent has called him a mob banker, ends his bid for President Obama's former Illinois Senate seat with a positive ad that features both the president and Michelle Obama, the first lady.
''Campaigns almost always close positive,'' Mr. McKinnon said. ''They want their final image to be contrary to the one painted by their opponents. And anyone who has children can't possibly be guilty of the heinous crimes of which they've been accused.''
And then, of course, there is the meta-ad, which features a candidate dismissing the negative ads his opponent has thrown at him all season, before saying something positive about himself.
''Obviously you want to wait to do something like that until there's been a lot of negative ads out there,'' said Travis Ridout, an associate professor of political science at Washington State University. ''It's a way of saying something kind of negative about your opponent, without seeming to say something negative.''

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Much Ado About Debt

BYLINE: JANIE LORBER


HIGHLIGHT: Today's top political stories from The Times and around the Web, plus what's on tap Thursday in Washington.

 BODY:
From Today's Times:
 President Obama's fiscal commission set off a political firestorm on Wednesday when it outlined an ambitious and provocative package of spending cuts and tax increases aimed at erasing nearly $4 trillion from projected deficits through 2020. The Times's Jackie Calmes has the details Obama administration officials have begun spreading the word that U.S. troops will be in Afghanistan until at least the end of 2014. The Times's Elisabeth Bumiller describes this retooled message as effectively a "victory for the military" in its tug-of-war with the administration's civilian leaders. The aim is to convince Afghans that the United States is not walking away next summer and to warn the Taliban that aggressive operations against them would continue. Secretary of the Treasury Timothy F. Geithner said he believed that the leaders of the world's largest economies, meeting in Seoul at the G-20 Summit, would agree to try to reduce vast trade imbalances that threaten global economic and financial stability. Counting all of the write-in ballots in Alaska's Senate race could take as many as five days. Even then, the final outcome could be determined in a courtroom as a result of a lawsuit filed Tuesday by the Tea Party-backed Republican nominee, Joe Miller 
From Around the Web: The Web has lit up with reaction to the fiscal commission's recommendations. The Atlantic's Andrew Sullivan rounds up the commentary. Among the contentious ideas presented in the bipartisan panel's draft proposal is a public health insurance option, a notion that proved one of the most divisive issues in last year's health care debate, The Wall Street Journal notes. It's never easy for lawmakers to think about supporting policy changes opposed by older Americans, like Medicare benefit cuts and an increased retirement age for Social Security. But members of the new Congress may find it even harder than usual. Retirees are the No. 1 financial supporters of at least 26 new House members when compared to other interest groups including the mining industry, lawyers and advocates for women's issues, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. John Boehner, the man poised to become speaker of the House, has become increasingly popular since Republicans won back the majority last week, according to a new USA Today/Gallup poll released on Wednesday. Even though 40 percent of Americans still say they do not know him well enough to have an opinion, more now rate him positively than negatively, a shift from three prior 2010 readings, including one taken in mid-October 
Washington Daybook:
 President Barack Obama is in Seoul today for the G-20 Summit. He will celebrate Veterans Day there at an event with the leaders of South Korea, China and Germany. Back in Washington, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. hosts a Veterans Day breakfast at the White House. At 11 a.m. Mr. Biden will attend and speak at the wreath-laying at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia, one of a number of commemorative events scheduled this afternoon at memorials in and around Washington.

HEADLINE: The Politics Game: Playing Midterm Election Bingo

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN and SANDHYA NANKANI


HIGHLIGHT: Lesson Plan | Playing a game to develop and reinforce knowledge and understanding of the midterm elections. 

 BODY:
Overview | How can students use news coverage to bolster their knowledge of the electoral process as well as their understanding of specific elections? In this lesson, students learn about the midterm elections by playing a game of Midterm Election Bingo. They then create their own election bingo games about historical elections or the electoral process. 
Materials | Computer with Internet access and projector, copies of the Midterm Election Bingo game board (PDF)

Warm-Up | Show students the interactive feature In Video: Why You Are Voting.
Ask: What do you think of these voters' reasons for voting in the midterm elections? Whom do you know who is planning to vote, or has already voted, in the midterms? Do you know why he or she voted? If you could vote, would you, and why or why not? If possible, students might post their comments on our related Student Opinion question.
You might show students who is on the ballot where they live by visiting the "On Your Ballot" section of the Vote 411 Web site. (Alternatively, if students can work individually on computers, they might explore Project Vote Smart's VoteEasy, which enables them to compare their own positions on key issues with those of candidates in their state.) Ask: What do you know about these candidates? What other races around the country are you aware of?
If the elections are over and the results are in, ask: Do you know who won in major races (for House, Senate and governor, as applicable) in our state? And if race results in your state are still undecided or are being contested, ask students what they know about these races.
Related | In the article "Candidates Advance Final Arguments," Jeff Zeleny looks at the end of the campaign season for the 2010 midterms:
Republicans made their closing argument on Sunday for capturing control of Congress, assailing President Obama as a champion of wasteful and excessive government, as Democrats countered that returning power to Republicans would embolden corporations and the wealthy with disastrous results for middle-class Americans.
Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. converged on Ohio in hopes of rekindling the passion Democrats displayed two years ago in sending the pair to the White House.
"In two days, you have a chance to once again say, 'Yes, we can,' " Mr. Obama said at a rally in Cleveland, reprising the theme of his 2008 campaign. "There is no doubt that this is a difficult election."
But Representative John A. Boehner, who is poised to become speaker if Republicans win the House, offered a rebuttal as he crisscrossed the state, warning voters not to be taken in by familiar promises of changing Washington.
Read the entire article with your class, using the questions below.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

        
Heading into the 2010 midterm elections, what are the main arguments of each major party?
        
What predictions are being made for election results in the House and Senate?
        
How much has been spent in Congressional races?
        
What are some of the tactics being used in political commercials to influence voters?
        
In what state were numerous high-profile political appearances on the Sunday before Election Day, and why?
Activity | Tell students that they will now play New York Times Midterm Election Bingo, using relevant print copies of the newspaper and the Times Web site, to find information that fits the criteria.
On NYTimes.com, resources to use include the Politics section and its subsections, and the political blogs the Caucus and FiveThirtyEight.
You might choose to use either our Midterm Election Bingo sheet (PDF), already filled in with 16 different criteria, or you might use this blank bingo sheet (PDF) and fill it in using other criteria as appropriate for your curriculum. For example, in a math class, you might provide all number-based criteria based on polling and predictions, voter turnout and race outcomes and so on.
To play the game, first establish whether students will work alone or in pairs, then put the bingo grid face-down in front of them. When you say "Go!" students turn it over and find the best examples they can to fill in each box. When they have completed a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, they call out "Bingo!"
Check that their answers are correct and, if you choose, award a "prize" of some sort. Or you may wish to establish that the first person or pair to get a good example in every square wins the game.
When the game is finished, go from box to box, asking different students to read their examples aloud and explain their thinking for each.
Going Further | Individually or in pairs, students research and create their own election bingo boards, using the blank sheet (PDF).
American history students might create bingo games based on past midterm or presidential elections that they are studying in class. In a civics or government course, students might create boards designed to reinforce specific knowledge about the electoral process.
Students might consider including icons, images, drawings or photographs representing different aspects of the voting process alongside traditional textual clues, like these:

        
Political party logos
        
Political caricatures, cartoons or other drawings of candidates
        
Objects associated with elections, like ballot cards, voter registration forms and voting machines
        
Campaign buttons, posters or advertisements
        
Photographs from political movements, like women's suffrage and civil rights
Students might play their games with friends or family members and report back to class with the results, in addition to playing them in class. Afterward, debrief: How easy or hard was your game for the players? Did these games serve to reinforce knowledge and understanding of the election in question?

HEADLINE: Fast Track to Inequality

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The clearest explanation yet of the forces that converged over the past three decades or so to undermine the economic well-being of ordinary Americans is contained in the new book, ''Winner-Take-All Politics: How Washington Made the Rich Richer -- and Turned Its Back on the Middle Class.''
The authors, political scientists Jacob Hacker of Yale and Paul Pierson of the University of California, Berkeley, argue persuasively that the economic struggles of the middle and working classes in the U.S. since the late-1970s were not primarily the result of globalization and technological changes but rather a long series of policy changes in government that overwhelmingly favored the very rich. 
Those changes were the result of increasingly sophisticated, well-financed and well-organized efforts by the corporate and financial sectors to tilt government policies in their favor, and thus in favor of the very wealthy. From tax laws to deregulation to corporate governance to safety net issues, government action was deliberately shaped to allow those who were already very wealthy to amass an ever increasing share of the nation's economic benefits.
''Over the last generation,'' the authors write, ''more and more of the rewards of growth have gone to the rich and supperrich. The rest of America, from the poor through the upper middle class, has fallen further and further behind.''
As if to underscore this theme, it was revealed last week (by David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning former reporter for The New York Times), that the incomes of the very highest earners in the United States, a small group of individuals hauling in more than $50 million annually (sometimes much more), increased fivefold from 2008 to 2009, even as the nation was being rocked by the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.
Last year was a terrific year for those at the very top. Professors Hacker and Pierson note in their book that investors and executives at the nation's 38 largest companies earned a stunning total of $140 billion -- a record. The investment firm Goldman Sachs paid bonuses to its employees that averaged nearly $600,000 per person, its best year since it was founded in 1869.
Something has gone seriously haywire in the distribution of the fruits of the American economy.
This unfortunate shift away from a long period of more widely shared prosperity unfolded steadily, year after year since the late-'70s, whether Democrats or Republicans controlled the levers of power in Washington. ''Winner-Take-All Politics'' explores the vexing question of how this could have happened in a democracy in which -- in theory, at least -- the enormous number of voters who are not rich would serve as a check on policies that curtailed their own economic opportunities while at the same time supercharging the benefits of the runaway rich.
The answer becomes clearer when one recognizes, as the book stresses, that politics is largely about organized combat. It's a form of warfare. ''It's a contest,'' said Professor Pierson, ''between those who are organized, who can really monitor what government is doing in a very complicated world and bring pressure effectively to bear on politicians. Voters in that kind of system are at a disadvantage when there aren't reliable, organized groups representing them that have clout and can effectively communicate to them what is going on.''
The book describes an ''organizational revolution'' that took place over the past three decades in which big business mobilized on an enormous scale to become much more active in Washington, cultivating politicians in both parties and fighting fiercely to achieve shared political goals. This occurred at the same time that organized labor, the most effective force fighting on behalf of the middle class and other working Americans, was caught in a devastating spiral of decline.
Thus, the counterweight of labor to the ever-increasing political clout of big business was effectively lost.
''We're not arguing that globalization and technological change don't matter,'' said Professor Hacker. ''But they aren't by any means a sufficient explanation for this massive change in the distribution of wealth and income in the U.S. Much more important are the ways in which government has shaped the economy over this period through deregulation, through changes in industrial relations policies affecting labor unions, through corporate governance policies that have allowed C.E.O.'s to basically set their own pay, and so on.''
This hyperconcentration of wealth and income, and the overwhelming political clout it has put into the hands of the monied interests, has drastically eroded the capacity of government to respond to the needs of the middle class and others of modest income.
Nothing better illustrates the enormous power that has accrued to this tiny sliver of the population than its continued ability to thrive and prosper despite the Great Recession that was largely the result of their winner-take-all policies, and that has had such a disastrous effect on so many other Americans.

HEADLINE: Disaster Averted

 BODY:
The discovery of two explosive devices packed aboard airplanes was a testament to American intelligence, and to the efforts of Saudi Arabia, which has played an ambiguous role in global antiterrorism operations. But the near disasters remind us that Al Qaeda remains eager to attack the United States and other nations. They highlight the need for constant vigilance, improved security -- and economic and political reforms in Yemen that could counter Al Qaeda's appeal. 
The two air packages -- both sent from Yemen and addressed to synagogues in Chicago -- were intercepted in Britain and Dubai. In both cases, the powerful explosive PETN was concealed in printer cartridges and experts said the force of these sophisticated bombs would have been enough to bring down the planes.
Saudi Arabia deserves credit for averting the disaster. It alerted Washington to the threat so that officials could locate and defuse the packages. Once known as the home base of Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 hijackers in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the country too often has been a reluctant ally in the fight against extremists. It seems to appreciate the problem more acutely now that Al Qaeda's branch in the Arabian Peninsula is growing in strength. The Saudi monarchy needs to do more at home, where extremism is tolerated and even encouraged in mosques and schools.
The Obama team was justifiably criticized last December when a Nigerian man trained in Yemen tried to blow a hole in the side of a Detroit-bound flight. But a staunch Obama critic, Representative Peter King, a Republican of New York, said: ''On this particular matter, I think the administration has handled it perfectly.''
Still, the incident exposed continued security lapses. Since 9/11, countries have been more rigorous about inspecting passenger planes, but cargo planes -- which initially carried the two bombs -- are largely ignored. The United States, Britain, Germany and France have halted cargo shipments from Yemen, but that cannot continue indefinitely. Washington missed a deadline last August to require inspections of cargo on all passenger planes and must put the system in place.
The Obama administration almost certainly will have to escalate its war against Al Qaeda in Yemen, while guarding against strikes that kill civilians. And it must work with the government of President Ali Abdullah Saleh and with Saudi Arabia, Yemen's main Arab ally and benefactor. The United States also must continue to lead international efforts to support Yemen with economic and development aid so that the people of the Arab world's poorest country are not drawn to extremists.
It is impossible to rule out terrorist attacks. It is possible to be more vigilant and to learn from each failed attempt how to better prevent the next one.

HEADLINE: Fed Is Poised to Aid Economy, but Impact Is Cloudy

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is all but certain to move to spur the nation's sputtering recovery this Wednesday, but most economists say it is unlikely to have a big impact on employment and growth.
Overruling objections from a handful of inflation-fearing dissidents, the Fed's policy-setting committee, which begins a two-day meeting on Tuesday, is expected to resume quantitative easing, a strategy of buying Treasury securities to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates. The hope is that new action by the Fed will make a deflationary spiral of falling prices less likely, and make it somewhat easier for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend.
In theory, the Fed could print trillions of dollars to achieve its aim, but it is far more likely to start with a smaller amount -- perhaps a few hundred billion -- and gradually buy more bonds as conditions warrant.
That open-ended, conditional approach would be a departure from the Fed's first, $1.7 trillion round of debt purchases, which lasted about 15 months and ended in March. 
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, seems to be under no illusion about the potency of the new purchases, having declared in August that ''central bankers alone cannot solve the world's economic problems.''
With inflation well below the Fed's unofficial target of 2 percent, unemployment stuck at nearly 10 percent, and gross domestic product growing at a lethargic rate, Mr. Bernanke has evidently concluded that doing nothing is not an option.
Mr. Bernanke has long argued that a central bank, having lowered short-term rates to zero, as the Fed did in December 2008, still has tools to prevent an economy from slipping into deflation; he is now following that advice.
But economists seem to be in broad agreement that no matter the magnitude of the Fed's actions this week, the economy will remain challenged for some time.
''There is a substantial chance that the U.S. economy is headed into a lost decade, similar to what Japan has experienced in the past 15 years, possibly with zero inflation instead of actual deflation,'' said Robert J. Gordon, of Northwestern University, who serves on the committee that determines the start and end dates of recessions.
''But the consequences for the U.S. population will be much more severe than in Japan,'' he added, ''because of our higher unemployment rate, our lack of a social safety net, our system that ties medical insurance to employment instead of making it a right of citizenship, our greater inequality and our higher level of poverty.''
Guillermo A. Calvo, of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University, gave a similar assessment.
''The central problem in the U.S. is the breakdown of the credit channel, especially credit for small firms and for working capital,'' he said. ''Buying long-term Treasury bonds amounts to directing credit toward a sector that has no need for it.''
The Fed's actions, Mr. Calvo said, will mostly be felt abroad. Quantitative easing is likely to push down the value of the dollar and send even more money flowing into the faster-growing economies of Asia and Latin America, where interest rates are higher and inflation is a greater worry than in the sluggish economies of North America and Western Europe.
Mr. Calvo said the result could be heightened tensions over currency and trade and pressure on emerging-market countries to curb the flow of capital into their economies.
The Fed has clearly taken steps to address both sources of anxiety, domestic and foreign, and to fully prepare the markets for its next move.
On Aug. 10, the Fed took a baby step toward additional monetary expansion, deciding to use proceeds from its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities to buy two- to 10-year Treasury securities. In an Aug. 27 speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Mr. Bernanke emphasized the need to analyze both the costs and the benefits of action, but made it clear he was prepared to move if needed.
At the Fed's most recent policy meeting, on Sept. 21, the committee said it was ''prepared to provide additional accommodation if needed,'' and in a speech in Boston on Oct. 15, Mr. Bernanke said ''there would appear -- all else being equal -- to be a case for further action.''
The actions have already had an effect. Since Aug. 10, long-term interest rates have fallen, stock prices have risen and expectations of inflation have crept upward.
At a closed-door gathering of central bankers from the Group of 20 economic powers in Gyeongju, South Korea, on Oct. 22 and 23, Mr. Bernanke tried to reassure his peers, some of whom expressed alarm about the effect of Fed action on the dollar.
In response, Mr. Bernanke cited the imperative of supporting domestic growth and the role American consumer demand plays in sustaining the worldwide recovery, according to people who attended the meeting.
What the chairman has not managed -- or necessarily tried -- to do, however, is to quell the dissenting voices within the Fed who say additional action is a grave mistake.
The most prominent dissenter, Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, has argued that new quantitative easing could lead to imbalances and volatility, undermine the Fed's independence and unmoor inflation expectations. In his most pointed language to date, he recently called the plan a ''dangerous gamble'' and a ''bargain with the devil.''
Other regional Fed presidents -- Charles I. Plosser of Philadelphia, Richard W. Fisher of Dallas and Jeffrey M. Lacker of Richmond -- also oppose additional bond purchases. But there is substantial support for more monetary stimulus from William C. Dudley of New York, Eric S. Rosengren of Boston, Charles L. Evans of Chicago and, recently, Dennis P. Lockhart of Atlanta.
Speculation about ''hawks'' (whose priority is fighting inflation) and ''doves'' (who put relatively greater emphasis on reducing unemployment) is a well-established game among Fed watchers.
But it is Mr. Bernanke's opinion that ultimately matters. He has studiously avoided wading into fiscal controversies, but it seems clear that the gridlock over taxes and spending, and the virulence of the rhetoric going into the Tuesday elections, has deprived the central bank of the support fiscal policy can play in bolstering the recovery.
''Fiscal measures would accomplish something; they directly support spending and therefore G.D.P.,'' said James K. Galbraith, an economist at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin. ''Quantitative easing will accomplish nothing beyond flooding the banks with cash which they will use, if at all, for speculating rather than lending.''
But Scott E. Pardee, an economist at Middlebury College, said Mr. Bernanke was correct to do all he could. ''As long as unemployment is so high, and the housing market is not standing on its own two feet yet, the Fed has no other choice,'' he said.

Times are tough, and Americans are understandably worried and angry. This year's campaign has only made things worse. Billions of dollars have been spent to destroy character rather than debate serious ideas. Still, there is no excuse for staying home on Election Day.
There are critically important decisions to be made about whether the country moves ahead with confidence or moves backward and becomes even more polarized. 
Voting in Republican primaries and special elections showed what happens when moderate Americans stay home or react to the barrages of fear and intolerance. We end up with fringe candidates like Christine O'Donnell in Delaware and Sharron Angle in Nevada. Establishment candidates then spout the same disturbing ideas. (Witness Representative John Boehner, the House minority leader, trying to act like an outsider after 18 years in the Washington power elite.)
Democrats have been far too timid to argue the case, but they, and President Obama, have done many important things in the last two years.
Most important, the stimulus -- which Republicans made sure was smaller than it should have been -- saved the country from a deeper, more destructive recession. That is not a lot of comfort for the millions of unemployed Americans, but it would have been far worse if the Republicans had had their way. They have even opposed extending federal unemployment benefits.
American troops are coming home from Iraq. For the first time, troops in Afghanistan have the full backing of the White House and Pentagon. The United States is regaining the respect of allies around the world.
The Republicans have been rewriting history. They claim Mr. Obama's economic policies are a failure and hope Americans will forget that it was President George W. Bush who turned big budget surpluses into huge deficits and whose contempt for regulation ultimately brought us to the brink of financial collapse. The Republicans want to go back to more tax cuts for the rich and more free passes for Wall Street and big corporations.
Tea Party candidates are particularly worrisome. Some want to privatize Social Security. Others want to eliminate Medicare. Betting on the Republican establishment to temper these excesses is a bad bet.
Here are some things to bear in mind on Tuesday:
Since Mr. Obama was elected, millions of poor children who did not have health insurance got it. A reform law was passed that already allows young people to be on their parents' plan until they are 26, bars insurers from dropping coverage after a beneficiary becomes sick, and removes lifetime caps on coverage. In 2014, many more benefits will kick in.
Republicans are determined to undo that progress. It would be a disaster. The law is the best chance in years to provide health insurance to the rapidly rising numbers of uninsured and to begin trying to slow cost growth in medical care and insurance.
The country needs tax reform that is fair and doesn't get us even deeper in the red. Republicans are interested only in one thing: permanently extending tax cuts for the rich, adding $700 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years.
The country needs jobs and to be globally competitive. Republicans are determined to block Mr. Obama's sensible proposals to create good jobs by rebuilding fraying infrastructure or creating new energy industries.
The country needs sound regulation. If there is any doubt about that look at the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Or the bank bailout that -- despite what the Republicans are saying -- happened on Mr. Bush's watch. The Republicans want more heedless deregulation.
With very few exceptions, Republican candidates are hostile to the administration's efforts to address climate change and reduce the nation's dependence on fossil fuels. There has already been talk on Capitol Hill of stripping the Environmental Protection Agency of its authority to regulate greenhouse gases.
We urge all Americans to think carefully and then vote, especially young voters who voted for the first time in 2008. Sitting on their hands is voting for Republicans, none of whom will protect these voters' interests. There are clear choices to be made.

HEADLINE: Charging In on Wave of Anger, Hoping to Rise in Better Times

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The impact of the anti-incumbency wave of 2010 -- if, in fact, it materializes in the way polls would indicate -- will be judged in the next few days by the number of seats that change hands in Washington and in statehouses across the country.
In the longer term, though, the importance of any wave election isn't only about the sheer number of seats gained and lost, but also about when the wave hits -- or, more specifically, where it falls in the economic cycles of the country. And if you look at it that way, history suggests that the expected big bang of 2010 may well end up reverberating loudly through our politics for a long time to come. 
That's because, in the years ahead, the country might well experience the kind of economic recovery that the White House had hoped would take hold in time for this year's elections. This isn't a sure thing, by any means; some economists are still predicting a long period of Japanese-style stagnation. But most Washington observers seem to be betting on the kind of upturn that's more evident to voters.
And it's the politicians who catch the political wave at such fortunate economic moments -- particularly governors who get themselves elected during hard times and then preside over the upswing -- who tend to establish themselves as folk heroes and turnaround experts, rising to national prominence not just because of their policies but also because of their timing. Which could be very good news for some Republicans like John Kasich, who may yet become Ohio's next governor, or for an unknown like Nikki Haley, who stands to win in South Carolina.
It isn't just governors, of course, who can benefit from good timing. Should Republicans take control of one or both chambers of Congress, an improving economy in the next several years could bolster the profiles and credibility of some of the party's younger leaders and their more innovative ideas.
But governors have a particular ability to capitalize on a turn in the economic cycle. Go back to 1982, when Republican incumbents, still mired in the economic slump that catapulted Ronald Reagan to the presidency two years earlier, suffered a stinging defeat at the polls, if not quite the massive wave they had feared. Democrats picked up a net gain of seven governors' seats that year. Among the winners were two former governors who had been turned out of office before: Michael S. Dukakis and Bill Clinton.
Mr. Dukakis rode the economic recovery that followed to the Democratic nomination for president in 1988, campaigning on the rebound he called his ''Massachusetts miracle.'' Mr. Clinton took advantage of the same fallow period (although he did, ultimately, have to govern during the late-1980s downturn as well) to improve education and spur job creation in Arkansas, on his way to becoming arguably the most influential political figure of his age.
By 1994, of course, President Clinton found himself bedeviled by his own sluggish economy, along with other problems. Among the Republicans who swept into office on the wave of 1994 -- and who would not have had much chance running in a less turbulent year -- were the novice George W. Bush, who stunned the political establishment by unseating Gov. Ann Richards of Texas.
Mr. Bush arrived in Austin just in time to catch a historic period of sustained economic growth, fueled by dot-com mania. Like other governors at that time, Mr. Bush was able to cut taxes while proposing increases in education spending and balancing the budget, a bit of magic that, along with his famous name, enabled him to become the first Texas governor to win successive four-year terms and made him the early frontrunner for his party's presidential nomination in 2000.
In fact, several Republicans who won in 1994, or in the off-year elections of 1993 that were essentially its prelude, went on to build national profiles during the boom years. Rudolph W. Giuliani got credit for making Gotham governable. Christie Whitman of New Jersey, George E. Pataki of New York and Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania all won governorships in reliably Democratic states and rose to stardom inside the party during the Clinton years.
Contrast the arc of these political careers with those of some Democratic governors elected in 2006, who then had the misfortune of governing as the already fragile national economy imploded. Two of the Democrats' hottest properties after they took back Republican seats in that election, Deval Patrick of Massachusetts and Ted Strickland of Ohio, are trying to eke out re-election after seeing their popularity plummet. Colorado's Bill Ritter Jr. opted not to run again, and Iowa's Chet Culver appears likely to lose.
None of this is to suggest that the economy, by itself, is destiny. No one can argue that Bill Clinton wasn't among the more talented politicians in modern history, or that just because tech stocks were soaring, the guy brewing coffee at the 7-Eleven could have governed just as ably as a Rudy Giuliani. But it does suggest that the politicians who linger longest and most successfully on the national stage tend to also be lucky, having been elected in years of unrest and having been able to claim credit for the periods of relative ease that followed.
So when the polls close on Tuesday, you might want to pay special attention to an obscure governor-elect like, potentially, Scott Walker of Wisconsin or Susana Martinez of New Mexico, both Republicans. If President Obama is right and the economy that has shadowed this election year is about to right itself, then you might be hearing their names again, perhaps even in 2016.

HEADLINE: A Gold Mine in Attack Ads on Local TV

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
In Waco, Tex., $350 will usually buy 30 seconds of advertising time on a local evening newscast. But not this week.
In a scene being repeated in markets across the country, the Democratic congressman who represents Waco and the surrounding region, Chet Edwards, has been fighting off a potent Republican challenger, Bill Flores, ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections.
The beneficiaries are the local stations that have been inundated by campaign attack ads. ''It's swamped us,'' said Phil Hurley of KCEN, the NBC affiliate in Waco, which has been charging closer to $500 for a 30-second spot on the 10 p.m. news. 
There has been a nationwide surge in TV ad spending for the midterms, which one group projects could top out at $3 billion this year, up from $2.7 billion in 2008. The victims, so to speak, are the local businesses whose ads are drowned out by the political din and the viewers who quickly tire of seeing the same attack ads over and over.
Rather than being squashed between attack ads, Tariq Sekander, the sales manager at Waco Hyundai, decided to keep the dealership's ad spending at a minimum in the weeks leading up to the election. He normally spends $13,000 to $15,000 a month on ads, but in October he budgeted only $3,500.
On television, ''all you hear about is about how awful all the other candidates are,'' and that exacerbates what is already a difficult season for car dealerships, Mr. Sekander said. ''People get so focused on the negative advertising that it spurs them not to make a buying decision,'' he said.
Stations say they try to be alert to the needs of their regular customers. ''We have to be very careful that we're taking care of them, because they're with us all the time,'' said Mr. Hurley, who is the chief operating officer at London Broadcasting Company, which owns KCEN. He said he was making sure there were no commercial breaks consisted solely of campaign ads.
Still, some regular advertisers are ''eagerly waiting for Wednesday,'' he added.
Local broadcasters have long grown accustomed to the every-other-year surge in political spending, and the slumps in the off years. What is different for stations like those in Waco is the amount this year, and the economic circumstances.
Local stations across the country suffered mightily in 2009 when there was retrenchment from advertisers, especially from those in the automotive category. Excluding political spending, KCEN's revenue was down about 20 percent last year.
Mike Lee, vice president and general manager for KXXV, the ABC affiliate in Waco, said he was treating the campaign dollars as ''just a little bit of recovery from what we lost last year.''
The recovery is in part because of a remarkably active election season. Discontent with incumbents and with Obama administration have put scores of formally safe seats into play, opening a spigot of campaign cash in local markets that are not accustomed to it.
In the Waco area, for instance, Mr. Edwards has held office since 1991, but his battle to keep his job this year has been bruising. Seeing an opening, the National Republican Congressional Committee has put forward hundreds of thousands of dollars for ads in east-central Texas, and American Crossroads, the Republican PAC co-founded by Karl Rove, has also chipped in.
Further feeding the ad business in Waco, there is a competitive Texas governor's race between the incumbent Republican, Rick Perry, and the Democratic challenger, Bill White.
Mr. Lee said political ad buying for the general election started in April. That was a month he had not expected any political ads, since the primaries were held the month before. ''This year we've seen it come in earlier than we expected, and we've seen more dollars than we expected,'' he said.
In the Congressional race, Mr. Edwards has criticized Mr. Flores as supporting a ''tax cut for millionaires'' and for briefly saying that he would consider raising the Social Security retirement age, before taking that comment back.
In his own ads, Mr. Flores has criticized Mr. Edwards for voting for ''Pelosi's budget'' and for ''Obama's green energy stimulus.'' That stimulus granted ''tax dollars for foreign corporations to create jobs overseas -- even China,'' the Flores ad's narrator said, emphasizing the words ''even China.''
Despite the gains from campaign ad dollars, Mr. Lee of KXXV is not budgeting for any new acquisitions of programming or for any additional news reporters. He said of the influx, ''It's like a house of cards, it goes away pretty quick.''
Radio tends not to benefit from campaign ad spending as much as television. ''Mud looks better on TV than it sounds on radio,'' said Brad LaRock, the general manager at KWOW, a Spanish-language station near Waco. Still, the Edwards campaign has spent a ''large amount of money'' on ads on KWOW, he said, apparently to encourage Hispanics to vote next week.
''We treat it as a bonus,'' Mr. LaRock said of the campaign spending. ''But it's welcome. In this day and age, everything is welcome.''
Welcome for the stations, but not among all the listeners and viewers. Mr. Sekander, for one, has been trying to shield his son, 12, and his daughters, 6 and 15, from the campaign ads, at least for one more day. ''We're recording the shows and fast-forwarding through the mud,'' he said.

HEADLINE: CAMPAIGN MEMO; Finding Clues to the Future In Flood of Midterm Data

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Kitty Bennett, Carl Hulse and Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even for a nation that is, by now, used to drinking in political news through a fire hose, election night on Tuesday could be a difficult one to absorb.
More than 500 House, Senate and governor's races will be decided, if not by the end of the night, then over the course of the nail-biting days ahead as write-in ballots are counted and recounts are requested.
Beyond the individual results, the nation will be looking at the returns for answers to bigger questions: Was this election about President Obama? How powerful a phenomenon is the Tea Party movement? How will the new Congress address the still-weak economy? What will it mean for the crop of likely 2012 Republican presidential candidates? Did anonymous campaign money sway the outcome?
Democrats made their last-minute appeals Monday. Michelle Obama headed to Las Vegas and Philadelphia as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. traveled to Vermont and former President Bill Clinton raced up and down the East Coast. Mr. Obama hunkered down in the White House, conducting a few radio interviews and bracing for a rebuke that most pundits predict could be historic in its breadth. 
On the eve of an election that could make him speaker of the House, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the minority leader, rallied Republicans in Cincinnati, praising as ''patriots'' the voters who have the ''audacity to speak up in defense of freedom, the Constitution and the values of limited government,'' according to excerpts released by his office.
Here is a guide to some of the trends to watch for as the results come in.
EARLY DECISIONS Polls close in Kentucky first, at 6 p.m. Eastern time, so look to the races there for an early clue to how the evening is going. In the state's Senate race, Rand Paul, the Republican and a Tea Party favorite, has been pulling ahead of Jack Conway, the Democrat. Also watch Representative Ben Chandler, a Democrat who won re-election easily in 2006 and 2008, but is fighting to survive in Kentucky's Sixth Congressional District.
In Virginia, Mr. Obama and his political team will be nervously watching the returns in the Fifth Congressional District, where Representative Tom Perriello, a freshman Democrat who voted for the health care bill and Mr. Obama's other major initiatives, is seeking to hold on in a conservative part of the state.
In Ohio, five close races could help decide whether Republicans can quickly claim to have retaken the House from Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats. Keep an eye on seats held by Representatives Charlie Wilson, Zack Space and John Boccieri, each of whom is in a tough fight with his Republican challenger.
Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, said he would be watching returns to see how Democratic turnout compared to 2008. ''If there is a dramatic falloff, Democrats are cooked,'' Mr. Rendell said.
THE TEA PARTY An analysis by The New York Times last month found that 138 candidates for the House and Senate claimed support from the Tea Party movement, and dozens of them could find themselves part of a Congressional Tea Party caucus on Wednesday and in a position to exert substantial influence on the Republican Party.
But assessing the movement's success will not be a simple numbers game. If big-name Tea Party favorites lose to Democrats in places like Alaska, Colorado, Delaware or Nevada, the Republican Party could be left with a decidedly mixed impression of the movement and a renewed debate over whether Tea Party fervor made it harder -- not easier -- for Republicans to seize control of the Senate.
The outcome of those contests will also help determine the political strength of former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, the self-described godmother of the Tea Party, who has actively backed many candidates. Ms. Palin has sought to rescue the faltering campaign of Joe Miller, who won an insurgent campaign for the Republican Senate nomination in Alaska but is in a close race with the write-in campaign of the woman he beat in the primary, Senator Lisa Murkowski. Democrats have some hope that they could snatch the seat if Republicans split their vote.
THE OBAMA MAP As the night wears on, one thing may become clearer: the extent to which Mr. Obama faces a new political reality as he begins to think about re-election in 2012.
Among the most telling indicators will be the outcomes of a handful of races for governor in important states Mr. Obama won in his 2008 campaign against Senator John McCain of Arizona. Those include Colorado, Florida, New Mexico and Ohio.
In Florida, the contest between Alex Sink, the Democrat, and Rick Scott, the Republican, drew to a tie in polling in the waning days before the election. A victory for Mr. Scott would put a crucial swing state under the control of Republicans.
The same can be said for Ohio, where Mr. Obama made a late visit on Sunday to bolster the chances of Gov. Ted Strickland. The Democratic Party is bracing for losses across the Midwest, so a victory by Mr. Strickland in Ohio would give the White House a bit of good news in that region heading into next year.
In the end, though, Mr. Obama's future may be determined by his ability to once again win a handful of Western states. Two races to watch: campaigns for governor in Colorado, which appears likely to be a solid Democratic victory, and New Mexico, which is leaning Republican.
THE MONEY As the tide turned decidedly against the Democrats this fall, Mr. Obama and his allies took aim at a flood of money outside groups were spending on behalf of Congressional Republicans. They argued that the money would corrupt the process and provide an unfair advantage to their rivals.
That thesis will be tested Tuesday across the country in races like the one in Iowa's First District, where outside conservative groups poured in close to $1 million to help defeat Representative Bruce Braley, a Democrat. In North Dakota's at-large House seat, outside groups spent more than $2.4 million in a state where that much buys plenty of ads.
Outside groups, including American Crossroads, a group the Republican strategist Karl Rove helped start, put more money into Colorado's Senate race than any other in the country -- a total of $25 million. If Senator Michael Bennet, the Democrat, loses there, Mr. Obama and his allies will no doubt point to Colorado as the prime example of their frustration about special-interest money in politics.
THE BLUE DOGS Conservative Democrats in the South won big in 2006 and 2008, edging out their Republican rivals in House districts that could have easily tilted either way. If they lose this time around, Republicans could solidify their grasp on the region.
Look for the outcomes in races like Representative Heath Shuler's re-election bid in North Carolina's 11th District. A loss by Mr. Shuler would indicate that even the most conservative Democrats are having a hard time this time around.
In Georgia, Representative Jim Marshall, a Democrat, is seeking to remain in office in part by promising not to support Ms. Pelosi for speaker.

HEADLINE: The Second Marriage

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
The heavens rejoiced. Two years ago as Democrats cruised to power, Washingtonians felt a jolt of electricity in the air. News organizations published picture books celebrating the dawning of a new age. I distinctly remember seeing angels and cherubs drunk at the bar of the Old Ebbitt Grill near the White House.
Today, the atmosphere is different. Republicans may win the House, but everyone is writing about anger, not inspiration. (Memo to young journalists: Democratic victories are always ascribed to hope; Republican ones to rage.) 
The biggest change is in the camp of the potential victors. Two years ago, Democrats waxed romantic. This year, the Republicans seem modest and cautious. I haven't seen this many sober Republicans since America lost the Ryder Cup.
We have to be careful not to get carried away, says Lamar Alexander, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate. ''I was thinking about putting photos of Nancy Pelosi and Henry Waxman in the Republican cloakroom to remind us not to overreach,'' he told me on Monday.
We have to beware of unrealistic expectations, emphasized Senator Jon Kyl, the second-ranking Republican. Republicans can't accomplish big things without Democratic help. They can't defund Obamacare on their own or pass a new tax law.
Many Americans are still skeptical about us, acknowledged Eric Cantor, the No. 2 Republican in the House. We can't do anything that might unsettle them, like shutting down the government. Instead, Republicans need to offer reassurance. Businesses should be able to predict what their tax costs will be, what their health costs will be and what their regulatory burdens will be.
In 1994, Newt Gingrich talked about a Republican Revolution, but these Republicans are still suffering from the hangover. Gingrich concentrated power in the speaker's office, weakened the committee chairmen and built his machine for speed. Today's Republican leader, John Boehner, vows to do the opposite -- to weaken the speaker's office, decentralize authority and move step by step.
Many Republicans figure the age of permanent majorities is over. Democrats once held the House for 40 years, but now control will likely flip back and forth with the tides. So lasting change has to be firmly implanted and gradually absorbed.
The Republican theory about how to revive economic growth, is best expressed by Alexander: ''We have to make it easier and cheaper to create private sector jobs.'' Week by week, Republicans hope to issue a string of bills designed to reduce uncertainty, public spending and the cost of hiring.
Some of the measures will attempt to repeal parts of Obamacare. For example, the new health care law has a provision that forces companies to file a 1099 form to the I.R.S. every time they pay more than $600 a year for goods or services from any individual or corporation. If you're a freelancer and you buy a laptop from an Apple store, you have to file a 1099. If you spend more than $600 per year with FedEx, you have to file a 1099. Republicans are going to make this an early target -- an example of the law's expensive interference in business life.
Republican leaders are also prepared to take what they can get, even if it's not always what they would like. Republicans would like to extend all the Bush tax cuts until the sun fizzles out. They're willing to take a compromise extension of two or three years. Republicans are under intense pressure from the business lobbies to compromise with Democrats to get certain things done: more infrastructure spending and tax breaks for energy innovation.
The predictable response to all this gradualism is that the Republican leaders may want this, but there is no way the fire-breathing Tea Party-types are going to cooperate. There's some truth to this. Rank-and-file Republicans are more hostile to earmarks than the chairmen (who say that without earmarks spending, decisions will just get made by bureaucrats).
There will also be clashes over budgets, raising the debt limit and doctors' reimbursements. (Democrats are talking about leaving behind legislative traps to maximize G.O.P. discomfort.)
But this leadership-versus-the-crazies storyline is overblown. The new Republicans may distrust government, but this will be a Republican class with enormous legislative experience. Tea Party hype notwithstanding, most leading G.O.P. candidates either served in state legislatures or previously in Washington. The No Compromise stalwarts like Senator Jim DeMint have a big megaphone but few actual followers within the Senate.
Over all, if it is won, a Republican House majority will be like a second marriage. Less ecstasy, more realism. The party could have used a few more years to develop plans about the big things, like tax and entitlement reform. But if a party is going to do well in an election, it should at least be a party that has developed a sense of modesty.

HEADLINE: Sign, Sign, Everywhere A Sign

BYLINE: By DANA SPIOTTA. 
Dana Spiotta is the author of the forthcoming novel, ''Stone Arabia.''

 BODY:
Syracuse, N.Y.
ELECTION day could not have come too soon, after what felt like many long and painful weeks.
It had been raining steadily, and the glorious reds and golds of upstate New York in autumn lay clumped and muted. On my way to work, as I do every day, I trudged by the large corner house that is covered in signs, some soaked and wilted in the rain, others protected behind the glass street-facing windows. Many of the signs were for Ann Marie Buerkle, the Tea Party candidate for New York's 25th Congressional district.
We are new to the neighborhood, and I called my husband: ''You know that house with all the Tea Party yard signs? The one on the corner, with like a million signs? They really make me mad. Right now I'm going to knock on their door and tell them how mad they make me.'' 
''They're allowed to have signs; it is their house,'' my irritatingly rational husband replied.
''And I'm allowed to have signs, too. I'm going to put signs all over our lawn!'' I said. Later I spotted a giant sign for Carl Paladino, the Republican candidate for governor, in front of a vacant lot. I called my husband again.
''I wouldn't worry. Paladino is down 20 points in the polls,'' he assured me.
I honestly considered getting a sign for Andrew Cuomo, the Democratic nominee. But I just wanted the election to be over already. The rain kept coming down. And I kept tallying signs: Mr. Cuomo was nearly shut out; Howie Hawkins, the Green Party candidate, was doing well near the university; but the suburbs were Carl country.
I asked my mother, who lives in rural Otsego County, about signs where she lived. She reported a few Paladinos.
My mother didn't have a Cuomo sign on her lawn either. Only an anti-fracking sign. Many upstate voters are worried about a plan to open up our area to hydrofracking, the highly controversial technique of using high-pressure water and chemicals to extract natural gas. In fact, my mother hates hydrofracking as much as my corner neighbor loves Ann Marie Buerkle.
''An election isn't a yard sign contest,'' my mother advised me. Yet I continued to notice more and more Paladino signs. Not only that, his and other Tea Party signs were often planted on public property: on street dividers, on the edges of parks and next to shopping malls.
Obviously, their supporters are excited about the election. I imagined them driving around in the middle of the night sticking up illegal signs, high-five-ing and joyful in their righteous anger. I felt no joy on my side. The lack of enthusiasm on the left has been widely discussed. But the despair about New York is longer and deeper than this election or recession.
What could help the economy of central New York, parts of which have been in decline since the Erie Canal closed down? I read that Mr. Cuomo would create upstate regional economic councils to help local businesses access resources and capital. Better still, he would appoint Daniel Wegman as one of the councils' advisors. Wegmans, the beloved central New York-based supermarket chain, consistently lands at the top of the Forbes Best Companies to Work For list.
Compare that with Carl Paladino's string of Family Dollar stores, the discount seconds franchise that colonizes run-down strip malls all over the region. Wegmans versus Family Dollar. Was there any chance New Yorkers would choose Family Dollar for their future?
That night, my mother called to say she had put up a Cuomo yard sign. ''O.K.? Do you feel better now?''
After I hung up, I went out to walk my dog, and discovered a yard sign planted in the middle of my lawn. It said Dave Valesky for State Senate. I still didn't know anything about my new State Senate district or Dave Valesky. I looked down the street. Who put this here? Was it some midnight Tea Partier, hopped up on Sean Hannity and ''Fox and Friends''? I pulled out the sign, muttering to myself about plastering Cuomo signs all over my local Family Dollar.
When I got back in the house, I looked up Mr. Valesky. He turned out to be our Democratic State Senator and, from what I could tell, a sane person. I picked the sign out from between my garbage cans, went out into the rain and replanted it in my yard. So I ended up with one yard sign, albeit an accidental one.
Final results for upstate's sign contest: the Tea Party won, hands down. It remains to be seen what else they'll win.

HEADLINE: Power Shift Is Expected By C.E.O.'s

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The most powerful executives in the banking industry didn't go to the government.
The government came to them.
Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve; Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary; and regulators like Mary L. Schapiro of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Gary Gensler of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission made their way last month to a room called the Nest at the Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington. There, the members of a group called the Financial Services Forum awaited them.
The event with the forum, which is composed of chief executives, underscored how influential banks, brokerage firms and insurance companies remain in Washington, despite all the critical campaign rhetoric from the White House, Capitol Hill and other quarters.
And Tuesday's midterm elections are likely to leave them in an even stronger position, blunting the most serious overhaul of financial regulations since the Great Depression. 
The widely expected prospect of a Republican takeover of the House of Representatives and possibly the Senate would be warmly welcomed by the banks, who want a break from the regulatory push of the last two years. Divided government makes it harder to pass new legislation and brings with it other benefits for the banks, like reducing the chances of an increase in corporate taxes.
''At this juncture, gridlock is good,'' said Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association. ''It's time we take a breather from all the excess of regulation and Congressional legislation. Our members and customers are ready for common sense to reappear.''
A Republican victory would also shift control of the oversight and appropriations process in Congress, and lobbyists are hoping that means less money for agencies like the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. to hire staff and aggressively enforce the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform bill passed this summer.
While that bill is already law and a rollback would be tough, other attempts at an end-run around it are likely, especially if the Senate also switches hands. In that case, Republicans could block appointees the industry considered hostile at the Treasury, as well as at the S.E.C. and C.F.T.C. Nominees for two of the five commissioner's seats at the S.E.C. will require approval by the Senate during the next session, while the term of one commissioner at the five-member C.F.T.C. expires.
In addition, analysts and lobbyists say a Republican-controlled Congress may be less likely to investigate industry practices or hold oversight hearings that may embarrass the industry.
While that won't affect hearings like ones set for later this month in the Senate that will examine the foreclosure mess, it makes them much less likely in the next Congress. ''It changes the tone in Washington,'' one industry lobbyist said. ''If a regulator knows they're going to get yelled at on Capitol Hill, that influences their decisions.''
Federal policy is likely to loom larger as the foreclosure crisis goes on -- the majority of those foreclosed homes are owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises that dominate the mortgage market and are now controlled by the Treasury. What is more, some Democrats who have called for a moratorium on foreclosures, like Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat who is the Senate majority leader, are facing tough re-election fights and their exit could be a boon for the banking industry.
Indeed, campaign donations from the financial industry in recent months have heavily favored the Republicans. In September, 71 percent of campaign donations went to Republicans, compared with 44 percent a year ago, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group.
''It's a dramatic shift and there's little irony that it coincided with Democratic-led financial reform,'' said Dave Levinthal, communications director for the Center for Responsive Politics. ''The industry wasn't at all thrilled with this legislation and since Democrats were driving it, they had an incentive to put their money with the party that might give them a more favorable shake in coming years.''
A shift in party control could also alter the rhetoric coming out of the capital. On Wall Street, there is a feeling among many executives that the White House has demonized the big banks -- and that complaint surfaced repeatedly at the Financial Services Forum event, as well as at one-on-one meetings in the last two months, according to several participants.
Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase and Lloyd C. Blankfein, head of Goldman Sachs, spoke the most, said one participant, although other top chief executives were present, including Brian T. Moynihan of Bank of America, Oswald J. Grubel of the Swiss bank UBS and Abigail Johnson of the mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments.
There are lighter moments during the meetings, as well. At a Washington get-together earlier this year, Mr. Dimon teased Mr. Blankfein, repeating the latter's famous remark that he ''was doing God's work.'' A jovial Mr. Blankfein responded, ''I'll be the judge of that.''
Mr. Dimon and Mr. Blankfein aren't the only executives to occasionally lighten the mood. Before Mr. Geithner addressed the Financial Services Forum last month, the chief executive of the American International Group, Robert H. Benmosche, joked that he had nothing to say. ''I'm just going to sit back and listen to my largest shareholder,'' he said, a reference to the 79.9 percent stake the government holds in A.I.G. after its bailout by Washington. .
While top government officials may occasionally come to them for group sessions like the Financial Services Forum, executives have also spent plenty of time recently calling on them individually at their offices.
Unlike some other bank chiefs who left after the Financial Services Forum meeting wrapped up, Mr. Dimon stayed in Washington, meeting privately Oct. 8 with Elizabeth Warren, who was appointed in September to lead the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. They discussed eliminating the fine print from credit card offers and streamlining mortgage disclosures so consumers would have a better idea of the exact terms of their loans.
A month earlier on Sept. 15, Mr. Dimon met privately with Mr. Bernanke at the Federal Reserve, as did Mr. Moynihan, who sat down on Sept. 3 for a 30-minute meeting to discuss the economy.
More recently, on Oct. 13 and Oct. 14, the president of Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn, met with officials at the C.F.T.C. to go over the rulemaking process, touching on subjects like reporting requirements for trades as well as limits on trading.
''The intersection of Washington and the financial services sector has never been as important as it is now,'' said Rob Nichols, president of the Financial Services Forum. ''It's critical to have a seat at the table and participate in a dialogue.''

HEADLINE: American Media Reveals Plans to File Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
American Media, the publisher that titillates the mind with tabloids like National Enquirer and firms the body with magazines like Men's Fitness, announced on Monday plans to restructure through what it said it expected would be a quick and painless bankruptcy. 
Struggling under a debt burden seven times greater than its equity, American Media said it had decided after years of trying to avoid bankruptcy that its only viable path to stability was through the courts.
The company, based in Manhattan, said it intended to continue business as usual while the restructuring unfolded, and did not expect any significant disruptions.
''During this period, there should be no impact to our employees, vendors or advertisers,'' American Media's chief executive, David J. Pecker, said in a statement.
''The reorganization should not affect American Media's operations. Publications will function seamlessly, staff will be unaffected by the reorganization and customers should not notice any difference during the 60-day process.''
The company is expected to file in the next two weeks, Mr. Pecker said.
Such prepackaged bankruptcies typically allow companies to restructure in a relatively short time. Unlike many other bankruptcies, which can play out for months and sometimes years while a company and its lenders squabble over agreements to pay financial obligations, creditors and debtors have a working agreement before a prepackaged bankruptcy.
American Media also publishes titles including Shape and Star, runs all of Playboy's noneditorial functions, like printing, and owns the gossip Web site Radar.
As the economy collapsed, the company was hit hard by falling newsstand sales, which amount to 60 percent of its business, and the contracting advertising market.
Mr. Pecker said American Media would proceed with an aggressive digital strategy upon leaving bankruptcy. He said that other magazines wanted to join American Media in deals similar to the arrangement it has with Playboy.
''I'm going to be taking over for other publishers, just like I do for Playboy,'' he said in an interview, but declined to name them.
As for the future of American Media, he said, ''I am cautiously optimistic.''

HEADLINE: Unions Fear Rollback of Rights Under Republicans

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Organized labor is deeply worried about what happens after Tuesday.
By many measures, labor unions have been the Republicans' fiercest, biggest-spending opponents in this year's campaign, laying out more than $200 million in hopes of safeguarding the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate.
So it should be no surprise that Republicans, who appear to stand a good chance of winning control of the House, are signaling that they plan to push bills and strategies to undermine labor's political clout and its ability to grow. 
''Republicans are likely to pursue a version of what Samuel Gompers often said: 'Reward your friends and punish your enemies,' '' said Joseph McCartin, a labor historian at Georgetown.
One bill that is popular among Republicans would prohibit employers from ever agreeing to unionization through ''card check,'' a process often used today in which an employer recognizes a union as soon as a majority of workers sign pro-union cards -- without holding a secret-ballot election. Another bill would severely crimp labor's campaign spending by barring unions from using any portion of a union member's dues for political purposes unless the member first gives written permission.
A Republican-led House or Senate is expected to be more eager than a Democratic-controlled one to approve free trade agreements that unions oppose, and to be more reluctant to enact stimulus plans that unions have supported, like the recent bill that gave states $26 billion to help save the jobs of teachers, police officers and other government employees. A Republican-controlled House or Senate would probably block a labor-backed bill that would give firefighters and police officers in every state the right to unionize.
''We fear that the Republicans are on the march, and that's why we're doing everything we can to stop them,'' said Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which is spending $91 million in the two-year campaign cycle.
Mr. McEntee praised the $26 billion jobs bill. ''That saved literally thousands of public-sector jobs,'' he said. ''I don't think we'll see something like that passed under John Boehner,'' the Ohio Republican who is expected to become speaker if the Republicans win control of the house.
All this means that Republicans may well go on the offensive against labor, after two years in which unions have been on the offensive. Labor leaders have pressed their Democratic allies, unsuccessfully so far, to muster the 60 votes needed in the Senate to advance card-check legislation. Many Republican and business leaders say the card-check process is unfair because union organizers often pressure workers to sign the cards, an assertion that the unions deny.
''Most certainly, the issue of card check will be dead,'' said Doug Heye, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ''That will be a victory for businesses large and small.''
Mr. Heye said that many Republicans were likely to support legislation that would bar unions from spending members' dues on politics unless members first ''opted in.'' Under current law, unions can spend a member's dues on politics unless the member first opts out, a little-known procedure few workers follow.
Mr. Heye said that when he visited campaigns around the country, union members who personally back Republicans had often complained that their unions were spending money to elect Democrats.
Union leaders vigorously oppose the opt-in idea. ''Obviously, this would further tilt the tables in favor of corporations in our political campaigns,'' said Bill Samuel, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s legislative director. ''Let's hope the Republicans focus on putting people back to work, instead of taking away workers' rights.''
If the Republicans win control of the House, Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican, is expected to succeed George Miller, a California Democrat, as chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee.
''One of the greatest threats to job creation is economic uncertainty,'' Mr. Kline said in an e-mail after being asked about his plans should he become chairman. ''The solution is to take economic threats -- like tax hikes and card check -- off the table and make the laws governing our workplaces more understandable, workable and effective for workers and employers.''
Mr. Kline is chief sponsor of the Secret Ballot Protection Act, a bill with 115 House co-sponsors that would bar employers from agreeing to unionization through card check. He has also criticized two policies that are favorites of construction unions: the Davis-Bacon Act, which requires that contractors on federal public works projects pay workers the prevailing wage, usually near the union wage, even if they are not unionized; and project labor agreements, which tend to tilt the awarding of federally financed construction projects toward unionized contractors.
Professor McCartin said, ''I suspect the Republicans will target these policies by trying to make the case that they waste taxpayer money by promoting higher wages on projects that taxpayers pay for.''
Ronald E. Meisburg, a Republican and former general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board, predicted that if a Republican-controlled House cripples labor-backed legislative efforts to make it easier for workers to unionize, the Democratic-controlled labor board might take administrative steps. Mr. Meisburg noted that one Democratic labor-board member recently proposed making a change in the timing of workplace elections after employees file a petition to hold a unionization vote, reducing the delay to just five or 10 days.
Unions want an accelerated schedule because they say employers have too much time to ply workers with antiunion propaganda, but employers complain that such quick elections deny them an adequate opportunity to campaign against unionizing.
''We're concerned that the N.L.R.B. will do exactly that,'' said Randel Johnson, senior vice president for labor matters at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ''It would be unfair to hold elections before employers have a chance to state their case.''
Mr. Samuel predicted that labor could stop any Republican legislative offensive. ''When Republicans won control of the House in 1994, they tried to roll back 60 years of labor protections for workers, but we fought them to a stalemate,'' he said. ''If the Republicans attempt that again, I think this story will repeat itself.''

HEADLINE: Cede Political Turf? Never! Well, Maybe.

BYLINE: By BENEDICT CAREY

 BODY:
No matter how it turns out, at least one message from the midterm election is clear: this is not a moment of harmonic convergence.
The campaign has been all about irreconcilable differences -- on health care, on spending and climate, on who's a lunatic and who's a tyrant. Political handicappers expect at best a divided government, and at worst a paralyzed, feuding one: ''Survivor: Washington, D.C.,'' with gavels and filibusters in place of bonfires and tribal headbands.
But recent research suggests that several strong but subtle psychological factors will be pushing Democrats and Republicans in an unexpected direction -- toward engagement instead of name-calling and nastiness. These forces, rooted in the nature of personal identity and the rhythm of one-on-one interaction, are present when any antagonists meet; they can blunt even sharp ideological differences.
''We've done a good job of documenting how harshly humans treat their enemies throughout evolution,'' said Dacher Keltner, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of ''Born to be Good'' (Norton, 2009). ''But we also have evidence of an early shift in human evolution to hypersociality -- a default orientation toward trust, toward sharing resources, toward forgiveness.'' 
Without putting aside their differences, he went on, humans have a ''profound capacity through which vicious adversaries can form alliances.''
Political insiders are skeptical that this will happen soon, especially if some of the strongest opponents of the president are elected. ''These candidates believe they're being sent to undo what's been done,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster and consultant. ''They don't even want to be seen'' dealing with opponents.
Still, people tend to exaggerate their differences with opponents to begin with, research suggests, especially in the company of fellow partisans. In small groups organized around a cause, for instance, members are prone to one-up one another; the most extreme tend to rise the most quickly, making the group look more radical than it is.
For this and other reasons -- including media coverage of the political fringes -- Americans as a rule overestimate the policy differences between so-called red and blue voters.
A series of recent studies demonstrates how quickly large differences can be put aside, under some circumstances. In one, a team of psychologists had a group of college students who scored very high on measures of patriotism read and critique an essay titled ''Beyond the Rhetoric: Understanding the Recent Terrorist Attacks in Context,'' which argued that the 9/11 attacks were partly a response to American policy in the Middle East.
The students judged the report harshly -- unless, prompted by the researchers, they had first described a memory that they were proud of. This group, flush with the image of having acted with grace or courage, was significantly more open to at least considering the case spelled out in the essay than those who had recounted a memory of having failed to exhibit their most prized personal quality.
Confronting an opposing political view is a threat to identity, but ''if you remind people of what they value in some other domain of their life, it lessens the pain,'' said the lead author, Geoffrey L. Cohen, a social psychologist at Stanford. ''It opens them up to information that they might not otherwise consider.''
Psychologists draw out these memories in the lab by asking people to describe a personal strength and an occasion when it was on display. But daily life is full of triggers too, whether in an unexpected call from an old friend, a question from a child or an evocative sight -- one's family portrait, say, propped up under the desk lamp as a reminder of what matters most.
The effect of such affirmations seems especially pronounced in people who boast strong convictions. In a follow-up experiment, the research team had supporters of abortion-rights act out a negotiation with an opponent on an abortion bill. Again, participants who were prompted to recall a treasured memory beforehand were more open to seeking areas of agreement and more respectful of their opposite's position than those not so prompted.
And most fair-minded of all were participants who recalled such a memory and also reaffirmed their beliefs on abortion rights before the role-playing. ''This is contrary to what many assume,'' Dr. Cohen said. ''But the combination of the two made for the greatest distance traveled to meet an adversary, to look for a middle ground.''
Private values -- memories, affirmations -- may well have played a role in some historic compromises. During the negotiations in 1978 to achieve what would become the Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt, the Israeli prime minister, Menachem Begin, appeared ready to walk away. President Jimmy Carter, who coordinated the talks, made a personal visit to Mr. Begin, bringing him autographed photographs of the meeting, addressed to each of the prime minister's eight grandchildren.
''That was it,'' Mr. Carter said in a 1994 interview. ''He looked at those eight photographs, and tears began to run down his cheeks -- and mine -- as he read the names. In just a few minutes he sent his attorney general to tell me he was going to look at the negotiations again.''
One reason sworn enemies may soften after the campaigning is over and they're seated face to face is that conversation subconsciously synchronizes people physically -- and, to some extent, mentally. Researchers have known for some time that a person's gestures, movements and expressions tend to mimic those of another when they interact one on one; the closer the mimicry, the warmer the interactions.
But new research suggests that conversation partners quickly and subconsciously begin to speak alike -- even when they don't care for one another. ''I think of it as a verbal dance,'' said James W. Pennebaker, a psychologist at the University of Texas. ''Speaking styles match up very quickly when people begin to talk to one another -- any two people.''
Within about 30 seconds, strangers making small talk begin speaking with similar sentence structure, a similar tone and often the same slang. In a new study, Dr. Pennebaker and Molly E. Ireland, also of the University of Texas, found that over time, the degree of similarity begins to reflect the closeness (or coolness) of a relationship.
The researchers analyzed correspondence and writings in three famous relationships: Freud and Jung and two poetic couples, Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, and Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Using a measure called language style matching -- a calculation that takes into account the frequency of personal pronouns and other subconscious markers of rapport -- they found that synchrony ranged from a high of nearly 90 percent (Freud and Jung, at the peak of their collaboration) down to 60 percent (Plath and Hughes, in a low period).
The new Congress, though short on married poets, will bring together in direct debate people with strong beliefs who -- even if hostile -- will automatically be speaking a similar language.
''It doesn't matter whether you admire the other person, simply need information or hate their guts,'' Dr. Pennebaker said. ''If you're paying attention to the other person, it's going to happen.''
That is a big if -- and one that, these days, is subject to many outside radicalizing forces, not to mention economic uncertainty.
But if members of the new Congress are secure in their convictions and willing to pay attention to their opponents, they just might get some business done.

HEADLINE: STOCKS AND BONDS; Mixed Finish Ahead of Elections and Fed Meeting

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Shares on Wall Street closed mixed on Monday ahead of midterm elections and expected changes in monetary policy.
The market opened higher on momentum from new statistics on the economy, including upbeat reports on manufacturing, construction and corporate earnings. But indexes declined as investors turned jittery before Tuesday's elections and a meeting of the Fed policy makers.
Investors will also get a look at the latest readings on car sales and retail sales later this week. 
And on Friday, the Labor Department is scheduled to release the unemployment report for October, which will be closely watched for any improvements to the 9.6 percent unemployment rate and any increases in private payrolls.
That rounds out what some analysts are calling one of the biggest weeks in some time for market-moving events.
''It's hard to remember a period so fraught with event risk, as midterm elections, an F.O.M.C. meeting, and a payrolls report are likely to add to volatility,'' said Guy LeBas, the chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 6.13 points to 11,124.62. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 1.12 points to 1,184.38, while the Nasdaq composite index declined 2.57 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,504.84.
On Wednesday the Fed is expected to announce a new round of bond purchases to help stimulate the American economy.
The Fed's F.O.M.C., or Federal Open Market Committee, meets Tuesday and Wednesday and is expected to announce a program to buy Treasury securities, and perhaps other investments, to pump more money into the financial system. Estimates as to the size of the purchases have ranged from $500 billion to $2 trillion.Many analysts expect the purchases to be mostly of two- and 10-year Treasuries, although Goldman Sachs predicted last week that the Fed might include 30-year bonds in its program.
The Fed is hoping to provide further stimulus to the economy during a period of extremely low inflation and nearly double-digit unemployment. Investors are also hoping the generally upbeat third-quarter corporate earnings will translate into a rise in hiring, and then the hoped-for increase in consumer spending.
While there has been some improvement in manufacturing and business confidence, Jason D. Pride, the director of investment strategy at Glenmede, noted that there was still a ''missing link'' between the corporate profits and their translation into jobs.
Stanley A. Nabi, chief strategist for the Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said that third-quarter corporate earnings had been ''far more solid than had been expected'' and that the outlook for the next few quarters looked generally upbeat. News about a troubled bond insurance company, the Ambac Financial Group, was among issues ''casting a shadow on the markets,'' said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.
Ambac said in a filing on Monday that it was in talks with creditors about a bankruptcy plan.
The company, which said it had $1.6 billion in debt as of June 30, said it was in talks about filing a prepackaged bankruptcy, a speedier route that has the backing of a majority of creditors, by the end of the year.
In the United States, manufacturing activity came in better than expected for October. The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index rose to 56.9 points last month, from 54.4 in September, exceeding the forecasts of economists, who had expected a decline in activity to 54. New orders rose to 58.9, from 51.1 in September, reversing three months of declines.
The employment component of the index rose to 57.7 points from 56.5 in September.
While the numbers are a bright spot for the manufacturing sector, economists noted that there were still substantial challenges ahead for consumers struggling under debt and uncertainty in the jobs market.
''Much will depend on the consumer, and we feel that the headwinds for consumer spending remain too brisk to expect substantial help on this front over the near to medium term,'' Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, said in a research note.
The Commerce Department also reported Monday that construction spending in Septemberrose to $801.7 billion, a seasonally adjusted, annualized figure that was above the revised August estimate of $797.5 billion. Spending on private construction in September was flat, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $482 billion, about the same as in August.
Interest rates were up slightly. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 7/32, to 100 and the interest rate rose to 2.62 percent, from 2.60 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: The Spa Half-Hour

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN

 BODY:
There was a time in the not-so-distant past when every big hotel needed a spa. Leisure travelers demanded it, and business travelers did, too -- to reward themselves, their clients or their employees with lavish massage and steam-filled weekends in opulent settings.
No more. 
Today, the oversize hotel spa has pretty much gone the way of limitless credit and fancy holiday parties.
In part, the American International Group is to blame. A week after receiving $85 billion in federal bailout money, a company subsidiary spent $442,000 on a weeklong resort retreat for top sales staff at the St. Regis Resort Monarch Beach in Dana Point, Calif., including $23,000 at the spa. The lavish spending enraged the public and tainted the public's perception of spas.
But the troubled economy, which hurt the hotel industry in general, is to blame as well.
According to Jeff Higley, a vice president at Smith Travel Research, a hotel research company in Hendersonville, Tenn., occupancy rates at hotels with spas fell to 62.4 percent in the first nine months of this year, from 70.8 percent in the first nine months of 2006.
To compensate, many hotel spas have scaled back in size, begun offering shorter treatments and started programs to entice local clients to replace the business travelers they lost.
''What's keeping them alive is the community that books services, the locals who go there for their upkeep -- not the hotel traveler,'' said Mary Bemis, the co-founder and editor in chief of Organic Spa Magazine. ''Most people who are visiting spas just want to use the fitness center and steam room rather than book a long treatment.''
She noted that hotel spas were being built smaller -- from, say, 5,000 to 7,500 square feet, rather than the 35,000-square-foot behemoths from years past -- and that shorter treatments were increasingly popular.
A June 2009 survey from the International Spa Association, the industry's trade group, reported that 86 percent of its member spas were offering more 30-minute options than the traditional 60- or 90-minute services. Hotels are also offering spa credits for hotel guests (giving a voucher for the spa when a room is booked, for example). And they are providing special promotions for local clientele, like letting them make a day of it by taking advantage of the spa's pool, sauna and relaxation area.
''Many spas at our hotels are now offering a la carte menus to cater to weekend guests,'' said Jim Holthouser, the global head of full service brands for Hilton Worldwide. Additionally, he said, many of his hotels have created spa packages bundled with room rates and other amenities. The Hilton Suites Toronto/Markham Conference Center and Spa, for example, is offering a ''spa getaway package'' that includes a free breakfast buffet, a two-room suite, free parking and a $100 credit toward services at its spa.
Margaret Lora, spa director at Spa Merge, part of the West 57th Street by Hilton Club in New York, a timeshare and hotel in Manhattan, said that the shorter treatments were necessary for the spa's survival. ''The 30-minute treatment had almost disappeared from spa menus because it was really not very efficient for a spa to sell 30-minute treatments,'' she said. ''In today's market, it's a way to touch a customer when the spas haven't been as busy.''
The spa at Andaz Wall Street in New York offers 15-minute massages and facials. The New York Palace's spa and fitness center offers 25-minute treatments, and the Seagate Spa in Delray Beach, Fla., offers mini treatments for under $65. Express spa treatments are popular with people who live or work near the Peninsula Spa by ESPA, in Manhattan.
''I'm a huge fan of the Peninsula Spa, but during my busy workweek I just couldn't find the time to dedicate to an hour treatment,'' said Jamie Brown, a 30-year-old marketing executive.
In July, the Four Seasons Hotel New York introduced a ''neighbor's recognition'' program offered to people who live in Midtown and the Upper East Side. Under that program, a 50-minute massage midweek costs $210 rather than the usual $225 on weekends.
The spa is also offering reflexology, custom massage and aromatherapy in 25-minute sessions. ''You don't have to look any further than electronic media to understand that people spend less time on basic activities like communicating and getting the news,'' says Natalie Matesic, the spa's director. ''The spa industry is no exception. Now more than ever, there is a need to offer quicker and shorter services that are still effective.''
Hotel spas may have weathered the worst. Members of the spa association reported a 58 percent increase in spa visits in the first quarter of 2010, over the same period in 2009.
Mr. Higley, of Smith Travel Research, said he was also seeing better numbers for the hotel spas. ''We are definitely starting to see a trend upward -- there's still a lot of ground to regain,'' he said. ''We're taking baby steps. But it's positive movement as companies realize that staying at these hotels doesn't always mean they're breaking the bank.''

HEADLINE: Crucial Manufacturing Index Strengthens in October

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A closely watched index of manufacturing was stronger than expected in October, while construction spending, after having fallen to the lowest level in a decade, edged up slightly.
At the same time, Americans slowed their spending in September to the weakest pace in three months and their incomes fell by the largest amount in 14 months.
In the manufacturing sector, the Institute for Supply Managementsaid its index rose to 56.9 points in October, from 54.4 in the previous month. Economists were expecting a slight slowdown in activity. The upbeat report follows a similar reading that showed manufacturing activity accelerated in China last month as well. 
''This was a very positive report, and it suggests that the U.S. manufacturing sector is beginning to reap the benefits of the weak dollar,'' Eric Green, an economist at TD Securities, wrote in a note to clients. A weak dollar makes American goods cheaper overseas.
Manufacturing helped drive the American economy out of recession last year, but growth had slowed in recent months. The manufacturing index rose to 60.4 in April, the highest level since June 2004. The index had bottomed out at 32.5 in December 2008, the lowest since June 1980.
The jump in October could ease concerns that companies are almost through rebuilding their stockpiles -- a trend that appeared to be slowing factory output growth in recent months.
''The U.S. manufacturing sector is getting a second tail wind,'' Mr. Green said.
Manufacturing activity in China also improved last month. A survey affiliated with the government said its measure rose to 54.7 in October, from 53.8 in September.
Brian Bethune, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said China's growth was important for the United States economy. China's manufacturing sector is critical to the rest of Asia's economy, and the region as a whole is a leading destination for American exports.
Still, much of the America's economy's health depends on consumer spending, and the gains in manufacturing cannot be sustained unless that picks up.
In the construction sector, the Commerce Department said residential activity and government projects helped offset weakness in commercial projects. Spending on building projects rose 0.5 percent in September after having fallen 0.2 percent in August to the lowest point since July 2000.
Even with the small September gain, construction activity remains 34 percent below the peak in 2006, when builders were enjoying a boom in residential housing. That boom turned into a bust that helped drag the country into a severe recession.
The Commerce Department said Monday that personal spending rose at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in September. That was below the 0.5 percent gains recorded in July and August. Incomes fell 0.1 percent in September, after a 0.4 percent rise in August that had been pushed higher by the return of extended unemployment benefits.
The weak growth in spending and the slide in incomes underscored how fragile the economy remained. Consumers facing high unemployment remain reluctant to spend.
The drop in incomes was the first decline since incomes fell 0.3 percent in July 2009. The August gain had been skewed by the reinstatement of an extended unemployment benefits program, which had temporarily lapsed in July after Republicans had blocked an extension.
Consumer spending is watched closely because it accounts for 70 percent of total economic activity.
The government reported Friday that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter. That was only slightly better than 1.7 percent growth in the second quarter.
Many economists say they believe that growth in the October-December quarter will be little changed from the third period.
Consumer spending helped lift third-quarter growth. It was the best showing since a 4.1 percent rise in consumer spending at the end of 2006, before the recession hit.
Monday's report, however, suggested the strength occurred in July and August and that spending slowed considerably in September.
The savings rate fell to 5.3 percent in September, the lowest rate since August 2009. But it is still above the 2.1 percent average savings rate for all of 2007.
An inflation gauge tied to consumer spending rose a slight 0.1 percent in September and was flat after excluding volatile food and energy.

HEADLINE: Low-Cost Dental Care Ignites Wide Debate

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN

 BODY:
In remote northwestern Alaska, where dental decay is rampant, some of Stephanie Woods's patients suffered from toothaches for months on end -- ''raging toothaches with swelling,'' she said in an interview, ''something that you or I would go that day and have it taken care of.''
But these patients just lived with the pain. ''They thought it was part of everyday life,'' she said. 
Ms. Woods is not a dentist. She is one of 14 certified dental therapists in Alaska, the only state where nondentists may perform extractions and administer fillings.
The therapists, who receive two years of training, help fill a vacuum: Alaska has long had trouble attracting and retaining licensed dentists. Sixty percent of Alaska Native children ages 2 to 5 have untreated decay, and 20 percent of Native adults over 55 have no teeth at all.
But the American Dental Association, the nation's leading dental society, opposes the use of nondentists for ''irreversible procedures'' -- including drilling and extraction -- citing patient safety.
''If you have a person suffering from pain, that person has advanced disease,'' said Dr. Raymond Gist, the association's president. ''I would want that person to see a licensed dentist without delay.''
Now a two-year foundation-supported study has reignited the debate over which practitioners are qualified to provide dental care, especially to underserved populations in high-poverty areas. It found that Alaska's dental therapists provide ''safe, competent, appropriate'' care. (The therapists refer cases beyond their scope to supervising dentists.)
The study, financed by the W. K. Kellogg, Rasmuson and Bethel Community Services Foundations, examined the work of dental therapists in five rural Alaskan communities. The positive results are consistent with findings from overseas, where dental therapy programs are well established, said Dr. Mary Williard, a dentist who directs the therapist training program for the nonprofit Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.
Ten other states, including Connecticut, are considering midlevel dental provider systems for underserved residents. These practitioners can be trained for relatively little money, said Dr. Allen H. Hindin, who is on the board of the Connecticut State Dental Association.
Partly for that reason, he said, the topic has become a ''turf issue'' -- not just economic, but ''intellectual and cultural.''
Unlike Alaska, Connecticut has no shortage of dentists. But Dr. Bruce J. Tandy, the state association's immediate past president, agreed that dentists were wary of losing patients to midlevel practitioners. ''Many dentists don't understand how these individuals are going to be used,'' he said, ''so they feel threatened.''
In fact, he said, the midlevel providers ''can be trained to do certain simple procedures safely,'' and they would most likely work in public health clinics, seeing patients whom ''most dentists will never see in their offices.''
Still, the American Dental Association -- which went to court five years ago in an unsuccessful attempt to block the Alaska program -- is firm in its opposition. Dr. Gist, the group's president, rejected the accusation that dentists fear a loss of income or status if midlevel practitioners are widely allowed. ''We don't consider that it has merit,'' he said.
He noted that the association favored increased Medicaid payments for dental work and said that dentists routinely donated services to needy populations.
The association says a better solution for the underserved population is its own new program of community dental health coordinators, who perform teeth cleaning and other noninvasive procedures, educate people about dental health and connect patients with licensed dentists for further care.
Moreover, the association argues, the Alaska study has little relevance for other states. Remote areas there are typically reached by airplane, boat or snowmobile; rural residents of other states, the association said in a statement, ''are accustomed to driving hours to reach a shopping or entertainment destination and can be expected to travel similar distances to reach a dentist.''
But Dr. Williard, in Alaska, called that argument misguided.
''Would I be satisfied to think that I would have to drive five hours with a 3-year-old in the car to get care?'' she asked. ''No, I would prefer to have care closer to home. I'm not sure that statement is really in touch with the populations in those areas.''

To the Editor:
''With Time Short, Parties Advance Last Argument'' (front page, Nov. 1):
The Republicans will almost surely regain control of the House and make serious inroads in the Senate on Election Day. But when they wake up bleary-eyed on Wednesday morning they will be faced with the same impossible choices that President Obama and the Democrats have been trying to deal with for almost two years now -- a high unemployment rate, an unwinnable war in Afghanistan, an education system crumbling as fast as the antiquated buildings our children attend school in and deficits of monumental proportions.
I've listened carefully to G.O.P. and Tea Party candidates tell the public what they will do if elected -- cut taxes, reduce the deficit and cut spending -- but little is said about how they will accomplish this. 
It will be very interesting to see Representative John A. Boehner wield the gavel as speaker of the House, and Senator Mitch McConnell pursue his ''single most important thing'' for the next two years: making Barack Obama a one-term president.
The real losers, no matter the outcome of the midterm elections, will be the American people.
Henry A. Lowenstein New York, Nov. 1, 2010
To the Editor:
The midterm elections are not simply moves on a board game, in which at the end of the evening on Nov. 2 you fold up the board and put it and all the pieces back into a box. The reality is that the winning candidates will need to cast votes in Congress.
Will they be beholden to the special interests that financed their campaigns, or be guided by Lincoln's words, ''A house divided against itself cannot stand''?
Voters, when you cast your ballot on Tuesday, consider who will govern best, representing the needs and the rights of ''We the People.''

Re ''Can the Dude Abide?,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, Oct. 31):

Re ''A Surge in Democratic Spending'' (news article, Oct. 30):
While the increase in Democratic spending could help in some close races, it may very well be too little too late.
This was the first election campaign since the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court, and it's clear to me that my voice matters very little when compared with the clout of American Crossroads, organized by Karl Rove, or the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
How can my contributions of $20 or $25 compare with the millions of dollars coming from groups that are not required to disclose their identities or agendas?

Re ''Drowning in Campaign Cash'' (editorial, Oct. 31):
Special interests, emboldened by a Supreme Court decision on campaign spending, are investing increasingly larger sums to polarize politics. Their paid-for ''free speech'' ads deliver inflammatory sound bites appealing to emotion and fear, not sound thought.
We see innuendo, few facts and a simple agenda that hides the real motives of greed and power. This is a condition that will become chronic and make good government unworkable.
Let us remove special-interest money from government. Fund all campaigns, from local dogcatcher to president of the United States, through taxpayer dollars only -- no other support permitted.
No candidate, no officeholder, would receive a dime from special interests and 501(c) groups.
Arthur H. Gunther Blauvelt, N.Y., Oct. 31, 2010
To the Editor:
Your editorial ''Drowning in Campaign Cash'' is akin to complaining about the symptoms of a disease rather than investigating the pathology.
Money in politics preys on our fecklessness. The real problem -- in spite of the billions we spend on education, 24-hour news and electronic everything -- is a citizenry that is incapable of disciplined reasoning. Instead, Americans are moved by attack ads, innuendo and hyperbole.
Until we commit ourselves to the hard work of fact-checking and adopt an open-minded approach to political and social issues, we will get what we deserve.

HEADLINE: Currency Policy of China Big Topic for G-20 Session

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Currency tensions will top the agenda when leaders of the Group of 20 economic powers gather in South Korea next week, days after midterm elections in the United States and a crucial decision by the Federal Reserve on new steps to prod along the slow recovery.
In their fifth meeting since the global financial crisis transformed the G-20 into one of the most significant forums for international economic cooperation, the leaders will try to bridge tensions between the United States and China that have profound effects on Europe, Japan and big emerging markets like Brazil and India. 
''The G-20's sense of common purpose, which drove agreement on financial regulatory reform in November 2008 and consensus on economic recovery measures in April 2009, has foundered on political realities,'' in the United States and China, said Daniel M. Price, who helped organize the 2008 meeting here as President George W. Bush's representative.
The G-20 meeting, on Nov. 11-12 in Seoul, is part of a larger Asian trip by President Obama, and probably the most significant part of the trip from a policy perspective.
The Obama administration will bring to the table lofty goals: an agreement on curbing the global economic imbalances -- too much spending, borrowing and importing by some nations and too little by others -- as well as a hope that China will permit greater flexibility in the value of its currency, the renminbi.
American officials have indicated that they believe a multilateral discussion on imbalances would be a more fruitful strategy than a head-to-head confrontation with China, which has been increasingly outspoken in defending its currency policy.
On Monday, China's Commerce Ministry accused the Federal Reserve of contributing to the currency tensions.
The Fed is expected to announce Wednesday a new round of quantitative easing, a strategy intended to lower long-term interest rates through the purchase of Treasury securities.
''The continued and drastic U.S. dollar depreciation recently has led countries including Japan, South Korea and Thailand to intervene in the currency market, intensifying a 'currency war,' '' the Commerce Ministry said in a report posted on its Web site.
In a briefing with reporters, Michael Froman, the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, tried to manage expectations for the meeting.
''We do not expect the China currency issue or the imbalance issue to be solved once and for all in Seoul,'' he said. ''This is part of an ongoing effort.''
Lael Brainard, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, said the American delegation led by Mr. Obama would emphasize that the global recovery would be enhanced by greater balance.
''For too long, the American consumer was the engine of growth for the entire global economy,'' she said.
''That pattern of growth, we have seen, was unsustainable. As we act here to address those imbalances by repairing our balance sheets, boosting our national saving, and investing in U.S. competitiveness to achieve the president's export goals, other nations that have relied excessively on exports must act to boost their domestic demand or we will all risk lower overall growth,'' she added.
Without naming China, Ms. Brainard made it clear that the United States believed Beijing was exacerbating the currency frictions.
At a preparatory meeting on Oct. 22-23 in Gyeongju, South Korea, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, unsuccessfully proposed to his fellow G-20 finance ministers that each member agree to limit the surplus or deficit on its current account -- the broadest measure of trade and investment -- to 4 percent of gross domestic product.
The International Monetary Fund estimates that the United States will have a current account deficit of 3.2 percent of G.D.P. this year, and China a current account surplus of 4.7 percent.
On Monday, Ms. Brainard played down the 4 percent proposal.
''We actually don't think targets per se -- a target, per se, is appropriate,'' she said.
Instead, she spoke of ''indicative guidelines'' that would define ''a range of sustainability'' for each country's current account balance.
If a country had large, sustained imbalances ''outside those ranges,'' she said, it would ''trigger an assessment, a peer-review mechanism.''
The G-20 has given the I.M.F. the job of monitoring the big economies' compliance with the ''framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth'' that the G-20 endorsed in Pittsburgh in September 2009.
The I.M.F. seems ready to take on that role, but its managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, cited the United States on Monday in a speech arguing that inequality had contributed to global economic instability.
''In too many countries, inequality increased and real wages stagnated -- failing to keep up with productivity -- over the past few decades,'' he said at the International Forum on Human Development in Agadir, Morocco. ''Ominously, inequality in the United States was back at its pre-Great Depression levels on the eve of the crisis.''
But Mr. Strauss-Kahn also broadly endorsed the goal of rebalancing.
''With savings in the United States and elsewhere unlikely to return to precrisis levels, the old model is dead,'' he said.
''The surplus countries must shift from an external to an internal growth engine, relying more on domestic demand, and letting the middle classes come into their own.''
In practice, that means that countries like China should improve social protections, so that their citizens do not need to save as much as they do now; invest in infrastructure; and reduce their dependence on exports -- the advice American officials are advocating.

HEADLINE: Debt Panel Pauses Until After Elections

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The bipartisan debt-reduction commission that President Obama created eight months ago will begin meeting privately soon after Tuesday's elections, with just three weeks to try to agree on cutbacks to Americans' favorite tax breaks and benefit programs.
The group, which has a Dec. 1 deadline for recommending how to reduce the annual deficits swelling the federal debt, purposely has done little to date beyond five public hearings, and it has decided nothing lest any decisions leak and blow up in the flammable mix of a campaign year with control of Congress in the balance. 
Amid that partisan backdrop, people in both parties say they have been surprised that the 18-member National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform reached an early consensus to put all three major budget parts on the table: taxes, annual spending for domestic and military programs, and the entitlement benefit programs Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
Still, given Republicans' opposition to tax increases and Democrats' to changes in benefits, expectations are low that any plan can get the 14-vote supermajority required to send it to Congress for a vote in December. Advocates' best hope seems to be that the co-chairmen -- Erskine B. Bowles, president of the University of North Carolina system and a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, and Alan K. Simpson, a former Senate Republican leader from Wyoming -- can negotiate a package that attracts a sizable minority of the 10 Democrats and 8 Republicans and provides a framework for future bipartisan action.
''We're going to put a very serious proposal out there that lots of people will find areas to pick at,'' Mr. Bowles said. ''But in total it will address this deficit problem that we face, and will lay a predicate out there for what the country has to do to get its fiscal house in order.''
Mr. Obama's executive order establishing the commission set medium and long-term goals. He called for balancing the budget in the 2015 fiscal year, excluding interest payments for the national debt. That would require reducing that year's nearly $800 billion deficit by more than $250 billion, based on current projections. Because the economy remains fragile, Mr. Bowles said no spending cuts or revenue increases should take effect before 2012.
Commission members say they are more focused on their other charge to ''meaningfully improve the long-run fiscal outlook,'' by limiting the growth of entitlement programs and closing the gap between spending and taxes.
A long-range focus ''means you can phase things in much more effectively and you won't impact this recovery,'' said Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, a Republican member.
Mr. Bowles has suggested that perhaps two-thirds of total deficit reduction come from spending and the rest from new revenues. The panel is not considering higher income tax rates given Republicans' resistance. It is exploring ways to shave the roughly $1.2 trillion annual cost of ''tax expenditures,'' the tax breaks for individuals and businesses.
Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan, who could become chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee if Republicans regain a House majority, is working with Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, the Senate Budget Committee chairman, on ideas for overhauling the tax system. Some members say that reducing tax breaks could raise revenues and allow lower income tax rates for corporations and individuals, much like legislation that Mr. Gregg has sponsored.
''There's no question that there's tax credit spending that is wasteful just like there's spending that's wasteful,'' said Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma.
Mr. Coburn cited a tax incentive for corn-based ethanol, calling it ''a stupid idea'' that inflates food costs and wastes energy. But it, like others, has protectors in Congress -- including anyone considering entering Iowa's presidential caucuses someday.
Four of the most expensive tax expenditures also are the most popular. Those are deductions for mortgage interest, state and local taxes, and charitable giving and the exclusion from income taxes of the cost of employer-provided health insurance. One option would be to keep such breaks but reduce them or phase them out, supporters say. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group of policy experts, has proposed changes to save $1.7 trillion over a decade.
Yet powerful lobbies for the housing industry, unions, charities and more stand guard. Their opposition stopped cold Mr. Obama's proposal to raise $300 billion over a decade by limiting deductions to 28 percent for high-income individuals in the 33 percent and 35 percent brackets.
Spending for the entitlement programs Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security is nearly half the federal budget and increasing. While the health programs are growing fastest, the dozen members of Congress on the commission do not want to reopen debate on them so soon after the battle over Mr. Obama's health insurance overhaul.
''There is health care fatigue,'' said Alice M. Rivlin, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and budget director for Congress and President Clinton.
While Mr. Bowles and Mr. Simpson will propose health policy changes for the commission's deliberations, Social Security is getting more of the members' attention. Republicans are more inclined to scale back future retirees' benefits than are Democrats, especially since liberal groups have mobilized in opposition. Especially controversial is the idea of raising the retirement age for full benefits; currently it is being increased gradually to 67 under a 1983 law.
Other options include less generous formulas for both initial benefits and annual cost-of-living increases for retirees in future decades. Democrats say any compromise to assure Social Security's solvency for the next 75 years would have to include increased payroll tax revenues as well as changes in benefits. The likeliest revenue option would raise the cap on wages subject to payroll taxes, now $106,800.
Both sides agree that they cannot make enough cuts in all other federal spending -- the ''discretionary'' spending that Congress decides annually -- to make a big dent in projected deficits. That category is smaller than entitlement programs as a share of the federal budget, is growing more slowly and yet covers the full range of government operations from education to warfare.
To Democrats' surprise, some Republicans are taking aim at military spending.
David M. Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell International and a Republican commission member, noted in a recent speech that military spending increased 87 percent over the past decade, 145 percent if war costs are included. And Mr. Coburn has been as critical of Pentagon excesses as Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, a liberal Democrat.

HEADLINE: In Air Cargo Business, It's Speed vs. Screening, Creating a Weak Link in Security

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER and ERIC LIPTON; Jad Mouawad, John F. Burns and Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting.

 BODY:
It is an essential lubricant of the global economy -- the multibillion-dollar air cargo industry, which every day carries millions of express packages of every shape and size around the world, parcels that can include things as diverse as an electronic component and a human body part.
But the discovery last week that terrorists had used United Parcel Service and FedEx to ship two explosive devices has set off a debate over what can be done to improve cargo security without damaging a business built on getting packages anywhere, quickly and cheaply.
The Obama administration is expected to announce measures soon to tighten the screening of air cargo, an area long viewed by experts as a weak link in post-9/11 security procedures. But several transportation experts say that placing a 100 percent screening requirement on cargo carriers -- like the one that now exists for cargo placed on passenger airlines -- would cause the system of express air delivery to grind to a halt. 
Those experts note that most shipments carried by air -- about 80 percent -- come from frequent customers who have longstanding relationships and security programs in place. The greatest risks, they say, involve ''one-off'' packages by random customers, like the recent explosive-laden shipments from Yemen headed to Chicago that initially eluded detection.
''You cannot stop the flow of time-sensitive air freight,'' said Yossi Sheffi, the director of the Center for Transportation and Logistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''It is simply not realistic.''
Officials at the Transportation Security Administration declined Monday to discuss what new steps might be imposed. But aides on Capitol Hill said they expected the Obama administration to demand physical inspection of certain ''high risk'' cargo carried on all-cargo flights, particularly shipments coming from nations where terror groups are known to operate, like Yemen.
The administration is also considering demanding more notice about the contents on cargo flights bound for the United States, so officials can perhaps intervene to request additional screening before a flight takes off. The current requirement for cargo manifests is four hours before the flight is scheduled to arrive.
Experts say air cargo poses unique dilemmas because of the vast volume of packages and the patchwork system of regulations governing inspections. In addition, air cargo moves both on airlines that carry only freight and on passenger planes. And the freight industry is by no means uniform. There are giant players like FedEx and U.P.S. and hundreds of small companies.
For now, freight carried on all-cargo planes does not have as stringent screening requirements as freight on passenger planes. Also, foreign carriers that bring cargo into the United States operate by their own sets of rules, which vary significantly from country to country.
''The issue is you don't have a seamless set of standards that apply globally from end to end in the global network with the same level of sensitivity,'' said Robert W. Mann Jr., an aviation industry expert in Port Washington, N.Y.
Still, T.S.A. officials emphasized Monday that even with the latest incident, air cargo security has improved in recent years, as demanded by Congress, particularly on domestic passenger flights, where cargo is now always inspected for threats before it is loaded.
''We have taken significant steps to strengthen the security of international air cargo,'' John S. Pistole, the T.S.A. administrator, said in a statement. ''T.S.A. will continue to evolve our security procedures.''
Every day, 20 million pounds of cargo, or 16 percent of the total freight carried by air into or out of the United States, are transported by passenger planes, according to the International Air Cargo Association. The vast majority, or 84 percent, is carried on cargo planes.
''Screening all these packages is not as easy as screening passengers -- it's a much more difficult thing to do and do effectively,'' said Edmund S. Greenslet, the publisher of The Airline Monitor, an industry trade publication. ''It's the weak link in the whole airline system.''
The air cargo system is built into the way many companies do business. Medtronic, the world's biggest producer of medical devices, for example, built a distribution center near a FedEx hub in Memphis to send out thousands of devices like spinal implants and heart pacemakers daily to hospitals worldwide.
The way cargo is packed also makes it difficult to inspect. For example, many containers of goods headed to the United States arrive at airports shrink-wrapped and are given an exemption from the inspection requirement, said Stephen M. Lord, director of homeland security and justice at the Government Accountability Office.
And American transportation security officials do not do enough to ensure that the inspections that foreign governments or air carriers conduct are rigorous enough to find explosive material about to be loaded onto passenger flights, Mr. Lord said.
''They still have work to do to meet the existing mandate,'' he said. ''And that means there is a remaining vulnerability on air cargo.''
Several European countries said Monday that they would suspend all cargo shipments from Yemen, with Britain also restricting shipments from Somalia. Germany halted all Yemeni passenger flights as well.
Theresa May, the British home secretary, said the government would work with the aviation industry and with the manufacturers of airport screening equipment ''to devise a sustainable, proportionate, long-term security regime'' that would meet the new terrorist threat to air cargo shipments.
Britain also said air passengers would not be permitted to carry on ink cartridges weighing about a pound, the size of those used in the plot. Both bans are to be in place, at first, for a month.
Union officials representing pilots who fly cargo planes said the security of those planes needed to be improved.
''We believe that current standards in air cargo screening are inadequate,'' said Brian Gaudet, a spokesman for the International Pilots Association.
Devices exist that would allow cargo companies to scan for explosives every container about to be loaded into the hold of an airplane, even without unloading the containers. But a single one of these machines -- which use a technology known as pulsed fast neutron analysis -- can cost more than $10 million, and five to 10 minutes are needed to check each shipment, industry officials said, a crippling cost given the thousands of different departure points globally for cargo.
There are simpler options -- bomb-sniffing dogs or small hand-held devices that can pick up traces of explosives.
During the height of the international drug trade years ago, cargo shippers developed security algorithms to better identity suspect packages sent by occasional customers or individuals, said Mr. Sheffi, from M.I.T.
Such algorithms use factors like a package's origin, its destination and the cost of a shipment relative to the value of the object shipped, he said. Mr. Sheffi said he thought similar methods were being used today with packages that might have been sent by terrorist groups.
Brian Clancy, a managing director at Logistics Capital and Strategy, a financial and strategic advisory firm based in Arlington, Va., said: ''No system is ever going to be perfect, and the tricky part is knowing what to look for.''

HEADLINE: A Banker Unafraid to Disagree

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT
EVEN people who have known Axel A. Weber for years are not quite sure why he has breached European Central Bank etiquette -- and dimmed his chances of becoming Europe's top central banker -- by discussing policy spats outside the clubhouse.
As the default favorite to succeed Jean-Claude Trichet as president of the bank a year from now, the safe path for Mr. Weber would simply be to keep a low profile. Instead, Mr. Weber has stridently voiced his dissent on decisions that most on the bank council have made since May to combat the European sovereign debt crisis.
Normally, little inside information escapes the conference room high in the European Central Bank headquarters, where members of the governing council meet twice a month around a large doughnut-shaped conference table.
Does Mr. Weber, now the president of the Bundesbank, not want Mr. Trichet's job? Is he simply not able to keep his views to himself? Or is he simply making sure that European heads of government know exactly what they are getting if they put him in charge of monetary policy for the countries that use the euro? 
''My own judgment is that he is certainly not making it easier to select him for the job,'' said Jan Pieter Krahnen, a professor of finance at Goethe-University Frankfurt and director of the Center for Financial Studies.
''He clearly states that 'I will not be an easy person to deal with. With me you will not get a dependent central bank,' '' said Mr. Krahnen, who was co-director with Mr. Weber of the center from 1998 to 2002.
Mr. Weber surprised analysts and investors when, in May, he made it clear he did not support the E.C.B.'s unprecedented decision to buy government bonds to slow a sell-off of Greek government debt and other troubled sovereign paper.
Mr. Weber surprised them again when -- despite the furor his first round of comments provoked -- he repeated his criticism last month during a speech in New York, where he called on the E.C.B. to end the so-called Securities Markets Program.
''As the risks associated with the S.M.P. outweigh its benefits, these securities purchases should now be phased out permanently,'' Mr. Weber argued. In fact, the E.C.B. has not bought any bonds in the last three weeks, though it has not formally ended the program.
Just last week, during a speech to an audience of business executives in Frankfurt, Mr. Weber split from Mr. Trichet again. Siding with Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, he argued that in future debt crises, bond investors should have to share the costs when a government gets in financial trouble, rather than leaving taxpayers with the bill.
That same day in Brussels, Mr. Trichet had argued that talk of making investors pay would only unsettle bond markets and complicate efforts to deal with the current crisis.
''I wish that in the future, the E.C.B. would speak with one voice,'' Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister of Luxembourg and head of the so-called euro group, complained to the German newspaper Die Welt in an interview published Monday.
Mr. Weber also seems to have annoyed Mr. Trichet, who almost never publicly criticizes his colleagues. Since taking office in 2003, Mr. Trichet has toiled for consensus among the members of the council.
That was no mean task, given that most are themselves presidents of their countries' central banks, with their own administrations to command and constituencies to serve.
Asked about Mr. Weber's comments by the Italian newspaper La Stampa last month, Mr. Trichet said, ''There is only one single currency; there is one governing council, only one monetary policy decision, and one president, who is also the porte-parole of the governing council,'' using the French word for spokesman.
There are signs that other countries are seizing on Mr. Weber's behavior to try to block his appointment. French newspapers reported last month that President Nicolas Sarkozy of France now considered Mr. Weber unacceptable.
But there are few other obvious candidates who would pass political muster and also possess the stature and intellect to do a job that could be the most powerful in Europe.
Mario Draghi, governor of the Bank of Italy, has raised his profile recently as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, a panel based in Basel, Switzerland, that has a mandate from the Group of 20 countries to make proposals for a more resilient financial system. Mr. Draghi has stuck to the E.C.B. hymn sheet in his public comments but could suffer from having worked as vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International from 2002 to 2005. The investment bank helped Greece mask the true extent of its financial problems.
Other candidates, like Nout Wellink, president of the Bank of the Netherlands and chairman of a prominent panel that is rewriting global banking regulations, are dark horses. Germany, as the largest financial contributor to the euro zone, inherently has a strong claim to supply the next E.C.B. president. Mr. Trichet is French and his predecessor, Wim Duisenberg, was Dutch.
The decision on who succeeds Mr. Trichet will have wide significance for the European economy. If leaders choose Mr. Weber, a militant on price stability issues, there would be an effect on bond prices, bank lending and other investment decisions tied to the inflation rate.
If investors expect inflation to be low, bond yields could fall and banks could become more willing to lend. But investors might also expect interest rates to rise, which would raise borrowing costs and make it more difficult for countries like Greece to solve their debt problems.
''If you get a president like Weber, that is a clear signal that there is absolutely no way we will be giving up on the inflation front,'' said Silvio Peruzzo, a euro area economist at Royal Bank of Scotland. ''The market reaction will be quite quick.''
Among people who know Mr. Weber, the most likely explanation for his vocal dissent is simply that he feels too strongly about some issues to keep quiet.
''He is a man who honestly speaks his opinion,'' said Jurgen von Hagen, a professor of economics at the University of Bonn, where Mr. Weber taught from 1994 to 1998. ''I think he is truly worried about the independence of the E.C.B.''
A stocky 53-year-old and father of two who wears his dark hair slicked back, Mr. Weber spent most of his career as a university professor, teaching in Bonn, Frankfurt and Cologne. He became president of the Bundesbank in 2004 after serving on the German government's council of economic experts, an influential advisory body.
As co-director of the Center of Financial Studies, Mr. Weber pushed for more interchange between the academic community and banks, which had avoided each other. He was crucial in organizing an annual conference that brings E.C.B. policy makers together with professors and analysts who focus on monetary issues, requiring the camps to confront one another in person.
''Some professors sit critically on the sidelines,'' Mr. Krahnen said. ''This was not Axel's position. He was more into dialogue, research with practical applications.''
Though he enjoys a vigorous debate, Mr. Weber is not dogmatic, Mr. Krahnen said.
''He listens, he argues,'' Mr. Krahnen said. ''He is not like other people I have seen in senior positions who basically don't question their own views.''
''He has always been, as far as I can remember, a very outspoken person and not the diplomat you see in these positions,'' he added.
While Mr. Weber enjoys wide respect for his intellect, some question whether that lack of diplomacy could be a liability. Certainly Mr. Weber would be a very different E.C.B. president compared with Mr. Trichet, a lifelong civil servant known for decorum.
''It is a good thing to have an internal debate,'' said Marie Diron, a former E.C.B. economist who now provides advice on economic issues to Ernst & Young, the consulting firm. ''But once the decision is taken, debate is harmful. It increases volatility in the markets, which is not helpful.''

HEADLINE: Major Technical Difficulties

 BODY:
Behind closed doors in Washington, American officials are shaping an overhaul of the 1994 federal statute that requires phone and broadband carriers to ensure their networks can be wiretapped.
Based on a chilling recent precedent, the risk is substantial that this so-called technical updating will spread far beyond what's said to be contemplated -- and greatly expand the already expansive power of the government to spy on Americans. Congress should be especially cautious about the scope of the revision. 
The precedent is the 2008 amendment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. While it also needed updating to keep pace with technology, the Bush administration added measures that sanctioned spying without a warrant, without suspicion, and without court approval. Retroactively, it gave legal cover to more than five years of the administration's illegal spying. Congress turned those provisions into law.
The Obama administration has no similar tracks to cover, but the risks of executive overreach are still there. It's essential for Congress to be deliberate about providing a check on the executive branch and striking a balance with other American interests.
In September, The Times reported that officials were ''preparing to seek sweeping new regulations for the Internet,'' so that all communications services -- e-mail transmitters like BlackBerry, social networking Web sites like Facebook, peer-to-peer providers like Skype -- will be able to comply with a wiretap order as online communications increasingly replace phone calls.
Last month, The Times reported that it's not just new technologies that officials are focusing on, it's those already covered by the 16-year-old law, like phone and broadband carriers, because they ''have begun new services and made system upgrades that caused technical problems for surveillance.''
The government's contention is that it seeks only to maintain its ability to conduct surveillance so that it can engage in legitimate spying via new technologies with the same proficiency that it can via old ones. If the goal were as straightforward as that, it would be difficult to challenge. Despite its abuses, wiretapping has long been accepted as a tool of law enforcement when used properly.
The problem is that the hub-and-spoke design of phone and broadband communication is very different from the decentralized design of the Internet -- and even more so from peer-to-peer connections. If, as some experts say, requiring Internet providers to be able to unscramble encrypted messages or intercept any transmitted communication also calls for them to function like centralized carriers, the shift will reverse what made the Internet -- and made it a fount of economic growth.
The huge scale of the potential disruption underscores how little we know about why this overhaul is needed. Officials have recounted how some carriers have been unable to carry out wiretap orders and how the F.B.I. has spent tens of millions of dollars to help fix the problems. But there is no public data about how often a communication service's technical makeup thwarts surveillance approved by a court. Congress must understand why these changes are so pressing before it considers the likely major new legal requirements needed to ensure that new technologies can be wiretapped.

HEADLINE: Where Do Democrats Go Next?

BYLINE: By EVAN BAYH. 
Evan Bayh, a Democratic senator from Indiana, is retiring from the Senate in January.

 BODY:
Indianapolis
DEMOCRATS can recover from the disappointments of this election and set the stage for success in 2012. But to do so we must learn from Tuesday's results.
Many of our problems were foreseeable. A public unhappy about the economy will take it out on the party in power, even if the problems began under previous management. What's more, when one party controls everything -- the House, the Senate, the White House -- disgruntled voters have only one target for their ire. And the president's party almost always loses seats in midterm elections.
Nonetheless, recurring patterns of history, broad economic forces and the laws of politics don't entirely account for the Democrats' predicament. To a degree we are authors of our own misfortune, and we must chart a better path forward. 
It is clear that Democrats over-interpreted our mandate. Talk of a ''political realignment'' and a ''new progressive era'' proved wishful thinking. Exit polls in 2008 showed that 22 percent of voters identified themselves as liberals, 32 percent as conservatives and 44 percent as moderates. An electorate that is 76 percent moderate to conservative was not crying out for a move to the left.
We also overreached by focusing on health care rather than job creation during a severe recession. It was a noble aspiration, but $1 trillion in new spending and a major entitlement expansion are best attempted when the Treasury is flush and the economy strong, hardly our situation today.
And we were too deferential to our most zealous supporters. During election season, Congress sought to placate those on the extreme left and motivate the base -- but that meant that our final efforts before the election focused on trying to allow gays in the military, change our immigration system and repeal the George W. Bush-era tax cuts. These are legitimate issues but unlikely to resonate with moderate swing voters in a season of economic discontent.
With these lessons in mind, Democrats can begin to rebuild. Where to start?
First, we have more than a communications problem -- the public heard us but disagreed with our approach. Democrats need not reassess our goals for America, but we need to seriously rethink how to reach them.
Second, don't blame the voters. They aren't stupid or addled by fear. They are skeptical about government efficacy, worried about the deficit and angry that Democrats placed other priorities above their main concern: economic growth.
So, in the near term, every policy must be viewed through a single prism: does it help the economy grow?
A good place to start would be tax reform. Get rates down to make American businesses globally competitive. Reward savings and investment. Simplify the code to reduce compliance costs and broaden the base. In 1986, this approach attracted bipartisan support and fostered growth.
The stereotype of Democrats as wild-eyed spenders and taxers has been resurrected. To regain our political footing, we must prove to moderates that Democrats can make tough choices. Democrats should ban earmarks until the budget is balanced. The amount saved would be modest -- but with ordinary Americans sacrificing so much, the symbolic power of politicians cutting their own perks is huge.
Democrats should support a freeze on federal hiring and pay increases. Government isn't a privileged class and cannot be immune to the times.
The most important area for spending restraint is entitlement reform. Democrats should offer changes to the system that would save hundreds of billions of dollars while preserving the safety net for our neediest. For instance, we could introduce ''progressive indexation,'' which would provide lower cost-of-living increases for more affluent Social Security recipients, or devise a more accurate measure of inflation's effects on all recipients' income.
Democrats should also improve legislation already enacted. Health care reform, financial regulation and other initiatives were first attempts at solving complex problems, not holy writ. The administration's grant of sensible exemptions to the health care bill, permitting some employers to offer only basic coverage, is an example of common-sense, results-oriented fine-tuning.
If President Obama and Congressional Democrats were to take these and other moderate steps on tax reform, deficit reduction and energy security, they would confront Republicans with a quandary: cooperate to make America more prosperous and financially stable, running the risk that the president would likely receive the credit, or obstruct what voters perceive as sensible solutions.
Having seen so many moderates go down to defeat in this year's primaries, few Republicans in Congress will be likely to collaborate. And as the Republicans -- including the party's 2012 presidential candidates -- genuflect before the Tea Party and other elements of the newly empowered right wing, President Obama can seize the center.
I'm betting the president and his advisers understand much of this. If so, assuming the economy recovers, President Obama can win re-election; Democrats can set the stage for historic achievements in a second term. The extremes of both parties will be disappointed. But the vast center yearning for progress will applaud, and the country will benefit.

HEADLINE: The Cotton Squeeze

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Synthetic linings. Smaller buttons. Less Italian fabric. And yes, even more polyester. Unusually high cotton prices have apparel makers scrambling to keep down costs, but consumers be warned: cotton clothing will be getting more expensive.
''It's really a no-choice situation,'' said Wesley R. Card, president and chief executive of the Jones Group, the company behind Anne Klein, Nine West and other brands. ''Prices have to come up.''
The Bon-Ton chain is raising prices on its private-label fashion items by as much as a dollar this spring, and prices will go up further next fall. And it is switching from 100 percent cotton in items like sweaters to more acrylic blends. Levi's says it has already increased prices and may push them further north next year. And Hanesbrands, the maker of Champion, Hanes and Playtex, says price increases will be in place by February, and prices could go up further if cotton prices remain where they are. 
Other apparel makers say they have held the line on prices this year, but next year will be different. The V. F. Corporation, the maker of 7 for All Mankind and The North Face, says most brands will probably cost more next year, and its cotton-heavy jeans lines are particularly susceptible to increases. Jones says its increases could be in the high single digits or more.
The problem is a classic supply and demand imbalance, with the price of cotton rising almost 80 percent since July and prices expected to remain high. ''World cotton production is unlikely to catch up with consumption for at least two years,'' said Sharon Johnson, senior cotton analyst with the First Capital Group, in an e-mail.
Cotton inventories had been low because of weak demand during the recession. This summer, new cotton crops were also depleted because of flooding in Pakistan and bad weather in China and India, all major cotton producers.
But demand from China, in particular, was rising. And as the economic recovery in the United States began, apparel makers and retailers placed orders for more inventory, spurring even more demand. As prices rose, speculators entered the market, driving prices even higher.
''So far, it has shocked even the most veteran traders,'' said Mike Stevens, an independent cotton analyst in Mandeville, La., in an e-mail. ''It has resulted in panic buying by mills worldwide in order to ensure that they can keep their doors open.''
As of Tuesday morning, the price of cotton (measured by cotton futures for December delivery) had hit a record high on worries that cold weather in China might have damaged some crops.
Cotton's swooping increase has some apparel companies switching production to countries with lower labor costs or milder customs charges. Lululemon Athletica, the sportswear company, is moving some manufacturing from China to Vietnam, Cambodia and Bangladesh, where wages are lower, and Bon-Ton is benefiting from reduced-duty production in Egypt and Nicaragua.
Manufacturers are also thinking smaller, examining whether a button or a thread can be replaced with a cheaper one, or whether the overall material mix can be changed so it is not so cotton heavy.
''They are taking purchase orders from the retailer and having this conversation with them, saying, 'Look, I can't deliver this garment for a dollar this year when it cost me a dollar twenty-five to make it up,' '' said Andrew Tananbaum, the chief executive of Capital Business Credit, which finances apparel makers and other importers. '' 'So would you take this garment if it had not cotton but acrylic?' ''
Mr. Card, of the Jones Group, said the company had ''whole teams'' looking for more cost-effective materials that did not reduce quality. ''That's all they do,'' Mr. Card said.
Liz Claiborne, which makes brands like Juicy Couture and Kate Spade, said it is also playing with some of the materials it uses. One example, said Jane Randel, a spokeswoman, would be shifting from some imported Italian fabrics to ''suppliers who produce their own raw materials or yarns.'' The company may also reassess its contracts for so-called component materials -- like buttons and trims -- she said in an e-mail.
At Bon-Ton, retail prices for the private-label clothes have increased about 5 to 8 percent so far this year, said Steve Villa, senior vice president of private brand at the company. Bon-Ton has been turning to different formulations, including sweaters blended with different rayons and synthetic fibers, to avoid further increases.
''At some point, you adopt a different process that maybe will yield some cost savings or you are faced with passing that through,'' Mr. Villa said.
Of course, as apparel makers increase the price of cotton goods and also try to reduce their reliance on cotton, there are some risks.
For starters, neither the apparel makers nor the retailers are certain that shoppers will be willing to pay more for cotton goods. ''It's an unanswered question at this point,'' said Robert K. Shearer, chief financial officer of the V. F. Corporation.
And -- to the disfavor of many fashion purists -- with prices unlikely to fall for some time, there could be wider popular acceptance of fabrics like polyester.
''We may be training a new generation to be far more accepting of synthetic fibers, which is likely to hurt cotton's market share in the long run,'' said Ms. Johnson, the analyst with the First Capital Group.

HEADLINE: 5 Options For Congress To Cut Taxes

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Bush tax cuts expire in 58 days.
If Congress does not take action before then -- Dec. 31 -- taxes will go up for nearly all households. That has the potential to cause both political and economic problems. So Congress, even a lame-duck, repudiated Congress, is likely to act.
But what will it do? 
Given the mood of the voters, the outcome will probably be closer to the Republicans' wishes (extending all the tax cuts) than President Obama's (extending all the cuts for households making less than $250,000 a year while allowing most of the cuts for households above that threshold to expire). Yet Democrats may still have enough sway to force some negotiation.
Here are five compromises worth considering, on what will be the first big order of business for Congress after the election:
FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY The tax cuts will be an early test of whether members of Congress meant what they said about the deficit during the campaign.
The cuts represent a huge share of the country's medium-term deficit. Letting them all expire would bring in $260 billion a year over the next decade -- which would go more than halfway toward getting the deficit down to a level economists think is sustainable. Of that $260 billion, the cuts that both parties favor account for about $200 billion. The cuts for the affluent make up the remaining $60 billion.
One option for Democrats is to accept the cuts for the affluent only if they are offset with deficit savings elsewhere. In the current political environment, an obvious place to look for savings is discretionary spending, which is all federal spending except for interest payments and entitlements like Medicare and Social Security.
Cutting earmarks, those pet projects of members of Congress, in half would save $8 billion a year. Canceling NASA's missions to the moon and Mars would save $4 billion. Reducing farm subsidies could save $10 billion. Cutting wasteful weapons programs could save tens of billions -- and, intriguingly, some Tea Party-backed candidates, like Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative Paul Broun of Georgia, say they favor military cuts.
CLOSE LOOPHOLES Another way to cut the deficit is to reduce something known as tax expenditures. These are the loopholes, deductions and credits that allow businesses and households to avoid paying many taxes.
The rising number of tax expenditures is the reason the tax code has become so maddeningly complex. In all last year, they cost the federal government $1.05 trillion. To put that in perspective, the sum total of all personal income taxes paid was only $915 billion.
Politically, expenditures are a promising target, because reducing them seems to be the one way Republicans are open to a tax increase. Why? Many in the party consider expenditures to be -- as the name suggests -- a form of spending. ''If Congress is serious about cutting government spending,'' as Martin Feldstein, the Republican economist, has written, ''it has to go after them.''
The trick will be to avoid cutting expenditures that benefit the middle class and poor while cutting taxes for the wealthy, thus aggravating income inequality. Among the possibilities suggested by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a research group, are the tax exclusion for individual income earned abroad (which costs $6 billion a year); oil and gas subsidies ($3 billion); and special tax treatment of Blue Cross and Blue Shield ($700 million).
Whatever the details, any spending cuts or tax increases could be delayed for a few years, to avoid the risk of making a weak economy weaker.
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS If anything, the best near-term move is to cut taxes further and to spend more. Unfortunately, extending all the Bush tax cuts is not likely to help the economy much, given that the well-off save more of their income than other households. Just consider what happened after the Bush cuts became law: job losses continued for another two years and growth after that was mediocre.
Mr. Obama recently backed several traditionally Republican ideas, like business tax cuts, that would probably do more to create jobs. He has also called for spending on highways and other infrastructure. Packaging these proposals with the Bush tax cuts could give the economy a needed lift.
A MILLIONAIRES TAX Right now, the 400,000th dollar earned by a surgeon is taxed at the same 35 percent marginal rate as the four millionth dollar earned by a hedge-fund manager. This makes little sense, and it runs counter to how the tax code worked for much of the 20th century.
The top brackets once distinguished between the merely affluent and the truly rich. In 1960, for example, the top marginal rate (of 91 percent) started at $400,000, which is the equivalent of almost $3 million today.
Congress could take a small step back in this direction by extending all the Bush tax cuts for households making less than $1 million a year. At the same time, though, a new tax bracket would start at $1 million. The marginal tax rate could be 39 percent, which was the top rate under Bill Clinton. The Financial Times recently endorsed such a plan. It would probably cost something like $30 billion a year, rather than the $60 billion for extending all the upper-income cuts.
Lest you worry about millionaires, they'd still be doing just fine. They would indeed get to keep part of the Bush tax cut -- that part that applied to their first million dollars of income. Their total federal tax rate would still have fallen far more in the last three decades than the rate for any other group. And millionaires have received much larger pretax raises over that time than the middle class or the poor.
A TACTICAL RETREAT If all these compromises fail, a final possibility remains. Congress could permanently extend the tax cuts for households making less than $250,000 a year and temporarily extend -- maybe for two years -- the upper-income cuts. True, this would not do much to reduce the deficit or help the economy. But it would increase the odds that the upper-income cuts would eventually disappear.
As you may have heard, the country is facing an enormous long-term budget deficit. Every year that the Bush tax cuts are extended makes that deficit all the larger.

HEADLINE: More Resigned Than Angry, Voters Seek a Fix for the Economy

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON; Reporting was contributed by Damien Cave from Florida, Erik Eckholm from West Virginia, Dan Frosch and Kirk Johnson from Colorado, Ian Lovett from California, Kevin Sack from Georgia, Susan Saulny from Illinois, Katharine Q. Seelye from Wisconsin, A. G. Sulzberger from Iowa, Sabrina Tavernise from Delaware and Katie Zezima from New Hampshire and Maine.

 BODY:
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Want to know what's wrong with this country? Just ask everyone.
''Anybody in business knows you can't have debt like this,'' said Marty Yanke, 76, a retired meat processing plant supervisor from Waunakee, Wis., who said he voted for Republicans.
Walter Sankey, 57, who lives in a working-class neighborhood of Columbus and chose all Democrats, said, ''You can't expect changes in two years for what took eight years to screw up.''
Joe Nguyen, a construction subcontractor in Orlando, Fla., said, ''Nobody is listening to the people, especially small-business people.'' 
And so it went Tuesday. In urban elementary schools, country churches and suburban recreational centers across the United States, worried voters talked of wanting to find the right mix of political leaders to lift the nation out of its economic crisis.
The mood at the polls was more about grim resignation than anger. Certainly, issues like immigration, war and education reform mattered to people, including Rafaela Suarez, who voted in East Los Angeles.
''There are six kids in my house,'' Ms. Suarez said. ''I want them to have a future.''
But with friends and relatives out of work, neighboring houses in foreclosure and their own savings accounts to consider, voters put fixing the economy first. And if that meant voting in ways that seemed out of the question two years ago, so be it.
Kathleen Morse, a homemaker from Epping, N.H., described herself as a centrist-leaning independent, but this time she voted for anyone with an R next to his or her name. ''I just went with it,'' Ms. Morse said. ''I mean, it can't be any worse.''
Marcia Rutledge, 71, supported a measure that would allow a casino in western Maine, despite her opposition to gambling. ''I know it's addictive,'' Ms. Rutledge said, ''but it will give some people up in that area work.''
Even at the student union at Ohio State University, young voters were more preoccupied with the economy than with war or social issues.
''I've got to find a job, and the way it's going I don't know that I'm going to,'' said John Breedlove, 22, a business student who supported President Obama in 2008 but backed Republicans on Tuesday.
The solution for many voters was to throw the bums out -- but replace them with whom? That answer was less clear.
''I'm not voting for what I think will be a great winner,'' said Lee Esker, 35, a finance director at a medical research center in Chicago, having just marked his ballot for the Republicans. ''I think I'm caught between the parties, and I'm voting for the lesser of two evils.''
Gina Duncan, 52, a Democrat who voted for Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida, a former Republican now running as an independent for the Senate, did so reluctantly. ''I was looking for candidates who can cross the aisle and get things done,'' Ms. Duncan said.
To be sure, some voters stood firmly behind President Obama. ''We haven't given Obama enough time, and we're rushing to judge his administration on a lot of issues that were out of his control,'' said Emily Pechar, 22, who voted in the Fulton County suburbs north of Atlanta. ''Obama's become a scapegoat, and that's not appropriate.''
Others saw the president and the lawmakers who supported his ambitious early agenda, including the health care overhaul and his stimulus plan, as clear villains. The country, many voters said, was veering dangerously to the left and needed to return to the center.
But many voters could not find solace anywhere. Mark Munn, a boilermaker from Savannah, Ga., whose three children attend a private Christian school, has sometimes voted for conservative Democrats, but he has not seen one in a while. Republican candidates, Mr. Munn said, have too many ties to big-money interests, even though he agrees with their social policies. The Tea Party is not a good fit, either.
''I'm just not comfortable with any of them,'' he said.
Still other voters were so hungry for change that experience did not seem to matter. Fifty-seven percent of the registered voters surveyed as part of a New York Times/CBS News poll released late last week said that this year they were more willing to take a chance on a candidate with little previous political experience.
John Nicholson, 69, a registered independent who voted at the Church of God in Camden Wyoming, Del., preferred Christine O'Donnell, the Republican nominee for Senate, mainly because she had never been in politics before. ''Everybody thinks she's ditzy, but she can learn like anyone else,'' Mr. Nicholson said. ''You have to give people like that a chance.''
Unlike the 2008 election, when liberals celebrated the politics of hope and change to address the country's problems and some conservatives began to embrace what would become the Tea Party's brand of revolution, Tuesday's contests were underscored by a deep sense of malaise on all sides.
''Things just don't feel right in the country right now,'' said Damon Gillette, 44, a business owner in Denver.
Adding to the grim feel in many polling places was the realization that the most expensive midterm election in history -- a record $3.8 billion was spent -- brought what appeared to be a new low in civil discourse, voters said.
''These elections have been a freak show all over the country,'' said David Morgan, a retired Air Force officer, in Beckley, W.Va. His wife found the campaigns so distasteful that she refused to vote.
Many voters just pleaded for the bickering to stop.
Tony Perelli, 75, of Chicago's South Side, who said he had voted reluctantly for all Democrats, considers himself a middle-of-the-road voter. But middle-of-the-road candidates were elusive. Instead, he found himself buried in rhetoric from both ends of the political spectrum.
''I'd like to get to the bottom of what's really right for this country, and that's kind of hard while they're all calling each other names,'' Mr. Perelli said.
Steve Bachar, 45, an investment manager in Denver, echoed that view. He said his biggest hope for the months ahead centered on one word: pragmatism. ''The political discourse in the course of the past several years has gotten so that both parties are talking past each other,'' he said.
It was a feeling echoed by Carla Kaiser, who was laid off by an insurance company and relied on unemployment checks. She is scared about the economy and politicians who might want to feed off the fear of people like her, who are enduring hard times.
''We as Americans need to pull together,'' she said. ''We need to stop looking at the Democrats and the Republicans and just look at the problems.''

HEADLINE: Late Voting Delays Results For Connecticut Governor

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Thomas C. Foley, a wealthy Republican businessman, and Dannel P. Malloy, a former Democratic mayor of Stamford, were locked in a tight race to become Connecticut's next governor, according to preliminary returns early Wednesday.
By 3 a.m. Wednesday morning, partial returns showed that Mr. Foley had 50.5 percent of the vote, to Mr. Malloy's 47.8 percent, with Mr. Foley's edge growing.
However, that did not stop Mr. Malloy from claiming victory shortly after 1 a.m. -- sort of. Speaking to a jubilant throng of supporters in Hartford, Mr. Malloy said: ''It appears we may enjoy victory tonight.'' 
He then hedged, saying: ''I fully acknowledge the rights of individuals to contest the numbers. I'm pretty certain we're going to be O.K.''
But Mr. Foley did not concede a thing. In fact, just a few minutes later, he spoke to a crowd of somber supporters in his hometown of Greenwich, and said: ''We are quite confident we will win.''
The uncertainty was compounded by voting hitches in Bridgeport, the state's largest city. A ballot shortage in the city, which is heavily Democratic, led a Superior Court judge to order that the polls stay open there an extra two hours until 10 p.m.
By 1:30 a.m., Mr. Foley was clinging to a three-percentage-point advantage, with 78 percent of precincts reporting. But votes in the state's biggest cities -- Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven , all Malloy strongholds -- had not yet been tabulated. As a result, Democrats were privately expressing confidence that Mr. Malloy would win.
Mr. Malloy, 55, had promoted his efforts to revitalize Stamford, the state's fourth-largest city. And with solid union support in a traditionally Democratic state, he led by as much as double-digit margins in early surveys.
But Mr. Foley, who was an ambassador to Ireland under President George W. Bush, poured almost $10 million of his own money into the race, outspending Mr. Malloy by two to one. He also pledged something that Mr. Bush's father once won notoriety for promising: no new taxes.
Whoever wins will succeed M. Jodi Rell, a Republican who decided not to run for re-election. Though Connecticut has voted mostly for Democratic candidates for president, United States Senate and state legislature, no Democrat has won a governor's race since William A. O'Neill was re-elected in 1986.
The next governor will most likely be joined by a full slate of Democrats in Hartford. In preliminary returns, Democrats held solid leads in the races for attorney general, comptroller, secretary of state and treasurer's office, as well as most of the state legislature.
Mr. Malloy was better known at the start of the race. He had run for governor in 2006, losing in the primary to John DeStefano. And in the primary this year, he upset Ned Lamont, who made national news in 2006 by beating Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in a Senate primary.
A former Brooklyn prosecutor with a reputation as an energetic and, at times, overly aggressive politician, Mr. Malloy tried to portray Mr. Foley as beholden to the kind of trickle-down economics that may have benefited Mr. Foley's neighbors in Greenwich, but not most of the state's residents.
Mr. Foley appealed to the kinds of disaffected Democrats and independents who helped to torpedo dozens of Democratic candidates around the country. He emphasized his first-time candidacy as a virtue to help tame a $3 billion budget deficit, and attract more jobs. He also featured his second wife, a Yale-educated lawyer, and his son, a Harvard undergraduate, in recent television ads, trying to convince voters that he was a family man.
One wild card was the death penalty. The state had been riveted by the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted last month for his part in a home invasion in Cheshire in which three residents were killed. Like most Connecticut residents, Mr. Foley supported the death penalty, but Mr. Malloy did not.
But in the end, exit polling suggested that nearly 90 percent of voters were worried about the nation's economic future.

HEADLINE: California Rejects Marijuana Legalization as Nation Votes on Issues Big and Small

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
OAKLAND -- California voters rejected a ballot initiative on Tuesday that would have legalized marijuana for recreational use, but disappointed supporters of the measure lighted up anyway outside their campaign headquarters here and vowed to continue pushing for a day when cannabis is treated like tobacco and alcohol, not heroin and cocaine.
''There will be a few tears shed,'' said Gregory Lyons, 63, a pastry chef who worked the phones throughout the day on Tuesday to rally support for the measure. ''Demonizing a plant doesn't make sense.'' 
Added Jeremy Daw, 30, who was puffing on a lengthy spliff as the returns came in: ''I feel deflated.''
Across the country, voters in dozens of states weighed in not just on candidates but on all matter of issues large and small, more than 150 of them in all. In Rhode Island, voters decided not to change the name of the state, which is officially ''Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.'' Arizona put an end to affirmative action programs. Oklahoma made English its official language. There were municipal initiatives as well, including a zany one in Denver that called on the city to set up a ''extraterrestrial affairs committee'' to look into UFOs.
The marijuana initiative would have allowed licensed retailers to sell up to one ounce at a time, with no doctor's note required, to those over the age of 21. Advocates of legalization argued that it was already easier for young people to get a marijuana cigarette than a cigarette or beer.
''They can get it more easily than alcohol, more easily than tobacco,'' said Hanna Dershowitz, a lawyer and mother of two from Southern California who backed the cannabis initiative. ''Drug dealers don't ask for ID.''
Legalizing marijuana, advocates had argued, would have had the added benefit of generating tax revenue and helping reduce the violence caused by Mexican organizations that traffic in illegal drugs. ''When was the last time Coors Lite did a drive-by shooting on Budweiser because they didn't like their marketing?'' asked Nate Bradley, a former police officer who supported the measure. But opponents carried the day with their argument that lifting the ban on marijuana would translate into increased usage of the drug. Already, a recent change in the law categorizes possession of small amounts as an infraction, the lowest level of offense.
And even some marijuana smokers did not like the idea of cannabis, long a symbol of the counterculture, being regulated. ''I don't want Anheuser-Busch handling pot or to have to buy Marlboro marijuana,'' said Shaun Ramos, 29, who spent Tuesday morning sticking ''No on Prop 19'' posters on light posts in downtown Oakland, only to see them quickly removed by supporters of legalization. ''This is all about corporate control.''
Tuesday's legalization effort was not the first attempt to decriminalize cannabis. California voters had rejected a similar legalization effort in 1972 and over the last decade voters in Alaska, Colorado, Nevada and South Dakota had all said no to marijuana.
Medical marijuana initiatives have fared better, with more than a dozen states allowing cannabis for those who get permission from their doctors. But voters in South Dakota rejected a measure allowing medical marijuana in that state, and Arizona appeared poised to do the same. Voters in Oregon, where about 40,000 people legally use medical marijuana, rejected a measure to set up state-regulated dispensaries.
The vote on legalizing marijuana in California was closely watched, especially in Mexico, where the government is engaged in a violent battle with drug traffickers who grow marijuana and sneak the profitable herb in bales across the border.
Also in California, voters rejected a measure to suspend the state's curbs on greenhouse gas emissions while the economy was in the doldrums. Largely financed by out-of-state oil companies, the initiative sought to tap into voters' economic woes to roll back landmark environmental legislation approved in 2006 that called for the state to curb emissions by 15 percent by 2020.
''This the first time ever that there's been such a huge referendum on climate change and clean energy policy,'' said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. ''This sends a clear message that people want a clean energy future.''
In Washington state, voters rejected an initiative creating the state's first income tax, exclusively on individuals who earn more than $200,000. It was backed by Bill Gates Sr., father of the Microsoft founder who is the country's richest man. In Massachusetts, voters endorsed wiping out the sales tax for alcohol, but rejected rolling back the 6.25 percent sales tax to 3 percent.
Three ballot measures in Colorado that would have cut the state income tax and sharply restricted government borrowing and property taxes for schools were overwhelmingly defeated. Voters also rejected an antiabortion amendment to the Colorado Constitution that would have conferred rights ''to every human being from the beginning of the biological development.''
In Arizona and Oklahoma, voters approved measures aimed at preventing President Obama's health care legislation from going into effect. Colorado voters rejected a similar measure.

HEADLINE: Tide Turns, Starkly

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
Somewhere along the way, the apostle of change became its target, engulfed by the same currents that swept him to the White House two years ago. Now, President Obama must find a way to recalibrate with nothing less than his presidency on the line.
The verdict delivered by voters on Tuesday effectively put an end to his transformational ambitions and left him searching for a way forward with a more circumscribed horizon of possibilities. Facing a hostile House with subpoena power and a diminished majority in the Senate, he will have to figure out the right blend of conciliation and confrontation to reassert authority and avoid defeat in 2012.
The most pressing question as Mr. Obama picks through the results on Wednesday morning will be what lessons he takes from the electoral reversals. Was this the natural and unavoidable backlash in a time of historic economic distress, or was it a repudiation of a big-spending activist government? Was it primarily a failure of communications as the White House has suggested lately, or was it a fundamental disconnect with the values and priorities of the American public? 
''He will read the results carefully and hear the messages the American people are sending,'' David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, said in an interview. ''I think he'll do that with care and with humility. But he's also very centered, and his impulse is to focus on what we do next and how we respond in a way that's constructive.''
Mr. Obama remained out of sight Tuesday night, watching the returns in the White House residence with his family, but he plans to hold a news conference on Wednesday afternoon to call on the country to put the divisive elections behind it and forge bipartisanship for a new era, aides said. He will soon invite leaders of both parties to meet to develop a common agenda to fix the economy and tame the deficit.
But fresh from their victories, Republicans may have little incentive to defer to Mr. Obama. ''The American people have sent an unmistakable message to him tonight and the message is: change course,'' Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the putative new Republican speaker, said Tuesday night. In the days leading up to the election, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said ''the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.''
The viability of the new political order in Washington will get a swift test when Congress returns to town for a lame-duck session this month. Mr. Obama may have to give ground and agree to at least a temporary extension of expiring tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, not just the middle class as he favors. He will be pressured to show that he is serious about reining in government spending.
Beyond the near term, the president appears likely to turn to more incremental initiatives in Congress and more aggressive use of his own executive authority to advance his agenda. In a recent interview, Mr. Obama listed areas where he thought he might be able to work with a new Congress: reforming immigration, curbing deficit spending and overhauling education.
''The president is somebody who knows he's not going to have his way on these things, that he needs Republicans and he has the ability to reach out to them,'' said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, the most prominent Republican in the administration.
At the same time, much of Mr. Obama's time may be spent on the defensive, fending off efforts by House Republicans to repeal or refuse to finance the health care program he pushed through this year. Of course, he will still have a relatively free hand in foreign policy, as he will demonstrate by leaving town on Friday for a long-delayed trip to Asia.
Mr. Obama finds himself in a similar position to his two most recent predecessors, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, each of whom endured a midterm election that handed Congress to the opposition. While distinguished by different factors, each of those elections was cast as a referendum on the president. Thirty-seven percent of voters in exit polls on Tuesday said they cast their vote to express opposition to Mr. Obama, compared with 24 percent who said they were trying to support him -- almost identical to the numbers for Mr. Bush four years ago.
Mr. Clinton responded to his party's 1994 losses by tacking to the middle and cutting deals with Republicans on welfare while outmaneuvering them during a government shutdown. With the Iraq war effort flailing, Mr. Bush fired Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld the day after the 2006 election, but battled with Democrats over war spending and other issues.
Strategists on both sides said the lessons of the past offered only limited utility. As politically toxic as the atmosphere in Washington was in the 1990s, the two sides appear even more polarized today. The Republicans may be more beholden to a Tea Party movement that abhors deal cutting, while Mr. Obama has not shown the same sort of centrist sensibilities that Mr. Clinton did and presides in a time of higher unemployment and deficits.
''I know President Clinton. President Clinton was an acquaintance of mine. Obama is no President Clinton,'' said former Representative Dick Armey of Texas, who as House Republican leader squared off against Mr. Clinton at the time and today is a prime Tea Party promoter. ''Personally, I think he's already lost his re-election.''
That remains to be determined, but he can expect a rough two years. If nothing else, both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush saw what can happen when the other side gets subpoena power. Legitimate oversight and political fishing expeditions can both take their toll.
''Even when carefully managed, these investigations can be distracting to senior White House officials,'' said W. Neil Eggleston, who was a White House lawyer under Mr. Clinton and later represented an aide to Mr. Bush during a Congressional inquiry.
Still, Mr. Obama wields the veto pen, and his Democratic allies in the Senate will provide a firewall against Republican initiatives. The possibility of gridlock looms. And in the White House, there is hope that Republicans descend into fratricide between establishment and Tea Party insurgents, while Mr. Obama presents himself as above it all.
Former Representative Tom Davis, Republican of Virginia, said it was hard to see Mr. Obama finding common cause with Mr. Boehner or Mr. McConnell, the Republican leaders.
''Obama's denigrated Boehner and McConnell by name -- not very presidential,'' Mr. Davis said. Moreover, both sides will have to answer to partisans on the left and the right with little interest in compromise.
''There's going to be a lot of posturing to the base,'' Mr. Davis said. ''I think it's going to be ugly, at least at first.''

HEADLINE: Election 2010

 BODY:
Voters in Tuesday's elections sent President Obama a loud message: They don't like how he's doing his job, they're even angrier at Congressional Democrats and they gave the House back to the Republicans. The Republicans spent months fanning Americans' anger over the economy and fear of ''big government,'' while offering few ideas of their own. Exit polls indicated that they had succeeded in turning out their base, and that the Democrats had failed to rally their own.
Americans who voted described themselves as far more conservative than they did in 2006 and 2008 -- and than the population as a whole. More than 4 in 10 said that they supported the Tea Party movement. But more than half of the conservatives said they have an unfavorable view of the Republican Party. 
The question is: Will either side draw the right lessons from this midterm election?
Mr. Obama, and his party, have to do a far better job of explaining their vision and their policies. Mr. Obama needs to break his habits of neglecting his base voters and of sitting on the sidelines and allowing others to shape the debate. He needs to do a much better job of stiffening the spines of his own party's leaders.
He has made it far too easy for his opponents to spin and distort what Americans should see as genuine progress in very tough times: a historic health care reform, a stimulus that headed off an even deeper recession, financial reform to avoid another meltdown.
Mr. Obama has a lot of difficult work ahead of him. The politics in Washington will likely get even nastier. Before he can hope to build the minimal bipartisan consensus needed to move ahead, Mr. Obama will have to rally more Americans to the logic of his policies.
The question for the Republicans now is whether they are going to bask in triumphalism or get down to the real work of governing. It is one thing to pander and obstruct when you are out of power. With a divided government, it won't take long for voters to demand that they explain their plans.
John Boehner, the likely speaker of the House, has not provided a clue of how his party will begin to cut the deficit, which Republicans say is their top priority. One of the few specific promises he has made would dig an even deeper hole: extending all of the Bush-era tax cuts.
And exit polls suggested that even these more conservative voters get what the Republican Party leadership still doesn't: that there is no way to tackle the deficit and slash taxes at the same time. Only 19 percent said cutting taxes was the top priority for the next Congress.
Anticipating a big win on Tuesday, leading Republicans haven't been talking about substance, only more obstructionism. Mr. Boehner said the other day that the president was welcome to support Republican programs. But as for Mr. Obama's agenda, he said, ''We're going to do everything -- and I mean everything we can do -- to kill it, stop it, slow it down, whatever we can.''
Mike Pence, the No. 3 Republican, said there would be ''no compromise'' on repealing the health care reform law and permanently extending all Bush-era tax cuts, including for the wealthiest Americans.
A Republican majority in the House of Representatives should pursue Republican priorities. But what we have been hearing sounds disturbingly like what we heard after the 1994 election, when Newt Gingrich, then the speaker-to-be, announced that there would be no compromising on his agenda.
The result was gridlock. The Republicans shut down the government, which ultimately cost Mr. Gingrich his job and the Republicans their majority.
One thing is very clear from all the polls and all the voting: Americans are fed up with that sort of gamesmanship. It's bad for the country.

HEADLINE: Japan Recalls Ambassador In Island Dispute With Russia

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Ellen Barry contributed reporting from Moscow.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- A diplomatic clash between Japan and Russia over disputed islands intensified on Tuesday when Japan summoned home its ambassador to Moscow, a day after President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia angered Tokyo by visiting one of the islands.
Russian officials said they were perplexed by Japan's response and upped the ante by saying that Mr. Medvedev was planning a return trip to the islands. 
''This morning, I spoke to Dmitri Anatolyevich Medvedev, who expressed his satisfaction with his trip to Kunashir,'' said Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, during a news conference in Oslo, referring to the island called Kunashiri by Japan. ''President Medvedev also said that he plans to visit the other islands.''
Mr. Medvedev's trip to the island, which sits at the southern end of the Russian-controlled Kurile Islands chain, was seen as a diplomatic snub in Tokyo, coming just weeks after Japan seemed to suffer a setback in a territorial dispute with another neighbor, China.
In that standoff, Japanese prosecutors released a Chinese trawler captain who had been arrested near a different group of disputed islands after Beijing raised the pressure by detaining four Japanese businessmen and cutting off high-level talks.
Japan's foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, said the nation's ambassador to Russia would return to Tokyo to brief officials on Mr. Medvedev's visit on Monday to one of the disputed islands, which were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Russia will not recall its ambassador in Japan to Moscow.
Both sides confirmed that Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Mr. Medvedev would still meet, as planned, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Yokohama, Japan, next week.
''We will say what we ought to say,'' Mr. Maehara said, ''but our intention to aim for settling the territorial dispute with Russia and conclude a bilateral peace treaty to boost our two nations' economic ties remains unchanged.''
Mr. Kan has tried unsuccessfully to hold a formal meeting with Chinese leaders since the standoff over the trawler captain in September. The arrest set off anti-Japanese protests in China, while Beijing's strong response prompted Japanese leaders to reassess their nation's growing economic dependence on China.
On Tuesday in Beijing, a Chinese spokesman rebuffed an offer by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to mediate the dispute. The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ma Zhaoxu, also criticized Mrs. Clinton for saying that the islands, known as the Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese, fall under the protection of Washington's security pact with Tokyo.
''The dispute over the islands with Japan is a matter between China and Japan,'' Mr. Ma said in a statement, and the United States should ''correct its wrongful stance immediately.''
Japan's dispute with Russia has divided the two countries for more than half a century, preventing them from signing a formal peace treaty to conclude World War II. Russia refers to the disputed islands as the Southern Kuriles, while Japan calls them the Northern Territories.
Mr. Medvedev is the first Russian or Soviet leader to visit the disputed islands, and he made it clear that despite Japan's demands, Russia had no plans to cede the territory, which is rich with minerals and fish.
''There are so many beautiful places in Russia!'' wrote Mr. Medvedev on his TwitPic page, under a photograph he had taken during his visit to the island the Russians call Kunashir.
The visit clearly shored up Mr. Medvedev's popularity at home, at a moment when his approval ratings are -- for the first time in his presidency -- equal to those of Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin.
As soon as Japan's prime minister warned Mr. Medvedev against making the trip, in September, he had to go through with it, said Konstantin V. Remchukov, editor of the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, in a radio commentary.
''If President Medvedev wants to be president after 2012, then he should show the domestic conservative electorate that he makes up his own mind about where he flies,'' Mr. Remchukov said.

HEADLINE: In Governors Races Across the Country, Republicans Make Gains

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Katharine Q. Seelye contributed reporting from Middleton, Wis., A. G. Sulzberger from Des Moines and Emma Graves Fitzsimmons from Chicago.

 BODY:
On an Election Day with one of the largest number of governors races in memory, Republicans gained governorships across the country, including those in the political battlegrounds of the industrial Midwest where Democrats have dominated in recent years.
In Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Republicans seized seats that had been held by Democrats. They also took seats now held by Democrats in other parts of the country, including Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wyoming.
In Wisconsin, a beaming Scott Walker, a Republican, took to a stage and praised all the voters who, he said, had emerged from the woodwork to ''take our state back.'' 
As in so many states, much of the campaign there had focused around job losses, financial woes and state budget troubles, and Mr. Walker, like several of his Republican colleagues, had pledged to cut government waste, reshape government and upend a system that he said had failed. Minutes after his victory became clear, Mr. Walker issued a release that declared: ''Wisconsin is open for business!''
But around the nation, the outcomes are expected to have effects that reach beyond local economic policies or legislation drawn up in statehouses.
States are preparing to carry out their once-a-decade redrawing of political districts -- for the House and state legislatures -- based on United States census counts collected this year, and many of these new governors will have important roles in deciding what those maps look like.
Going into Election Day, Democrats held 26 governorships, while Republicans had 24. Following most midterm elections after the arrival of a new president, the party in power in the White House typically loses some governorships, but the changes on Tuesday appeared to go deeper.
With votes in many states still being counted on Tuesday night, Republicans were already holding on to many of the seats they currently hold -- in Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas and Utah -- as well anticipating significant gains.
''People are not happy with the direction of this country,'' said Terry Branstad, a Republican and former governor who defeated Gov. Chet Culver of Iowa, another state where the economy seemed to overwhelm most other issues. ''The status quo is not acceptable.''
Democrats were hoping that voters might turnout in high numbers and that efforts in the final weeks by President Obama and other Democratic leaders might lessen the damage.
There were certainly some indications of relief for Democrats, in states that included Arkansas, Colorado and California, where Jerry Brown, who has already been Governor, will return to the job having beaten Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay who invested millions in the race.
In New York, too, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo easily defeated the Republican, Carl P. Paladino, even though Republicans were expected to pick up seats in the state legislature and the Congressional delegation. In Massachusetts, Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, beat Charles Baker Jr., a Republican and a former chief executive of one of the state's largest health insurers. And in Maryland, Martin O'Malley, the Democratic governor, fought off a challenge from Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a Republican who had once been governor. But the Republicans' gains in the Midwest were daunting for Democrats, in part because of the size and scope of the shift.
In Wisconsin, Mr. Walker, the county executive of Milwaukee who has promised to shrink government, beat Tom Barrett, the Democratic mayor of Milwaukee. Mr. Walker equated electing Mr. Barrett with giving one more term to James E. Doyle, the current governor whose popularity ratings had become anemic.
In Michigan, where Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat, was barred from seeking re-election by term limits, Rick Snyder, a Republican who stunned the party establishment by beating better-known, more established candidates in a primary, defeated Virg Bernero, the Democratic mayor of Lansing. The issue in the state, which had suffered devastating economic losses even before the recession, was the same as everywhere: jobs and money.
Among the group of new Republican political leaders emerging on Tuesday: Nikki Haley, the nation's first Indian-American female governor, a victor in South Carolina; Susana Martinez, a Republican district attorney who promised to end a pattern of corruption and to block illegal immigrants from getting driver's licenses in New Mexico; and Mr. Snyder, the former head of Gateway Inc., who was elected governor of Michigan with a catch phrase, ''one tough nerd.''
Of the 37 states voting for governor, 24 races were open seats from both parties, thanks to terms limits and to a climate that seemed to discourage some incumbents from seeking re-election.
From Maine to Hawaii, the governors' races had been hard fought, with clear indications, leaders from both parties said, of the same broad national climate that was testing the survival of Democrats -- and incumbents -- for the House and Senate.
In another indication of how voters seemed in search of something, anything, entirely different from the status quo, third-party candidates had a particularly pronounced effect on governors races in at least five states. And in Rhode Island, Lincoln D. Chafee, a former Republican senator who ran for governor as an independent, won on Tuesday.
While much of the attention this season has focused on who will control Washington, the outcomes in these governors' races were drawing particular notice because of redistricting.
The shapes of the political maps can carry lasting effects for partisan victories and losses in all sorts of offices. Governors in at least 36 states get a say in shaping Congressional maps, and governors in 39 states have a place in redrawing state legislative districts.
''This is the most important governors' election in 20 years,'' said Nathan Daschle, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, which devoted $50 million to races this year, three times the amount the group spent four years ago, in the last comparable election. The Republican Governors Association spent $102 million on this year's races.

HEADLINE: Fighting for Majority, Republicans Make Gains in the Senate

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Erik Eckholm contributed reporting from Charleston, W. Va., and Susan Saulny from Chicago.

 BODY:
Republicans improved their lot in the Senate on Tuesday but were foiled by Democrats in a few key states with a high number of independent voters in their bid to capture both houses of Congress.
By adding seats in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Arkansas, Illinois, Wisconsin and North Dakota, Republicans narrowed the gap with Democrats. They maintained control in states like Florida, Kentucky and New Hampshire.
But in some states they had eyed with visions of victory, Republicans came up short -- notably in Nevada, where the majority leader, Harry Reid, eked out a victory over Sharron Angle, and in West Virginia and Connecticut. California, Delaware and Vermont were also triumphs for the Democrats.
In West Virginia, the Democratic governor, Joe Manchin III, defeated the Republican businessman John Raese for the seat once held by the late Robert C. Byrd. Mr. Manchin's victory was widely seen as vital to Democratic control of the Senate. 
''Tomorrow starts the rebuilding of America,'' Mr. Manchin told a jubilant and relieved crowd in downtown Charleston, carrying on with his outsider appeal. ''We acknowledge that Washington is broken,'' he said, pledging to work with any lawmakers who were willing to forget party labels and ''put America first.''
In a closely watched race in Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey, a Republican former congressman, beat Representative Joe Sestak, a Democrat, by a very narrow margin.
Former Senator Dan Coats, a Republican who left the Senate more than a decade ago for a career in lobbying, returned Indiana's seat to his party, while John Boozman became the second Republican from Arkansas to serve in the Senate since Reconstruction, beating the incumbent Blanche Lincoln. In another Republican pickup, Gov. John Hoeven of North Dakota handily defeated Tracy Potter, a Democratic state senator, to fill an open seat previously held by a Democrat.
In Kentucky, the Tea Party candidate Rand Paul prevailed over the state attorney general, Jack Conway, leaving that seat in Republican control after a nasty midterm battle. In Florida, Marco Rubio easily beat both a Democrat and an independent to maintain Republican control of the open seat in Florida.
Mr. Paul, an ophthalmologist and a son of Representative Ron Paul of Texas, was among the Tea Party's first upset victories when he prevailed in the May primary by a large margin to fill the seat vacated by Senator Jim Bunning, who is retiring. His general election campaign was often rocky -- his criticism of President Obama's censure of BP after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and his questioning of some aspects of the Civil Rights Act drew fire.
But Mr. Paul, a prolific fund-raiser, benefited from his decision to largely stop speaking about his positions and, perhaps more important, from the backlash against his opponent, who ran advertisements questioning Mr. Paul's Christianity.
In Florida, Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican turned independent, was forced to mount a fight against both sides of the political spectrum in his race against Representative Kendrick B. Meek, a Democrat, and Mr. Rubio whose fiery star power drew support across a wide a swath of demographic groups, according to exit polls.
In less volatile races, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, held on to his seat, and in South Carolina, the Republican Jim DeMint cruised to victory over the Democrat Alvin Greene, who -- unemployed, indicted and resistant to campaigning -- posed no threat. In Ohio, Representative Rob Portman won the open Senate seat formerly held by his fellow Republican George Voinovich, defeating Lee Fisher, the lieutenant governor.
Yet in spite of enormous spending and an aggressive effort, Republicans were unable to make the sale in several key states, either because those states were far more divided than largely gerrymandered House districts where Republicans prevailed, or because the party nominated candidates who were ultimately unable to close the deal with a more heterogeneous general electorate than the one they faced in the primaries.
In Delaware, Chris Coons, several months ago the Democratic underdog, easily dispatched his unusual Republican opponent, the Sarah Palin favorite Christine O'Donnell.
Yet Democrats were bedeviled in some states that Mr. Obama won in 2008. The strong Republican opposition demonstrated disaffection among the coveted independent voters who broke for Mr. Obama that year.
Further, in contrast to the undoing in the House, which grew like a wave across the country, the Senate races unfolded bit by incredible bit, with a remarkable number too close to call when the polls opened Tuesday.
Early in the primary season, Utah started the mini-trend of incumbents with deep party roots falling to upstarts. It continued into Alaska and Pennsylvania, where a Republican and a Democrat, respectively, were sent packing by their parties. In Alaska, Lisa Murkowski, the Republican and a foe of Ms. Palin, had to resort to a write-in campaign.
In Delaware, the story was similar: although Michael N. Castle was not a Senate incumbent, he was a respected and long-serving Republican congressman who was expected to prevail over Ms. O'Donnell and whichever Democratic nominee emerged. Instead, Democrats were able to maintain a badly needed Senate seat, one that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had occupied for more than 30 years -- and that they had more or less kissed goodbye several months ago.
Some Democrats paid a price with voters for their role in passing the health care bill, which helped to build a sense around the nation, stoked to great effect by Republicans, that a Democratic majority was shoving costly legislation down voters' throats.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, leveraged his savvy with Senate procedure, which helped slow things down and contribute to the image of a do-nothing Senate, and his ability to rally his party around his vision to keep Democrats from enjoying Republican support on legislation.
Across the country, jobs and the economy were foremost among voters' concerns. Nearly half of voters interviewed in exit polls in Florida said they were worried that their home, or that of a relative, would be foreclosed on. More than half said they were very worried about the condition of the national economy over the next year.
In a stinging defeat for Democrats on Mr. Obama's home turf, Mark Steven Kirk, a Republican and longtime member of Congress representing Chicago's affluent northern suburbs, won a narrow victory over his Democratic rival, Alexi Giannoulias, the state treasurer, whom the president had endorsed.
Mr. Obama, who remains popular in Illinois, campaigned for Mr. Giannoulias as recently as last weekend. And that was seen by many political observers here as a boon to Mr. Giannoulias in a contentious, nail-biting race that had been an official toss-up for weeks.
''Losing is not easy,'' said Mr. Giannoulias, who lost his composure for a moment during his remarks at a downtown Chicago hotel. ''It's not something you expect, which is probably why I didn't write a speech.''

HEADLINE: On a Collision Course With an Unlikely Foe: Public Unions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
It was perhaps the most memorable line from Eliot Spitzer's 2006 campaign for governor of New York, a pithy promise as well as a threat: ''Day 1,'' he declared, ''everything changes.''
For Andrew M. Cuomo, it is not Day 1 that may define his tenure as chief executive, but Day 90. That is when two labor contracts will expire for thousands of government workers and Mr. Cuomo's most important, distinctive and unexpected campaign pledge will face a test: Can he confront and outmaneuver the public-sector unions that have dominated politics and budgeting in Albany for decades?
Onstage Tuesday night at the Sheraton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, as Mr. Cuomo basked in his decisive victory over the Republican Carl P. Paladino, he effusively thanked longtime allies from the labor movement, whose money and muscle have been instrumental in his political resurrection.
But at the same time, Mr. Cuomo has telegraphed a message to those union officials that is both grim and urgent: The state is broke, and the era of gold-plated labor contracts is over. 
''There is a crisis,'' he told union leaders throughout the campaign, according to people involved in the discussions. ''You need to rise to the crisis.''
The intractable troubles afflicting Albany -- the tragicomedy of the place, with its routinely indicted lawmakers, the $20,000 sushi bills and the debt-masking budget gimmicks -- are all real and serious. But as the state faces an $8 billion deficit next year, the soaring cost of providing pensions, health care and wages for state workers is the long-term problem that most profoundly needs fixing, watchdogs and economists say.
A spin through some of the sobering figures: Out of an operating budget of $79.2 billion, the state spends about $11 billion on wages for its work force of 220,000. The cost of providing medical insurance for those employees will surge to $2.5 billion from $1.8 billion over the next three years.
By 2015, state pension costs -- which are, by law, set in Albany and underwritten by Democratic and Republican administrations -- will exceed $8 billion a year, compared with $2.6 billion last year, according to a state projection. At the same time, New York has promised more than $200 billion worth of health benefits to its retirees but has set aside almost nothing to pay for them.
In short, Mr. Cuomo argues, the public work force is on a collision course with the state's taxpayers. ''The salaries you are paying and the benefits you are paying are unsustainable,'' he said recently. He has even encouraged business leaders to act as a greater counterweight to unions, encouraging them to, of all things, hire more lobbyists.
Perhaps nowhere else in the country, then, has a Democratic candidate for governor taken such a hard rhetorical line against such a potent constituency within his own party. (Across the Hudson River, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has become a Republican folk hero and an attractive possible candidate for president by excoriating and defying public unions.)
Yet, so far Mr. Cuomo has been strategically vague about what he will actually do, and his options may be limited. By ruling out tax increases, as he has done repeatedly during the governor's race, he has but three likely courses: sizable layoffs; a reduction in pension benefits for new employees; and a major restructuring of the work force, like the introduction of a 40-hour workweek (today, it is 37.5).
All three options are anathema to union leaders, who in interviews said that they trusted Mr. Cuomo and understood the state's dire financial situation, but that they had no intention of giving anything away.
''His policy positions are not aligned with ours,'' said Richard C. Iannuzzi, president of New York State United Teachers, which declined to endorse Mr. Cuomo.
Lillian Roberts, the executive director of District Council 37, a New York City union with thousands of state workers, was even less diplomatic. Mr. Cuomo, Ms. Roberts said recently, was trying to ''put labor in its place,'' and she warned that she was ready for a fight.
Public-sector labor leaders are especially inflamed by Mr. Cuomo's willingness to consider replacing the state's pension system with a defined contribution plan similar to a 401(k), potentially stripping public workers of a guaranteed stream of retirement income.
They grumble that Mr. Cuomo is biting the hand that fed him. Organized labor was crucial to his victory as attorney general in 2006, and it helped him again this year by nudging the incumbent, David A. Paterson, to drop out of the governor's race.
But in private conversations, Mr. Cuomo had made a distinction: This time around, his support was drawn heavily -- and deliberately, it seems -- from private-sector unions, not those representing government workers. The strategy gives him not just the independence to take on government unions, but also the ability, he argues, to prevent the state's unions from coalescing against him.
As Mr. Cuomo tackles the issue, he is likely to dismantle, in ways big or small, the legacy of his father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who significantly expanded the size of the state's work force in the 1980s.
Over the past few weeks, the younger Mr. Cuomo has mailed union leaders a copy of ''The Man Who Saved New York: Hugh Carey and the Great Fiscal Crisis of 1975,'' which depicts how union leaders banded together in the 1970s to prevent New York City from filing for bankruptcy.
Not all the union leaders are rushing to read the book. ''I will try to read it when I get some free time,'' said Ken Brynien, president of the Public Employees Federation, which represents nearly 60,000 employees in New York, and backed Mr. Cuomo.
Edmund J. McMahon, the director of the Empire Center for New York State Policy, which studies the state's finances, said that if Mr. Cuomo could push through the introduction of a 401(k)-style pension system, ''it would be a real Nixon-goes-to-China moment for him.'' The first Democratic governor in the country to do so, Mr. McMahon said, ''would have a real future in national politics.''
Correction: November 5, 2010, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in some editions on Wednesday about union contract negotiations that Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor-elect of New York, must deal with misstated the amount of the state's operating budget. It is $79.2 billion, not $78.2 billion.

HEADLINE: New Support From Independents Fueled G.O.P Gains, Exit Polls Show

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and MEGAN THEE-BRENAN

 BODY:
Democrats lost significant support Tuesday among nearly all demographic groups in a midterm election that was a referendum on President Obama and a Democratic-controlled Congress in a stubbornly weak economy.
Independent voters, who in 2006 mostly voted for Democrats and helped end the Republicans' 12-year majorities in the House and Senate, this time turned just as strongly against Democrats, according to surveys of voters who were leaving polling places. Two other groups who recently supported Democrats -- suburban residents and college graduates -- also gave Republican Congressional candidates more votes this year.
That support was in addition to the Republicans' traditional strong backing from men; white voters; those making more than $100,000 a year; conservatives; white Protestants; evangelicals; frequent churchgoers; and Southerners. Roman Catholic voters, a swing group, favored Republicans after supporting Democrats in the last two elections.
Democrats drew support from their traditional base -- younger voters; blacks and Hispanics; those without high school diplomas and those with post-graduate education; less affluent voters; black women; union members; and Easterners. 
Women have been among the Democrats' most loyal supporters, giving them a majority of their votes in all but one of the past 14 election years. But the size of that traditional advantage appears to have narrowed this year. Since 1982, when exit polls first measured support, Republicans only once received the same share of women's votes as Democrats -- in 2002 -- and Democrats lost their narrow Senate majority that year.
Democrats suffered from defections as the electorate tilted conservative in a year when Republicans were enthusiastic about voting against President Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress. A majority of voters told interviewers they believed that government was doing too much.
Voters who described themselves as moderates preferred Democrats by a significant margin, and liberals preferred them overwhelmingly. But the two groups were outnumbered by conservatives. Moderates were a smaller share of the electorate on Tuesday than they were in 2006.
Moderates' strong preference for Democrats reflected their estrangement from the Republican Party as it came to be dominated by conservatives who were scornful of moderates in the ranks. Republicans' embrace of the Tea Party movement underscored that rupture.
While the survey results were good news for Republicans after two devastating election cycles, there were warning signs for the party's long-term prospects.
The few demographic groups that preferred Democrats included some that are considered significant in the composition of the future electorate. One was voters under age 30. The others were Hispanics and Asian-Americans; both groups, which have objected to the Republicans' tough stands against illegal immigration, are among the fastest-growing constituencies in the country.
The voter surveys confirmed what even the White House had acknowledged before Election Day: Like many Congressional midterm elections, this one was a referendum on the president but at a time when unemployment hovered around 10 percent.
A majority said they disapproved of President Obama's job performance, and nearly 9 out of 10 of them voted for Republicans. About 4 in 10 said one reason for supporting a Republican for Congress was ''to express opposition to Barack Obama.'' About half of voters said the president's policies would hurt the country.
An even bigger share of voters -- nearly three-quarters -- said they disapproved of how Congress had done its job. Those voters chose Republicans by about a two-to-one ratio.
A strong majority agreed with the statement that ''government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals,'' and by a nearly a four-to-one ratio they voted for Republicans.
Six of 10 white voters aligned with Republicans.
The youngest voters (18 to 29) and the oldest (65 and older) were mirror images: 6 of 10 young voters chose Democrats, and the same share of older voters picked Republicans. Voters 65 and older, who have been the least supportive age group of Mr. Obama, are more likely than younger voters to turn out in midterm elections, and this year they made up about a quarter of the electorate, up from 19 percent in 2006.
The economy was by far the most crucial issue. Nearly 9 in 10 said they were worried about the direction of the economy in the coming year, and a majority said the country was seriously on the wrong track. Those voters chose Republicans by large margins. About a quarter of voters said health care or the war in Afghanistan were the biggest concerns facing the country, and majorities of them favored Democrats.
In selecting a Congress that will debate Mr. Obama over deficit reduction and additional stimulus measures, about 4 in 10 voters said reducing deficits should be the first priority, and they favored Republicans. About 4 in 10 said job creation should be a priority, and they favored Democrats. A much smaller share said cutting taxes should be a priority, which Congressional Republicans also favor.
About half of voters said Congress should repeal the health care overhaul; the other half said it should be expanded or left alone. Those who wanted the law repealed voted for Republicans, and the others supported Democrats.
The nationwide surveys of voters were conducted by Edison Research for a media consortium of television networks and The Associated Press.
How the Poll Was Conducted: The Election Day polls were based on questionnaires completed by voters as they left voting places on Tuesday throughout the country. The polls were conducted by Edison Research of Somerville, N.J., for the National Election Pool, a consortium of ABC News, The Associated Press, CBS News, CNN, Fox News and NBC News. National results are based on 16,982 voters in 268 randomly chosen precincts across the United States. These include 1,601 absentee voters and early voters interviewed by telephone. The state results are based on 1,414 to 3,790 voters in 25 to 50 randomly selected precincts across each of 14 states analyzed by The Times. In certain states, some interviews were also conducted by telephone with absentee voters and early voters. In Colorado and Washington, all interviews were by telephone. In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by no more than plus or minus one percentage point nationally, and three to four points in each state, from what would have been obtained by seeking to interview all voters who cast ballots in each of these elections. Results based on smaller subgroups have a larger potential sampling error. In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of voter opinion on Election Day, like the reluctance of some voters to take time to fill out the questionnaire, may introduce other sources of error into the poll. The Times was assisted in its polling analysis by Prof. David R. Jones of Baruch College, City University of New York; Prof. Monika L. McDermott of Fordham University; and Michael R. Kagay of Princeton, N.J.

HEADLINE: Roots of Democrats' Decline Were Laid in Earlier Success

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
Two years ago this week, triumphant Democrats were throwing around the word ''realignment,'' as in the kind of Democratic majority that could endure for a generation or more. Wednesday morning, those same Democrats awoke to find that their majority had not lasted for even another election cycle.
The question that will dominate the conversation among Democrats in the days ahead is how it came to this, especially since Republicans offered little to voters beyond an emphatic rejection of the president's policies. Some Democrats believe they fell victim to the inevitable tide of midterm elections. Others blame the economy, plain and simple, while a growing chorus accuses Mr. Obama of failing to communicate the party's successes. 
The truth is that all these explanations probably played some role in the unraveling -- though, in the case of Mr. Obama's message, the failure may have deeper roots than his critics assume.
Start with the issue of inevitability. It's fair to say that Democrats set themselves up for something of a letdown in 2010 by performing beyond any reasonable standard in 2006 and 2008. Democratic candidates in those back-to-back ''wave elections'' picked up dozens of House seats that had generally trended Republican, including some in states like Indiana and Virginia.
Democrats were bound to lose a significant number of those vulnerable seats during the subsequent midterm cycle, when voters, having had their catharsis, generally feel some buyer's remorse about the incumbent president's party.
Then there's the sluggish economy and its attendant unemployment. As recently as last summer, White House aides were gamely hoping that voters would feel some momentum in the months leading up to the elections. Absent that, the administration was forced to argue a negative -- that is, to claim that the stimulus spending and bank bailouts of 2009 had saved many jobs that otherwise would have been lost.
That brings us to the question of whether Mr. Obama stumbled in making a case for his proposals to right the economy and remake the health care system. The answer may be yes, but if Mr. Obama failed to communicate the urgency of his agenda to the voters, then that failure may have less to do with anything he did in 2010 than with his strategy in 2008.
Mr. Obama ran his presidential campaign much like Republicans ran this one, as a referendum on the status quo. Sure, there was what Sarah Palin calls the ''hopey, changey stuff,'' and plenty of standard talk about affordable health care and clean energy, both of which candidate Obama was for. What there wasn't was much mention of what change would entail, in terms of taxation or deficits. Ending the war in Iraq and rolling back tax cuts for the wealthy, Democrats said, would pay for everything.
No doubt Mr. Obama's team believed there would be plenty of time to make more complicated arguments after the election, when Mr. Obama would be able to reassure and cajole the nation from behind the presidential lectern. But then a couple of things happened to derail that plan.
First, the same wave that carried Mr. Obama to a resounding victory also brought in the largest Democratic majorities in Congress since the 1970s. Suddenly, Democrats, especially in the House, were giddily talking of a liberal renaissance in the land, and they were confident that the electorate had issued a blanket endorsement for whatever new investments they might see fit to make. They weren't inclined to sit around while Mr. Obama went to the voters and asked permission again.
Second, the economic crisis that greeted Mr. Obama was deeper and more jolting than anyone had anticipated, and the White House thought it had little choice but to offer major spending proposals immediately aimed at heading off a depression, even without the benefit of a long public hearing. Mr. Obama's advisers believed that voters would thank them for the hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending once the economy began to rebound, as it inevitably would.
But the economy didn't rebound, and Mr. Obama, beset by crises and absorbed in negotiations on Capitol Hill, never did get around to making a sustained public argument for his most divisive policy choices. The independent voters who had sided with Mr. Obama by a margin of eight points over Senator John McCain, according to exit polls in 2008, drifted inexorably into the Republican camp.
It may be the case, as a lot of Democrats now contend, that Mr. Obama offered an inconsistent pitch over these last several weeks, jumping from a critique of the Bush years (how Republicans drove the national car into a ditch, and so on) to an indictment of campaign cash from outside groups. But it's probably also the case that, by that point, public opinion had hardened. Some 62 percent of voters in exit polls Tuesday said the country was on the wrong track.
If there is a lesson in all this for both parties, perhaps it's that merely piling up votes on Election Day doesn't confer on you a mandate for any ambitious agenda -- unless you have presented the voters with the difficult choices you intend to make. For Republicans, this argues against overinterpreting the meaning of Tuesday's gains. For Mr. Obama, it probably means that the campaign for the next agenda begins right now.

HEADLINE: Republicans Retake House, Ousting Old and New Alike

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
Republicans captured the House Tuesday by ousting powerful Democratic committee chairmen as well as newcomers who faced a voter backlash after supporting an aggressive Democratic legislative agenda for the past two years.
The dozens of Democrats who lost in the economically struggling Midwest include Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, who heads the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Skelton was joined in defeat by Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the chairman of the Budget Committee.
Republicans, who returned to power in the House after four years of Democratic control, won at least 56 seats held by Democrats. They swept away veterans in Indiana, Florida, Mississippi, Texas and Virginia, and they defeated freshmen lawmakers, too, as they staked their claim to the House majority two years into the Obama administration.
Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is set to become the new speaker, promised changes in the way the House does business as he announced his victory in an emotional speech in Washington just before midnight. 
''Our new majority will be prepared to do things differently,'' said Mr. Boehner, who grew up the son of an Ohio tavern owner, as he could hardly hold back the tears.
Republicans defeated Democrats who have long defied challenges from the opposition, notably Representative Gene Taylor of Mississippi, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House. Representative Rick Boucher of Virginia, first elected in 1982, fell. Voters in Indiana ousted Representative Baron Hill, another Democratic veteran, and in Florida, Representative Allen Boyd, a longtime force among conservative Democrats, also lost.
In Texas, Representative Chet Edwards, a Democrat who had held a seat in one of the most Republican districts in the nation since 1990, was defeated. Representative Paul Kanjorski, a Pennsylvania Democrat with 26 years in the House and a senior member of the Financial Services Committee, lost his seat as well.
Among the more junior casualties was Representative Tom Perriello of Virginia, a Democrat who had become an Obama administration favorite for his willingness to back initiatives like the health care and energy bills, despite resistance in his district.
Representative Glenn Nye, a first-term Virginia Democrat who broke with his party on health care, lost as well. In Florida, two Democratic freshmen who supported the health overhaul, Suzanne M. Kosmas and Alan Grayson, were easily defeated.
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois were particularly good territory for Republicans, who picked up multiple seats in each state. Democrats blamed stubborn unemployment for their losses there.
As the votes were being counted, Republicans celebrated the fact that voters were willing to return them to power after ousting them just four years ago.
''Tonight, the people of this Commonwealth and our great country are poised to give us a second chance,'' Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 Republican in the House, said in a victory speech in Richmond.
Republicans also picked up an open Democratic House seat in Indiana, and beat incumbents in New Hampshire and New Jersey while the party's incumbents were winning easily across the board in the early voting.
But some Democratic lawmakers thought to be vulnerable in Kentucky and North Carolina appeared likely to retain their seats, suggesting that the Republican wave might not reach as far as some had expected..
Democrats did pick up a seat in Delaware, where former Lt. Gov. John Carney won the state's sole House seat, taking over from Mike Castle, the Republican who ran for the Senate and was defeated in the primary. They also ousted Representative Joseph Cao in Louisiana.
The election came after a contentious two years in the House as Democrats under Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California forced through an ambitious agenda, despite almost uniform resistance from Republicans.
More so than in the Senate, Republicans in the House refused to support any of the main Democratic initiatives, like the economic stimulus and the health care overhaul.
And Democrats, with the numbers and House rules that give majority members the ability to dictate the agenda on their side, were not inclined to strike many deals with the opposition.
As a result, House Republicans dug in, bided their time and from the start of the 111th Congress set their sights on significantly cutting into or eliminating the Democratic majority in the midterms.
Republicans have promised to put a strong new focus on cutting federal spending, raising the possibility of a future showdown with the Obama administration.
They have also said they would emphasize tax cuts and loosen federal regulations to stimulate business. Republicans also run the risk of leaving their supporters disillusioned if they find themselves unable to deliver on some of their main pledges.
Mr. Boehner urged his colleagues heading up the House Republican campaign effort to find credible opponents for as many Democrats as possible, and promised enough money to ensure the political operation would be effective.
Many Republicans were also quick to ally themselves with Tea Party groups and conservative activists unhappy with the Democratic-controlled Congress and President Obama.
Party figures like Mr. Boehner, Mr. Cantor and Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota appeared at Tea Party events.
During the House vote on the health care bill, House Republicans rallied conservative protesters from the balconies of the Capitol, winning more support from the activists who would play a role in the coming elections.
Even as voters were casting their ballots Tuesday, House Democratic leaders put up an optimistic front, saying they saw a ''narrow path'' to retaining the House, based on the possibility of independents' splitting their votes between the parties rather than flocking to Republicans.
The Republican comeback was rooted in both politics and policy. The wave of Democratic House victories in 2006 and 2008 reached deep into Republican territory. So in this election, Democrats had to defend many junior members -- typically the most vulnerable -- in dozens of districts won by President George W. Bush in 2004 and Senator John McCain in 2008.
At the same time, Republicans, energized by angry constituents, were able to gain a foothold in districts where incumbent Democratic lawmakers had not faced serious competition in years. That forced Democrats to spread their resources, both manpower and money, over a widening and shifting playing field.
An assortment of advocacy groups formed for the election also helped Republicans by paying for television attack ads. The groups helped level the playing field for some Republican candidates, and in some cases gave them an advantage over Democratic incumbents.
Republicans also say that Democrats provided them ample ammunition by advancing their ambitious legislative agenda. The main issue that Republicans emphasized in their campaign advertising was the $787 billion economic stimulus measure passed early in Mr. Obama's term.
Analysts said the stimulus legislation was seen by Republican and independent voters as an example of excessive spending and undue government intervention.
Republican strategists said that while the House climate-change energy legislation received less attention, it galvanized Republican voters in coal-country states like Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia.
Making matters worse for Democrats, the Senate never even considered the House's version of the so-called cap-and-trade bill, meaning many House Democrats took a tough vote that the Senate ultimately avoided.
During earlier periods in its history, the House regularly experienced sudden switches in party control. Substantial losses of House seats were not that uncommon as the nation's political mood underwent seismic shifts. Democrats lost more than 100 seats in the election of 1894 after a national economic collapse.

HEADLINE: A Victorious Paul Vows to Stay With Libertarian Message in the Senate

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
BOWLING GREEN, Ky. -- From the earliest days of his campaign, even before his Republican primary victory that shook up the Kentucky political establishment, Rand Paul has pledged not to compromise. And that was the message he returned to on Tuesday night as he celebrated a Senate victory over his Democratic opponent, Jack Conway, the state attorney general.
''They say that the U.S. Senate is the world's most deliberative body,'' Mr. Paul said, taking the podium at a victory rally here in Bowling Green. ''I'm going to ask them to deliberate upon this: The American people are unhappy with what is going on in Washington. Eleven percent of the people approve of what's going in Congress. But tonight there's a Tea Party tidal wave and we're sending a message to them. It's a message that I will carry with me on Day 1.'' 
That message, Mr. Paul explained, is one of limited government, entrepreneurship and a conservative reading of and adherence to the Constitution.
''When I arrive in Washington I will ask them respectfully to deliberate on this: We are in the midst of a debt crisis and the American people want to know why we have to balance our budget and they don't,'' he said.
''America will remain great if and when we understand,'' he said, in a direct rebuke to the Obama administration's stimulus plan, ''that government cannot create prosperity -- we have to understand that it comes from ourselves.''
Before he appeared at the rally -- which had the air of a rock concert, with young men shouting ''Capitalism!'' among other things -- Mr. Paul was introduced by his father, Ron Paul, the Texas congressman, who gave a short pep talk via video. The biggest question for many going forward is whether Rand Paul can maintain his largely libertarian brand of Republicanism after he arrives in Washington. Ron Paul directly addressed the question of compromise.
''If they want to increase government by 100 percent and they increase government by 50 percent, that's not compromise, that's a sellout,'' he said to cheers. ''If our side wants to reduce government by 50 percent and we end up only reducing it by 25 percent, that's a compromise we can live with.''
Earlier in the day, the issue of compromise was on the minds of some of his supporters, who were excited to vote for him but concerned about what lay ahead.
Cheri Star, 50, a homemaker, said she was confident in Mr. Paul after voting for him at an elementary school in Bowling Green on Tuesday morning. ''But I'm afraid that the system might change him,'' she said nervously.
The elder Mr. Paul did not have any words of gratitude for the Republican establishment, which has had a tenuous relationship with the Tea Party in general and both Pauls in particular.
Tuesday night's victory ''originated outside the political party system,'' he said, adding that Republicans had fallen short in previous attempts to limit government. ''The test will come very shortly,'' he said. ''We have to stand for something.''
But whatever the national party's relationship will be with the Tea Party, Rand Paul's victory did not change the makeup of the state's Congressional delegation because he will replace Jim Bunning, also a Republican. The four Republicans in the House won easily, and the Democratic incumbent in the district that represents Louisville won as well.
However, with 98 percent of the vote counted, it was still too close to call the race in the Sixth Congressional District, which pit Ben Chandler, a three-term Democratic incumbent, against Andy Barr, a Republican lawyer.

HEADLINE: As New House Speaker, Boehner Will Face Tough Fight and Tight Deadline

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
In leading his party to midterm triumph, Representative John A. Boehner, the next speaker of the House, is not at the endgame. He is at the beginning of the next and harder fight.
Relying on his decades of experience with the inner workings of the House, Mr. Boehner, of Ohio, now has less than two years to show that the Republican Party is the antidote to what ails Washington, with a discordant caucus, a stagnant economy, a hostile White House with veto power and the long shadow of 1994 all looming before him.
His promises on behalf of the new House majority -- reducing the size of government, creating jobs and fundamentally altering the way the Congress conducts its business -- are mostly as lofty as they are unspecific, and his efforts to legislate them into reality must be done with ambitious upstarts within his own party and a fresh crop of Tea Partiers, some of whom seem to believe that it is they, not he, now running the show. 
The demands on Mr. Boehner from voters are many and not all consistent. There is a craving, polling shows, to see the current system upended, but preferably without gridlock or rancor. Voters want federal spending curtailed, but jealously guard costly entitlements. They angrily reject what is, but have no clearly articulated vision for what should be.
Indeed, Mr. Boehner and his party were delivered no clear mandate from voters, who, polls suggested, were rejecting a policy agenda more than they were rallying around one. One demand resonated loudly: the reduction of federal spending immediately, a daunting goal. Yet, among the first things that Mr. Boehner has said he will seek to accomplish are reversing cuts to the Medicare program and extending the expiring Bush-era tax cuts, steps that are hard to reconcile with a commitment to reining in the national debt.
Mr. Boehner, who will become second in line to the presidency in January, has responded to the contradictory forces that led to Republican victory with equally mixed messages.
He has given speeches about inclusiveness, then written Twitter messages denouncing compromise. He is specific about the amount of spending cuts he seeks -- $100 billion -- but says little about how he will get there. In speeches during a whirlwind tour of Ohio over the weekend, he promised things would be ''different'' in Washington, but then returned to the two-year theme of denigrating President Obama.
The best guiding documents for understanding what Mr. Boehner seeks to accomplish are the House Republican policy document titled ''A Pledge to America'' and his recent speech to the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. The former is a short collection of goals, some of them near-impossible in the near term (like ending government control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage companies) and a few small-bore but relatively easy to accomplish, like repealing paperwork rules imposed on small businesses.
Mr. Boehner and his party have also made it clear that they will immediately try to unravel the new health care law, either by repealing pieces of it, some of which have already gone into force, or by using the appropriations process to remove financing from its key provisions.
Mr. Boehner will also be tested -- perhaps as early as during the lame duck session this month, when Democrats may be eager to put the issue to bed -- on the tax cut front. Democrats would like to see tax cuts extended for all but the highest income levels, while Republicans seek to make them permanent for all taxpayers.
Dragging this battle out would create tremendous headaches for the Internal Revenue Service, and the issue might be settled in the lame duck session. But Mr. Boehner learned this year, when he indicated a willingness to work with Democrats to hammer out a middle ground solution and was excoriated by some party mates, that not all Republicans cotton to compromise on the issue.
Mr. Boehner, in his speech and in the pledge, also seeks to overhaul much of the way Congress does its business, including eliminating sprawling bills that are filled with items that have nothing to do with the legislation's main intent, as well as requiring bills to cite constitutional authority and ensuring more bipartisan debate on bills.
There is no doubt that Mr. Boehner, who was among the so-called Gang of Seven in 1994, when Republicans took control of the House and then became entangled in missteps and feuds, does not want a repeat of history.
For instance, in 1994, when Republicans captured both the House and the Senate, Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Senate leader, Bob Dole, both harbored presidential aspirations and worked less in tandem than as adversaries. That division between House and Senate Republicans played to President Bill Clinton's advantage.
In contrast, Mr. Boehner's relationship with his Senate counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, with whom he has worked closely in the past two years to oppose Mr. Obama's agenda, remains strong.
Finally, there is some opportunity for bipartisan lawmaking, as Democrats and Republicans alike recognize, often privately. The pursuit of alternative energy sources, modest trade agreements, changes to the Bush administration's signature education act and even adjustments to the tax code are all within reach.
''The big, interesting question is 'What message does Obama take out of this election? What path does he choose?' '' said Mr. McConnell, who said spending and debt were potential areas of common ground.
''There will be plenty of Republicans willing to help reduce both,'' the senator said. ''There are places where he has expressed interest in the past that would be similar to our own interests.''

HEADLINE: Rubio Continues Quick Rise in Republic Party With Florida Senate Win

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Jeb Bush said he had to fight back tears when he introduced the victor in the Florida Senate race, Marco Rubio, ''the right man at the right time.'' Mr. Rubio, when he took the stage amid the palm trees at the Biltmore Hotel, in front of a mostly bilingual crowd, was no less emotional -- about his uphill battle to defeat a popular governor, and about what he described as his abiding faith in the dream lived out by his immigrant parents.
''The United States is simply the greatest nation in all of human history,'' Mr. Rubio said. But he added, ''it requires action on our part.'' 
Mr. Rubio pledged to stay true to the ideology of fiscal restraint he laid out during the campaign. Offering no details, he pledged to make the country better for his children by rejecting the Washington status quo, and even traditional Republican standards.
''We're making a great mistake if we believe that tonight these results are somehow an embrace of the Republican party,'' Mr. Rubio said in his 15-minute speech. ''What they are is a second chance -- a second chance for Republicans to be what they said were going to be not so long ago.''
It seemed, in some ways, a fitting end. Mr. Rubio, 39, was not expected to win when the campaign started, but with rousing speeches that centered on ''reclaiming America'' and returning to core Republican values of fiscal restraint, he became one of the first candidates propelled by the Tea Party insurgents. Although he later distanced himself from their orthodoxy, he won, like many other conservative Congressional candidates in Florida (including Daniel Webster who beat the liberal firebrand, Alan Grayson), with a message that focused on the economy, lower taxes and limited government.
Mr. Rubio's pitch, here in a state won by Mr. Obama two years ago but still reeling from the recession and foreclosures, apparently captured the mood. For Mr. Rubio, the victory completes a dramatic rise for a young Cuban-American candidate, the son of a bartender and a maid in middle class West Miami.
He slew the dragon, or at least Charlie Crist, the state's popular moderate governor. It was Mr. Rubio's vast lead in the polls that helped push Mr. Crist to bolt from the Republican Party and run a campaign without affiliation.
And while at times, Mr. Crist's effort seemed to gain traction, Republicans unified behind Mr. Rubio, leaving Mr. Crist and Kendrick B. Meek, the Democrat in the race, to spend much of the campaign battling for the same liberal and moderate voters.
Mr. Rubio, in turn, coasted forward as a Republican favorite. Although he spent most of his career in the Florida Legislature, he ran as an outsider, and supporters said he would bring a new approach to Congress.
''He will go to Washington as a symbol of the new conservative movement -- young, committed, and a purist when it comes to his philosophy and his points of view,'' said Al Cardenas, the former chairman of Florida's Republican Party. ''It will make him one of the key figures in our party nationally.''
Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida, who worked with Mr. Rubio when they both served in Tallahassee, spoke of him as a friend: ''I am so proud he will be part of a next generation of leaders that will restore America.''
Democrats entered Election Day with 592,000 more registered voters than Republicans. State officials said turnout was steady, but not overwhelming, with about 2.3 million voters casting ballots early, out of about 11 million registered voters.
Many voters said they were frustrated, and Democratic strategists acknowledged that their party had struggled. Screven Watson, the former executive director of the state's Democratic Party, said the Senate and governor's races would be seen as a wake-up call for Democrats.
''If we lose them both, we're going to have a long, hard look at our party structure -- how we're running races, our messaging,'' Mr. Watson said.
Many Republicans said they were expecting major victories in races across the state, but Mr. Cardenas warned against claims of overconfidence.
''The one constant about Florida is how fluid it is,'' Mr. Cardenas said, adding, ''The truth is Florida will continue to be a purple state. We just happen to have hit a good cycle.''
Mr. Rubio acknowledged that he, too, could lose his way. He ended his victory speech by asking the crowd of supporters to pray ''that we will not change,'' and he said, ''that we will always remember the things we cared about on this night.''

HEADLINE: Harry Reid Keeps His Seat As Democrats Hold Senate

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Ana Facio Contreras contributed reporting from Las Vegas.

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader and a symbol of the Democratic establishment, fought back a fierce challenge from Sharron Angle to win re-election on Tuesday in a contest that offered a stark test of the Tea Party against one of the most effective political operations in the nation.
Mr. Reid provided the Democratic Party with a sliver of good news as he demonstrated a political tenacity that has been a hallmark of his political career and his tenure as Democratic leader in the Senate. The race was not as close as predicted, with Mr. Reid finishing with 50 percent of the vote, to Ms. Angle's 45 percent. 
''Today Nevada chose hope over fear,'' Mr. Reid said in a victory speech at a hotel at the new CityCenter complex on the Las Vegas Strip. ''Nevada chose to move forward, not backwards.''
When someone in the audience yelled out, ''Yes we can!'' Mr. Reid paused a moment and responded, ''Yes we did.''
In her concession speech, according to The Associated Press, Ms. Angle said: ''We didn't just inspire Republicans, we inspired Democrats and independents as well. They may call us the Tea Party, but we know we're Main Street America.''
Mr. Reid was a top target of national Republicans and Tea Party activists, who saw him as a prominent trophy and a chance for an upset win that would ring with historical resonance. It has been 58 years since a sitting Senate majority leader lost re-election, when Ernest McFarland of Arizona lost in 1952 to Barry Goldwater, who himself went on to lead a conservative revolution in the Republican Party.
More than $30 million had been spent on television advertising in the Senate race in this small state, a record that reflected Mr. Reid's aggressive fund-raising, Ms. Angle's success at tapping into the Tea Party financial network, and outside groups spending on behalf of an election that had national implications. Nearly half of that money came from outside groups.
Ms. Angle's defeat dampened what otherwise was a triumphant night for Republicans, offering stark evidence of the risks the Tea Party poses for the party going forward.
Ms. Angle defeated a cast of more established Republicans who sought the nomination -- and who Republicans and Democrats in Nevada say they feel would most likely have defeated Mr. Reid, particularly given the severe economic distress in the state. She entered the race advocating a series of positions, including calling for the phasing out of Social Security and against requiring insurance companies to cover such tests as mammograms, that Mr. Reid seized on with a punishing round of attacks intended to show her out of the Nevada mainstream.
''We believe she's out of touch,'' said Pamela Cherry, 59, a registered Democrat who voted for Mr. Reid in North Las Vegas. ''She doesn't know what she's doing, trying to privatize Social Security. A lot of people need that money to live on.''
By Election Day, Mr. Reid had collected the endorsement of many of this state's most powerful Republicans, reflecting what they saw as the danger of losing such a powerful advocate in Washington at a time when the state is undergoing such economic turmoil: It has the highest unemployment rate and mortgage foreclosure rate in the country.
The results offered an early test of the passion of the Tea Party -- this state a leading target of Sarah Palin, who staged a rally in Mr. Reid's hometown, Searchlight, earlier this year -- versus a well-financed and sophisticated Democratic voter turnout operation that Mr. Reid had boasted of for over two years. As such, it could have implications for Mr. Obama's re-election bid in 2012. Mr. Obama won Nevada in 2008, in no small part because of a sophisticated voter identification and turnout operation that he and Mr. Reid put together -- and that Mr. Reid continued to develop in the two years after the presidential election.
Mr. Reid's early attention to turnout -- as well as his decision to start advertising one year ago and to continue through Election Day -- reflected consensus among Democrats and Republicans that he was one of the most vulnerable Democratic incumbents this year. He was viewed unfavorably by a majority of Nevada voters, upset with his partisan role as Senate majority leader, first battling former President George W. Bush and then championing President Obama's policies, in particular the health care legislation.
''I voted for her to get different representation in the White House,'' said Lisa Harris, 49, a pharmacy technician who backed Ms. Angle and said this was only the second time in her life that she had voted for a Republican. ''I hope she changes the direction of the country.''
There were few races nationwide that offered such a stark contrast of views about the role of government. Ms. Angle said it was the role of private industry, not government, to help create jobs. She opposed measures to regulate banks and the insurance industry.
Beyond that, both candidates ran strikingly negative contests against the other: Mr. Reid's final advertisements described her as ''pathological,'' while she suggested that Mr. Reid had somehow gotten wealthy as a result of his work in the Senate. The bitterness went into the final hours as Ms. Angle filed a complaint with federal and state authorities charging that Harrah's Entertainment, the casino owner, had coerced its workers to get to the polls to vote for Mr. Reid.
Online Correction: November 3, 2010, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version referred incorrectly to the medical procedure Ms. Angle said insurance companies should not have to cover. It was mammograms, not mastectomies.

HEADLINE: Rubio Continues Quick Rise in G.O.P. With Florida Senate Win

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Jeb Bush said he had to fight back tears when he introduced the victor in the Florida Senate race, Marco Rubio, ''the right man at the right time.'' Mr. Rubio, when he took the stage amid the palm trees at the Biltmore Hotel, in front of a mostly bilingual crowd, was no less emotional -- about his uphill battle to defeat a popular governor, and about what he described as his abiding faith in the dream lived out by his immigrant parents.
''The United States is simply the greatest nation in all of human history,'' Mr. Rubio said. But he added, ''it requires action on our part.'' 
Mr. Rubio pledged to stay true to the ideology of fiscal restraint he laid out during the campaign. Offering no details, he pledged to make the country better for his children by rejecting the Washington status quo, and even traditional Republican standards.
''We're making a great mistake if we believe that tonight these results are somehow an embrace of the Republican party,'' Mr. Rubio said in his 15-minute speech. ''What they are is a second chance -- a second chance for Republicans to be what they said were going to be not so long ago.''
It seemed, in some ways, a fitting end. Mr. Rubio, 39, was not expected to win when the campaign started, but with rousing speeches that centered on ''reclaiming America'' and returning to core Republican values of fiscal restraint, he became one of the first candidates propelled by the Tea Party insurgents. Although he later distanced himself from their orthodoxy, he won, like many other conservative Congressional candidates in Florida (including Daniel Webster who beat the liberal firebrand, Alan Grayson), with a message that focused on the economy, lower taxes and limited government.
Mr. Rubio's pitch, here in a state won by Mr. Obama two years ago but still reeling from the recession and foreclosures, apparently captured the mood. For Mr. Rubio, the victory completes a dramatic rise for a young Cuban-American candidate, the son of a bartender and a maid in middle class West Miami.
He slew the dragon, or at least Charlie Crist, the state's popular moderate governor. It was Mr. Rubio's vast lead in the polls that helped push Mr. Crist to bolt from the Republican Party and run a campaign without affiliation.
And while at times, Mr. Crist's effort seemed to gain traction, Republicans unified behind Mr. Rubio, leaving Mr. Crist and Kendrick B. Meek, the Democrat in the race, to spend much of the campaign battling for the same liberal and moderate voters.
Mr. Rubio, in turn, coasted forward as a Republican favorite. Although he spent most of his career in the Florida Legislature, he ran as an outsider, and supporters said he would bring a new approach to Congress.
''He will go to Washington as a symbol of the new conservative movement -- young, committed, and a purist when it comes to his philosophy and his points of view,'' said Al Cardenas, the former chairman of Florida's Republican Party. ''It will make him one of the key figures in our party nationally.''
Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida, who worked with Mr. Rubio when they both served in Tallahassee, spoke of him as a friend: ''I am so proud he will be part of a next generation of leaders that will restore America.''
Democrats entered Election Day with 592,000 more registered voters than Republicans. State officials said turnout was steady, but not overwhelming, with about 2.3 million voters casting ballots early, out of about 11 million registered voters.
Many voters said they were frustrated, and Democratic strategists acknowledged that their party had struggled. Screven Watson, the former executive director of the state's Democratic Party, said the Senate and governor's races would be seen as a wake-up call for Democrats.
''If we lose them both, we're going to have a long, hard look at our party structure -- how we're running races, our messaging,'' Mr. Watson said.
Many Republicans said they were expecting major victories in races across the state, but Mr. Cardenas warned against claims of overconfidence.
''The one constant about Florida is how fluid it is,'' Mr. Cardenas said, adding, ''The truth is Florida will continue to be a purple state. We just happen to have hit a good cycle.''
Mr. Rubio acknowledged that he, too, could lose his way. He ended his victory speech by asking the crowd of supporters to pray ''that we will not change,'' and he said, ''that we will always remember the things we cared about on this night.''

HEADLINE: Juror Is Excused in EMI Sale Dispute

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
In a case that has had its share of odd turns, the battle between the British financier Guy Hands and Citigroup over the buyout of the EMI Group took a cinematic twist on Tuesday morning. In the end, a juror was left on the cutting room floor. 
The scene was set after Theodore V. Wells Jr., the lead lawyer for Citigroup, marched into the federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan and made an application to remove a juror from the trial, which is in its third week.
Judge Jed S. Rakoff called a sidebar to discuss the matter. At the conclusion of the private conference, Judge Rakoff's courtroom was suddenly transformed into an art house cinema.
On the overhead screen ran a two-and-a-half minute montage from ''Capitalism: A Love Story,'' a 2009 documentary about the financial crisis by Michael Moore, the muckraking filmmaker.
The excerpt included a scene during which a family was packing up a house that had been foreclosed on by a bank. At the end of the clip, the credits rolled. During the ''special thanks'' section, the court paused on the name ''Donna Gianell'' and highlighted it.
Ms. Gianell, a former circus performer and now a ''movement therapist,'' is a juror in the case.
Judge Rakoff, who at times plays for laughs in the courtroom, joked that they should label the film clip ''Marxist Exhibit 1.'' He also said the film appears to be ''an extremely one-sided, scurrilous appeal to antibank prejudice.''
The judge took the matter under advisement, brought in the jury, and proceeded with the trial. The juror, whose specific contribution to the film was unclear, was dismissed at day's end, according to people briefed on the matter.
The trial is of a lawsuit brought by Mr. Hands, who has accused Citigroup of deceiving him during the auction of EMI and tricking him into buying the struggling music company.
Separately, in another setback for Mr. Hands, Judge Rakoff late Monday night eliminated the potential recovery of punitive damages.
The judge said that in most jurisdictions a punitive damage claim ''involves some threat to the public,'' and this lawsuit was nothing more than ''a cat fight between two rich companies.''
Closing statements begin Wednesday morning. The jury is expected to get the case in the afternoon.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Solar-Panel Maker to Close a Factory and Delay Expansion

BYLINE: By TODD WOODY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Solyndra, a Silicon Valley solar-panel maker that won half a billion dollars in federal aid to build a state-of-the-art robotic factory, plans to announce on Wednesday that it will shut down an older plant and lay off workers. 
The cost-cutting move, which will reduce the company's previously announced production capacity, is a sign of the notable shift in the prospects for cutting-edge American solar companies, which now face intense price competition from Chinese manufacturers that use more established photovoltaic technologies.
Just seven weeks ago, Solyndra opened Fab 2, a $733 million factory in Fremont, Calif., to make its high-tech solar panels. The new plant was supposed to be the first phase of a rapid expansion of the company.
Instead, Solyndra has decided to shutter the old plant and postpone plans to expand Fab 2, which was built with a $535 million federal loan guarantee.
''Fab 2 is much more efficient and cost-effective than our existing facility,'' Brian Harrison, Solyndra's chief executive, said in an interview. ''We're adjusting our plans to be more in line with where the market is and where our business is at the moment.''
When Solyndra filed for an initial public stock offering in December, it estimated it would have a total production capacity of 610 megawatts by 2013 if its two plants were fully built out. The company now expects it have capacity of 285 to 300 megawatts by 2013.
Solyndra abandoned plans for the stock offering in June, citing market conditions.
The company is the most prominent of a wave of Silicon Valley solar start-ups that hoped to transform the economics of the industry. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Energy Secretary Steven Chu helped break ground on Fab 2 last year, and President Obama made an appearance at the unfinished factory in May to extol Solyndra's innovative technology.
Mr. Harrison noted that the market had undergone a significant shift since Solyndra filed for the stock offering, with solar module prices plummeting as low-cost Chinese manufacturers like Suntech and Yingli ramped up production.
That has put pressure on companies like Solyndra, which makes advanced thin-film solar modules that are less efficient than conventional photovoltaic modules but had been cheaper to install until prices began to fall sharply last year.
Solyndra said it would lay off around 40 employees and not renew contracts for about 150 temporary workers as a result of the consolidation. The closing of the old factory, called Fab 1, will save the company more than $60 million in capital expenditures, executives said.
Mr. Harrison, who became Solyndra's chief executive in July, said that despite the cutbacks, the company's production of solar panels for commercial rooftops would double in 2011 from the previous year. He said Solyndra continued to receive large orders from customers.
Depending on how the market evolves, Solyndra could reopen Fab 1 or expand its new factory, Mr. Harrison said.

HEADLINE: Blumenthal and Cuomo Win in Key Regional Races

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Reporting was contributed by David W. Chen, Marjorie Connelly, Elizabeth A. Harris and Nate Schweber.

 BODY:
Andrew M. Cuomo, whose career in government appeared all but over just eight years ago, was elected the 56th governor of New York on Tuesday, a stunning comeback for the scion of one of the state's legendary political families.
Mr. Cuomo, the state's Democratic attorney general, won a decisive victory over his Republican opponent, Carl P. Paladino, a Buffalo businessman whose strident and often belligerent rhetoric failed to gain traction among voters, exit polls showed. 
The state's sitting senators, Kirsten E. Gillibrand and Charles E. Schumer, easily won re-election. Results had not yet been reported in the contests for attorney general and state comptroller.
In Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal, the state attorney general and Democratic stalwart, captured the United States Senate seat being vacated by Christopher J. Dodd after staving off a fierce challenge from Linda E. McMahon, a Republican and former pro wrestling executive who spent $40 million on her insurgent campaign.
The expensive and hard-fought contest, which included accusations that Mr. Blumenthal had exaggerated his military record, was considered a national bellwether on a night when Republicans were poised to make big gains in Congress on the strength of voter resentment toward Washington.
But while Republican challengers have already picked up key Senate seats in Florida and Kentucky, Mr. Blumenthal's victory, in a race where Republicans were hoping to poach a seat, underscored expectations that the Democrats would hold onto control of the Senate.
Mr. Blumenthal received substantial support from female voters, a group that Ms. McMahon failed to attract early in the race and may have eventually been her undoing. Mr. Blumenthal also benefited from a heavy Democratic turnout: several polling places in Bridgeport, one of the state's major Democratic strongholds, repeatedly ran out of ballots on Tuesday, prompting officials to extend voting hours there until 10 p.m.
In her concession speech, Ms. McMahon sounded defiant as she insisted that her campaign, while unsuccessful, still amounted to a victory. ''We have left no stone unturned in this race; we have made Washington listen,'' she told supporters. ''We are not going to fade into the woodwork.''
The race for governor in Connecticut remained too close to call. Tom Foley, a Republican wealthy businessman, had an early lead over the Democratic candidate, Dannel P. Malloy, a former mayor of Stamford. The candidates are running to replace M. Jodi Rell, the state's retiring Republican governor.
In New York, Mr. Cuomo enjoyed support from nearly every age and income demographic in the state, according to exit polls. Two-thirds of women, and 7 out of 10 moderates, backed Mr. Cuomo, along with overwhelming majorities of black and Hispanic voters. Much of Mr. Paladino's support came from white voters without a college education, while independent white voters were divided between the two candidates.
Jimmy McMillan, who was running for governor as the candidate of the one-man Rent Is Too Damn High Party, received about 1 percent of the vote.
Votes were being counted at an extremely slow pace in the other statewide races. State Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, the Democrat, held a lead over Daniel M. Donovan Jr., the Republican district attorney from Staten Island, in the race to succeed Mr. Cuomo as attorney general.
In the state comptroller's race, Thomas P. DiNapoli, the incumbent, was running behind his dark-horse Republican opponent, the former financier Harry J. Wilson. Polls showed that race tightening in recent weeks.
Voters in New York City, where a new electronic voting system made its debut this year, are also being asked to decide whether politicians should be limited to two consecutive terms, a move that would reverse the legislation that allowed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to pursue his third term in City Hall. Early returns showed overwhelming support for restoring a two-term limit.
Fears about the state of the economy could be the determinant in many regional races on Tuesday, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of the major television networks and The Associated Press.
Half of New York voters said they were very worried about the state of the economy, although Mr. Paladino's supporters were more likely to express this sentiment. Half of the voters surveyed in New York described Mr. Cuomo as an honest candidate; only a quarter said the same of Mr. Paladino.
More than half said they approved of President Obama's job performance, but fewer than 1 in 5 of Mr. Paladino's supporters agreed with that statement, according to the polls. About half of New York voters said the government was performing too many services that would be better left to businesses and individuals.
Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Paladino was asked if he would miss the stresses of the campaign trail. He laughed. ''I'm not a great campaigner,'' he said, adding that the process had been ''treacherous'' and ''confusing'' for him. He vowed never to do it again.
''No. More. Elections!'' he called out, enunciating each word. ''This is it.'' And his plans for the rest of the day? A prayer service, Mr. Paladino said, followed by a nap.
Mr. Cuomo, meanwhile, spent the morning at his residence in Mount Kisco, where he voted with his companion, the television cooking personality Sandra Lee. In Yonkers, Rudolph B. Steward, Jr., 60, a military veteran and retired postal service worker, said he voted for Mr. Cuomo because he believed the Democrat would not cut his disability benefits. He said he feared what would happen if Mr. Paladino were to be elected governor.
''There was nothing about Cuomo that made me vote for him,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''I just did it to fight the policies of the Republicans.''

HEADLINE: Engagements With History Punctuate a Lifetime in Books

BYLINE: By DWIGHT GARNER

 BODY:
OUTSIDE LOOKING IN
Adventures of an Observer
By Garry Wills
195 pages. Viking. $25.95.
''Square,'' ''colorless,'' ''stodgy,'' ''unthreatening.'' Those are some of the adjectives that the prolific journalist and historian Garry Wills uses to describe himself in ''Outside Looking In,'' his pointillistic new memoir.
Off the page, all those things may (or may not) be true. On it, as countless politicians and writers have learned, having Mr. Wills sternly contemplate your work can be like having the Red Baron on your tail. ''Unthreatening'' is hardly the word. Writing in The New York Review of Books and other journals, he's sent entire squadrons of shoddy works and ideas down in flames.
Mr. Wills has written some 40 books of his own, from pinwheeling political analysis (''Nixon Agonistes,'' published in 1970) to sober inquiry about celebrity (''John Wayne's America,'' published in 1997) to meditations on oratory and language. In 1993 he won a Pulitzer Prize for ''Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words That Remade America.'' 
Now 76, Mr. Wills is also among America's leading Roman Catholic intellectuals; in recent years faith has become his abiding preoccupation. In the last decade alone he's written nearly a dozen books about religion, including ''Saint Augustine's Sin'' (2003) and ''What the Gospels Meant'' (2008), in addition to many on other subjects.
He's become a publishing machine, issuing a steady drip of erudite but remote volumes from the broad and rectangular plain of his parsonlike forehead. Few of Mr. Wills's recent books have warmed in your hands. They've been easier to admire than to embrace.
The good news about ''Outside Looking In'' is that it's the most limber and humane book Mr. Wills has written in years. It's far from a proper autobiography, although it does detail bits of Mr. Wills's bookwormish childhood in Michigan and Wisconsin. (His father, a college boxing coach, gambler and instigator of business schemes, once paid him not to read so much. The boy used the money to buy another book.)
It also offers warm set pieces from his life with his wife, Natalie, to whom he has been married for more than 50 years. He met her on an Eastern Airlines flight in 1957 -- she was working as a stewardess -- when she commented on the book he was reading by the French philosopher Henri Bergson.
''I can scare myself silly,'' Mr. Wills writes, ''by considering the close calls'' that almost made him miss that particular flight.
''Outside Looking In'' is, most fundamentally, a series of pointed scenes from a busy life. Its vaguely oxymoronic subtitle (''Adventures of an Observer'') seems misleading. No one who counted William F. Buckley, John Waters, Studs Terkel, Beverly Sills and Murray Kempton among his many friends, and who had close-up views of many of the last century's signal events, can qualify as a true outsider.
The early chapters of ''Outside Looking In'' are a Greyhound bus tour through many events Mr. Wills covered as a barnstorming young journalist, writing for Harold Hayes's Esquire and other publications. He was thrown in jail along with Benjamin Spock, Joe Papp and Judy Collins during the 1968 Democratic convention in Chicago, after agreeing to take part in a protest. He flew into Memphis on the night of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination. He visited strip clubs in Dallas in 1966 while writing about Jack Ruby, Lee Harvey Oswald's killer, who owned a club called the Carousel.
There is a chapter here on Nixon (Wills landed on his enemies list), as well as on Jimmy Carter, whom he admired, and on the Clintons (he has kinder things to say about Hillary than about Bill, and admires her gifts as a mimic). There are chapters as well on Buckley, who asked the young and unknown Mr. Wills to write theater criticism for National Review, and on Studs Terkel. Mr. Wills also writes fondly about his friendship with the actor and antiwar activist Dick Cusack, the father of the actors John and Joan, and the rest of the busy Cusack clan.
Mr. Wills writes gratefully, and with relish, about the intellectual and spiritual armor he acquired early. ''I was blessed by my schooling -- Catholic grade school, high school, college (St. Louis University) and graduate school (Xavier of Cincinnati),'' he says.
Mr. Wills also has a Ph.D. in classics from Yale, and he is eloquent about why this sort of education matters to anyone who wishes to write and think seriously. ''Learning classical Greek is the most economical intellectual investment one can make,'' he writes. ''On many things that might interest one -- law and politics, philosophy, oratory, history, lyric poetry, epic poetry, drama -- there will be constant reference back to the founders of those forms in our civilization.''
There are moments when ''Outside Looking In'' seems like a data dump, as if Mr. Wills were flipping though a trunk of his yellowed magazine clips. There's more here than is strictly necessary about things like the particulars of Sills's run as chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera. And a bit, spread over several pages, about the actor Joseph Fiennes's behaving like a twerp on a film set that Mr. Wills visited is a waste of this book's already limited storage capacity.
Other narrative detours are pure labors of love. Mr. Wills's chapter on his family's years in Baltimore (he and his wife have three children) includes a long and ardent disquisition on the glories of Johnny Unitas's passing with the Baltimore Colts, and Raymond Berry's receiving. Mr. Wills approvingly quotes the sportswriter Frank Deford, who declared: ''If there were one game scheduled, Earth versus the Klingons, with the fate of the universe on the line, any person with his wits about him would have Johnny U. calling signals in the huddle.''
Mr. Wills's politics have never been doctrinaire, but he makes it clear that he arrived at his middle-class conservatism by temperament. He says the rosary daily. He has never smoked pot. He dresses, in his daughter's words, ''like a bum.'' He has had sex with only one woman.
''I agree with Hilaire Belloc: 'it is well to have loved one woman from a child,' '' he writes.
More than faith, Mr. Wills admires faithfulness. He's justifiably proud that he's been true to his wife, to his friends, to the two universities where he's taught for long stretches over 43 years and to the few literary agents he's had. For a man who describes himself as one of the least interesting people on the planet, he makes the old virtues sound surprisingly sexy.

HEADLINE: MasterCard's Profit Rises 15%

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Third-quarter profit at MasterCard, the credit and debit card processor, rose 15 percent and beat expectations, as people outside the United States bought more things and switched more of their payments to plastic from cash. 
Revenue in the quarter was $1.43 billion.
The company, which processes credit card transactions but does not lend directly to people, makes money each time someone buys something with one of its credit or debit cards. It was relatively insulated from the credit losses that banks suffered during the financial crisis, but its revenue faltered in the last two years as consumers spent less money.
''The numbers were well ahead of expectations'' and illustrated ''a fundamental turn in their business,'' said James T. Tierney Jr., chief investment officer of W.P. Stewart, which owns MasterCard shares.
The company is cultivating new business in emerging markets, and consumers in Asia, Europe and especially Latin America spent more money with MasterCard-branded credit and debit cards in the quarter.
MasterCard reported a 32 percent jump in debit card purchase volume growth outside the United States, meaning that many people who once relied on cash are starting to replace it with cards.
Cross-border volumes also rose 15.4 percent from a year earlier, indicating that more people and businesses are spending money on travel and using their cards abroad.
The chief executive, Ajay Banga, was cautious regarding the United States economy. Spending on MasterCards in the United States shrank slightly during the quarter, although much less than it did a year ago.
The company has relatively few opportunities for growth in the United States, where rival Visa dominates the debit processing market and most consumers already use credit and debit cards.
MasterCard earned $518 million, or $3.94 a share, in the third quarter, compared with $452 million, or $3.45 a share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average had expected $3.54 a share, according to Thomson Reuters.

HEADLINE: Markets End Higher on Eve of Fed Decision

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks ended higher Tuesday as voters went to the polls for midterm elections and policy makers from the Federal Reserve met to decide whether they would start a new round of purchases of Treasury securities to help stimulate the economy.
Such a decision, which will put downward pressure on long-term interest rates, is expected to be announced by the Federal Open Market Committee on Wednesday. Analysts said the market had been pricing in the prospect of the measure, called quantitative easing, for weeks as Fed officials made clear that the central bank was prepared to act if needed. 
But even as investors weighed the remaining uncertainty about the size and schedule of such a program, stocks edged higher, as the dollar weakened against the euro and the yen, and as analysts forecast that the Republican Party would take control of the House of Representatives.
''I think some of the people are buying because they see a better market,'' said Muriel F. Siebert, the president of Muriel Siebert & Company. ''The Fed has made it obvious they stand ready to do what they think is good.''
Paul Ashworth, senior United States economist at Capital Economics, said the Republicans could make significant gains. ''We continue to suspect that fiscal policy will end up being largely paralyzed for the next two years as a result,'' he said in a research note.
Still, the election results will be quickly overtaken by the expected Federal Reserve announcement on Wednesday.
Many analysts expect the Fed purchases to be mostly of two- and 10-year Treasuries, although Goldman Sachs predicted last week that the Fed might include 30-year bonds in its program. The program, estimated to range from $500 billion to $2 trillion, is intended to stimulate the economy, but the extent of its effect on unemployment and growth is uncertain.
Interest rates could be pushed lower, which could further weaken the dollar, said Alan B. Lancz, the president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates.
On Tuesday, the dollar declined against the yen and the euro, spurred by a rate increase by the Australian central bank, stronger manufacturing data out of Europe and expectations of the additional Fed easing.
Marc Chandler, the global currency strategist for Brown Brothers Harriman, said the move by the Australian central bank started the selling of the dollar.
Also, a new business survey showed that the rate of expansion in euro zone manufacturing production accelerated in October, for the first time in three months. The Markit survey said the Purchasing Managers' Index rose to 54.6, revised from the earlier estimate of 54.1 and up from September's eight-month low of 53.7.
''So those two things helped trigger a dollar decline ahead of the F.O.M.C. meeting,'' Mr. Chandler said.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 64.10 points, or 0.58 percent, to 11,188.72. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 9.19 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,193.57, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 28.68 points, or 1.14 percent, to 2,533.52.
The dollar index edged lower against a range of currencies. Interest rates were slightly lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 10/32, to 100 10/32, and the yield slipped to 2.59 percent from 2.62 percent late Monday.
Equities have been buoyed in recent days by new statistics on the economy, and the monthly unemployment report for October on Friday will be watched closely for any improvements to the 9.6 percent unemployment rate and any increases in private payrolls.
Third-quarter corporate earnings have also provided some momentum.
On Tuesday, Pfizer's shares declined just under 1 percent to $17.45 after it reported third-quarter profit was down 70 percent, below expectations.
MasterCard said its net income was up 15 percent, to $518 million, or $3.94 a share, from $452 million, or $3.45 a share, in the third quarter of 2009. Its share rose nearly 3 percent to $245.98.
And Kellogg's share fell just over 2 percent, to $49.69, after it said net earnings were $338 million, a 6 percent decrease from the comparable quarter a year ago. Net sales declined 4 percent to $3.2 billion in the third quarter.

HEADLINE: On a Stingray Crawl

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
KOK FYE SEETOH shot me a warning look.
I was jammed into a restaurant kitchen in Queens with the pre-eminent translator to the English-speaking world of the food of Malaysia and Singapore. I had serious doubts about a sauce.
A sweet sludge punctuated by large pieces of raw shallot, it was presented by the restaurant's Malaysian owner as ''popular with Americans.''
As the owner turned away to put the fish in the fryer, I asked Mr. Seetoh under my breath, ''Would you really eat this in Singapore?''
''We'll talk outside,'' he said, tersely. 
Mr. Seetoh, a former photojournalist who now publishes exhaustive guides to street foods in Southeast Asia, was my wingman for what may have been America's first stingray crawl. Its goal: to mine Mr. Seetoh's expertise by choosing one popular dish from the alluring, often bewildering menus of New York's Southeast Asian restaurants, and chasing it all over town.
In sunglasses, he strode into kitchens with the imperious confidence of Keith Richards and judged them with the tender harshness of Gordon Ramsay. He rode waves of enthusiasm and dropped into valleys of despair, pleasantly surprised by the juicy fish at one place but tormented by the careless spicing at another.
''They make too many compromises here,'' he said flatly as we left, dismissing the offending sauce as not authentic and, worse, just not good. Ikan pari pangang, stingray coated with a spicy sambal and grilled on banana leaves, was the test he chose for local cooks. (Stingray is known on our tables as skate; the French call it raie).
Originally a dish for fishermen and peasants, made with what was considered a ''trash fish'' but deliciously aromatic from the spice paste and toasted banana leaves, ikan pari pangang is now a classic outdoor dinner and an accompaniment to cold beer. As the moist heat suffuses the fish, it should take on a tangy, dry crust but stay juicy near the central spine. (The flesh slides off easily after cooking.) Served with wedges of lemon and rings of onion, with lots of juicy bits to poke at with chopsticks and swipe through the sauce, it makes a pleasant, indolent meal, like picking at a whole barbecued pork butt.
It is a dish with Malay roots, which sets it apart from the many popular Chinese- and Indian-influenced snacks that the region is famous for, like curry-rich roti canai (pronounced CHEN-nye), Hainanese chicken rice, kangkung belachan (water spinach cooked with shrimp paste) and savory stir-fried Chinese-based noodle dishes like char kway teow, a crunchy, savory tangle of rice noodles, bean sprouts, shrimp, pork and chili paste.
But grasping those flavors, especially from far away, is not easy.
Southeast Asia covers a huge area, in both culinary and geographic terms. Singapore, with a slightly smaller landmass than New York City, is a dot in the huge stretch of islands that swirls off the coast of Vietnam -- including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Singapore's history as a free port under the British empire, its central location on trade and spice routes and recent decades of high-speed economic growth have made the cuisine there a heady international brew. And Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's ever-expanding capital city across the Strait of Johor, has a food scene almost as intense.
In New York City, ''Southeast Asian'' restaurants try to cover a range of food from Malaysia and Singapore, often stirring in popular dishes from Thailand and Vietnam; some have hundreds of items on the menu. Most restaurant owners here are ethnically Chinese: noodles, rice, stir-frying and steaming are fundamentals, and even kung pao shrimp may appear on the menu. But dishes with chilies, lemon grass, galangal, coconut, curry spices and funky fermented seafood products like belachan (shrimp paste) are signs that the food isn't just arriving from China.
I knew that Mr. Seetoh, whose Makansutra guidebooks contain detailed culinary analysis of individual dishes, down to the perfume of the duck broth and the springiness of the fish balls, would be able to answer my lingering questions: What makes one dish Malaysian and not Singaporean? Why are some dishes called by Malay names, and others Cantonese? And most important for a food lover, does this dish taste as good as it is supposed to, or was the flavor lost in translation?
Malaysian food leans more toward tangy flavors, and Singapore food toward the richness of peanut and coconut, Mr. Seetoh said, but other than that, the distinctions are usually traced to individual cooks.
At Coco in Elmhurst in Queens, where David Lim, the chef and an owner, serves a local crowd of Southeast Asians, Koreans, Chinese and Latinos, the stingray was sweeter and less redolent of dried shrimp and shrimp paste. At Sanur in Chinatown in Manhattan, Mr. Seetoh was impressed by Sun Chen Lai's hack: to adapt the method from an outdoor grill to a basement stovetop, Mr. Lai, the chef and an owner, deep-fries the fish first, then enfolds it in a round lotus leaf and tosses the packet deftly in a hot wok until it is good and charred.
But Mr. Seetoh was not entirely satisfied with anyone's sambal, the cooked sauce that acts as a cooking medium and a table condiment. ''When they gentrify the food, it's understandable, but it is completely the wrong idea,'' he said.
Barriers of language and culture, he said, prevent many immigrant cooks in the United States from presenting their best food to outsiders. ''In traditional culture, selling food on the street is one degree above prostitution,'' he said. ''We need to learn to be proud of what we have.''
It is a given for Mr. Seetoh, a first-generation Singaporean whose parents were born in mainland China, that hawker versions are always an improvement on the original dish: more savory, richer, better balanced.
''I went to Hainan to taste the chicken rice,'' Mr. Seetoh said, referring to the island off southern China that was the birthplace of Singapore's unofficial national dish of steamed chicken, white rice, cucumbers and chili sauce. ''It was totally boring,'' he said, pointing out that in the Singaporean version, the white rice is gilded with chicken fat and butter, and scented with the sweet, vanilla-like pandan leaf.
Hainan chicken rice is a main dish of the region, making it a subject of frequent squabbles between Malaysia and Singapore. Last year, Malaysia's tourism minister staked an official claim to the dish for his nation, bringing simmering cross-Straits resentments to a boil.
Singapore is especially reliant on food hawkers, according to food historians, because it was initially populated by young, mostly Chinese men, who could not afford their own households. The thousands of food vendors (in Singapore they are gathered into ''hawker centers,'' and in Malaysia a food stall is a ''warung'') tend to specialize in a single dish or a small family of foods, refining it over the years to try to grab a bigger piece of the market share. Thus, Mr. Seetoh said, the best food always wins.
''Food is the greatest democratic institution in Singapore,'' he said. ''There is truly no bland food and no bad restaurants.''
Even by New York standards, Singaporeans seem to be obsessed with food. ''I have tried to cook Singapore food in Brooklyn, but at the end there was always something missing,'' said Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan, a writer whose memoir of ''food and family'' will be published in February. When she left Singapore to attend Northwestern University in Chicago in 1993, she said, she missed the food of home so much that she would trek through snow to the computer center to gaze at Internet photos of her favorite dishes. ''A lot of what you love in Singaporean cuisine is the flavor of the hawker center,'' she said. ''It might be MSG, it might be the heat or the humidity or the sweat, you just don't know.''
Continuing the crawl solo at Overseas Asian in Chinatown, I found an ikan pari that seemed too wet to my Seetoh-trained palate. (But the best roti canai I've had in New York: fluffy, yeasty, lightly sweet.) The last stingray was the best: an excellent, smoky version at Redang Island in Sunset Park in Brooklyn, where the fish is rubbed with spices and steamed before the final cooking.
One of Mr. Seetoh's primary goals is to preserve such dishes, which he sees as a product of diverse, resourceful and often desperate communities. The hawker food will be lost, he fears, as the population becomes affluent and aspiring cooks can afford Western education -- culinary or otherwise. Asian cooks are opening French and Italian restaurants in the cities now, he said, and the traditional hawkers are aging. ''They are old, and their sons are old, and their grandsons go to Harvard,'' he said.
Just as many hawkers have transcended street life and the day-to-day grind, Mr. Seetoh himself has become more than a food guide. He appeared on ''Top Chef'' last season and has taught Martha Stewart to make laksa, the iconic meal-in-a-bowl of the region. Now he is a global entrepreneur, working with real estate developers to build self-contained hawker centers, populating them with his favorite cooks and tailoring the food to its neighborhood. ''In a business district, you don't want noodle soup -- too messy for office workers, and it takes too long to eat,'' he said.
Over all, he said, Southeast Asian food in New York City is about 50 percent as good as at home. To lift that number, he hopes to bring a hawker center here. ''Like Eataly, but with hawkers,'' he said. ''Wouldn't that be great?''

Recipe: Sambal Stingray in Banana Leaf
Adapted from K. F. Seetoh
Time: 1 hour
FOR THE SAMBAL
1 ounce (about 1/2 cup) dried red chilies
2 ounces (about 1/2 cup) dried small shrimp (available in Asian markets)
10 to 12 large garlic cloves
8 to 10 shallots, peeled
3-inch piece ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped
3-inch piece lemon grass, white end, coarsely chopped
1 teaspoon belachan (shrimp paste, available in Asian markets) or 2 teaspoons fish sauce
1 tablespoon tamarind paste or lime juice, more to taste
2 tablespoons light brown sugar, more to taste
1/4 cup raw peanuts
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, plus more for fish
For the fish
1 whole, skinless skate wing, 1 1/2 to 2 pounds, or firm fillets like snapper, about 3/4-inch thick
3 banana leaves (available frozen at Asian and Latin markets)
Slices of lemon and white onion, for garnish
Sprigs of cilantro, for garnish.
1. Make the sambal: In separate bowls, soak the chilies and the dried shrimp in water to cover for 10 minutes, then drain. Remove and discard stems and seeds from the chilies.
2. In a blender, combine the chilies, shrimp and remaining sambal ingredients, except the oil, with 1/2 cup water. Blend until finely chopped but not smooth. Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat and add the sambal. Cook, stirring often, until it is moist, thick and dark red, adding water 1 tablespoon at a time if needed to prevent scorching.
3. Cook the fish: Rinse and dry the fish and sprinkle it with salt. Heat a grill to high, or place a heavy skillet (with a lid) over medium-high heat. Spread one side of the fish with a thin layer of sambal. Place a banana leaf on grill (or in skillet), drizzle lightly with vegetable oil and place the fish on top, sambal side up. Cover grill or pan and cook about 8 minutes, until the banana leaf is toasted and the sambal is dry and fragrant. Remove the leaf and fish from the heat. Place a new banana leaf on grill or in pan, drizzle it with oil, flip fish onto it and spread more sambal on top. Cover and cook another 6 to 8 minutes, until cooked through.
4. Place another leaf on a platter. Flip the fish onto it, spoon more sambal over the top and garnish with lemon and onion slices and cilantro sprigs. To serve whole skate, slide the fish off the spine with a spoon.
Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

HEADLINE: In Waikiki, Fears That Construction Will Spoil Beach

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
In the public imagination, Waikiki Beach is a pristine strip of sand bracketed by coconut trees and outrigger canoes.
But after Hawaii became a state in 1959, high-rise hotels like the Rainbow Tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Sheraton Waikiki began to hide Honolulu's most famous beach behind a wall of buildings. In 1976, the Honolulu City Council created the Waikiki Special District, imposing height, density and setback requirements for new construction.
The main requirement was a 1:1 ratio between height and setback, meaning a building could only be as tall as the open space in front of it was deep.
For decades, the rules remained in place. The Halekulani, a hotel built in 1981, stands far back from the beach, behind landscaped grounds. 
But now Kyo-ya, which owns large swaths of Waikiki, is proposing a $700 million redevelopment of its Princess Kaiulani and Moana Surfrider hotels. The plan would include replacing an eight-story wing of the Moana Surfrider with a 26-story hotel and condo tower -- at 300 feet, more than twice as tall as the 1976 rules allow.
In August, the City Council approved the $150 million tower plan, in broad outline, which now requires a variance from the Department of Planning and Permitting. David Tanoue, director of the department, has until the middle of this month to decide whether to grant the variance. If Kyo-ya gets the required approvals, construction of the tower could begin in 2012, said the company's executive vice president, Greg Dickhens. But environmental groups might appeal a decision in Kyo-ya's favor.
Kyo-ya's position is clear. ''If Waikiki wants to retain its position as a leading visitor destination in a world environment, we need to reinvest in our hotel inventory,'' Mr. Dickhens said.
But critics point out that the building, mostly devoted to condominiums, will contain fewer hotel rooms than the one it is replacing. According to Mr. Dickhens, hotel rooms in Waikiki cost $600,000 or more each to build, meaning the company would have to command $600 a night to turn a profit, he said.
''In this market, it just isn't economically viable,'' he said, explaining Kyo-ya's preference for condominiums it can sell. But including some hotel rooms, Mr. Dickhens said, was essential to winning the support of the community.
When the project was first announced, the local hotel workers union, Unite Here Local 5, opposed the plan, fearing a loss of jobs. But the union relented -- on the eve of the City Council vote -- when Kyo-ya promised to include at least 60 hotel rooms in the new tower.
Whatever the final mix of condos and hotel rooms, critics say the building will overpower a beach that is already losing one to two feet a year to erosion.
Donna Wong, director of the environmental group Hawaii's Thousand Friends, said the new building would create ''a solid wall effect'' along the Waikiki shoreline, which she said ''is exactly what legislation 34 years ago was meant to prevent.'' She added, ''We find it impossible to understand why our elected officials and government planners would not work to prevent encroachment into Waikiki Beach, instead of supporting this proposal.''
In an e-mail message, Mr. Tanoue, the planning director, gave no hint of whether he would grant the variance. But, he wrote, ''a basic planning principle is that a variance should be difficult to obtain.''
To obtain the variance, Kyo-ya has to prove hardship -- that without the variance, it would be denied reasonable use of the property.
But in the case of the proposed Diamond Head tower, there is already a 141-room hotel on the property, which the company could renovate without seeking a variance, said John P. Whalen, a former director of the Honolulu Department of Land Utilization. For that reason, ''it's difficult to see how they could prove they've been denied use of their property,'' said Mr. Whalen, who now runs a private planning firm called PlanPacific (and has no stake in the Kyo-ya application).
But Mr. Dickhens said, ''We do have a hardship argument. If we stick to the zoning code, we would be limited to using about one-third of the site.'' He said the hardship was exacerbated by the state's failure to comply with a 1965 agreement to expand the beach. Since 2004, Kyo-ya has been controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, a private investment firm based in New York.
In the run-up for the City Council vote, Kyo-ya agreed to donate $50,000 to the Waikiki Health Center, for children's programs, and another $50,000 to the city for trash receptacles.
The council, in deciding whether to grant a variance, is permitted to consider offsetting ''public benefits.''
Mr. Whalen said that, in past cases, the public benefits have been physical improvements ''related to the development.''
But Mr. Tanoue, the planning director, wrote in an e-mail that ''the benefits do not need to be attached physically to the project.''
Mr. Dickhens of Kyo-ya said that the new tower, because it was thinner than the building it would replace, would open up view corridors toward the beach. He said that the hotel deserved special dispensation because its lot was the narrowest one on Waikiki beach. But critics of the plan warn of a domino effect if Kyo-ya is allowed to build its tower.
More towers like the one Kyo-ya is proposing would be a ''disaster,'' said David Lewin, general manager of the Hyatt Regency Waikiki Resort and Spa. Mr. Lewin said that if hotel companies destroyed the ambiance of Waikiki, tourism could suffer. The rules were put in place after the last round of overdevelopment, he said, so that Waikiki ''doesn't make the same mistakes twice.''
Mr. Lewin has a more immediate reason to oppose the Kyo-ya proposal. The views from some 18 floors of the Hyatt, which occupies a 1976 tower behind the Diamond Head tower site, would be diminished by the new tower. ''The rules were in place when they bought the property,'' said Mr. Lewin said of his business rival, Kyo-ya. ''Nothing has changed.''
Robert D. Harris, director of the Hawaii chapter of the Sierra Club, said his organization believed the construction on a rapidly eroding beach could mean ''the potential loss of parts of Waikiki, which he described as one of Hawaii's ''crown jewels.''
Mr. Harris added that Hawaii should be planning for climate change. ''It's critical that the state start a managed retreat away from the shoreline before the problem of sea level rise becomes imminent and critical,'' he said.
In the meantime, the state is planning a beach renourishment project, which would involve moving 24,000 cubic yards of sand to Waikiki Beach from offshore through a submerged pipe. Sam Lemmo, the state's administrator of the Office of Conservation and Coastal Lands, said the project, which is expected to begin in February, would add about 40 feet to the beach.
Most of the $2.5 million cost will be borne by taxpayers, said Mr. Lemmo.
But Kyo-ya, which will gain direct benefits from the replenishment, has agreed to pay $500,000 of the cost.

HEADLINE: Interest Rates Increase In India and Australia

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
Australia and India raised interest rates on Tuesday, highlighting the contrast between the Asia-Pacific region's rapid growth and the fragile recovery in other parts of the world.
Central banks in the United States, Europe and Japan are still propping up their economies with very low interest rates. In fact, the Federal Reserve is expected to announce additional pump-priming measures Wednesday. But many of their counterparts in developing Asia and in fast-growing Australia have been gradually nudging up the cost of borrowing this year.
Few economists had expected Australia to raise its main cash rate to 4.75 percent. It was the latest in a series of increases that began in October 2009 and now total 1.75 percentage points. 
India, too, has pushed up rates gradually this year. On Tuesday it added another quarter of a percentage point to the repurchase rate for short-term lending, making it 6.25 percent, and to the reverse repurchase rate for short-term borrowing, now at 5.25 percent.
The Reserve Bank of India cited rising inflation pressures, which have become the major concern for policy makers throughout the region, as the reason for the latest rate increase.
Unencumbered by the debt levels that are still haunting their counterparts in the West, most Asian economies are set to enjoy robust growth this year. Increasing trade within Asia, including with China, also has helped offset the declining consumer demand in the United States.
China, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia have started to increase borrowing costs, as have Brazil and other emerging market economies, though the cumulative moves by Australia and India have been among the most aggressive to date.
Australia in particular has benefited from China's enormous appetite for its natural resources, which shows few signs of abating.
''Most commodity prices have firmed, after a fall earlier in the year,'' Glenn Stevens, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said in a statement after the rate decision on Tuesday. ''The prices most important to Australia remain at very high levels, with the result that the terms of trade are at their highest since the early 1950s.''
India, meanwhile, has powered ahead thanks to the steadily increasing wealth of its huge population, while its economy has been less reliant on overseas trade.
For many such countries, rising food and energy prices, rather than slow growth, have emerged as the main worry for policy makers.
India's economy, for example, grew at a rate of 8.8 percent in the three months that ended in June, compared with the period a year earlier. But the wholesale price index for September, the last one released before the central bank's meeting, had risen at an annual rate of 8.62 percent, from 8.5 percent in August.
In Australia, inflation has remained fairly muted in recent months but still represents a worry for the future.
''The moderation in inflation that has been under way for the past two years is probably now close to ending,'' Mr. Stevens said.
The Reserve Bank of Australia's unexpected decision to stage another rate increase prompted the Australian dollar to jump on Tuesday. The currency has been steadily appreciating for months; by late afternoon in Sydney, one Australian dollar was worth almost exactly $1.
Other currencies in the region have been undergoing similar rises in recent months, as investors from slower-growing economies have sent cash into emerging markets in search of higher returns.

HEADLINE: Big Victory in New York Caps a Long Comeback

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Elizabeth A. Harris and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, completing a painstakingly plotted comeback from political ruin nearly a decade ago, won a resounding victory on Tuesday in the race for governor of New York, easily beating his Republican rival, Carl P. Paladino.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, triumphed with the help of independent voters, suburbanites and city dwellers from all corners of the state, a broad sweep that stood out as his party suffered setbacks in Congress and other statehouse races around the country.
The rise of Mr. Cuomo, 52, fulfills the restoration of a political dynasty and marks the first time a son of a New York governor has been elected to that office. Mario M. Cuomo was elected in 1982 and served three terms.
''The people of the state of New York want a government that they can trust, a government that they can be proud of once again, the government that they deserve -- and they are going to get it,'' Mr. Cuomo told a cheering crowd at a Midtown Manhattan hotel. 
Mr. Cuomo's campaign was aided by the virtual implosion of Mr. Paladino, a Buffalo real estate developer whose blunt manner and fiery rhetoric thrilled some disaffected voters, but ultimately thrust him into so many controversies that it forced him off his message of major tax and spending cuts.
Mr. Cuomo rolled up impressive tallies not only in Democratic strongholds like New York City, where early exit polls showed him collecting 8 in 10 votes, but also in the counties surrounding the city. Even upstate, he either outpolled or ran even with Mr. Paladino.
Mr. Cuomo's margin was especially lopsided among women and African-Americans, suggesting that some of Mr. Paladino's more incendiary behavior, like forwarding racially tinged and pornographic e-mails, had alienated those groups. Over all, Mr. Cuomo won by more than 20 points.
Mr. Cuomo drew support from more than 90 percent of blacks, according to the exit polling, conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool. He attracted the votes of two-thirds of women, 9 in 10 liberals and 7 in 10 moderates. White men were closely divided; Mr. Paladino ran best among less-educated whites and conservatives, who backed him three to one.
''He was done the first time he said, 'I want to take a baseball bat to Albany,' '' said Mark Sanna, 51, of Orchard Park, a suburb south of Buffalo, who works in sales. ''You can't negotiate with people when you come at them saying, 'You're just going to do what I say!' ''
Mr. Paladino sought to channel voters' anger and paint Mr. Cuomo as part of a discredited establishment. But Mr. Cuomo said that anger was not enough, and that his experience in government best equipped him to fix it.
''The people have spoken tonight and they have been loud and clear,'' Mr. Cuomo said in his victory speech. ''They are angry that they are paying for an economic recession that they didn't cause. They are frustrated when they look at the dysfunction and degradation of Albany. They're disgusted -- and they are right. And what they are saying today is they want reform and they want that government in Albany changed. And that's what they're going to get.''
Mr. Cuomo, who will be New York's 56th governor, did not mention his opponent by name, and bitterness between the candidates had become obvious in the final stretch of the campaign.
The two men did not speak before their respective speeches on Tuesday night. In Buffalo, Mr. Paladino brandished his trademark baseball bat, telling Mr. Cuomo that it represented the will of New Yorkers and suggesting that he bring it to Albany. If he did not, Mr. Paladino warned, Mr. Cuomo had not ''heard the last of Carl Paladino.'' He added, ''Keep our pitchforks at the ready and never surrender.''
Mr. Cuomo has made clear in recent interviews that he was already preparing for an even more arduous campaign: breaking the grip of labor unions and other special interests over Albany, dragging state government out of severe financial problems and restoring public faith in a political system plagued by corruption and scandal.
Mr. Cuomo significantly outspent Mr. Paladino, who entered the race vowing to spend $10 million on his own campaign but appeared on track to come in about $2 million below that.
As of his most recent campaign finance report, Mr. Cuomo had already spent more than $20 million, much of it raised from the same lobbyists, unions and business interests that typically finance elections in New York.
Mr. Cuomo shuns public introspection and dismisses much of what is written about him as tedious psychoanalysis, but his victory on Tuesday represented the culmination of a personal quest.
He endured a humiliating withdrawal from the 2002 Democratic primary for governor, a period when many party elders viewed him as brash and overambitious. But four years later, after mending fences and setting his sights slightly lower, he won election as attorney general and embarked on crusades against health insurers and student loan companies, emerging as one of the most popular elected officials in the state.
Yet while the father was a lion of his party's liberal wing, the son has positioned himself as a moderate and technocrat, pledging to rein in spending and hold the line on taxes. And while the last Governor Cuomo presided over a historic expansion of New York's government, the future Governor Cuomo has promised to shrink it.
Mr. Cuomo's decisive victory came after he ran one of the most secretive and cautious election campaigns in recent New York history, one that seemed built not around inspiring passion but on preserving his political standing in a treacherous election year much like the one that forced his father from office in 1994.
Even with the election over, Mr. Cuomo remains in some ways a remote figure to many voters, respected and admired for his work as attorney general but little known otherwise.
Rudolph B. Steward, Jr., 60, of Yonkers, a veteran on disability, said he would vote for Mr. Cuomo largely because he feared what would happen if Mr. Paladino won. ''There was nothing about Cuomo that made me vote for him,'' Mr. Steward said. ''I just did it to fight the policies of the Republicans.''
Mr. Cuomo led in the polls throughout the race, but received something of a scare in the days after Mr. Paladino's upset victory in the Republican primary, in September. The emergence of Mr. Paladino seemed to rattle the Cuomo campaign, which had been preparing to face Rick A. Lazio, a former congressman who had difficulty stirring enthusiasm among Republican voters.
But Mr. Paladino repeatedly found himself mired in controversy. He nearly came to blows with a reporter who questioned him aggressively and later opined that children should not be ''brainwashed'' into viewing homosexuality as acceptable.
As the campaign drew to a close, polls showed that large numbers of New Yorkers had deemed Mr. Paladino unfit to be governor.
Mr. Cuomo suggested in his speech that Mr. Paladino was part of a polarizing movement that persuaded voters elsewhere but failed to sway New Yorkers.
''The people of this state today say you're not going to divide us, you're not going to separate us, you can try it somewhere else but you're not going to sell that in New York,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Running Shorts. Singlet. Shoes?

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
If running 26.2 miles in a couple of hours seems daunting, imagine doing it barefoot.
Barefoot runners are still a tiny number of the more than 43,000 expected to race in the New York City Marathon on Sunday, but organizers say they have seen an increase in runners who are interested in the trend.
''I feel like I get asked at least weekly, if not more,'' said Mary Wittenberg, chief executive of the New York Road Runners, which organizes the marathon and other races throughout the year. 
Barefoot runners are not new to marathon courses -- Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia won the marathon in bare feet at the 1960 Rome Olympics -- but their ranks have grown in recent years, prompted in part by a bestselling book that promotes the practice and the arrival on the market of several lightweight, thin-soled shoes designed to mimic the feel of running barefoot. The Barefoot Runners Society, a national club for unshod runners, claims 1,345 members, nearly double the 680 members it had in November 2009, when it was founded.
''This barefooting thing isn't new, but it is newly popular,'' said David Willey, editor in chief of Runner's World magazine, which published an article on the so-called minimalist shoes in its November issue. ''The appeal of this is obvious, especially right now with where the economy is and the sort of macrotrends in the culture that are going back to simplicity. This feeds right into that.''
Barefoot enthusiasts, as well as those who run in minimalist shoes, say their method is easier on the body because it is closer to the way that humans evolved to run. The theory has been popularized by the book ''Born to Run'' by Christopher McDougall, who plans to run the New York City Marathon barefoot this year.
One convert is Rick Roeber of Kansas City, Mo., who began running barefoot in 2003 and has run 54 marathons without shoes, including the New York City Marathon in 2007. Roeber, who runs in Missouri winters through snow and ice, said he had persistent knee problems until he made the switch, and he has been injury-free ever since.
''When I was growing up, I was barefoot a lot, so I could run gravel roads when I was a kid,'' said Roeber, who goes by the nickname Barefoot Rick. ''When the idea hit me to start running barefoot, I was like, yeah, why not?''
As the practice has grown in popularity, however, it has drawn criticism from podiatrists who say there is no scientific research that shows barefoot running reduces injuries. The American Podiatric Medical Association recently released a statement urging runners to be wary of the method, noting the lack of peer-reviewed studies and expressing concern it could lead to puncture wounds from road debris or added stress in the lower extremities.
''The surfaces that we tend to run on now are different than what our ancestors were running on when they were running barefoot,'' said James Christina, a podiatrist and the director of scientific affairs at the podiatric association.
Jeffrey Ross, a podiatrist in Houston who specializes in treating runners, said he had seen six patients over the last three months with injuries that he attributed to running barefoot or in minimalist shoes. ''Now it's become a standard question, what are you running in?'' he said.
One of his patients, Barbara Callistien, fractured the second metatarsal bone in her left foot this summer, an injury she attributed to the pair of minimalist Newtons that she had recently bought. Callistien said she tried to ease into the shoes by wearing them on a treadmill for three weeks, but she injured her foot the first time she wore them outside.
Callistien, who is 51, said she partly blamed herself because she was prone to injury and should have known better. But ''you get caught up in a craze,'' she said. ''Everybody gets excited by this idea and they forget to insert common sense.''
Not everyone in the medical community is opposed to the practice. One proponent is Irene Davis, who is director of the Running Injury Clinic at the University of Delaware. Although she agreed that more research was needed into whether barefoot running prevents injury, she said that there was also no evidence that running with shoes prevents injuries. Running barefoot forces a change in gait, where the forefoot strikes first instead of the heel. Davis has done research showing that landing on the forefoot has less impact.
''There are these little pieces of information that when you take them collectively, at least have to make you stop and go hmm,'' she said.
Medical directors at the Twin Cities, Boston and New York marathons said they have not seen any injuries more serious than a blister among the small number of runners who go barefoot, noting that they have more serious issues to worry about, like cardiac arrest.
Roeber said he was still seen as an oddity on marathon courses. ''It's like an alien landed,'' he said. ''The reaction I get the most is, 'Oh my God, he doesn't have shoes on.' ''
One of the biggest challenges facing a shoeless marathon runner is where to place the computer chip that records a competitor's time. Typically, the chips are affixed to shoelaces. Roeber fastens a leather strap around his ankle. Others use dog collars. Angie Bishop of Des Moines, who ran her first barefoot marathon in October, uses a shoelace looped around her middle toes like a huarache sandal.
She said her reception as a barefoot runner had changed noticeably compared with a year ago, when she ran a half-marathon.
''This year people were very interested in telling me about their barefoot running experience, or how they're really curious about it,'' she said.
Bishop and others said many of the concerns about barefoot running evaporate once you try it. Sidewalks and roads are not as hazardous as one might imagine, she said, adding that she has learned to jog around debris like glass or twigs. She stepped on a garter snake while running through grass, so she makes a point of running exclusively on concrete or asphalt.
One place Bishop does wear shoes is inside her house: she once hurt her foot stepping on a stegosaurus toy in the middle of the night. ''I have four boys,'' she said. ''There's always something on the floor to step on.''

HEADLINE: $68.9 Million Modigliani Gets Auction Season Off to a Healthy Start

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Classic images from art history, a doe-eyed female nude by Modigliani and a seminal Monet waterlily attracted bidders from around the world on Tuesday night at Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern art.
It was the start of the fall auction season, and despite the mixed bag of works on offer -- many were familiar, mediocre or both -- international collectors, some from countries by now famous for new money, kept prices at healthy levels.
''It's designer brands for new buyers,'' said Rory Howard, a private art dealer from London, referring to the appeal of big names. ''Art as fashion.'' 
Few seemed to care that many of the paintings had been on the auction market in recent years, some of them more than once. The evening's star, for example, Modigliani's 1917 portrait ''Nude Sitting on a Divan (The Beautiful Roman Woman),'' was sold at Sotheby's in 1999, when it brought $16.7 million, an auction record for the artist at the time. On Tuesday night, history repeated itself, as Sotheby's representatives from Hong Kong, Paris, Geneva, Tokyo, Moscow and New York competed tenaciously for the painting.
Roberta Louckx, a Sotheby's representative based in New York and known to work with Russians, was the winner for her client, who is paying $68.9 million, including Sotheby's fees. That was well above the $40 million estimate and eclipsed the previous auction record for the artist, which was set in June at Christie's in Paris when a limestone head by Modigliani sold for $52.6 million.
Putting the Modigliani early in the evening helped bolster buyers' confidence, and all told, Sotheby's managed to sell 46 of its 61 works in a sale that totaled $227.5 million, in the middle of its estimate of $195 million to $266 million.
Given the shaky economy, the auction house was cautious going into the sale. The Modigliani and a 1942 Matisse had been presold. Sotheby's had arranged what it calls irrevocable bids for both works, meaning that buyers had already agreed to purchase the art for undisclosed sums. If someone else wanted to pay more, the original bidder would get a percentage of the profit.
As there were with the Modigliani, there were many takers for the Matisse, ''Dancer in an Armchair With a Checkered Floor,'' despite its irrevocable bid. That painting, which depicts Carla Avogardo, a dancer friend of the artist, in a bright yellow chair against a background of black and white checks, had been estimated at $12 million to $18 million but ended up selling for $18.5 million, or $20.8 million with fees. The buyer was Mark Politmore, deputy chairman of Sotheby's Europe and the Middle East.
The Matisse had been on the market at Sotheby's twice since 2000, once bringing $7.4 million and the last time, in London in 2007, $21.7 million.
A Matisse bronze of two embracing naked figures conceived in 1907 and cast around 1930 fared less well, selling to Alan Hobart, a London dealer, for $7.5 million, or $8.4 million with fees, just above its $8 million low estimate. The same sculpture had last been sold at Christie's in 2001 for $7.5 million.
(Final prices include the buyer's commission to Sotheby's: 25 percent of the first $50,000; 20 percent of the next $50,000 to $1 million; and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
Ted Arison, the founder of Carnival Cruise Lines, and his wife, Lin, bought the Monet waterlily paintings at Sotheby's sale of art from the Reader's Digest Collection in 1998, a year before Mr. Arison died. On Tuesday night Ms. Arison sold the work, which was painted from 1917 to 1919, for $25.7 million, well within the estimate of $20 million to $30 million, but more than twice the $9.9 million that the Arisons had paid. The proceeds will benefit YoungArts, a program of the National Foundation for Advancement in the Arts in Miami, which supports emerging artists.
Ms. Arison was also selling another Modigliani portrait from 1917, ''Jeanne Hebuterne Wearing a Hat,'' which depicts the artist's mistress and muse. The couple bought it at a Sotheby's auction in 1996 for $3.5 million. This time it was estimated at $9 million to $12 million, but four telephone bidders went for the painting and it ended up selling for $19.1 million. Proceeds from that work are also going to YoungArts.
Late Picassos have been all the rage in recent years, but not on Tuesday night. Of the two on offer, ''Man and Woman With a Bouquet,'' from 1970, failed to get a single bid, and ''Man With a Flag,'' from 1969, which had been estimated to bring $5 million to $7 million, sold to a telephone bidder for $4.7 million, or $5.3 million with fees.
''It's a sensible market,'' Nicholas Maclean, a private dealer, said after the sale. ''Things that were average or overpriced didn't do well.''
As for the Modigliani nude, Mr. Maclean explained: ''The timing was perfect. Few Modliglianis have come on the market. It's what collectors have been looking for.''

HEADLINE: New Owners, Less Debt Give Rangers A Shot at Lee

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR and KEN BELSON

 BODY:
In five months, the Texas Rangers went from bankruptcy to playing in the World Series.
They went from borrowing $40 million from Major League Baseball to stay afloat to vowing to aggressively pursue their free-agent pitcher, Cliff Lee, against certain competition from the Yankees.
Team ownership changed in August from Tom Hicks, who weighed down the Rangers with debt that exceeded M.L.B.'s limits, to a group led by Nolan Ryan and Chuck Greenberg, who have a cleaner balance sheet because of the bankruptcy and deep-pocketed investors backing them. 
Bob Simpson, one of those investors, told The Fort Worth Star-Telegram last week, ''We're going to go after Cliff Lee -- hard, and we have the financial firepower to do that.''
He added, ''Guys like Josh Hamilton, we will take care of those guys.''
Now the question is whether a team that had the 26th-lowest opening day payroll, at $55.2 million, truly has the wherewithal to match up against bigger spenders like the Yankees, the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Angels. The Rangers' owners have room to add to their payroll, but will they do it with an unwavering plan or will they execute it willy-nilly, as Hicks did when he overpaid a megastar like Alex Rodriguez or over-the-hill players like Juan Gonzalez, Rafael Palmeiro and Chan Ho Park?
''They should be able to approach a $100 million payroll in two or three years and still be fine,'' said Marc Ganis, a sports industry consultant. ''But if they mistakenly try to be the Yankees, they will go into a major economic slide. They could be a strong next-echelon team.''
The Rangers are certainly better positioned than they were recently under Hicks. Simpson and Ray Davis, the other lead investor, say they are willing to spend to maintain the team's momentum -- and they are free of Hicks's massive debt load. Attendance at Rangers Ballpark increased by 15.7 percent to 2.5 million this season, and the team will get an extra revenue kick from postseason games.
Usually, a successful team that goes as far as the World Series can expect increases in revenues from attendance, sponsorships, concessions and suite rentals.
Vince Gennaro, a consultant to several major league teams, said: ''Drawing 2.8 million is very conservative. Three million is probably more likely.'' He said that after the Chicago White Sox won the 2005 World Series, their season ticket base nearly doubled to 25,000.
But the Rangers still owe $45 million to former players like Rodriguez (they have already funded the liability, which Hicks did not) and took on bank debt of about $189 million to buy the team.
One positive indicator of the Rangers' future financial health was the signing in late September of a contract worth $1.6 billion to $2 billion with Fox Sports Southwest to carry the team's games on cable for 20 years starting in 2015. According to several reports, the Rangers got $80 million to $100 million upfront on a deal that will pay about $50 million to start, with payments rising incrementally each year.
But increased revenues from various sources might soon lead the Rangers to start paying into baseball's revenue sharing pool, rather than receive payments, as they have the last two years.
The Rangers certainly seem poised to absorb the extra salary they will have to pay Lee and Hamilton. Lee earned $9 million this year with Seattle and Texas and will likely get a deal like the seven-year, $161 million contract that C. C. Sabathia signed with the Yankees in 2008.
Hamilton is not a free agent but is eligible for arbitration for the second straight season. He avoided arbitration in 2010 and signed for one year at $3.25 million. But he will probably double or triple that in 2011, especially if he is voted the American League's most valuable player.
''Lee's a big-game pitcher and those pitchers command a high price,'' said Jim Duquette, a former Mets general manager who is a commentator for Sirius XM Radio. ''He has every right to compare himself to C. C. but he probably won't get that money, or to what the Mets paid Santana,'' he said, referring to Mets pitcher Johan Santana.
He said the Rangers could try to sign Hamilton to a long-term deal that would take him past his first chance to be a free agent in 2013.
''Sometimes you can do something like that especially with where he's been in his life,'' he said referring to Hamilton's drug and alcohol problems.
Beyond Lee, the Rangers do not have a lot of free agents due huge contracts and could reduce their payroll if they buy out the mutual option on Vladimir Guerrero, who would get $9 million next year.
Guerrero had a terrific regular season but faltered in the World Series. Third baseman Michael Young, their highest-paid player at $13.2 million, is locked up through 2013; second baseman Ian Kinsler has a contract through 2012; outfielder Nelson Cruz is now eligible for arbitration but younger players who emerged this season, like relief pitcher Neftali Feliz and shortstop Elvis Andrus, are not.
The Rangers' off-season might well be defined by whether they can keep Lee.
''There's pressure on them,'' Duquette said. ''They gave up a lot of talent, like Justin Smoak, to get him, so signing him would justify giving up that talent.''
But the Yankees lurk with a reputation burnished for more than a decade of signing the free agents they want. In 2008, they executed the sort of triple play unimaginable to other teams: they signed Sabathia, Mark Teixeira and A. J. Burnett to more than $420 million in long-term contracts.
But if they signed Lee, who is 32, to a five-year contract at $20 million or more per season, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman would be adding another aging, highly paid player. In 2013, for instance, Sabathia (who last week had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee) will turn 33; Derek Jeter will be 39; Mariano Rivera will be 43 and Rodriguez will be 38. Jeter and Rivera are heading into salary talks.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Nov. 3 about the Texas Rangers' finances and their chances of re-signing the pitching ace Cliff Lee misstated, in some editions, the surname of a relief pitcher who will not be eligible for arbitration. He is Neftali Feliz, not Perez.

The Tea Party movement set the agenda in its first midterms, its energy propelling the Republican sweep in the House and capturing the mood of a significant chunk of the electorate, with a remarkable 4 in 10 voters in exit polls expressing support for the movement.
But in the Senate, the effect was exactly what establishment Republicans had feared: While Tea Party energy powered some victories, concerns about Tea Party extremism also cost them what could have been easy gains -- most notably in Nevada, where the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, survived a challenge from Sharron Angle, a Tea Party favorite.
Now, as it tries to make the transition from a protest movement to a power on Capitol Hill, the Tea Party faces the challenge of channeling the energy it brought to the election into a governing agenda when it has no clear mandate, a stated distaste for the inevitable compromises of legislating, and a wary relationship with Republican leaders in Congress.
For many voters the Tea Party has been a blank screen on which they have projected all kinds of hopes and frustrations -- not always compatible or realistic. 
To many in the movement, the singular goal is to stop an expanding government in its tracks, to ''hold the line at all hazards,'' as Jennifer Stefano, a Tea Party leader in Pennsylvania, put it.
But the movement is also animated by a belief that the entire political system has become disconnected from the practical needs and values of Americans, suggesting that its voting power stemmed as much from a populist sense of outrage in a tough economic moment as it did from ideology. What many of its adherents want as much as anything is for the two parties to come together to solve problems.
That sometimes conflicting mandate was neatly captured by two interviews in Searchlight, Nev., hometown of Mr. Reid, who became the Tea Party's biggest target. ''I want to see gridlock,'' said Ronald Hanvey, who supported Ms. Angle. ''I don't want to see any more laws.''
A few months earlier on nearly the same spot, Jeff Church, arriving at a Tea Party rally against Mr. Reid, complained equally about the state's Republican senator, John Ensign, and yearned for bipartisanship. ''Why can't they get along and make some common-sense solutions?'' Mr. Church asked.
In the Senate, the Tea Party carried to victory Marco Rubio in Florida and Rand Paul in Kentucky. Still, it cost the Republicans some seats that they had once counted as solid, including one in Delaware, where Christine O'Donnell, who beat an establishment candidate in the primary thanks to strong Tea Party support, lost to Chris Coons, a Democrat once considered a long shot.
Even more painful for Republicans was the result in Nevada. Mr. Reid, once considered the most vulnerable Democrat, fought off Ms. Angle, who had made headlines for her controversial and sometimes eccentric remarks.
House races showed the same win-loss effect.
Looking ahead, the immediate focus for the movement will be on the big legislative issues facing Congress. But as attention inevitably shifts to 2012, the Tea Party will also have the chance to exert potentially substantial influence on the race for the Republican presidential nomination, with a variety of potential candidates, including Sarah Palin and Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, maneuvering to lead it into the next election.
For the Republican Congressional leaders, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the question is whether the passion of the Tea Party translates into an agenda that can drive legislative progress in a divided capital, or whether it becomes a prod to block Mr. Obama and his party at every turn. They want to keep the movement's energy alive through the next presidential election -- but not fall captive to it.
A year spent observing the contours of Tea Party America revealed an uneasy alliance within it, between those who came to the movement with unswerving ideology, generally libertarian, and those who say they came to it more out of frustration and a desire to feel that they were doing something to move forward when the country seemed stuck.
The much-mocked sign at a health care town hall last summer, ''Keep your government hands off my Medicare,'' suggested how many Tea Party supporters had come to the movement without thinking through the specifics. While the more ideological Tea Party supporters embrace ideas like phasing out Social Security and Medicare in favor of private savings accounts, most do not.
And just as Tea Party supporters do not always agree on what the agenda is, most Americans disagree with many of the goals proclaimed by Tea Party candidates.
While incoming Tea Party lawmakers like Mr. Paul have advocated sharp across-the-board cuts in federal spending, a Pew Research Center poll last week found that a plurality of Americans disapproved of a proposal to freeze all government spending except the part that goes to national security. A majority disapproved of permanently extending the Bush-era tax cuts on incomes greater than $250,000.
A New York Times/CBS News poll last month similarly found opposition to raising the retirement age or reducing Social Security or Medicare benefits for future retirees. And a plurality of voters disagreed with what is perhaps the Tea Party movement's most widely supported goal: repealing the health care overhaul passed in March.
Even where the public agrees on parts of the Republican-Tea Party agenda, there are important qualifiers. A slight majority in the Pew poll approved of changing Social Security to allow private accounts, but only by the same margin as when President George W. Bush advanced the cause in 2005, only to see it fail when people read the fine print.
The most ardent Tea Party activists expect Republicans to hew to their desires.
Even before polls closed Tuesday, FreedomWorks, the libertarian advocacy group that has helped shape the movement from its earliest hours, put out a press release declaring, ''The success of the G.O.P. will not merely benefit from the Tea Party vote, it will depend on it.''
David Adams, a Tea Party activist in Kentucky who ran Mr. Paul's primary campaign, said, ''I'm hoping for a lot of fireworks in Washington over who takes control of who.
''If Republican leaders think for a minute that they're going to suck us in and continue business as usual,'' he said, ''they're wrong.''
Like many other Tea Party supporters, Mr. Adams said the biggest goals are to balance the budget and reduce the national debt. And on those, it was unclear where he was willing to compromise. He expects lawmakers like Mr. Paul who campaigned on a promise to balance the federal budget within a year and pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to put forward proposals to do so. It would not be enough, Mr. Adams said, to reach an agreement to, say, balance the budget over five years.
Mr. Adams's list also includes changing Social Security and Medicare, cutting the military budget, replacing the income tax with a flat tax -- all ideas that have been raised and voted down, firmly, before. As for repealing the health care legislation? ''I can't imagine much compromise there,'' he said.
''You look at what the Tea Party has done over the course of this last year, we've changed the shape of the debate,'' he said. ''We have major candidates who are winning races by large margins by talking about making government smaller. We're getting very, very close to put-up-or-shut-up time.''
There was not much room for compromise on Ms. Stefano's list, either. She wants the health care bill and the estate tax to be repealed, and the Bush-era tax cuts to be made permanent.
She warned Republicans not to read too much into the Tea Party support for Republicans. ''They should not see it as a mandate for their agenda,'' she said. ''It is a repudiation of the president and Nancy Pelosi's view of America. As far as I'm concerned, as of Nov. 3, the Republicans are on probation.''
But as much as the Tea Party allowed the Republicans to win in enthusiasm, it will still have a relatively small caucus in the House and the Senate. With control of Congress split, Republicans will have to work with Democrats to get things done. Tea Party lawmakers who refuse to go along may find they become irrelevant -- certainly not the goal of all the noise and passion of the last two years.

HEADLINE: Patrick Hangs On as Massachusetts Governor

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Gov. Deval Patrick won a second term in Massachusetts on Tuesday despite an aggressive challenge from his Republican opponent, Charlie Baker.
Mr. Patrick also defeated State Treasurer Tim Cahill, who ran as an independent, and Jill Stein, the Green-Rainbow Party candidate, in a race that focused almost entirely on how to create more jobs.
With 95 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Patrick had captured 48 percent of the vote, compared with 41 percent for Mr. Baker, 8 percent for Mr. Cahill and 1 percent for Ms. Stein. 
A former civil rights lawyer and corporate executive who draws comparisons with President Obama, Mr. Patrick sailed into office in 2006 after dazzling voters with a message of hope and change. But he clashed with the Democratic-controlled Legislature through much of his first term, and by this year, his approval ratings had sunk so low that he seemed to have little chance of re-election.
When the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy's seat went to a Republican, Scott Brown, in January's special election, the timing seemed perfect for Republicans to take back the governor's office as well. Mr. Patrick, 54, is the state's first Democratic governor since Michael S. Dukakis left office in 1991. When Gov. David Paterson of New York leaves office at the end of the year, Mr. Patrick will also be the nation's only black governor.
In his victory speech, Mr. Patrick appeared intent on healing partisan divisions, saying that he was not just ''the governor of the Democrats.''
''We must be, all of us, about lifting the whole Commonwealth up,'' Mr. Patrick said, ''not tearing anyone down, and modeling for a nation hungry for something positive to believe in.''
The Republican Party had high hopes for Mr. Baker, the former chief executive of one of the state's largest insurers, who was also a well-respected aide to two governors in the 1990s. He sought to persuade voters that with both houses of the legislature under Democratic control, they should put a Republican back in the governor's office to restore the balance of power and get the state's spending under control.
But Mr. Baker, 53, did not seem to connect well with voters, and he suffered constant attacks from Mr. Patrick for his role in how the state financed Boston's infamous Big Dig highway project. As the state's budget chief under Govs. William F. Weld and Paul Cellucci, from 1994 to 1998, Mr. Baker wrote a financing plan for the project that Mr. Patrick called ''a great big albatross around the necks'' of taxpayers.
Mr. Patrick also painted himself as the compassionate candidate, warning that Mr. Baker would heedlessly slash programs and services. And he stressed that Massachusetts had not suffered as much fallout from the economic downturn as many other states.
Though Mr. Cahill injected drama into the race -- both Mr. Patrick and Mr. Baker feared he would siphon away some of their voters, and his running mate abandoned him -- he had little impact in the end.
The Democrats, who were taken off guard by Mr. Brown's victory last winter, organized an unusually fierce ground campaign on Mr. Patrick's behalf, focusing on areas of the state where Mr. Brown did well along with traditional Democratic strongholds. They were especially focused on the state's 10th Congressional district, including Cape Cod, where a hotly contested race for Representative William Delahunt's open seat brought out a lot of voters.
The Democrat in that race, William Keating, defeated the Republican, Jeffrey Perry; Democratic incumbents also prevailed in the state's other House races, defying the expectation that Mr. Brown's win might start a Republican revolution here.
The governor's race did not take on as bitter a partisan tone as others around the country, and Mr. Baker called for unity in his concession speech.
''It's important that all of us get behind the governor,'' he said, ''and do all that we can to make sure that he succeeds in pulling our economy out of the doldrums and getting us back on the right track.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. TAKES HOUSE; Reid Is Re-elected and Keeps Leader's Job

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Megan Thee-Brenan, David M. Herszenhorn and Michael Luo contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Republicans captured control of the House of Representatives on Tuesday and expanded their voice in the Senate, riding a wave of voter discontent as they dealt a setback to President Obama just two years after his triumphal victory.
A Republican resurgence, propelled by deep economic worries and a forceful opposition to the Democratic agenda of health care and government spending, delivered defeats to House Democrats from the Northeast to the South and across the Midwest. The tide swept aside dozens of lawmakers, regardless of their seniority or their voting records, upending the balance of power for the second half of Mr. Obama's term.
But Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, narrowly prevailed and his party hung onto control by winning hard-fought contests in California, Delaware, Connecticut and West Virginia. Republicans picked up at least six Democratic seats, including the one formerly held by Mr. Obama, and the party will welcome Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky to their ranks, two candidates who were initially shunned by the establishment but beloved by the Tea Party movement.
''The American people's voice was heard at the ballot box,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, who is positioned to become the next speaker of the House. ''We have real work to do, and this is not the time for celebration.'' 
The president, who watched the election returns with a small set of advisers at the White House, called Mr. Boehner shortly after midnight to offer his congratulations and to talk about the way forward as Washington prepares for divided government. Republicans won at least 58 seats, not including those from some Western states where ballots were still being counted, surpassing the 52 seats the party won in the sweep of 1994.
The most expensive midterm election campaign in the nation's history, fueled by a raft of contributions from outside interest groups and millions in donations to candidates in both parties, played out across a wide battleground that stretched from Alaska to Maine. The Republican tide swept into statehouse races, too, with Democrats poised to lose the majority of governorships, particularly those in key presidential swing states, like Ohio, where Gov. Ted Strickland was defeated.
One after another, once-unassailable Democrats like Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, Representatives Ike Skelton of Missouri, John Spratt of South Carolina, Rick Boucher of Virginia and Chet Edwards of Texas fell to little-known Republican challengers.
''Voters sent a message that change has not happened fast enough,'' said Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
Republicans did not achieve a perfect evening, losing races in several states they had once hoped to win, including the Senate contests in Delaware and Connecticut, because some candidates supported by the Tea Party movement knocked out establishment candidates to win their nominations. But they did score notable victories in some tight races, like Pat Toomey's Senate run in Pennsylvania.
Senator Reid said in a speech that he was ''more determined than ever'' after his victory. ''I know what it's like to get back on your feet.''
The outcome on Tuesday was nothing short of a remarkable comeback for Republicans two years after they suffered a crushing defeat in the White House and four years after Democrats swept control of the House and Senate. It places the party back in the driver's seat in terms of policy, posing new challenges to Mr. Obama as he faces a tough two years in his term, but also for Republicans -- led by Mr. Boehner -- as he suddenly finds himself in a position of responsibility, rather than being simply the outsider.
In the House, Republicans found victories in most corners of the country, including five seats in Pennsylvania, five in Ohio, at least three in Florida, Illinois and Virginia and two in Georgia. Democrats braced for the prospect of historic defeats, more than the 39 seats the Republicans needed to win control. Republicans reached their majority by taking seats east of the Mississippi even before late results flowed in from farther West.
Throughout the evening, in race after race, Republican challengers defeated Democratic incumbents, despite being at significant fund-raising disadvantages. Republican-oriented independent groups invariably came to the rescue, helping level of the playing field, including in Florida's 24th Congressional District, in which Sandy Adams defeated Representative Suzanne Kosmas; Virginia's 9th Congressional District, where Mr. Boucher, a 14-term incumbent, lost to Morgan Griffith; and Texas's 17th Congressional District, in which Mr. Edwards, who was seeking his 11th term, succumbed to Bill Flores.
Democrats argued that the Republican triumph was far from complete, particularly in the Senate, pointing to the preservation of Mr. Reid and other races. In Delaware, Chris Coons defeated Christine O'Donnell, whose candidacy became a symbol of the unorthodox political candidates swept onto the ballot in Republican primary contests. In West Virginia, Gov. Joe Manchin III, a Democrat, triumphed over an insurgent Republican rival to fill the seat held for a half-century by Senator Robert C. Byrd. And in California, Senator Barbara Boxer overcame a vigorous challenge from Carly Fiorina, a Republican.
But Democrats conceded that their plans to increase voter turnout did not meet expectations, party strategists said, and extraordinary efforts that Mr. Obama made in the final days of the campaign appeared to have borne little fruit.
The president flew to Charlottesville, Va., on Friday evening, for instance, in hopes of rallying Democrats to support Representative Tom Perriello, a freshman who supported every piece of the administration's agenda, but he was defeated despite the president's appeals to Democrats in a state that he carried two years ago.
In governors' races, Republicans won several contests in the nation's middle. They held onto governorships in Texas, Nebraska and South Dakota, and had seized seats now occupied by Democrats in Tennessee, Michigan and Kansas. Sam Brownback, a United States Senator and Republican, easily took the Kansas post that Mark Parkinson, a former Republican turned Democrat, is leaving behind.
Though Democrats, who before the election held 26 governors' seats compared to 24 for the Republicans, were expected to face losses, there were also bright spots. In New York, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo easily defeated the Republican, Carl P. Paladino, even as Republicans were expected to pick up seats in the state legislature and the congressional delegation. In Massachusetts, Gov. Deval Patrick won a second term.
As the election results rolled in, with Republicans picking up victories shortly after polls closed in states across the South, East and the Midwest, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and other party leaders made urgent appeals through television interviews that there was still time for voters in other states to cast their ballots.
But the mood in Democratic quarters was glum, with few early signs of optimism in House or Senate races that were called early in the evening. Surveys that were conducted with voters across the country also provided little sense of hope for Democrats, with Republicans gaining a majority of independents, college-educated people and suburbanites -- all groups that were part of the coalition of voters who supported Mr. Obama two years ago.
''We've come to take our government back,'' Mr. Paul told cheering supporters who gathered in Bowling Green, Ky. ''They say that the U.S. Senate is the world's most deliberative body. I'm going to ask them to deliberate on this: The American people are unhappy with what's going on in Washington.''
The election was a referendum on President Obama and the Democratic agenda, according to interviews with voters that were conducted for the National Election Pool, a consortium of television networks and The Associated Press, with a wide majority of the electorate saying that the country was seriously off track. Nearly nine in 10 voters said they were worried about the economy and about 4 in 10 said their family's situation had worsened in the last two years.
The surveys found that voters were even more dissatisfied with Congress now than they were in 2006, when Democrats reclaimed control from the Republicans. Preliminary results also indicated an electorate far more conservative than four years ago, a sign of stronger turnout by people leaning toward Republicans.
Most voters said they believed Mr. Obama's policies would hurt the country in the long run, rather than help it, and a large share of voters said they supported the Tea Party movement, which has backed insurgent candidates all across the country.
The Republican winds began blowing back in January when Democrats lost the seat long held by Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, with the victory of Scott P. Brown serving as a motivating force for the budding Tea Party movement and a burst of inspiration for Republican candidates across the country to step forward and challenge Democrats everywhere.
On Tuesday, the president did not leave the grounds of the White House, taking a respite from days of campaigning across the country, so he could meet with a circle of top advisers to plot a way forward for his administration and his own looming re-election campaign. The White House said Mr. Obama would hold a news conference on Wednesday to address the governing challenges that await the new Congress.
''My hope is that I can cooperate with Republicans,'' Mr. Obama said in a radio interview on Tuesday. ''But obviously, the kinds of compromises that will be made depends on what Capitol Hill looks like -- who's in charge.''
But even as the president was poised to offer a fresh commitment to bipartisanship, he spent the final hours of the midterm campaign trying to persuade Democrats in key states to take time to vote. From the Oval Office, Mr. Obama conducted one radio interview after another, urging black voters in particular to help preserve the party's majority and his agenda.
''How well I'm able to move my agenda forward over the next couple of years is going to depend on folks back home having my back,'' Mr. Obama said in an interview with the Chicago radio station WGCI, in which he made an unsuccessful appeal for voters to keep his former Senate seat in Democratic hands.
There was little Democratic terrain across the country that seemed immune to Republican encroachment, with many of the most competitive races being waged in states that Mr. Obama carried strongly only two years ago. From the president's home state of Illinois to neighboring Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio -- all places that were kind to the Democratic ticket in 2008 -- Republicans worked aggressively to find new opportunities.
For all the drama surrounding the final day of the midterm campaign, more than 19 million Americans had voted before Tuesday, a trend that has grown with each election cycle over the last decade, as 32 states now offer a way for voters to practice democracy in far more convenient ways than simply waiting in line on Election Day.

HEADLINE: Japan Recalls Ambassador In Island Dispute With Russia

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Ellen Barry contributed reporting from Moscow.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- A diplomatic clash between Japan and Russia over disputed islands intensified on Tuesday when Japan summoned home its ambassador to Moscow, a day after President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia angered Tokyo by visiting one of the islands.
Russian officials said they were perplexed by Japan's response and upped the ante by saying that Mr. Medvedev was planning a return trip to the islands. 
''This morning, I spoke to Dmitri Anatolyevich Medvedev, who expressed his satisfaction with his trip to Kunashir,'' said Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, during a news conference in Oslo, referring to the island called Kunashiri by Japan. ''President Medvedev also said that he plans to visit the other islands.''
Mr. Medvedev's trip to the island, which sits at the southern end of the Russian-controlled Kurile Islands chain, was seen as a diplomatic snub in Tokyo, coming just weeks after Japan seemed to suffer a setback in a territorial dispute with another neighbor, China.
In that standoff, Japanese prosecutors released a Chinese trawler captain who had been arrested near a different group of disputed islands after Beijing raised the pressure by detaining four Japanese businessmen and cutting off high-level talks.
Japan's foreign minister, Seiji Maehara, said the nation's ambassador to Russia would return to Tokyo to brief officials on Mr. Medvedev's visit on Monday to one of the disputed islands, which were seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Russia will not recall its ambassador in Japan to Moscow.
Both sides confirmed that Prime Minister Naoto Kan and Mr. Medvedev would still meet, as planned, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Yokohama, Japan, next week.
''We will say what we ought to say,'' Mr. Maehara said, ''but our intention to aim for settling the territorial dispute with Russia and conclude a bilateral peace treaty to boost our two nations' economic ties remains unchanged.''
Mr. Kan has tried unsuccessfully to hold a formal meeting with Chinese leaders since the standoff over the trawler captain in September. The arrest set off anti-Japanese protests in China, while Beijing's strong response prompted Japanese leaders to reassess their nation's growing economic dependence on China.
On Tuesday in Beijing, a Chinese spokesman rebuffed an offer by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to mediate the dispute. The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Ma Zhaoxu, also criticized Mrs. Clinton for saying that the islands, known as the Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese, fall under the protection of Washington's security pact with Tokyo.
''The dispute over the islands with Japan is a matter between China and Japan,'' Mr. Ma said in a statement, and the United States should ''correct its wrongful stance immediately.''
Japan's dispute with Russia has divided the two countries for more than half a century, preventing them from signing a formal peace treaty to conclude World War II. Russia refers to the disputed islands as the Southern Kuriles, while Japan calls them the Northern Territories.
Mr. Medvedev is the first Russian or Soviet leader to visit the disputed islands, and he made it clear that despite Japan's demands, Russia had no plans to cede the territory, which is rich with minerals and fish.
''There are so many beautiful places in Russia!'' wrote Mr. Medvedev on his TwitPic page, under a photograph he had taken during his visit to the island the Russians call Kunashir.
The visit clearly shored up Mr. Medvedev's popularity at home, at a moment when his approval ratings are -- for the first time in his presidency -- equal to those of Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin.
As soon as Japan's prime minister warned Mr. Medvedev against making the trip, in September, he had to go through with it, said Konstantin V. Remchukov, editor of the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, in a radio commentary.
''If President Medvedev wants to be president after 2012, then he should show the domestic conservative electorate that he makes up his own mind about where he flies,'' Mr. Remchukov said.

HEADLINE: An Effort to Adapt A European-Style Tool To U.S. Mortgages

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
Covered bonds, a financing tool that has been popular in Europe since the 18th century, are winning converts here as a new way to finance residential and commercial mortgages.
A covered bond is a securitized debt instrument backed by a pool of high-quality assets, usually mortgages. But unlike the assets in a securitized mortgage bond, the assets in a covered bond, known as a cover pool, are kept on the issuer's balance sheet. This may provide an extra measure of safety, as the issuer will be less likely to underwrite risky loans, experts say.
There is no established market for the bonds in the United States, though they are a $3 trillion business overseas and lately have been attracting American institutional investors. This year, Representative Scott Garrett, Republican of New Jersey, introduced a bill that would establish a covered bond framework here. 
The House Financial Services Committee passed the bill in July, and it narrowly missed being included in the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. Experts predict that covered bond legislation could pass both houses next year.
A covered bond has several characteristics that protect the bondholder: The assets in the cover pool are subjected to monthly monitoring by an independent third party, and should one of the loans become nonperforming, the issuer is obligated to remove it and replace it with a performing loan.
It is also typical that the cover pools are fenced off from the bank's other assets in case of a default, and are overcollateralized, so that the market value is in excess of the face value of the bonds that it backs. Bondholders also have dual recourse to both the assets in the cover pool and the issuer in case of a bankruptcy.
Because of the safety features, most covered bonds are rated triple-A. In the history of the European covered bond market, which began in 1769 when Prussia issued them to finance agricultural projects, there has not been a single default, according to Anna T. Pinedo, a partner at the law firm Morrison & Foerster and the author of a legal work on covered bonds.
''We have seen the difficulties wrought by the complexity of securitizations,'' said Bert Ely, a financial and monetary policy consultant based in Alexandria, Va. ''Covered bonds, on the other hand, are a very clean and simple tool. A bank makes a loan, keeps the loan on its books and issues a covered bond. There is no sale and resale of mortgages.''
Despite their safety, covered bonds have not been popular here in part because government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have made it affordable for banks to finance the bulk of their mortgages by tapping the securitization market. That market has been largely frozen in the wake of the housing bust.
''Banks need alternative methods for financing mortgages,'' said Jerry R. Marlatt, senior of counsel in the capital markets group at Morrison & Foerster. ''The time is going to come when the housing market is going to recover, and now is the time to get new forms of financing in place.''
Washington Mutual and Bank of America are the only domestic banks to have issued covered bonds (Washington Mutual in 2006 and Bank of America in 2007). But without legislation providing a framework for how the bonds would behave in case of bankruptcy, the banks were forced to create costly contracts that made further issuance too expensive and complicated.
While Mr. Garrett has proposed legislation to facilitate bond issuance here, there is some conflict with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The regulator, which takes over failed banks, has several concerns, chief among them the fate of the cover pools.
The pools are overcollateralized, sometimes by as much as three times the face value of the bonds, and the F.D.I.C. wants access to these overcollateralized assets after a bankruptcy. Otherwise, if the cover pools shield the bulk of the bank's assets from being claimed, it puts the depositors at undue risk, the regulator argues.
''We support covered bond legislation, but not at the expense of our obligation to protect the deposit insurance fund,'' said Michael H. Krimminger, deputy to the F.D.I.C. chairwoman.
Market players say that if the F.D.I.C. were given control over the cover pool, it would put bondholders at too much risk.
''The F.D.I.C. is basically saying 'trust me,' '' said Paul Hinton, vice president of NERA Economic Consulting. ''But administrations change, policies change, and this makes it risky for bondholders.''
Without legislation, American banks are hamstrung, and in their stead, foreign banks have begun to move in on the domestic market. This year, a record $28 billion worth of dollar-denominated covered bonds have been issued to American institutional investors, according to Dealogic. The bulk of the bonds were issued by Canadian banks, with French, Norwegian and British institutions also participating.
Unlike when Washington Mutual and Bank of America originally tried to start an American market for this debt, ''in the last six to eight months, there has been a confluence of events that have brought covered bonds to the attention of U.S. investors,'' said Sean Davy, the managing director of the corporate credit markets division of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a Wall Street trade group.
Institutional investors are hungry for high-quality bonds in which to invest, since traditional sources for such debt dried up after the housing bust, Mr. Davy said. European and Canadian banks are looking to diversify their investor base, and several factors have made it economical for them to issue dollar-denominated debt, he added.
As a result, more institutional investors, like insurance companies and pension funds, are buying up covered bonds from foreign banks. In other words, American investors are helping to finance the mortgage markets abroad, Mr. Marlatt said. ''The playing field is not equal. Foreign banks are financing European mortgage loans with U.S. money,'' he added. ''Why shouldn't American banks be empowered to help investors fund the mortgage market here?''
Mr. Garrett said covered bonds were a needed salve for the financial crisis. ''This bill is good for the issuer,'' he said, ''because it will provide another financing tool for the bank; it's good for the investor because it is a new, secure place to invest for the long term; and it's good for the consumer because it will provide new lines of credit and simplify the issues now plaguing mortgage modifications.''

HEADLINE: Perry Re-elected in Texas Governor Race

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- Gov. Rick Perry won a resounding victory over his Democratic challenger, Bill White, a triumph for the conservative Republican governor who was early to embrace the antigovernment Tea Party movement.
Speaking to supporters at a hunting ranch in Buda, Mr. Perry, the longest-serving governor in the state's history, said a majority of Americans had become weary of what he called ''do-gooder policies'' and mandates from the federal government.
''Our citizens are tired of big government raising their taxes and cooking up ways to micromanage their lives,'' he said. ''The people are fed up.'' 
Mr. White, who retired as the mayor of Houston in January, conceded defeat at 9 p.m. Central time as it became clear that the early returns were against him and that he would not be able to catch up. With about 6 in 10 precincts counted, Mr. Perry had 55 percent of the vote, Mr. White had 39 percent, and the rest was divided among two other candidates.
Mr. White had hammered away at Mr. Perry for months, accusing him of turning state government into a Republican political machine and patronage mill during his decade in office.
In his concession speech, however, Mr. White called on his supporters to give Mr. Perry their respect and support and issued a call for more civility in politics. ''All our elected leaders, including our national leadership, deserve respect,'' he said. ''Texans and Americans should understand that respect for diversity does not mean just diverse ethnic backgrounds, but it also means respect for people with a different point of view.''
The governor won by campaigning on his record of creating jobs and on the state's relatively good economy in the face of the worst economic downturn since the 1930s. Embracing Tea Party supporters and others in the right wing of his party, he also campaigned against President Obama, assailing the main Democratic initiatives in Washington over the last two years: the health care overhaul and the $787 billion stimulus package.
Like other Republicans across the nation, Mr. Perry turned the race into a referendum on federal spending, and argued that Texas had charted a different, business-friendly course of low taxes and low regulation.
Mr. White was the Democrats' best hope to win back the governorship since George W. Bush swept into office in 1994 and started a period of Republican dominance.
A former lieutenant governor, Mr. Perry became governor when Mr. Bush was elected president in 2000, and he has won three elections since then. He has recently made moves suggesting that he might run for national office. Over the weekend, he refused to commit to serving out another four-year term, and on Wednesday he will a nationwide tour for his book ''Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington.''
In his book, Mr. Perry denounces an expansion of federal power. ''We are fed up with a federal government that has the arrogance to preach to us about how to live our lives, and the chutzpah to haul every baseball player and other 'evildoer' in the world before a Congressional committee,'' he says.
Mr. Perry calls Congress ''one of the most incompetent regimes with one of the worst track records of mismanagement in the history of mankind,'' and he likens Social Security to a ''Ponzi scheme'' that must be overhauled.
In another passage, he says, ''Prohibition on school prayer, the redefinition of marriage, the nationalization of health care, the proliferation of federal criminal laws, interference with local education, the increased regulation of food -- even telling us what kind of light bulbs we can use -- there is seemingly no end to the reach of Washington.''
Mr. Perry's election to a fourth term and expected gains in the Legislature give Republicans a heavy advantage in the coming redistricting battle, during which the state will add four House seats to its current 32 seat.
Mr. Perry will also face a $20 billion shortfall in the next two-year spending plan, to be adopted next spring. He closed a similar gap in the last budget with $15 billion in federal money from the stimulus package, which he argues should never have been approved. He has pledged not to raise taxes, which means the state will have to make steep cuts to services.
''We have our work cut out for us,'' Mr. Perry said in his victory speech. ''We need to be able to make some tough decisions.''

HEADLINE: In California, Boxer Wins Re-election, and Brown Is Poised to Be Governor Again

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY; Reporting was contributed by Rebecca Cathcart and Jennifer Medina in Los Angeles; Ian Lovett in Irvine, Calif.; and Malia Wollan in Oakland, Calif.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Feeling pessimistic, but bucking the national trend, California voters decided against a pair of untested Republicans in favor of old-school Democrats on Tuesday.
In the governor's race, the state's attorney general, Jerry Brown, 72, was elected California's oldest chief executive and will return to the office he held from 1975 to 1983. Mr. Brown's victory came despite the record $140 million spent by his Republican challenger, Meg Whitman, a former chief executive of eBay who was trying to become the first woman to be elected governor in the nation's most populous state.
With 93 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Brown had 54 percent of the vote to Ms. Whitman's 41 percent, according to The Associated Press.
''It looks like I'm going back again,'' Mr. Brown said, standing with his wife, Anne Gust, who helped run his campaign. ''This time, of course, we have a first lady, which we didn't have last time.'' 
Mr. Brown -- whose first go-round as governor was marked by anecdotes about his sometimes unorthodox thinking and his celebrity dating habits -- said he recognized that voters were unhappy.
''I'm praying that this breakdown that's been going on for so many years in the state capital and in Washington, that a breakdown paves the way for a breakthrough,'' he said. ''And that's the spirit that I'm going to take back to Sacramento.''
Senator Barbara Boxer was declared the winner over Carly Fiorina, a Republican whose resume included six years as the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. Mrs. Boxer, considered one of the most liberal -- and most vulnerable -- members of the Senate, consistently attacked Ms. Fiorina's corporate record, which included large-scale layoffs and her unceremonious firing by Hewlett-Packard's board of directors in 2005.
Mrs. Boxer won with 52 percent of the vote, to Ms. Fiorina's 42 percent. In her acceptance speech, Mrs. Boxer called this race for a fourth term ''the toughest and roughest campaign of my life.''
''Everything was thrown at us in this election,'' Ms. Boxer said, who shared a stage with her Democratic counterpart, Senator Dianne Feinstein. ''Including the kitchen sink and the stove and the oven.''Both Mr. Brown and Mrs. Boxer provided victories for Democrats in the West on a night when swathes of the Midwest and the South went for Republicans. In the new House, California figured to lose several important chairmanships and the speaker's chair, now held by Nancy Pelosi. But California Democrats, who control both houses of their state Legislature, sounded proud of not joining a Republican wave.
''I think people in California are saying, 'We don't want that Tea Party stuff.' '' State Senator Darrell Steinberg said.
Ms. Whitman's loss stung, considering the money she spent. A disciplined campaigner who rarely strayed from her talking points, Ms. Whitman was hurt by revelations in late September that she had long employed a Mexican housekeeper who was living in United States illegally. Ms. Whitman had fired the housekeeper, but the seeming disconnect between her actions and her public support of stiff penalties for employers who hire illegal immigrants seemed to stagger her campaign. It also hurt her with Latino voters.
In her concession, Ms. Whitman struck a conciliatory note, saying it was time to ''unite around the common cause of turning around this state we love.''
''I believe that if we all work together to demand change for Sacramento, we will be successful,'' she said.
Both Ms. Whitman, who is a billionaire, and Ms. Fiorina, who received $21 million in severance pay from Hewlett-Packard, were in their first political campaigns. Mr. Brown first ran for office in 1969, has served as the state's secretary of state and the mayor of Oakland, Calif., and has run for president three times. Mrs. Boxer has served three terms in the Senate and five in the House of Representatives. Republicans had high hopes in California, in part because of Ms. Whitman's spending power and Ms. Fiorina's reputation as a street fighter, a trait she illustrated in a series of fiery stump speeches.
And late Tuesday, Ms. Fiorina refused to concede, saying the race was still too close to call. ''It's going to be a long night,'' she said.
Ms. Fiorina courted conservatives with her strong opposition to abortion and her embrace of offshore drilling, but economic issues were far and away the most dominant theme of the campaign. California has struggled with a $19 billion spending gap, which contributed to a three-month period this year when the state went without a budget.
The state -- one of the most affected by the foreclosure crisis and housing collapse -- also has an unemployment rate of more than 12 percent, with joblessness at twice that level or higher in some areas. Nearly 9 out of 10 voters in California say they are worried about the economy in the coming year, including nearly half who are very worried, according to an Edison Research exit poll.
Such grim expectations played a significant role in the campaigns, with no candidate offering an easy fix. And voters seemed ambivalent about their choices on Tuesday.
Ms. Whitman admitted as much in a late commercial. ''I know many of you see this election as an unhappy choice,'' she said, ''between a longtime politician with no plan for the future and a billionaire with no government experience.''
Republicans are badly outnumbered in California: 44 percent of registered voters are Democrats, compared with 31 percent who identify themselves as Republicans. Ms. Whitman and Ms. Fiorina had pinned their hopes on independents, who make up more than 20 percent of the electorate.
Even in such liberal areas as San Francisco, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a six-to-one ratio, there were signs of voter disenchantment. Michael Purdy, 40, a Democrat, said he was concerned about the state of the nation and the treatment of President Obama by Republicans.
But Mr. Purdy said that although he usually voted a straight Democratic ticket, he had crossed party lines in several statewide races. ''I just felt there were people who were better qualified.''
Democrats were initially worried about Mr. Brown, who did not run a particularly active campaign until after Labor Day. His campaign also committed a number of gaffes, the most serious in October when a recording surfaced of an aide's calling Ms. Whitman a ''whore.'' Mr. Brown apologized, but never identified or fired the staff member who made the remarks.
Ms. Whitman's campaign had hoped that controversy, as well as her potential landmark victory, would pull female voters into her camp.
Despite hard times, some voters seemed to have faith in the California dream. Sabrina Hernandez, 29, a cake decorator from Berkeley, said she was feeling ''pretty hopeful'' on Tuesday and planned to vote for Democrats. ''You can't expect things to change overnight,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Blumenthal Wins in Connecticut to Take Dodd's Senate Seat

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER; C. J. Hughes and Noah Rosenberg contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Richard Blumenthal, the longtime attorney general of Connecticut, withstood a $50 million spending assault, his own major missteps and a brutal climate for Democrats on Tuesday, defeating the professional wrestling tycoon Linda E. McMahon to capture a Senate seat being vacated by Christopher J. Dodd.
In choosing Mr. Blumenthal, voters in Connecticut defied the national electoral trend, standing by the ultimate insider -- a career politician who had become the face of the state's Democratic establishment -- over a plain-speaking, conservative Republican, a first-time candidate who had built a business into an empire and created hundreds of jobs. 
''I have something money can't buy -- I have you,'' Mr. Blumenthal told a whooping, cheering crowd at the Hartford Hilton about 10:30 p.m., jabbing the air with his left fist in a thumbs-up. ''Connecticut today had an election, not an auction.''
With his wife and four children beside him, he rattled off his legal victories against utilities and pharmaceutical and tobacco companies, adding, ''Thank you for letting me keep fighting for you.''
By 1 a.m., with 70 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Blumenthal led 53 percent to 46 percent. In her concession speech about an hour earlier, Ms. McMahon promised not to ''fade into the woodwork.''
''I have had the most fabulous, unbelievable year,'' she told about 300 supporters at a convention center in Hartford. ''As far as I'm concerned, tonight is a victory.''
Ms. McMahon, 62, would have been the first female senator in Connecticut's history. But the campaign, in a state known for its Yankee gentility, shone a spotlight on what critics called the misogyny of her World Wrestling Entertainment's programming. Mr. Blumenthal, 64, countered with his record of fighting domestic violence and protecting children from tobacco advertisements: exit polls indicated that women flocked to him.
Indeed, despite her spending on advertising, which shattered Connecticut records, Ms. McMahon never persuaded a majority of voters to think favorably of her.
Mr. Blumenthal, by contrast, began the contest with the highest popularity and job-approval ratings of any politician in the state -- he had not been in a close fight since his first election as attorney general, in 1990. When he announced in January his intention to seek the seat that Mr. Dodd was giving up after 30 years, Democrats crossed it off their list of Senate seats that would be difficult to defend.
But Mr. Blumenthal's campaign was rocked in May when The New York Times reported that he had repeatedly claimed to have served as a Marine in Vietnam, though he actually served stateside in the reserves after receiving five draft deferments. He eventually apologized for his statements.
Ms. McMahon seized on the opening to accuse Mr. Blumenthal of a ''pattern of deception.'' She used it as part of a strategy aimed at persuading voters that he was not the earnest, Eagle Scout-like figure they had been led to believe, but rather was an ambitious politician willing to lie to enhance his image and leery of taking any stand that might alienate them.
Ms. McMahon drove that message with a barrage of advertisements, prompting accusations that she was trying to buy the Senate seat. Mr. Blumenthal sought to depict Ms. McMahon as a heartless executive with a history of putting ''profits ahead of people.'' But by late September, a Quinnipiac University poll showed she had cut Mr. Blumenthal's lead to three percentage points among likely voters.
Two days later, Ms. McMahon equivocated on a question about lowering the minimum wage, and Mr. Blumenthal pounced with hard-hitting advertisements of his own.
In three debates last month, Ms. McMahon kept on the offensive, again calling Mr. Blumenthal a liar and a career politician. But Mr. Blumenthal seemed to find his footing, saying Ms. McMahon received $46 million in compensation in 2009 and got nearly $10 million in tax breaks, but laid off 10 percent of World Wrestling Entertainment's workers.
He blasted her company's policy toward steroid use, citing the deaths of several former wrestlers. And he ran more advertisements accusing Ms. McMahon of hiring lobbyists to help the company ''duck taxes, kill steroid and drug testing laws, and avoid health and safety protections for her workers.''
Exit polls conducted by Edison Research showed that Ms. McMahon's wrestling background hurt her: half of the voters said it contributed to their decision, and four out of five of those said it made them less likely to vote for her.
In West Hartford, a Democratic stronghold, Claire Avitabile, 41, said she was uncomfortable with Mr. Blumenthal's exaggerations of his Vietnam record but more so with Ms. McMahon's background. ''I don't like what McMahon stands for,'' she said, calling wrestling a ''violent sport.''
And in Naugatuck, known for its concentration of so-called Reagan Democrats, Arnold Nori, 87, said he had voted for Mr. Blumenthal because of his concerns about the economy and his distaste for Ms. McMahon's ads.
''She turned me off,'' he said, ''and nothing ever turned me back on to her.''

HEADLINE: Rand Paul Vows to Stay On Message In Senate

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
BOWLING GREEN, Ky. -- From the earliest days of his campaign, even before his Republican primary victory that shook up the Kentucky political establishment, Rand Paul has pledged not to compromise. And that was the message he returned to on Tuesday night as he celebrated a Senate victory over his Democratic opponent, Jack Conway, the state attorney general.
''They say that the U.S. Senate is the world's most deliberative body,'' Mr. Paul said, taking the podium at a victory rally here in Bowling Green. ''I'm going to ask them to deliberate upon this: The American people are unhappy with what is going on in Washington. Eleven percent of the people approve of what's going in Congress. But tonight there's a Tea Party tidal wave and we're sending a message to them. It's a message that I will carry with me on Day 1.'' 
That message, Mr. Paul explained, is one of limited government, entrepreneurship and a conservative reading of and adherence to the Constitution.
''When I arrive in Washington I will ask them respectfully to deliberate on this: We are in the midst of a debt crisis and the American people want to know why we have to balance our budget and they don't,'' he said.
''America will remain great if and when we understand,'' he said, in a direct rebuke to the Obama administration's stimulus plan, ''that government cannot create prosperity -- we have to understand that it comes from ourselves.''
Before he appeared at the rally -- which had the air of a rock concert, with young men shouting ''Capitalism!'' among other things -- Mr. Paul was introduced by his father, Ron Paul, the Texas congressman, who gave a short pep talk via video. The biggest question for many going forward is whether Rand Paul can maintain his largely libertarian brand of Republicanism after he arrives in Washington. Ron Paul directly addressed the question of compromise.
''If they want to increase government by 100 percent and they increase government by 50 percent, that's not compromise, that's a sellout,'' he said to cheers. ''If our side wants to reduce government by 50 percent and we end up only reducing it by 25 percent, that's a compromise we can live with.''
Earlier in the day, the issue of compromise was on the minds of some of his supporters, who were excited to vote for him but concerned about what lay ahead.
Cheri Star, 50, a homemaker, said she was confident in Mr. Paul after voting for him at an elementary school in Bowling Green on Tuesday morning. ''But I'm afraid that the system might change him,'' she said nervously.
The elder Mr. Paul did not have any words of gratitude for the Republican establishment, which has had a tenuous relationship with the Tea Party in general and both Pauls in particular.
Tuesday night's victory ''originated outside the political party system,'' he said, adding that Republicans had fallen short in previous attempts to limit government. ''The test will come very shortly,'' he said. ''We have to stand for something.''
But whatever the national party's relationship will be with the Tea Party, Rand Paul's victory did not change the makeup of the state's Congressional delegation because he will replace Jim Bunning, also a Republican. The four Republicans in the House won easily, and the Democratic incumbent in the district that represents Louisville won as well.
However, with 98 percent of the vote counted, it was still too close to call the race in the Sixth Congressional District, which pit Ben Chandler, a three-term Democratic incumbent, against Andy Barr, a Republican lawyer.

HEADLINE: In House Victories, Republicans Oust Old and New Democrats Alike

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
Republicans captured the House Tuesday by ousting powerful Democratic committee chairmen as well as newcomers who faced a voter backlash after supporting an aggressive Democratic legislative agenda for the past two years.
The dozens of Democrats who lost in the economically struggling Midwest include Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, who heads the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Skelton was joined in defeat by Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the chairman of the Budget Committee.
Republicans, who returned to power in the House after four years of Democratic control, won at least 56 seats held by Democrats. They swept away veterans in Indiana, Florida, Mississippi, Texas and Virginia, and they defeated freshmen lawmakers, too, as they staked their claim to the House majority two years into the Obama administration.
Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is set to become the new speaker, promised changes in the way the House does business as he announced his victory in an emotional speech in Washington just before midnight. 
''Our new majority will be prepared to do things differently,'' said Mr. Boehner, who grew up the son of an Ohio tavern owner, as he could hardly hold back the tears.
Republicans defeated Democrats who have long defied challenges from the opposition, notably Representative Gene Taylor of Mississippi, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House. Representative Rick Boucher of Virginia, first elected in 1982, fell. Voters in Indiana ousted Representative Baron Hill, another Democratic veteran, and in Florida, Representative Allen Boyd, a longtime force among conservative Democrats, also lost.
In Texas, Representative Chet Edwards, a Democrat who had held a seat in one of the most Republican districts in the nation since 1990, was defeated. Representative Paul Kanjorski, a Pennsylvania Democrat with 26 years in the House and a senior member of the Financial Services Committee, lost his seat as well.
Among the more junior casualties was Representative Tom Perriello of Virginia, a Democrat who had become an Obama administration favorite for his willingness to back initiatives like the health care and energy bills, despite resistance in his district.
Representative Glenn Nye, a first-term Virginia Democrat who broke with his party on health care, lost as well. In Florida, two Democratic freshmen who supported the health overhaul, Suzanne M. Kosmas and Alan Grayson, were easily defeated.
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois were particularly good territory for Republicans, who picked up multiple seats in each state. Democrats blamed stubborn unemployment for their losses there.
As the votes were being counted, Republicans celebrated the fact that voters were willing to return them to power after ousting them just four years ago.
''Tonight, the people of this Commonwealth and our great country are poised to give us a second chance,'' Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 Republican in the House, said in a victory speech in Richmond.
Republicans also picked up an open Democratic House seat in Indiana, and beat incumbents in New Hampshire and New Jersey while the party's incumbents were winning easily across the board in the early voting.
But some Democratic lawmakers thought to be vulnerable in Kentucky and North Carolina appeared likely to retain their seats, suggesting that the Republican wave might not reach as far as some had expected..
Democrats did pick up a seat in Delaware, where former Lt. Gov. John Carney won the state's sole House seat, taking over from Mike Castle, the Republican who ran for the Senate and was defeated in the primary. They also ousted Representative Joseph Cao in Louisiana.
The election came after a contentious two years in the House as Democrats under Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California forced through an ambitious agenda, despite almost uniform resistance from Republicans.
More so than in the Senate, Republicans in the House refused to support any of the main Democratic initiatives, like the economic stimulus and the health care overhaul.
And Democrats, with the numbers and House rules that give majority members the ability to dictate the agenda on their side, were not inclined to strike many deals with the opposition.
As a result, House Republicans dug in, bided their time and from the start of the 111th Congress set their sights on significantly cutting into or eliminating the Democratic majority in the midterms.
Republicans have promised to put a strong new focus on cutting federal spending, raising the possibility of a future showdown with the Obama administration.
They have also said they would emphasize tax cuts and loosen federal regulations to stimulate business. Republicans also run the risk of leaving their supporters disillusioned if they find themselves unable to deliver on some of their main pledges.
Mr. Boehner urged his colleagues heading up the House Republican campaign effort to find credible opponents for as many Democrats as possible, and promised enough money to ensure the political operation would be effective.
Many Republicans were also quick to ally themselves with Tea Party groups and conservative activists unhappy with the Democratic-controlled Congress and President Obama.
Party figures like Mr. Boehner, Mr. Cantor and Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota appeared at Tea Party events.
During the House vote on the health care bill, House Republicans rallied conservative protesters from the balconies of the Capitol, winning more support from the activists who would play a role in the coming elections.
Even as voters were casting their ballots Tuesday, House Democratic leaders put up an optimistic front, saying they saw a ''narrow path'' to retaining the House, based on the possibility of independents' splitting their votes between the parties rather than flocking to Republicans.
The Republican comeback was rooted in both politics and policy. The wave of Democratic House victories in 2006 and 2008 reached deep into Republican territory. So in this election, Democrats had to defend many junior members -- typically the most vulnerable -- in dozens of districts won by President George W. Bush in 2004 and Senator John McCain in 2008.
At the same time, Republicans, energized by angry constituents, were able to gain a foothold in districts where incumbent Democratic lawmakers had not faced serious competition in years. That forced Democrats to spread their resources, both manpower and money, over a widening and shifting playing field.
An assortment of advocacy groups formed for the election also helped Republicans by paying for television attack ads. The groups helped level the playing field for some Republican candidates, and in some cases gave them an advantage over Democratic incumbents.
Republicans also say that Democrats provided them ample ammunition by advancing their ambitious legislative agenda. The main issue that Republicans emphasized in their campaign advertising was the $787 billion economic stimulus measure passed early in Mr. Obama's term.
Analysts said the stimulus legislation was seen by Republican and independent voters as an example of excessive spending and undue government intervention.
Republican strategists said that while the House climate-change energy legislation received less attention, it galvanized Republican voters in coal-country states like Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia.
Making matters worse for Democrats, the Senate never even considered the House's version of the so-called cap-and-trade bill, meaning many House Democrats took a tough vote that the Senate ultimately avoided.
During earlier periods in its history, the House regularly experienced sudden switches in party control. Substantial losses of House seats were not that uncommon as the nation's political mood underwent seismic shifts. Democrats lost more than 100 seats in the election of 1894 after a national economic collapse.

HEADLINE: Rand Paul Vows to Stay On Message In Senate

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
BOWLING GREEN, Ky. -- From the earliest days of his campaign, even before his Republican primary victory that shook up the Kentucky political establishment, Rand Paul has pledged not to compromise. And that was the message he returned to on Tuesday night as he celebrated a Senate victory over his Democratic opponent, Jack Conway, the state attorney general.
''They say that the U.S. Senate is the world's most deliberative body,'' Mr. Paul said, taking the podium at a victory rally here in Bowling Green. ''I'm going to ask them to deliberate upon this: The American people are unhappy with what is going on in Washington. Eleven percent of the people approve of what's going in Congress. But tonight there's a Tea Party tidal wave and we're sending a message to them. It's a message that I will carry with me on Day 1.'' 
That message, Mr. Paul explained, is one of limited government, entrepreneurship and a conservative reading of and adherence to the Constitution.
''When I arrive in Washington I will ask them respectfully to deliberate on this: We are in the midst of a debt crisis and the American people want to know why we have to balance our budget and they don't,'' he said.
''America will remain great if and when we understand,'' he said, in a direct rebuke to the Obama administration's stimulus plan, ''that government cannot create prosperity -- we have to understand that it comes from ourselves.''
Before he appeared at the rally -- which had the air of a rock concert, with young men shouting ''Capitalism!'' among other things -- Mr. Paul was introduced by his father, Ron Paul, the Texas congressman, who gave a short pep talk via video. The biggest question for many going forward is whether Rand Paul can maintain his largely libertarian brand of Republicanism after he arrives in Washington. Ron Paul directly addressed the question of compromise.
''If they want to increase government by 100 percent and they increase government by 50 percent, that's not compromise, that's a sellout,'' he said to cheers. ''If our side wants to reduce government by 50 percent and we end up only reducing it by 25 percent, that's a compromise we can live with.''
Earlier in the day, the issue of compromise was on the minds of some of his supporters, who were excited to vote for him but concerned about what lay ahead.
Cheri Star, 50, a homemaker, said she was confident in Mr. Paul after voting for him at an elementary school in Bowling Green on Tuesday morning. ''But I'm afraid that the system might change him,'' she said nervously.
The elder Mr. Paul did not have any words of gratitude for the Republican establishment, which has had a tenuous relationship with the Tea Party in general and both Pauls in particular.
Tuesday night's victory ''originated outside the political party system,'' he said, adding that Republicans had fallen short in previous attempts to limit government. ''The test will come very shortly,'' he said. ''We have to stand for something.''
But whatever the national party's relationship will be with the Tea Party, Rand Paul's victory did not change the makeup of the state's Congressional delegation because he will replace Jim Bunning, also a Republican. The four Republicans in the House won easily, and the Democratic incumbent in the district that represents Louisville won as well.
However, with 98 percent of the vote counted, it was still too close to call the race in the Sixth Congressional District, which pit Ben Chandler, a three-term Democratic incumbent, against Andy Barr, a Republican lawyer.

HEADLINE: In House Victories, Republicans Oust Old and New Democrats Alike

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
Republicans captured the House Tuesday by ousting powerful Democratic committee chairmen as well as newcomers who faced a voter backlash after supporting an aggressive Democratic legislative agenda for the past two years.
The dozens of Democrats who lost in the economically struggling Midwest include Representative Ike Skelton of Missouri, who heads the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Skelton was joined in defeat by Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the chairman of the Budget Committee.
Republicans, who returned to power in the House after four years of Democratic control, won at least 56 seats held by Democrats. They swept away veterans in Indiana, Florida, Mississippi, Texas and Virginia, and they defeated freshmen lawmakers, too, as they staked their claim to the House majority two years into the Obama administration.
Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who is set to become the new speaker, promised changes in the way the House does business as he announced his victory in an emotional speech in Washington just before midnight. 
''Our new majority will be prepared to do things differently,'' said Mr. Boehner, who grew up the son of an Ohio tavern owner, as he could hardly hold back the tears.
Republicans defeated Democrats who have long defied challenges from the opposition, notably Representative Gene Taylor of Mississippi, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House. Representative Rick Boucher of Virginia, first elected in 1982, fell. Voters in Indiana ousted Representative Baron Hill, another Democratic veteran, and in Florida, Representative Allen Boyd, a longtime force among conservative Democrats, also lost.
In Texas, Representative Chet Edwards, a Democrat who had held a seat in one of the most Republican districts in the nation since 1990, was defeated. Representative Paul Kanjorski, a Pennsylvania Democrat with 26 years in the House and a senior member of the Financial Services Committee, lost his seat as well.
Among the more junior casualties was Representative Tom Perriello of Virginia, a Democrat who had become an Obama administration favorite for his willingness to back initiatives like the health care and energy bills, despite resistance in his district.
Representative Glenn Nye, a first-term Virginia Democrat who broke with his party on health care, lost as well. In Florida, two Democratic freshmen who supported the health overhaul, Suzanne M. Kosmas and Alan Grayson, were easily defeated.
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Illinois were particularly good territory for Republicans, who picked up multiple seats in each state. Democrats blamed stubborn unemployment for their losses there.
As the votes were being counted, Republicans celebrated the fact that voters were willing to return them to power after ousting them just four years ago.
''Tonight, the people of this Commonwealth and our great country are poised to give us a second chance,'' Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the No. 2 Republican in the House, said in a victory speech in Richmond.

HEADLINE: Rubio Continues Quick Rise in G.O.P. With Florida Senate Win

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- Jeb Bush said he had to fight back tears when he introduced the victor in the Florida Senate race, Marco Rubio, ''the right man at the right time.'' Mr. Rubio, when he took the stage amid the palm trees at the Biltmore Hotel, in front of a mostly bilingual crowd, was no less emotional -- about his uphill battle to defeat a popular governor, and about what he described as his abiding faith in the dream lived out by his immigrant parents.
''The United States is simply the greatest nation in all of human history,'' Mr. Rubio said. But he added, ''it requires action on our part.'' 
Mr. Rubio pledged to stay true to the ideology of fiscal restraint he laid out during the campaign. Offering no details, he pledged to make the country better for his children by rejecting the Washington status quo, and even traditional Republican standards.
''We're making a great mistake if we believe that tonight these results are somehow an embrace of the Republican party,'' Mr. Rubio said in his 15-minute speech. ''What they are is a second chance -- a second chance for Republicans to be what they said were going to be not so long ago.''
It seemed, in some ways, a fitting end. Mr. Rubio, 39, was not expected to win when the campaign started, but with rousing speeches that centered on ''reclaiming America'' and returning to core Republican values of fiscal restraint, he became one of the first candidates propelled by the Tea Party insurgents. Although he later distanced himself from their orthodoxy, he won, like many other conservative Congressional candidates in Florida (including Daniel Webster who beat the liberal firebrand, Alan Grayson), with a message that focused on the economy, lower taxes and limited government.
Mr. Rubio's pitch, here in a state won by Mr. Obama two years ago but still reeling from the recession and foreclosures, apparently captured the mood. For Mr. Rubio, the victory completes a dramatic rise for a young Cuban-American candidate, the son of a bartender and a maid in middle class West Miami.
He slew the dragon, or at least Charlie Crist, the state's popular moderate governor. It was Mr. Rubio's vast lead in the polls that helped push Mr. Crist to bolt from the Republican Party and run a campaign without affiliation.
And while at times, Mr. Crist's effort seemed to gain traction, Republicans unified behind Mr. Rubio, leaving Mr. Crist and Kendrick B. Meek, the Democrat in the race, to spend much of the campaign battling for the same liberal and moderate voters.
Mr. Rubio, in turn, coasted forward as a Republican favorite. Although he spent most of his career in the Florida Legislature, he ran as an outsider, and supporters said he would bring a new approach to Congress.
''He will go to Washington as a symbol of the new conservative movement -- young, committed, and a purist when it comes to his philosophy and his points of view,'' said Al Cardenas, the former chairman of Florida's Republican Party. ''It will make him one of the key figures in our party nationally.''
Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida, who worked with Mr. Rubio when they both served in Tallahassee, spoke of him as a friend: ''I am so proud he will be part of a next generation of leaders that will restore America.''
Democrats entered Election Day with 592,000 more registered voters than Republicans. State officials said turnout was steady, but not overwhelming, with about 2.3 million voters casting ballots early, out of about 11 million registered voters.
Many voters said they were frustrated, and Democratic strategists acknowledged that their party had struggled. Screven Watson, the former executive director of the state's Democratic Party, said the Senate and governor's races would be seen as a wake-up call for Democrats.
''If we lose them both, we're going to have a long, hard look at our party structure -- how we're running races, our messaging,'' Mr. Watson said.
Many Republicans said they were expecting major victories in races across the state, but Mr. Cardenas warned against claims of overconfidence.
''The one constant about Florida is how fluid it is,'' Mr. Cardenas said, adding, ''The truth is Florida will continue to be a purple state. We just happen to have hit a good cycle.''
Mr. Rubio acknowledged that he, too, could lose his way. He ended his victory speech by asking the crowd of supporters to pray ''that we will not change,'' and he said, ''that we will always remember the things we cared about on this night.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Makes Gains In Senate, but Majority Eludes Party's Grasp

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Erik Eckholm contributed reporting from Charleston, W. Va., and Susan Saulny from Chicago.

 BODY:
Republicans improved their lot in the Senate on Tuesday but were foiled by Democrats in a few key states with a high number of independent voters in their bid to capture both houses of Congress.
By adding seats in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania, North Dakota and Wisconsin, Republicans narrowed the gap with Democrats. They maintained control in states like Florida, Kentucky and New Hampshire.
But in some states where they had visions of victory, Republicans came up short -- notably in Nevada, where the majority leader, Harry Reid, eked out a win over Sharron Angle, and in Connecticut and West Virginia. California, Delaware and Vermont were also triumphs for the Democrats.
In West Virginia, the Democratic governor, Joe Manchin III, defeated the Republican businessman John Raese for the seat once held by the late Robert C. Byrd. Mr. Manchin's victory was widely seen as vital to Democratic control of the Senate. 
''Tomorrow starts the rebuilding of America,'' Mr. Manchin told a jubilant and relieved crowd in downtown Charleston, carrying on with his outsider appeal. ''We acknowledge that Washington is broken,'' he said, pledging to work with any lawmakers who were willing to forget party labels and ''put America first.''
In a closely watched race in Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey, a Republican former congressman, beat Representative Joe Sestak, a Democrat, by a narrow margin -- 51 percent to 49 percent.
Dan Coats, a Republican who left the Senate more than a decade ago for a career in lobbying, returned Indiana's seat to his party, while John Boozman became the second Republican from Arkansas to serve in the Senate since Reconstruction, beating the incumbent Blanche Lincoln. In another Republican pickup, Gov. John Hoeven of North Dakota handily defeated Tracy Potter, a Democratic state senator, to fill an open seat now held by a Democrat.
In Kentucky, the Tea Party candidate Rand Paul prevailed over the state attorney general, Jack Conway, leaving that seat in Republican control after a nasty midterm battle. In Florida, Marco Rubio easily beat both a Democrat and an independent to maintain Republican control of the open seat in Florida.
Mr. Paul, an ophthalmologist and a son of Representative Ron Paul of Texas, was among the Tea Party's first upset victories when he prevailed in the May primary by a large margin to fill the seat vacated by Senator Jim Bunning, who is retiring. Mr. Paul's general election campaign was often rocky -- his criticism of President Obama's censure of BP after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and his questioning of some aspects of the Civil Rights Act drew fire.
But Mr. Paul, a prolific fund-raiser, benefited from his decision to largely stop speaking about his positions and, perhaps more important, from the backlash against his opponent, who ran advertisements questioning Mr. Paul's Christianity.
In Florida, Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican turned independent, was forced to mount a fight against both sides of the political spectrum in his race against Representative Kendrick B. Meek, a Democrat, and Mr. Rubio whose fiery star power drew support across a wide a swath of demographic groups, according to exit polls.
In less volatile races, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, held on to his seat, and in South Carolina, the Republican Jim DeMint cruised to victory over the Democrat Alvin Greene, who -- unemployed, indicted and resistant to campaigning -- posed no threat. In Ohio, Representative Rob Portman won the open Senate seat formerly held by his fellow Republican George V. Voinovich, defeating Lee Fisher, the lieutenant governor.
Yet in spite of enormous spending and an aggressive effort, Republicans were unable to make the sale in several key states, either because those states were far more divided than largely gerrymandered House districts where Republicans prevailed, or because the party nominated candidates who were ultimately unable to close the deal with a more heterogeneous general electorate than the one they faced in the primaries.
In Delaware, Chris Coons, several months ago the Democratic underdog, easily dispatched his unusual Republican opponent, the Sarah Palin favorite Christine O'Donnell.
Yet Democrats were bedeviled in some states that Mr. Obama won in 2008. The strong Republican opposition demonstrated disaffection among the coveted independent voters who broke for Mr. Obama that year.
Further, in contrast to the undoing in the House, which grew like a wave across the country, the Senate races unfolded bit by incredible bit, with a remarkable number too close to call when the polls opened Tuesday.
Early in the primary season, Utah started the mini-trend of incumbents with deep party roots falling to upstarts. It continued into Alaska and Pennsylvania, where a Republican and a Democrat, respectively, were sent packing by their parties. In Alaska, Lisa Murkowski, the Republican and a foe of Ms. Palin, had to resort to a write-in campaign.
In Delaware, the story was similar: although Michael N. Castle was not a Senate incumbent, he was a respected and long-serving Republican congressman who was expected to prevail over Ms. O'Donnell and whichever Democratic nominee emerged. Instead, Democrats were able to maintain a badly needed Senate seat, one that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had occupied for more than 30 years -- and that they had more or less kissed goodbye several months ago.
Some Democrats paid a price with voters for their role in passing the health care bill, which helped to build a sense around the nation, stoked to great effect by Republicans, that a Democratic majority was shoving costly legislation down voters' throats.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, leveraged his savvy with Senate procedure, which helped slow things down and contribute to the image of a do-nothing Senate, and his ability to rally his party around his vision to keep Democrats from enjoying Republican support on legislation.
Across the country, jobs and the economy were foremost among voters' concerns. Nearly half of voters interviewed in exit polls in Florida said they were worried that their home, or that of a relative, would be foreclosed on. More than half said they were very worried about the condition of the national economy over the next year.
In a stinging defeat for Democrats on Mr. Obama's home turf, Mark Steven Kirk, a Republican and longtime member of Congress representing Chicago's affluent northern suburbs, won a narrow victory over his Democratic rival, Alexi Giannoulias, the state treasurer, whom the president had endorsed.
Mr. Obama, who remains popular in Illinois, campaigned for Mr. Giannoulias as recently as last weekend. And that was seen by many political observers here as a boon to Mr. Giannoulias in a contentious, nail-biting race that had been an official tossup for weeks.
''Losing is not easy,'' said Mr. Giannoulias, who lost his composure for a moment during his remarks at a downtown Chicago hotel. ''It's not something you expect, which is probably why I didn't write a speech.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Makes Gains In Senate, but Majority Eludes Party's Grasp

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Erik Eckholm contributed reporting from Charleston, W. Va., and Susan Saulny from Chicago.

 BODY:
Republicans improved their lot in the Senate on Tuesday but were foiled by Democrats in a few key states with a high number of independent voters in their bid to capture both houses of Congress.
By adding seats in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania, North Dakota and Wisconsin, Republicans narrowed the gap with Democrats. They maintained control in states like Florida, Kentucky and New Hampshire.
But in some states where they had visions of victory, Republicans came up short -- notably in Nevada, where the majority leader, Harry Reid, eked out a win over Sharron Angle, and in Connecticut and West Virginia. California, Delaware and Vermont were also triumphs for the Democrats.
In West Virginia, the Democratic governor, Joe Manchin III, defeated the Republican businessman John Raese for the seat once held by the late Robert C. Byrd. Mr. Manchin's victory was widely seen as vital to Democratic control of the Senate. 
''Tomorrow starts the rebuilding of America,'' Mr. Manchin told a jubilant and relieved crowd in downtown Charleston, carrying on with his outsider appeal. ''We acknowledge that Washington is broken,'' he said, pledging to work with any lawmakers who were willing to forget party labels and ''put America first.''
In a closely watched race in Pennsylvania, Pat Toomey, a Republican former congressman, beat Representative Joe Sestak, a Democrat, by a narrow margin -- 51 percent to 49 percent.
Dan Coats, a Republican who left the Senate more than a decade ago for a career in lobbying, returned Indiana's seat to his party, while John Boozman became the second Republican from Arkansas to serve in the Senate since Reconstruction, beating the incumbent Blanche Lincoln. In another Republican pickup, Gov. John Hoeven of North Dakota handily defeated Tracy Potter, a Democratic state senator, to fill an open seat now held by a Democrat.
In Kentucky, the Tea Party candidate Rand Paul prevailed over the state attorney general, Jack Conway, leaving that seat in Republican control after a nasty midterm battle. In Florida, Marco Rubio easily beat both a Democrat and an independent to maintain Republican control of the open seat in Florida.
Mr. Paul, an ophthalmologist and a son of Representative Ron Paul of Texas, was among the Tea Party's first upset victories when he prevailed in the May primary by a large margin to fill the seat vacated by Senator Jim Bunning, who is retiring. Mr. Paul's general election campaign was often rocky -- his criticism of President Obama's censure of BP after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and his questioning of some aspects of the Civil Rights Act drew fire.
But Mr. Paul, a prolific fund-raiser, benefited from his decision to largely stop speaking about his positions and, perhaps more important, from the backlash against his opponent, who ran advertisements questioning Mr. Paul's Christianity.
In Florida, Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican turned independent, was forced to mount a fight against both sides of the political spectrum in his race against Representative Kendrick B. Meek, a Democrat, and Mr. Rubio whose fiery star power drew support across a wide a swath of demographic groups, according to exit polls.
In less volatile races, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, held on to his seat, and in South Carolina, the Republican Jim DeMint cruised to victory over the Democrat Alvin Greene, who -- unemployed, indicted and resistant to campaigning -- posed no threat. In Ohio, Representative Rob Portman won the open Senate seat formerly held by his fellow Republican George V. Voinovich, defeating Lee Fisher, the lieutenant governor.
Yet in spite of enormous spending and an aggressive effort, Republicans were unable to make the sale in several key states, either because those states were far more divided than largely gerrymandered House districts where Republicans prevailed, or because the party nominated candidates who were ultimately unable to close the deal with a more heterogeneous general electorate than the one they faced in the primaries.
In Delaware, Chris Coons, several months ago the Democratic underdog, easily dispatched his unusual Republican opponent, the Sarah Palin favorite Christine O'Donnell.
Yet Democrats were bedeviled in some states that Mr. Obama won in 2008. The strong Republican opposition demonstrated disaffection among the coveted independent voters who broke for Mr. Obama that year.
Further, in contrast to the undoing in the House, which grew like a wave across the country, the Senate races unfolded bit by incredible bit, with a remarkable number too close to call when the polls opened Tuesday.
Early in the primary season, Utah started the mini-trend of incumbents with deep party roots falling to upstarts. It continued into Alaska and Pennsylvania, where a Republican and a Democrat, respectively, were sent packing by their parties. In Alaska, Lisa Murkowski, the Republican and a foe of Ms. Palin, had to resort to a write-in campaign.
In Delaware, the story was similar: although Michael N. Castle was not a Senate incumbent, he was a respected and long-serving Republican congressman who was expected to prevail over Ms. O'Donnell and whichever Democratic nominee emerged. Instead, Democrats were able to maintain a badly needed Senate seat, one that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had occupied for more than 30 years -- and that they had more or less kissed goodbye several months ago.
Some Democrats paid a price with voters for their role in passing the health care bill, which helped to build a sense around the nation, stoked to great effect by Republicans, that a Democratic majority was shoving costly legislation down voters' throats.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, leveraged his savvy with Senate procedure, which helped slow things down and contribute to the image of a do-nothing Senate, and his ability to rally his party around his vision to keep Democrats from enjoying Republican support on legislation.
Across the country, jobs and the economy were foremost among voters' concerns. Nearly half of voters interviewed in exit polls in Florida said they were worried that their home, or that of a relative, would be foreclosed on. More than half said they were very worried about the condition of the national economy over the next year.
In a stinging defeat for Democrats on Mr. Obama's home turf, Mark Steven Kirk, a Republican and longtime member of Congress representing Chicago's affluent northern suburbs, won a narrow victory over his Democratic rival, Alexi Giannoulias, the state treasurer, whom the president had endorsed.
Mr. Obama, who remains popular in Illinois, campaigned for Mr. Giannoulias as recently as last weekend. And that was seen by many political observers here as a boon to Mr. Giannoulias in a contentious, nail-biting race that had been an official tossup for weeks.
''Losing is not easy,'' said Mr. Giannoulias, who lost his composure for a moment during his remarks at a downtown Chicago hotel. ''It's not something you expect, which is probably why I didn't write a speech.''

HEADLINE: As New House Speaker, Boehner Will Face Tough Fight and Tight Deadline

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
In leading his party to midterm triumph, Representative John A. Boehner, the next speaker of the House, is not at the endgame. He is at the beginning of the next and harder fight.
Relying on his decades of experience with the inner workings of the House, Mr. Boehner, of Ohio, now has less than two years to show that the Republican Party is the antidote to what ails Washington, with a discordant caucus, a stagnant economy, a hostile White House with veto power and the long shadow of 1994 all looming before him.
His promises on behalf of the new House majority -- reducing the size of government, creating jobs and fundamentally altering the way the Congress conducts its business -- are mostly as lofty as they are unspecific, and his efforts to legislate them into reality must be done with ambitious upstarts within his own party and a fresh crop of Tea Partiers, some of whom seem to believe that it is they, not he, now running the show. 
The demands on Mr. Boehner from voters are many and not all consistent. There is a craving, polling shows, to see the current system upended, but preferably without gridlock or rancor. Voters want federal spending curtailed, but jealously guard costly entitlements. They angrily reject what is, but have no clearly articulated vision for what should be.
Indeed, Mr. Boehner and his party were delivered no clear mandate from voters, who, polls suggested, were rejecting a policy agenda more than they were rallying around one. One demand resonated loudly: the reduction of federal spending immediately, a daunting goal. Yet, among the first things that Mr. Boehner has said he will seek to accomplish are reversing cuts to the Medicare program and extending the expiring Bush-era tax cuts, steps that are hard to reconcile with a commitment to reining in the national debt.
Mr. Boehner, who will become second in line to the presidency in January, has responded to the contradictory forces that led to Republican victory with equally mixed messages.
He has given speeches about inclusiveness, then written Twitter messages denouncing compromise. He is specific about the amount of spending cuts he seeks -- $100 billion -- but says little about how he will get there. In speeches during a whirlwind tour of Ohio over the weekend, he promised things would be ''different'' in Washington, but then returned to the two-year theme of denigrating President Obama.
The best guiding documents for understanding what Mr. Boehner seeks to accomplish are the House Republican policy document titled ''A Pledge to America'' and his recent speech to the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. The former is a short collection of goals, some of them near-impossible in the near term (like ending government control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant mortgage companies) and a few small-bore but relatively easy to accomplish, like repealing paperwork rules imposed on small businesses.
Mr. Boehner and his party have also made it clear that they will immediately try to unravel the new health care law, either by repealing pieces of it, some of which have already gone into force, or by using the appropriations process to remove financing from its key provisions.
Mr. Boehner will also be tested -- perhaps as early as during the lame duck session this month, when Democrats may be eager to put the issue to bed -- on the tax cut front. Democrats would like to see tax cuts extended for all but the highest income levels, while Republicans seek to make them permanent for all taxpayers.
Dragging this battle out would create tremendous headaches for the Internal Revenue Service, and the issue might be settled in the lame duck session. But Mr. Boehner learned this year, when he indicated a willingness to work with Democrats to hammer out a middle ground solution and was excoriated by some party mates, that not all Republicans cotton to compromise on the issue.
Mr. Boehner, in his speech and in the pledge, also seeks to overhaul much of the way Congress does its business, including eliminating sprawling bills that are filled with items that have nothing to do with the legislation's main intent, as well as requiring bills to cite constitutional authority and ensuring more bipartisan debate on bills.
There is no doubt that Mr. Boehner, who was among the so-called Gang of Seven in 1994, when Republicans took control of the House and then became entangled in missteps and feuds, does not want a repeat of history.
For instance, in 1994, when Republicans captured both the House and the Senate, Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Senate leader, Bob Dole, both harbored presidential aspirations and worked less in tandem than as adversaries. That division between House and Senate Republicans played to President Bill Clinton's advantage.
In contrast, Mr. Boehner's relationship with his Senate counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, with whom he has worked closely in the past two years to oppose Mr. Obama's agenda, remains strong.
Finally, there is some opportunity for bipartisan lawmaking, as Democrats and Republicans alike recognize, often privately. The pursuit of alternative energy sources, modest trade agreements, changes to the Bush administration's signature education act and even adjustments to the tax code are all within reach.
''The big, interesting question is 'What message does Obama take out of this election? What path does he choose?' '' said Mr. McConnell, who said spending and debt were potential areas of common ground.
''There will be plenty of Republicans willing to help reduce both,'' the senator said. ''There are places where he has expressed interest in the past that would be similar to our own interests.''

HEADLINE: The Vandal Next Door

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY

 BODY:
STEVE MILLER is justifiably proud of the manicured grounds around his stately stucco home in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. So he was nonplussed last year when he discovered that someone had been tossing plastic bags of dog excrement into the sculptured shrubs around a palm tree in his front yard.
''It was a pile of at least 10 bags,'' said Mr. Miller, 55, who owned a dance costume business in Bristol, Pa., before retiring to Florida in 2005. ''I had my suspicions, but wanted to find out for sure which one of my neighbors was doing it.''
So Mr. Miller went to a local electronics store and bought a $400 do-it-yourself video surveillance kit. In so doing, he joined the ranks of outraged homeowners who are recording their neighbors' misdeeds. Attracted by the declining prices and technological advances of such devices, these homeowners are posting the videos online to shame their neighbors or using them as evidence to press charges. 
With their cameras hidden in bushes or dangling from windows, these homeowners are outing not just littering dog owners, but also bottle snatchers and car scratchers. Although Mr. Miller's surveillance system came with two motion-activated cameras, he used only one of them, anchoring it with a zip tie to a concrete balustrade outside an upstairs window and running the wire inside, where he plugged it into a DVR.
A month's worth of video footage clearly showed one of his neighbors slinging bags of dog feces into his yard. ''You'd see him come from all directions and even turn around afterwards -- like I was his dumping destination and not just a convenient stop on his way,'' said Mr. Miller, who showed the video evidence to his community's security patrol. ''They were stunned, and wrote the guy a citation for improper waste disposal, littering and leash law violations.''
Moreover, the neighbor had to pick up all that he had tossed. Mr. Miller also had some fun at the neighbor's expense, posting a video on YouTube with a suitably silly soundtrack and narration. The video has had more than 4,000 views.
''He never apologized, so that's why I posted it,'' Mr. Miller said. ''But I did wait until after he moved.''
There are countless videos online that are intended to settle scores between neighbors. Whereas such disputes were once confined to the individuals involved, now they can have a much wider audience, whose members often take sides and post comments.
Take Adam Kliebert, 41, a real estate developer in Houston, who last year trained a video camera on his driveway in an attempt to catch his neighbor, Woody Densen, a former state district judge, scratching the back of his car. The video, which was posted online and delivered to the police, shows Mr. Densen walking behind the vehicle. Although the front of the car obscures the former judge's actions, he pleaded guilty last April to criminal mischief, a misdemeanor, and paid for $3,000 worth of damages to Mr. Kliebert's Range Rover. The video has been viewed more than 3,000 times.
Robert Pelton, the lawyer for Mr. Densen, said he did not damage the car and pleaded guilty only in order to avoid trial.
Mr. Kliebert was still out the $2,000 he paid for the surveillance equipment. But, he said: ''I don't care. I wanted to catch him, and he knows it's there so he won't try anything.'' Despite a history of animosity that predates the car incident, the two men remain neighbors.
Prices for surveillance equipment have been falling for the past five years; systems that once cost thousands of dollars now cost hundreds. Popular do-it-yourself kits by manufacturers like Logitech, Swann, Defender and Lorex currently cost between $150 and $2,500, depending on the number of cameras, digital storage capacity, wireless capability and whether a monitor is included.
Moreover, many of these systems can now transmit to smartphones, so that people can watch activity on their property remotely. There are also apps that alert homeowners when video equipment detects motion in a particular area, such as near a car or beneath a beloved palm tree. Executives at Swann, Lorex and other makers of do-it-yourself surveillance systems report that sales are now evenly split between businesses and residences. Five years ago, they said, only 20 percent of sales were to homeowners.
Another option for do-it-yourself surveillance is free software, like SupervisionCam, which will turn any computer's Webcam into a motion-activated video camera. It works by detecting the changes in pixelation that occur when something moves and alters the scene. Kenneth Gore, 43, an unemployed welder who lives in Pinellas Park, Fla., used the software to document a neighbor's cats prowling and fouling the yard around his mobile home.
Mr. Gore not only recorded the cats but also discovered neighbors looking in his windows while he was away. After he showed the video to the manager of the mobile home park, Mr. Gore said, ''The trespassing stopped, because they know they're being filmed.'' (Trespassers will also get soaked by a motion-activated sprinkler Mr. Gore bought to drive away the cats.)
Mr. Gore posted videos of his nosy neighbors and of the sprinkler squirting the cats on YouTube. One video has funny captions, and music from the vintage British television comedy ''The Benny Hill Show.'' The other is narrated by the cartoon character Tweety Bird: ''I tawt I taw a puddy tat!'' The two have had more than 43,000 views.
''A lot of people get mean, posting videos like that,'' said Mr. Gore. ''I thought it was better to be humorous.''
Do his videos anger his neighbors? ''There ain't much they can do about it,'' he said.
Indeed, the law seems to be on Mr. Gore's side because he recorded only what was happening in his yard. ''It matters how you're doing it and why, but generally it's true that you can film your own property as well as anything that is in public view,'' said David Ardia, director of the Citizen Media Law Project at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. ''It's when you extend your senses into unexpected places, like using a telephoto to film what's going on in your neighbor's bedroom, that you could run into trouble.''
Representatives of neighborhood security patrols, police departments and animal protection agencies said that video has helped them deal with situations that, in the past, would have been one neighbor's word against another's. ''It's hard to argue with video evidence,'' said Officer Bruce Borihanh, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. ''And it's a powerful deterrent if people consider their actions could end up on YouTube.''
Video evidence led to the arrest of Jay Risner's neighbor in St. Clair Shores, Mich. Mr. Risner, 29, an engineer for a phone company, noticed laundry detergent and redeemable bottles disappearing from his basement shortly after a new neighbor moved into his condominium complex in 2008. ''I thought it was him, but you need proof before the cops can do anything,'' Mr. Risner said.
Using a $400 wireless surveillance system, Mr. Risner set up a camera in the basement and got his proof. Within two days, he had video of his neighbor entering his basement and rooting around, which he posted online earlier this year, after both he and his neighbor had moved.
''The video doesn't show him actually taking anything,'' Mr. Risner said, ''but it was enough for the police to arrest him for home invasion and take him to jail.''
The neighbor was ordered to pay restitution for what he had stolen as well as for a new door lock for Mr. Risner's basement -- since the old one was obviously easy to pick. At his new house, Mr. Risner has installed surveillance cameras that are trained on both the front and back doors.
''I'm not sure now,'' he said, ''whether to worry more about my neighbors or strangers.''

HEADLINE: FED SETS OUT PLAN USING $600 BILLION TO SPUR ECONOMY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, getting ahead of the battles that will dominate national politics over the next two years, moved Wednesday to jolt the economy into recovery with a bold but risky plan to pump $600 billion into the banking system.
A day earlier, Republicans swept to a majority in the House on an antideficit platform, virtually guaranteeing that they would clash with the Obama administration over the best way to nurture a fragile recovery.
The action was the second time in a year that the Fed had ventured into new territory as it struggles to push down long-term interest rates to encourage borrowing and economic growth. In a statement, the Fed said it was acting because the recovery was ''disappointingly slow,'' and it left the door open to even more purchases of government securities next year.
The Fed is an independent body, its policy decisions separated from the political pressures of the day. But it acted with a clear understanding that the United States, like many other Western countries, seems to have taken off the table many of the options governments traditionally use to give their economies a kick, particularly deficit spending. 
The Republicans regained control of the House for the first time in four years in part by attacking the stimulus plan -- begun by the Bush administration and accelerated by President Obama -- as a symbol of government spinning out of control, contributing to a dangerously escalating national debt.
This political reality has left Washington increasingly reliant on the Fed to take action, though its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said the Fed cannot fix the problem alone.
But in stepping in so aggressively, the Fed is taking risks. The action not only expands the Fed's huge portfolio of Treasury bonds, it makes it a target of a Congress whose new members include some who are hostile to the Fed's independent role.
On Wall Street, analysts said the move appeared to be a balancing act that met expectations and stock prices rose.
Ordinarily the Fed's main tool for spurring economic growth is to lower short-term interest rates. But those rates are already near zero. With no more room to go, it has to find another route to stimulate demand.
That route is to buy government bonds, which increases demand for them and raises their prices, pushing long-term interest rates down. ''Easier financial conditions will promote economic growth,'' Mr. Bernanke predicted in an essay for Thursday's Washington Post.
Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, the outgoing chairman of the House Republican Conference, said shortly after the announcement that the Fed was overstepping its bounds. ''Diluting the value of the dollar by continually increasing the supply of money poses an incalculable risk,'' he said. ''Instead, Congress needs to embrace progrowth fiscal policies to stimulate our economy rather than masking our fundamental problems by artificially creating inflation.''
In making that argument, Mr. Pence and his allies are replaying a dispute that permeated Washington in the mid-1930s, when the economy was crawling out of the Great Depression. Conservative Democrats pushed Franklin D. Roosevelt to cut back on spending, and argued for tight monetary policy. Many economists argue that the result was a second downturn just before the outbreak of World War II, but others say the conditions today differ in so many ways that the comparison is misleading.
While the Fed step was telegraphed to the markets in recent weeks, most experts had expected $300 billion to $500 billion in purchases of Treasury debt. Still, the pace -- $75 billion a month for eight months -- disappointed some investors.
The Fed said it would also continue an earlier program, announced in August, of using proceeds from its mortgage-related holdings to buy additional Treasury debt, at a rate of about $35 billion a month, or $250 billion to $300 billion by the end of June.
So in total, the Fed will buy $850 billion to $900 billion, just about doubling the amount of Treasury debt it currently holds.
If the Fed's bet is right, lower long-term rates should ripple through the markets, pushing down rates for mortgages and corporate bonds. That could encourage homeowners to refinance into cheaper mortgages, though it would not help the millions of Americans facing foreclosure. It could push businesses to make investments instead of sitting on piles of cash.
In a sign of its willingness to do even more, the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy arm, left open the possibility of even more purchases beyond June, saying it would ''adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.''
Only one committee member dissented, for reasons that are similar to the complaints that some Republicans are likely to raise. Thomas M. Hoenig, an economist who is president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said he believed the decision could create more risk for the financial system by enticing too much borrowing.
There are other risks, as well. The actions are likely to further drive down the dollar. That could worsen trade and exchange-rate tensions that have threatened to unravel cooperation among the world's biggest economies.
Moreover, the Fed is exposing itself to the risk that the assets it has acquired could shrivel in value when interest rates eventually rise. That could reduce the amount of money the central bank turns over to the Treasury each year, and expose the Fed, already vulnerable for its failure to prevent the 2008 financial crisis, to even more criticism.
On Wednesday, the standoff between the parties was on display as the two sides argued over tax cuts and the desirability of government investment to create jobs.
It was this impending gridlock that might have pushed Mr. Bernanke to move, said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor. ''Bernanke has said that fiscal stimulus, accommodated by the Fed, is the single most powerful action the government can take for lowering the unemployment rate, when short-term rates are already at zero,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''He has nearly pleaded with Congress for fiscal stimulus, but he can't count on it.''
But Leonard J. Santow, an economic consultant, said he feared that the Fed was reacting to one mistake -- the failure of fiscal policy -- by adding another. ''The main problem is on the fiscal side, and there is nothing wrong with the Fed chairman making budget recommendations and admitting there is not a great deal left for monetary policy to achieve when it comes to stimulating the economy,'' he said.
One of the main questions raised by the Fed's action was whether it had waited too long. While economists disagree on that, the Fed's announcement completed a U-turn. Earlier, speculation was that the Fed would gradually raise interest rates and tighten the supply of credit, as it would normally do after a recession..
But this downturn and its painful aftermath have been anything but normal. Markets were set back in the spring by the European debt crisis. By late summer, as continuing high unemployment, slow growth and low inflation became clear, Mr. Bernanke became convinced that the Fed needed to act again.

HEADLINE: New Energy Outfoxes Old in California

 BODY:
There are several ways to look at Tuesday's overwhelming endorsement by California's voters of the state's global warming law: as a vote for clean energy over dirty, as a rebuke to carpetbaggers, as proof that good things can happen when a political leader -- in this case, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger -- leads. 
State voters rejected a proposition by a vote of roughly 60 percent to 40 percent -- backed mainly by two out-of-state oil companies, Valero and Tesoro. It would have effectively killed the law known as AB 32. The law is aimed at reducing California's emissions of greenhouse gases by 80 percent at midcentury by requiring cleaner cars, more energy efficient buildings and renewable fuels.
The oil companies and a few allies ran a scare campaign that warned Californians that AB 32 would drive up energy prices and cost jobs -- ''a loss of two blue-collar jobs for every one green job created,'' it claimed.
What the companies had not reckoned on was a fierce pushback from Governor Schwarzenegger, or the deep pockets of the state's wealthy venture capitalists and hedge fund managers, who believe there is a lot of money to be made -- and jobs to be had -- in a clean energy economy. The facts, so far, support them. Over the last five years, new green jobs have grown in California 10 times faster than the state average; the clean technology sector has attracted nearly $9 billion in venture capital and created dozens of new businesses.
The pro-AB 32 forces were so persuaded that the law was good for California's economy that they outspent the oil companies -- $31.2 million compared with $10.6 million. That war chest paid for mass mailings, nearly three million telephone calls to voters and TV commercials that extolled the promise of green jobs and urged voters to reject the oil companies' ''job-killing dirty energy proposition.'' About 3,000 volunteers took the case door to door.
California has been far ahead of the rest of the country on environmental issues. And it long ago cast its economic future with high-tech industries. But politicians in Washington -- who have made no progress on climate change and clean energy -- should take a lesson from the pro-AB 32 campaign.
Supporting clean energy is not only essential for the environment and good for the economy. When voters have the facts, it can also be a political winner.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Gets Its Groove Back, And Big Pay, Too

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
These are not boom times for financial firms. Trading is down and new regulations threaten to take a bite out of future profits. Some firms have been handing out pink slips. Morgan Stanley even posted a loss in its last quarter.
Yet Wall Street pay seems to defy gravity: Bonuses will be up this year, according to a study to be released on Thursday by a Wall Street compensation expert, Alan Johnson. The survey shows that overall compensation in financial services will rise 5 percent this year, with employees in some businesses like asset management getting increases of 15 percent. 
''I did not expect compensation would come back the way it has,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''I underestimated the industry's resiliency.''
One does not have to look far to see that Wall Street has found its stride again. Hot new restaurants are opening, and they are packed with traders and investment bankers. John DeLucie, the chef and one of the owners of The Lion restaurant, one of Greenwich Village's newest hot spots, said business had been surprisingly strong since it opened in May.
Customers are buying vintage bottles of wine; the restaurant recently sold a 1982 Chateau Mouton Rothschild for $3,950. ''We are seeing a lot of luxury purchases, like vintage Bordeaux, things that we haven't seen sell well in a few years,'' Mr. DeLucie said.
Rich year-end bonuses are expected this year even though the total amount of money set aside for compensation in sales and trading and investment banking for the five big Wall Street banks has shrunk.
Over all, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have set aside $89.54 billion this year to pay employees, 2.8 percent less than a year ago, according to data from the Japanese bank Nomura. Total revenue for the five firms has fallen about 4 percent this year.
But in the wider universe of financial companies, including asset managers and smaller firms, compensation will be modestly higher, Mr. Johnson says.
In compiling his survey, Mr. Johnson says he talks to executives across Wall Street, looks at what has been set aside to date for compensation and then makes estimates based on which divisions are doing well and which are not.
Financial firms will not calculate what exactly will be paid until January. So much depends on what happens in the fourth quarter, Mr. Johnson cautions. If business continues to be sluggish, bonuses may drop from last year.
While the current market may not necessarily justify a bump up in bonuses, Wall Street bankers and traders benefit from a curious economy of their own making. If Wall Street firms start lowering pay, employees will most likely find another firm willing to pay them more. As a result, even in difficult years, Wall Street still doles out big bonuses, typically cutting into what otherwise would go to shareholders.
And this year, while some firms including Bank of America and Credit Suisse have let go of some employees as trading activity has slumped, other firms are hiring, putting upward pressure on 2010 compensation.
For instance, Nomura recently started an aggressive expansion on Wall Street and is paying high prices for many of its new recruits. Morgan Stanley, struggling to find its footing since the 2008 credit crisis, has hired hundreds of traders this year. And despite its third-quarter loss, Morgan Stanley plans to add more staff by year's end. Citigroup, badly bruised by the mortgage crisis, has also shown a willingness to pay millions of dollars for some strategic hires.
''This is the first year we have seen people building again,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''This build is medium sized, not big, but we are coming from nothing, so this is actually a big deal.''
The line item likely to garner the most attention this year is executive pay, the bonuses that go to top executives like Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs and Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase. Pay for the most senior executives across Wall Street fell during the credit crisis. Still, President Obama called the bonuses paid during the crisis ''shameful.''
But chief executives should see a ''meaningful'' increase this year, Mr. Johnson said.
''Senior executive pay will go up more than the rest,'' he said. ''I think executives are saying 'I didn't get paid much for two years and now I want something.'''
In 2009, Mr. Blankfein, who runs Wall Street's most profitable firm, received a $9 million all-stock bonus. In 2008, the year the financial system nearly collapsed, he took no bonus. In 2007, he took $68.5 million in cash and stock, a record payday for a Wall Street chief.
Lower down the food chain, Wall Street employees tend to get a base salary of $100,000 to $200,000; the rest comes in big year-end bonuses. Firms typically pay out 40 percent to 50 percent of their revenue in compensation and benefits. Top employees often make well in excess of $10 million a year.
Mr. Johnson said asset management employees, hard hit last year, could see their compensation rise as much as 15 percent in 2010.
However, fixed-income and equity traders will not fare quite as well, he said, predicting the difficult trading environment recently could result in a 40 percent compensation cut for some employees. This, of course, is off a high base in 2009, when these divisions did quite well.
Executives in private equity and those who handle mergers and acquisitions will see their pay rise slightly, as much as 5 percent, Mr. Johnson said. Those who work in retail banking will see a slightly larger bump, between 5 and 10 percent. The big losers, he says, will be traders in fixed income and equities, with only some groups, like commodities traders, doing better.
Lucy Cabrera, president and chief executive of the Food Bank for New York City, said she expected it to take two years for the new wealth from Wall Street to trickle down to Main Street. She said 93 percent of the agencies the food bank services have seen an increase in first-time users, one sign that those hurt by the 2008 crisis have only just run out of money. ''Let's hope this news means increased spending and jobs for others,'' she said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Road Ahead Turns Right

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
Energized by their big victories in the midterm elections, Congressional Republican leaders wasted no time on Wednesday in putting President Obama and Democrats on notice: the days of single-party control are numbered and legislating in Washington is about to get a whole lot more complicated.
Oh, and by the way, lest anyone forget: Republicans still have major problems with the two major pieces of legislation that Democrats pushed through this year -- the overhauls of health care and financial regulation -- and they intend to do something about it as soon as they can. 
In addition, the Republicans want to continue all of the Bush-era tax cuts -- a step Mr. Obama opposes. Cutting government spending is high on the list, a goal the president shares, although Republican leaders have yet to offer specifics.
They also seemed likely to push forward with their own legislation, challenging Democrats to deal with the government-sponsored mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and pressing on various economic and trade issues.
At a news conference at the Capitol, the likely speaker, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, and the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, both said they wanted the health care law repealed and replaced.
''I believe that the health care bill that was enacted by the current Congress will kill jobs in America, ruin the best health care system in the world and bankrupt our country,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''That means that we have to do everything we can to try to repeal this bill, and replace it with common-sense reforms that will bring down the cost of health insurance.'' Earlier in the day, Mr. Boehner called the health care law a ''monstrosity.''
The prospects of a repeal are extremely slim, given that Democrats hold a majority in the Senate and Mr. Obama enjoys veto power. But Republicans are likely to insist on changing whatever provisions they can.
On the financial regulation front, Republicans did not threaten to repeal the law, but they said they would use the leverage of their new House majority to conduct careful oversight, which could include hearings and the use of subpoena power.
''When it comes to the financial services bill and the 358 regulatory filings required under that bill,'' Mr. Boehner said, ''it's going to require a significant amount of oversight -- so that not only will the Congress understand, but the American people will understand, just what this bill will do to our financial services industry.'' The Republicans will also most likely seek changes to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which they believe was given too much power.
And in the Senate, Republicans emboldened by their election victories could take a more aggressive stance in blocking Mr. Obama's nominees.
While leaders in both parties have hinted at the possibility of reaching agreements on relatively modest legislation dealing with energy or education, fiscal issues like taxes or government spending cut straight to some of the core philosophical disagreements between the two sides.
While divided government inevitably creates opportunities for compromise, the recent acrimony in Congress suggests that efforts to work together could just as easily collapse in a fusillade of angry floor speeches, filibusters by the Senate Republicans and veto threats by the White House.
Gov. Haley Barbour, Republican of Mississippi, who joined Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell at the news conference, suggested that his party might feel a bit unwilling to give ground considering the election results. ''The policies of the Obama administration, the Pelosi-Reid Congress, were repudiated by the voters,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Sorting Out the Election

 BODY:
Tuesday's election was indeed a ''shellacking'' for the Democrats, as President Obama admitted after a long night of bad news. It was hardly an order from the American people to discard the progress of the last two years and start over again.
Mr. Obama was on target when he said voters howled in frustration at the slow pace of economic recovery and job creation. To borrow his running automotive metaphor, voters threw the keys at Republicans and told them to drive for a while, but gave almost no indication of what direction to drive in. 
Republican leaders, who will take over the House and have a bigger minority in the Senate, say they heard the American people tell them to repeal the ''monstrosity'' of health care reform, in the words of the likely House speaker, John Boehner. In fact, the American people said no such thing. In polls of Tuesday's voters, only 18 percent said health care was the nation's top issue. While 48 percent of voters said they wanted to repeal the health care law, 47 percent said they wanted to keep it the way it is or expand it -- hardly a roaring consensus.
The ''loud message'' to cut spending cited by Mr. Boehner was actually far more muted. The polls showed that 39 percent of voters say cutting the deficit should be the highest priority of Congress, but a statistically equal 37 percent prefer spending money to create jobs. Fully a third of those who want to spend money to create jobs were Republicans.
More voters (correctly) blamed President George W. Bush for the economic problems than President Obama, and even more (also correctly) blamed Wall Street.
The Republican victory was impressive and definitive, although voters who made it happen were hardly spread evenly across the electorate. The victory was built largely on the heavy turnout of older blue-collar white men, most in the South or the rusting Midwest.
Democratic candidates did better among voters younger than 30, minorities, city dwellers, and those living on the East or West Coasts. But women essentially split their vote between the parties -- and that is a major challenge to the Democrats, who also failed to turn out their core voters among young people and minorities.
The new Republican officeholders will have to quickly address the economic pain and fear expressed by the voters who flocked to them in frustration. But it does those voters no good to say the answer is as simple as cutting discretionary government spending. It is time to show how cuts would lead to jobs and to specify which ones should be made -- and how they plan to reduce the deficit while also preserving the Bush-era tax cuts.
Mr. Obama offered some specific ideas. Extending unemployment insurance. Extending tax cuts for the middle class. Providing tax breaks for companies that are investing in American research and development.
He proposed finding common ground on energy policy, developing domestic natural gas resources and encouraging electric cars. He took Republicans up on their offer to start banning earmarks, while urging greater investment in infrastructure. And he acknowledged that he could have done more to change Washington's messy and secretive ways, and to have been in closer touch with those suffering from the recession.
The question is how the Republicans will act. For two years, they have refused to cooperate on any of those ideas, simply to deny Mr. Obama a policy victory and try to reduce his re-election prospects. If they are serious about accepting Tuesday's mantle, they will join in governing and not simply posturing.

HEADLINE: Democrats Outrun by a Two-Year Comeback Plan

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
The PowerPoint slides presented to House Republicans in January 2009 seemed incongruously optimistic at a time when the very word ''hope'' belonged to the newly ascendant Democrats and their incoming president, Barack Obama.
''If the goal of the majority is to govern, what is the purpose of the minority?'' one slide asked.
''The purpose of the minority,'' came the answer, ''is to become the majority.''
The presentation was the product of a strategy session held 11 days before Mr. Obama's inauguration, when top Republican leaders in the House of Representatives began devising an early blueprint for what they would accomplish in Tuesday's election: their comeback. 
How they did it is the story of one of the most remarkable Congressional campaigns in more than a half-century, characterized by careful plotting by Republicans, miscalculations by Democrats and a new political dynamic with forces out of both parties control. The unpredictable Tea Party movement, the torrent of corporate money from outside interests and an electorate with deep discontent helped shift the balance of power in Washington.
The White House struggled to keep Democrats in line, with a misplaced confidence in the power of the coalition that propelled Mr. Obama into office. Republicans capitalized on backlash to the ambitious agenda Mr. Obama and his party pursued, which fueled unrestricted and often anonymous contributions to conservative groups, some advised by a nemesis Democrats thought they had shaken, Karl Rove. That money so strengthened the Republican assault across the country that an exasperated Democratic party strategist likened it to ''nuclear Whac-a-Mole.''
Most of all, Republican leaders had the foresight to imagine the possibility of winning again. Even now, they believe they could have taken back the Senate if they had just managed to block at least two Tea Party candidates who proved unelectable.
At that Republican retreat in January 2009, gathering inside a historic inn in Annapolis, Md., the group -- led by Representatives John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader, and Eric Cantor of Virginia, the whip -- did not tolerate the hand-wringing that consumed so many Republicans that dark winter.
Instead, they walked through a by-the-numbers picture of Democratic vulnerability that had been lost in the excitement over Mr. Obama's election. Some 83 Democrats held seats in districts that once supported President George W. Bush; more than two dozen won their last elections by wafer-thin margins, according to a Republican document provided to The New York Times.
In their quest to reach a majority, the Republican leaders imposed tough party discipline, warning incumbents that the party would no longer act as a ''welfare state'' for those who were lax fund-raisers. They began an aggressive recruiting effort for top-flight candidates in districts that seemed to be virtually owned by some of the longest-serving Democrats in the House. And they were keenly aware of the anti-establishment mood, rarely engaging with Tea Party challengers, as Senate leaders did, fearful that any efforts to influence primary races could backfire.
They also tried to push Democrats into retirement, using what was described in the presentation as ''guerilla tactics'' like chasing Democratic members down with video cameras and pressing them to explain votes or positions. (One target, Representative Bob Etheridge of North Carolina, had to apologize for manhandling one of his inquisitors in a clip memorialized on YouTube. Only this week did Republican strategists acknowledge they were behind the episode.)
Improbably, Mr. Boehner's team turned the notion that Republicans could not afford to be the ''Party of No'' -- or, in his words, the party of ''Hell no'' -- on its ear, successfully portraying it as a virtue in the face of Mr. Obama's legislative priorities. But even that team never predicted the sort of victory they experienced Tuesday night.
''I remember people laughing at me back when they thought Republicans were a lot like dinosaurs,'' Representative Pete Sessions, the Texan who leads the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in an interview. ''Our mission statement was to retire Nancy Pelosi. That was the whole mission statement.''
Borrowed Playbook
They may not have liked Rahm Emanuel's policies, but they envied his tactics.
The Republican leaders had watched and studied Mr. Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff and congressman who engineered the Democratic takeover of Congress in 2006, and they had his playbook in mind as they plotted a course to win back their own majority.
The first step was recruiting candidates, a task that fell to Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, one of three self-titled Young Guns of the House.
Mr. McCarthy, who often saw Mr. Emanuel during workouts at the House gymnasium, admired his aggressive political style and adopted his approach by persuading Republicans to challenge Democrats who seemed far less vulnerable at the time.
A top recruit came in the Northwoods of Wisconsin, where Sean Duffy, a county prosecutor and former reality show star on MTV's ''Real World,'' agreed to take on Representative David R. Obey, who had won 21 straight races and was elected two years before Mr. Duffy was born.
Over the last two election cycles, Democrats had gained 55 seats in the House, many in districts deep into Republican territory. And that is where the Republican leaders began, hoping to cut that daunting number by forcing out longtime Democratic incumbents.
They ran advertisements in their districts, hoping to scare them into retirement, given that even Democrats knew that the Congressional campaign of 2010 would be difficult. Only twice in the last 75 years has a president's party not lost seats in an off-year election.
Several Democrats did retire. And many of those who did not -- including Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the chairman of the Budget Committee, who received a personal appeal from the president to run for a 15th term -- ended up losing on Tuesday.
Comfort and Confidence
Democrats were no less aware of their vulnerabilities.
But they had succeeded in beating back challenges in a string of special elections earlier in the year that gave them a false sense of confidence. ''We are going to maintain our majority,'' Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the House majority leader, declared when Mark Critz, a Democrat, beat his Republican opponent in the May race for the seat vacated by the death of Representative John P. Murtha, Democrat of Pennsylvania.
Democrats had also taken comfort that their Congressional candidates had raised more money than their Republican challengers, believing it would help them withstand the hostile political atmosphere in the country.
Mr. Emanuel, before stepping down from his White House post to run for mayor in Chicago, often produced a spreadsheet when reporters asked if Democrats were ready for the final push of the campaign. The document, which circulated between the White House and Capitol Hill, included a candidate-by-candidate list pointing to Democratic strength.
And while the White House was keenly aware that Mr. Rove and others were out looking for unlimited corporate cash to help them take on Democrats, a report by one of the main groups he helped start, American Crossroads provided more false reassurance. Filed in June, it showed a paltry monthly fund-raising total of $200.
At the time, it seemed the group had collected far less than the $52 million it vowed to raise. That figure, officials with the group now say, was something of a confident bluff -- they hoped they could hit the mark, but were by no means certain. The number was the invention of Jim Dyke, a former Republican Party strategist who was on the American Crossroads board and believed the group needed to send a signal that it intended to have a major impact.
''We needed to raise a good bit of money to be credible,'' Mr. Dyke said. ''So when I thought about 'credible,' I figured raising and spending what at the time would have been the same amount of money as the unions was credible.'' (Labor unions ultimately spent much more than that on behalf of Democrats.)
In truth, the group had early commitments of $30 million, but its chief executive overseeing day-to-day operations, Steven Law, said in an interview that he was not initially sure all of those would materialize.
On a fund-raising trip with Mr. Rove through Tennessee and Texas, Mr. Law found donors expressing hesitation, telling him, ''Other groups have a track record, you don't.''
Crossroads had yet to get involved in a race and now needed an opportunity to show it could have an impact.
It found one, he said, in Sharron Angle, the Tea Party candidate in Nevada who unexpectedly won the Republican primary for the seat held by Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader. Ms. Angle had emerged as the nominee virtually broke, and the rest of the Republican establishment was shunning her, worried that some of her extreme statements -- suggesting, for example, that rape victims should make ''lemonade'' out of unwanted pregnancies -- made her a weak candidate.
Within days, American Crossroads flooded the state with anti-Reid ads. Donors noticed. ''It was like turning on a light switch,'' Mr. Law said.
And so began what became the largest financial involvement from outside groups in American midterm elections. American Crossroads and a sister organization, Crossroads GPS, went on to raise more than $70 million.
Rush of Advertising
Making the groups all the more potent was that they were coordinating with each other and several more, all with an eye on dumping money into seats where the party committees were not helping financially struggling Republican candidates who might have a shot.
''We had the intention of expanding the field all along,'' Mr. Rove said in an interview. ''The idea was to keep broadening the field and to make them fight in more places.''
Around Labor Day, Democratic leaders in the Senate worried that their candidates were overwhelmed by the outside money, and asked the White House to publicly raise it as an issue.
It was not until Mr. Obama began mentioning the name of Mr. Rove that loyal Democratic voters took notice. So the president began singling him out again and again, which may have energized those liberal voters with a particular ire for Mr. Rove, but did not stop the ads.
Frustrated Democratic candidates complained that the White House was spending more time talking about the outside money, an issue they did not believe was as important to voters as job creation and spurring the economy.
While Republican officials say they now believe they would have won control of the House without the groups, they do not believe they would have won by the same margins -- or that they would have had the same gains in the Senate.
''We've had cavalry showing up on hilltops that have never shown up before to help us,'' said Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, a vice chairman of the Republican Congressional committee.
Bill Miller, the national political director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, recalled how his team ran an advertisement against Representative Joe Sestak, running for the Senate in Pennsylvania, claiming that he voted with Ms. Pelosi 100 percent of the time -- knowing it might be a slight exaggeration.
He said his team was thrilled when Mr. Sestak raised a public objection, arguing that, in fact, he voted with Ms. Pelosi 97 percent of the time. In a climate where Ms. Pelosi was toxic, ''I was like, 'Jackpot,' '' Mr. Miller said. (Mr. Sestak lost in a close race.)
Democrats had a different reaction to the rush of advertisements, at times bordering on panic.
In early October, Chuck Wolfe, the chief executive of the Victory Fund and Leadership Institute, a group that supports gay candidates, offered some startling news to the campaign of Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who represented what had for years been considered a reliably safe district.
Mr. Wolfe had been at a Capitol Hill restaurant the evening before and overheard a Republican advertising strategist discussing his new assignment, to attack Mr. Frank with an expected budget of $1 million and a strategy to ''piss him off, because you know how Barney gets.'' Mr. Wolfe said afterward, ''That anybody thought Barney could be vulnerable in his district seemed surprising.'' Mr. Frank survived.
Others were not so lucky.
Representative Alan Grayson, Democrat of Florida, stood outside his home in Orlando two weeks before the election and marveled at the scope of the attacks and the candidates they were backing. ''They think they can elect a ham sandwich,'' he said.
He expressed relief that the barrage against him had come to an end, noting that his attackers appeared to have concluded that their work with him was done and moved on to another member.
They were correct. He was one of the 60 Democrats who lost their seats on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: A More Aggressive Response After Months of Holding Back

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
For much of the last year, there were three basic camps on what the Federal Reserve should be doing.
One focused on the risks of the Fed's taking more action to help the economy. This camp -- known as the hawks, because of their vigilance against inflation -- worried that the Fed could be sowing the seeds of future inflation and that any further action might cause global investors to panic.
Another camp -- the doves -- argued instead that the Fed had not done enough: inflation remained near zero, and unemployment near a 30-year high. 
In the middle were Ben Bernanke and other top Fed officials, who struggled to make up their minds about who was correct. For months, they came down closer to the hawks and did little to help the economy. On Wednesday, they effectively acknowledged that they had made the wrong choice.
The risks of inaction have turned out to be the real problem.
The recovery has not been as strong as the Fed forecast. Businesses became more cautious about hiring after the European debt crisis in the spring. State governments began cutting workers around the same time, and the flow of federal stimulus money began to slow. Since May, the economy has lost 400,000 jobs.
Now -- six months later, with Congress unlikely to spend more -- the Fed is getting more aggressive. (And, yes, the idea that the doves are the advocates for aggression is indeed a bit odd.) Having long ago reduced its benchmark short-term interest rate to zero, the Fed will again begin buying bonds, as it did last year, to reduce long-term interest rates, like those on mortgages. Lower rates typically lead to more borrowing and spending by households and businesses.
Of course, the risks of taking action have not gone away. The new policy could eventually cause inflation to spike. All else equal, a policy that encourages more spending will cause prices to rise. And if investors begin to think that a dollar tomorrow will be worth much less than one today, they may refuse to lend money at low interest rates, undercutting the whole point of the bond purchases. Separately, the Fed, like any bond buyer, could end up losing money on the purchases, worsening the federal budget deficit.
What's striking about the last six months, however, is how much more accurate the doves' diagnosis of the economy has looked than the hawks'.
Early this year, for example, Thomas Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Fed and probably the most prominent hawk, gave a speech in Washington warning about the risks of an overheated economy and inflation. Mr. Hoenig suggested that the kind of severe inflation that the United States experienced in the 1970s or even that Germany did in the 1920s was a real possibility.
When he gave the speech, annual inflation was 2.7 percent. Today, it's 1.1 percent.
The doves, on the other hand, pointed out that recoveries from financial crises tended to be weak because consumers and businesses were slow to resume spending. Around the world over the last century, the typical crisis caused the jobless rate to rise for almost five years, according to research by the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff. By that timetable, the unemployment rate would rise for a year and a half more.
Perhaps the clearest case for more action came from within the Fed itself. In June, an economist at the San Francisco Fed published a report analyzing how aggressive monetary policy should be, based on past policy and on the current levels of unemployment and inflation.
As a benchmark, it looked at the Fed's effective interest rate, taking into account the actual short-term rate as well as any bond purchases to reduce long-term rates. Because the short-term rate was zero and the Fed bought bonds in 2009, the report judged the effective interest rate to be below zero -- about negative 2 percent.
And what should the effective rate have been, based on the economy's condition? Negative 5 percent, the analysis concluded. In other words, the Fed wasn't buying enough bonds.
All the while, global investors have continued to show no signs of panicking. If anything, as the economy weakened over the summer, investors became more willing to lend money to the United States, viewing its economy as a safer bet than most others.
After the Fed's announcement on Wednesday, many of the hawks who warned about inflation earlier this year repeated those warnings anew. The Cato Institute, citing a former vice president of the Dallas Fed, said the new program would ''sink'' the economy. Mr. Hoenig provided the lone vote inside the Fed against the bond purchases.
It's always possible that the critics are correct and that, this time, inflation really is just around the corner. But there is still no good evidence of it.
Some economists are optimistic that it has finally found the right balance. Manoj Pradhan, a global economist at Morgan Stanley, pointed out that bond purchase programs lifted growth in Europe and the United States last year -- and a broadly similar approach also helped end the Great Depression. ''There are no guarantees,'' Mr. Pradhan said, ''but the historical precedents certainly suggest it will work.''
Others, though, wonder if the program is both too late and too little. ''I'm a little disappointed,'' said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist who has strongly argued for more action. The announced pace of bond purchases appears somewhat slower than Fed officials had recently been signaling, Mr. Gagnon added, which may explain why interest rates on 30-year bonds actually rose after the Fed announcement.
One thing seems undeniable: the Fed's task is harder than it would have been six months ago. Businesses and consumers may now wonder if any new signs of recovery are another false dawn. And although Mr. Bernanke quietly credits the stimulus program last year with being a big help, more stimulus spending seems very unlikely now.
Unfortunately, in monetary policy, as in many other things, there are no do-overs.

HEADLINE: THE GREAT DIVIDE: OBAMA AND G.O.P.

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and CARL HULSE; Megan Thee-Brenan, Michael Luo and Joseph Berger contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama and newly empowered Republican leaders professed a desire Wednesday to work together but yielded little ground on deep policy differences, foreshadowing the profound challenge of turning around a flagging economy under a divided government.
After what Mr. Obama described as an electoral ''shellacking'' for his party, the two sides gingerly explored the reshaped political terrain and sought to define Tuesday's results. Republicans claimed a mandate to reverse Mr. Obama's agenda while the president cast the vote as a cry of frustration that he has not moved fast enough.
''Over the last two years, we've made progress,'' Mr. Obama said at a White House news conference intended to reassert his leadership as Republicans celebrated their capture of the House and gains in the Senate. ''But, clearly, too many Americans haven't felt that progress yet, and they told us that yesterday. And as president, I take responsibility for that.'' 
More conciliatory than contrite, Mr. Obama used that phrase, ''take responsibility,'' six times but rejected the suggestion that his policies were moving the country in the wrong direction. He conceded that legislation to limit greenhouse gases was dead and said he was ''absolutely'' willing to negotiate over the extension of tax cuts, including for the wealthy. But he drew the line at any major retreat from signature priorities, saying he would agree to ''tweak'' his health care program, not ''relitigate arguments'' over its central elements.
While Republicans also called for more cooperation, they suggested that Democrats might not have fully absorbed the lessons of their drubbing.
''Their view is that we haven't cooperated enough,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader. ''I think what the American people were saying yesterday is that they appreciated us saying no to the things that the American people indicated they were not in favor of.''
The trials awaiting a fractured capital could arrive swiftly when the departing Democratic-controlled Congress returns in lame-duck session this month with contentious issues like tax cuts, the federal debt limit, unemployment insurance, an arms control treaty with Russia and gay men and lesbians in the military all on the table.
As Washington awoke to the new order on Wednesday, Republicans had picked up at least 60 seats in the House, with 11 races undecided, the biggest swing since the 1948 elections under President Harry S. Truman. They took at least six seats in the Senate, falling short of control, with two races undecided.
In Colorado, Senator Michael Bennet, the Democrat, won, while in Washington Senator Patty Murray led her Republican challenger by one percentage point. In Alaska, Senator Lisa Murkowski, who ran as a write-in after losing the Republican primary, appeared poised to surpass both party nominees. If the incumbents hang onto their seats, The Democratic caucus will have a majority of 53 to 47.
The election results immediately played out on Capitol Hill as House Republicans began a leadership shuffle and Democrats awaited a decision by Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California on whether she intended to remain as her party's leader in the minority. Ms. Pelosi told Diane Sawyer of ABC News that she would talk with her family ''and pray over it'' before deciding but added that she had ''no regrets'' and blamed the economy for her party's losses.
''Nine and a half percent unemployment is a very eclipsing event,'' she said. ''If people don't have a job, they're not too interested in how you intend for them to have a job. They want to see results.''
Their rise to power means Republicans have more leadership positions to fill. With Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio slated to become speaker and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia expected to become majority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, who was active in recruiting candidates this year, announced he would seek the No. 3 job of majority whip.
Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, formerly leader of a bloc of House conservatives, is seeking the No. 4 slot, conference chairman. He could face a challenge from Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a Tea Party favorite.
Making his debut as speaker in waiting, Mr. Boehner predicted that he would be able to work well with the incoming conservative class elected on Tuesday. ''What unites us as Republicans will be the agenda of the American people,'' he said. ''And if we're listening to the American people, I don't see any problems incorporating members of the Tea Party, along with our party, in a quest that's really the same.''
Mr. Boehner could find that unity tested, probably early next year, when the House must vote on raising the federal debt ceiling. Most Republicans in recent years have refused to support such increases, and many candidates this year ran on a platform opposing any increase in red ink. But as the party soon to be in charge of the House, Republicans run the risk of triggering a government default and a financial crisis should they refuse to increase federal borrowing power.
Mr. Boehner had no ready answer for how Republicans would handle the potentially explosive issue. ''We'll be working that out over the next couple of months,'' he said.
Except for early in President George W. Bush's tenure, when a party switch briefly handed control of the Senate to Democrats, this will be the first time Congress has been split between the parties since the 1986 election. The Senate may prove useful to Mr. Obama in killing Republican initiatives he opposes but it remains unclear whether he will be able to play off a Republican House heading into 2012 the way President Bill Clinton used a Republican-controlled Congress as a foil for his re-election in 1996.
The divide between the two chambers was evident as Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, having survived an election scare, emerged to argue that the lesson of the election was that voters want more cooperation from the parties. The onus, he said, is on Republicans.
''Republicans must take their responsibility to solve the problems of ordinary Americans,'' Mr. Reid said in a conference call with reporters. ''No is not the answer. It has to be yes. Not our yes, but a combined yes, something we work out, a consensus yes. The time for politics is over.''
Weakened by the election results, Mr. Obama sought Wednesday to occupy the public stage and take his punishment without surrendering stature. He announced no staff shuffle or new direction, as presidents sometimes do when they get in trouble. But he called the defeat ''humbling'' and said ''it feels bad'' to see so many allies go down for voting for his program.
''This is something that I think every president needs to go through,'' he said. ''In the rush of activity, sometimes we lose track of, you know, the ways that we connected with voters that got us here in the first place.''
Living in the White House, he said, ''it is hard not to seem removed.''
But he quickly added, to laughter: ''Now, I'm not recommending for every future president that they take a shellacking like I did last night. I'm sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons.''
Still, his analysis of that shellacking differed sharply from that of the Republicans and many independent strategists. He agreed that many voters felt government was growing too large and intrusive. But he maintained his were still the right policies.
''It would be hard to argue that we're going backwards,'' he said. ''I think what you can argue is we're stuck in neutral.''
Where he conceded a misstep was in failing to follow through on promises to reform the way Washington works out of a need to confront the economic crises he inherited: ''We were in such a hurry to get things done that we didn't change how things got done. And I think that frustrated people.''
Mr. Obama said he was ''very eager to sit down'' with Republicans and laid out ''a whole bunch of areas where we can agree,'' including job creation, deficit reduction, energy independence, education reform and infrastructure investment. While a carbon cap cannot pass ''this year or next year or the year after,'' he said, he suggested that he and Republicans could collaborate to promote natural gas, electric cars and nuclear energy.
He specifically embraced a proposal by Mr. Cantor to impose a moratorium on special Congressional spending items known as earmarks. Asked if there was anything in the Republicans' Pledge to America campaign manifesto that he could support, he mentioned its promises to reform how Washington works.
''I do believe there is hope for civility,'' he said. ''I do believe there's hope for progress.''

HEADLINE: A Royal Family Legal Fight Heads to a City Courtroom

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
Family disputes over money are almost always unpleasant and difficult to untangle. When such a dispute involves a family that rules a small country and a fortune that amounts to tens of billions of dollars, the complications multiply.
That is the case with a legal odyssey between the sultan of Brunei and his youngest brother, which has tumbled along for more than a decade, sweeping through courtrooms in various corners of the globe, including London, Brunei, the Cayman Islands, Malaysia and Singapore.
Now, an offshoot of the dispute between the sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah, and his brother, Prince Jefri Bolkiah, has found its way to a courtroom in New York City. 
A trial is expected to start next week in State Supreme Court in Manhattan in which Prince Jefri and Bruneian companies he once owned are suing two lawyers whom the prince hired. They are accused of pillaging some of the assets, including the Palace Hotel on Madison Avenue, that the prince had hired them to oversee.
The lawyers, Faith Zaman and Thomas W. Derbyshire, who are married, ''engaged in misconduct to enrich themselves at the expense of Prince Jefri,'' the prince and the companies claimed in a complaint filed three years ago.
The defendants' lawyers have said that their clients were authorized to take all the money they did and that Prince Jefri was making scapegoats of their clients to cover his own mismanagement of funds that his brother entrusted to him. The defense lawyers have tried to shift the focus from their clients' alleged misconduct to the prince's lavish lifestyle, which includes erotic statues he commissioned, fancy cars, dozens of wives and mistresses and a yacht.
''It's a way of him avoiding responsibility for his own conduct,'' Mark A. Cymrot, the lawyer for Ms. Zaman, said of Prince Jefri.
Ms. Zaman and Mr. Derbyshire are countersuing Prince Jefri, 56, for millions of dollars in what they said were unpaid legal fees.
The path to this case started with the Asian economic crash in 1997 and a drop in oil prices. This sputtering economy gave Brunei, an oil-rich nation on the northwest edge of Borneo, a harsh dose of reality.
Until then, its citizens lived in tax-free prosperity, perhaps no one more so than Prince Jefri. His brother, the sultan, put him in charge of much of the country's wealth. But after the downturn hit, the sultan filed a lawsuit against his brother in 2000, accusing him of misspending some $15 billion.
They quickly reached a settlement, with Prince Jefri agreeing to give back all his assets around the world and live on a monthly allowance of $300,000. But that was not the end of the legal wrangling.
Over the course of the next decade, the sultan accused his brother of not adhering to the terms of the settlement by doing things like holding secret bank accounts and not turning over properties that he said he would.
A few years ago, a British court held Prince Jefri in contempt, saying he had not disclosed all his assets. If Prince Jefri were to try to return to his home in London, he would most likely be arrested, and so now he finds himself confined to Brunei.
The London court ultimately ruled that Prince Jefri had to give up the rest of his assets, which he is said to have done. But while he was still clashing with his brother, Prince Jefri filed the lawsuit three years ago against Ms. Zaman and Mr. Derbyshire. He claimed that they funneled money their way without permission.
In one instance, the defendants are accused of using the money from a property sold in Las Vegas to buy themselves houses. In another, they are accused of using corporate credit cards tied to the Palace Hotel to buy designer clothes, jewelry, flights and electronics.
A New York judge ruled in 2008 that the Palace Hotel should be returned to the Bruneian government. Even though Prince Jefri no longer owns that and some of the other entities that are plaintiffs in the lawsuit, the Bruneian government has continued fighting to recoup the money.
But Ms. Zaman and Mr. Derbyshire said in their countersuit that they were the ones who were cheated. Prince Jefri did not pay them all the legal fees they were promised, according to their countersuit. Prince Jefri told them they could take some assets to make up for some of the fees he did not pay them, their lawyer said.

HEADLINE: Relieved but Not Surprised by the Fed's Actions, Investors Lift Shares Slightly

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Nelson D. Schwartz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Squawk boxes barked the news over the trading floor at Barclays: the Fed was back in.
Inside the Manhattan headquarters of the British bank -- and, indeed, throughout the financial world -- word Wednesday afternoon that the Federal Reserve was making another effort to revive the American economy drowned out everything else.
Yes, the Republicans had swept to victory in the midterm elections, as many on Wall Street had hoped. But it was the Fed, not the elections, that captivated the world's markets. 
After months of speculation, the Fed announced that it would embark on another round of what is known as quantitative easing. That is, the central bank would buy Treasury securities on the open market -- this time, to the tune of $600 billion.
The response was swift. The broad stock market, which has been rallying since August in the hope of just such a step, rose to its highest level in two years. Prices of Treasury notes rose, while those of long-term government bonds fell. The weak dollar weakened further.
But the question left lingering was whether this new effort by the Fed would be enough. Many analysts were doubtful, particularly given that the Republicans' gains in Congress made it far less likely that the Obama administration would be able to embark on new programs to revive growth through government spending.
Indeed, no sooner did the Fed's news hit, about 2:15 p.m., than some financial analysts began assessing the possibilities for still more action from the central bank. Others suggested that the Fed had struck a delicate balance and carefully met investors' expectations.
''I sensed caution from the Fed here,'' said Larry Kantor, head of research at Barclays, in an interview just off the trading floor, where traders were still digesting the Fed's news. ''They have already done as much as they can in monetary policy and they did not want to take it much further. It is not in monetary policy where the problems lie.''
Even before the opening bell sounded, Wednesday looked like a difficult day for Wall Street. Many analysts had spent Tuesday night analyzing the election results and their implications for various industries.
Dean Maki, Barclays's chief United States economist, said the outcome of the elections made even less likely any new fiscal stimulus to help the economy -- and raised uncertainty about whether Bush-era tax cuts would be extended in December.
But then came the Fed, which had been widely expected to take new action. Analysts said the Fed had managed to do a balancing act in more or less meeting market expectations. A lower number would have pushed long-term interest rates higher. But a figure more than $600 billion would have put more downward pressure on the dollar. The lingering questions are whether the Fed's latest steps will add to the momentum behind the economic recovery and whether growth will succeed in reducing unemployment.
''I think that the market is more certain about what the Fed intentions are and how bold the Fed is, but I think there is lingering unease about whether it can fix the problem,'' said Nick Kalivas, vice president for financial research at MF Global.
''I still think there is debate in the market about whether it is going to fix anything materially and how it is also going to play out in the end, because we are in uncharted territory.''
After a slow start, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.41 points, or 0.24 percent, to 11,215.13, its highest close since September 2008, just before the financial crisis erupted and surpassing the previous high of 11,205.03 on April 26.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.39 points or 0.37 percent, to 1,197.96. The Nasdaq gained 6.75 points or 0.27 percent, to close at 2,540.27.
The mood at the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday was calm, almost anticlimactic.
''In terms of the election, it was all built into the market already,'' said Jason Weisberg, director of institutional trading at Seaport Securities. ''And the Federal Reserve has been telegraphing for weeks what it was planning to do, so there was no big surprise in their decision to buy back $600 billion worth of bonds.''
Because official rates are already near zero, the Fed had been expected to buy Treasury securities to pump more money into the financial system. Wednesday's statement merely provided some clarity.
The purchases are intended to stimulate the economy, but the effect is still uncertain, economists said.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William C. Dudley, said in a speech on Oct. 1 that $500 billion of purchases would provide about as much stimulus as a reduction in the federal funds rate of a half point and three-quarters of a point.
''A trillion dollars based on that arithmetic could potentially add about a half percentage point to growth in each of the next two years,'' said James F. O'Sullivan, the chief economist for MF Global.

HEADLINE: A Scale-Back Is Possible In Financial Overhaul Law

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
Only three months after the enactment in July of the Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulation legislation that was intended as a response to the financial crisis, a section of the act has already been repealed.
Though that effort -- a bipartisan rollback of the ability of the Securities and Exchange Commission to exempt some data from the Freedom of Information Act -- shows that Congress is not averse to rethinking parts of the law, it is small potatoes compared with the changes that some opponents of Dodd-Frank would like to see.
Those include reining in the powers of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, reconsidering limits on debit card fees and restricting the budgets and growth of the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In addition, Republicans and opponents of the law would like to reverse what they call the institutionalization of ''too big to fail'' for the largest financial companies. 
''We're not under the illusion that there will be a massive rewrite of Dodd-Frank,'' Edward L. Yingling, president and chief executive of the American Bankers Association, said in an interview. But he said that by using its oversight responsibility to conduct hearings on the regulatory process, ''I think the new Congress is going to find that there have been unintended consequences that need to be fixed.''
Near the top of the list for Representative Spencer Bachus, the Alabama Republican in line to become chairman of the Financial Services Committee, is to repeal the provision that calls for the government to seize and liquidate large troubled financial firms, according to people close to the congressman.
The new law put the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in charge of seizing and breaking up large financial firms that are headed for collapse. Mr. Bachus has argued that creates the expectation that investors will be bailed out, and contends that existing bankruptcy law should govern failing financial institutions.
Many Republicans have criticized the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which will regulate institutions that offer financial products -- credit cards, mortgages, checking accounts and the like -- to the public.
In addition to viewing such a vast agency as a second federal regulator of banks, opponents deplored the appointment of a single director to head the bureau rather than a five-member commission of the type that oversees many other regulators.
But President Obama seems unlikely to accept major changes in the agency, administration officials said. ''The president fought to pass this law to empower America's consumers and because he believes that accountability on Wall Street is good for the economy on Main Street,'' Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman, said.
Banks and their trade groups are also focused on the Durbin amendment, which empowered the Federal Reserve to regulate the fees that large banks charge merchants on debit card transactions. TCF National Bank of Minnesota filed a lawsuit last month challenging the constitutionality of the provision.
Some efforts will face long odds, not least because of the ability of Democrats in the Senate to block any broad repeal of Dodd-Frank provisions. But the new Republican House could have an easier time influencing the regulatory process, in part by tightening the purse strings on agencies that are putting the law in place.
The S.E.C. is required by the law to complete more than 100 rulemaking provisions, many of them by next July, along with 20 studies and the establishment of five new offices. Mary L. Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairwoman, said this year that the commission needed to add about 800 staff positions to carry out the new responsibilities. The C.F.T.C., meanwhile, identified 30 broad areas of new rulemaking and said it would require 400 additional staff members once the rules were written to regulate derivatives exchanges, clearing facilities and other areas.
David Hirschmann, president and chief executive of the Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said that the role of Congress in overseeing those expanded regulatory responsibilities would be crucial.
''These are regulators who everyone agreed did not work well'' during the financial crisis, Mr. Hirschmann said. ''Now we've given them hundreds of new rules to turn out and they are taking on extraordinary new responsibilities.''

HEADLINE: Organizers Need Endurance in Recruiting Between Races

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
After chasing the world's fastest marathon runner for the better part of the last decade -- at races, at his home and in New York -- Mary Wittenberg, the president of New York Road Runners, finally caught up to Haile Gebrselassie in southern Ethiopia.
At each turn, she had been gently pressuring him to run the New York City Marathon; Gebrselassie would always respond with the same smile and vague reply: in time.
The time has arrived. Gebrselassie, 37, had broken the world marathon record twice, and New York provided a new challenge. His agent negotiated some terms in April with Road Runners coordinators, and a month later Wittenberg was on a plane to Ethiopia.
She resisted the hard sell when they took an eight-hour car ride to the opening of Gebrselassie's new resort hotel on Lake Hawassa. At the end of her 48-hour stay, Gebrselassie dropped Wittenberg off at the Addis Ababa airport, and put his hands on her shoulders. 
''Don't worry, Mary, I promise you something special,'' Wittenberg said Gebrselassie told her.
The confirmation e-mail came days later.
Wittenberg's pursuit of Gebrselassie, as well as top female athletes like the 2008 United States Olympian Shalane Flanagan, who will make her marathon debut on Sunday in New York, demonstrates the long-term and long-distance commitment it takes for race organizers to recruit top runners.
''Our strategy is to be everywhere, supporting these athletes and building relationships,'' Wittenberg said.
In most other sports, free-agent signings have become transparent to the point of spectacle, and generally teams sign fewer than a half-dozen per year. But every year, the top marathons have to scramble to recreate their fields, factoring in an athlete's performances, injuries and other commitments, including the Olympics, all with far smaller budgets.
In New York, that budget is $2.5 million to $3 million, covering appearance fees and prize money for athletes, Wittenberg said. While that is the single-biggest line item for the nonprofit Road Runners, it is only about 10 percent of the total marathon budget.
Roughly a third (more than $900,000) of the recruiting budget goes to prize money; more money is set aside for time bonuses, which could be significant if men, women and wheelchair racers have particularly strong days.
To keep pace with other fall marathons -- namely Chicago and, to a lesser degree, Berlin-- which compete for the same pool of runners, New York has increased its spending by about 25 percent over the last five years, Wittenberg said. To compensate for the larger appearance fees, race directors are asking athletes to meet with sponsors, talk to youth groups and lead clinics, said Sam Grotewold, the Road Runners elite athlete coordinator.
Exactly what athletes are paid is still murky, though, a vestige of the sport's amateur past and the informal nature of negotiations. The New York Road Runners would not comment on appearance fees.
''A lot of things are still done by handshakes, because there is a lot of trust,'' said Mark Wetmore, who represents runners for Global Athletics & Marketing in Boston.
But several agents said that a small cadre of superstars like Gebrselassie or Paula Radcliffe (who has won New York three times) can command about $400,000 just to show up in New York. (They supplement this with money from shoe companies and other sponsors.) This year, Gebrselassie could also win $130,000 in prize money if he finishes first and $60,000 to $70,000 in a time bonus for breaking the course record.
But appearance fees showered on these world-record holders are the equivalent of those paid to 15 to 20 lower-tier runners, agents said, a sign of a widening compensation gap. The Road Runners will bring in 90 professional athletes for the marathon, and between 40 and 50 will receive some form of appearance fee, Wittenberg said, even if it is as little as $1,000.
''I'd love to see a day where we are paying these athletes more,'' Wittenberg said.
London's marathon, many agents agree, can pay about double what New York can in appearance fees because it has a larger budget and gives money to fewer top runners. The Berlin Marathon spends the bulk of its funds on top runners like Gebrselassie, and on pacesetters.
The New York and Chicago races generally attract different kinds of runners because of the differences in the courses, Chicago being flatter and having record-breaking potential.
The Chicago race director, Carey Pinkowski, and Wittenberg often bump into each other at races and in hotel lobbies when going after elite runners.
''We're good friends, but we're fierce competitors, too,'' Pinkowski said.
New York, as he says in pitches for his own race, is a tougher course and a more inconvenient athlete experience at the start. Wittenberg counters that New York offers a bigger stage because the race is televised in 125 countries, satisfying sponsors and shoe companies. As a result, winning in New York has a commercial value that Chicago or Dubai, which offers one of the largest prize purses, do not.
''Mary much more looks on the marketing point,'' said Jos Hermens, Gebrselassie's Netherlands-based agent.
Pinkowski has his own advantages to lure runners beyond just appearance fees. In 1997, he took Khalid Khannouchi, a leading runner at the time, to a Bulls game, where he arranged to have Michael Jordan stop by. While sitting together on the team's bench, Jordan told Khannouchi, ''Listen, everybody in Chicago wants to see you here and break the record.''
Khannouchi committed to the race after the game.
Three decades ago, when marathon directors started paying runners, Fred Lebow in New York and Bob Bright in Chicago made a show out of haggling over the top athletes as a way to create news media interest, even though they decided in private who they would sign.
These days, the power has shifted to the runners and their agents, who pick the courses that suit their styles and goals.
Some sports economists argue that signing up well-placed celebrities, like the cyclist Lance Armstrong or the actor Edward Norton, would attract just as many television viewers, corporate sponsors and maybe runners.
Wittenberg disagrees. The marathon, she said, is one of the few sports in which professionals and amateurs share the same event, creating more news media coverage.
''A lot of people would argue that 39,000 would show up, but over time you lose the glamour and glory and cool factor and mystique of 'I'm running on the same course as Haile,' '' she said.
This explains why Wittenberg invested so much time in recruiting Flanagan, perhaps America's next great women's marathon runner. Flanagan ran an 8-kilometer race in New York in March 2008. Two months later, she shattered the American record in the women's 10,000 meters in Palo Alto, Calif., and she learned after the race that Wittenberg paid Rose Kosgei about $1,000 to be a pacesetter in the race.
Wittenberg watched Flanagan win the bronze medal in the 10,000 in Beijing in 2008, and last November she put Flanagan in the women's pace car to see the marathon in New York up close. In January, Wittenberg saw Flanagan win her debut at the half-marathon in Houston. It was there that Flanagan agreed to make her marathon debut in New York, to the dismay of Pinkowski in Chicago.
''She's always been a figure in the track and field, always there to say hello,'' Flanagan said of Wittenberg. ''Sometimes she's doing things behind the scenes, too, like the godfather.''

PERSON: Rochelle Slovin 

HEADLINE: It's a Wrap: Director of Film Museum Plans to Retire

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Rochelle Slovin remembers what it was like when she came to Astoria, Queens, in 1981 to try to turn a dilapidated film studio building into a museum about movies and television, how she had to dodge the pigeons and the soiled mattresses where kids had been shooting drugs -- all in her high heels.
''I got dressed up every day,'' she said. ''I dressed up to keep up my spirits. I dressed up in a little compact with myself that there was going to be something here.'' 
Ms. Slovin did manage to make something there: the Museum of the Moving Image, which calls itself the only museum in the United States -- and the first in the world -- devoted to film, television and digital media and from which Ms. Slovin plans to retire in February, after 30 years as director.
These days Ms. Slovin is walking in her high heels through yet another building transformation, a $67 million expansion and renovation of the museum that will reopen on Jan. 15.
The building project, completed in difficult economic times, will double the size of the institution and take it firmly into the realm of today's technology. It is very much Ms. Slovin's legacy as she turns over her post to Carl Goodman, the museum's senior deputy director. ''The museum is about to enter a whole new phase of its existence,'' she said.
It is hard to imagine the driven, dynamic Ms. Slovin -- ''bossy'' by her own description -- retiring from anything, let alone the institution that has been her baby for so many years. With her distinctive flowing white hair, she has long been a recognizable fixture on the New York cultural scene.
But in a lengthy interview at her office, Ms. Slovin, 70 -- known to most as Shelly -- said she was ready to hand over the reins to Mr. Goodman, who has been at the museum since 1991.
''He's ideally suited to carry on,'' she said.
Mr. Goodman said, ''This is not a story of an outsider coming in to shake things up.''
At the same time he acknowledged that he was stepping into big shoes (or high heels). Ms. Slovin ''created something out of nothing,'' he said. ''She made the impossible possible.''
Ms. Slovin was hardly a natural candidate to run a cultural institution. Although she had a degree from Columbia Business School, Ms. Slovin spent most of her early career performing in avant-garde productions at Off Off Broadway theaters like La MaMa. ''My mother-in-law was furious that I was working -- 'a woman's place is in the home' -- she really wasn't kidding,'' Ms. Slovin said. ''If I had been a very different person, a more courageous person, or born in a different time, I would have been a theater director. For me it was impossible.''
After the births of her two sons, Ms. Slovin worked in politics and government and went on to direct the New York City CETA Artists Project, a publicly financed employment program for creative artists in the vein of the W.P.A. She is married to a philosopher, Edmund Leites.
Ms. Slovin was hired by the Astoria Motion Picture and Television Center Foundation, formed in 1977 to save the studio complex, which had been home to Gloria Swanson's silent films and Marx Brothers comedies. ''She had the vision for what this should be,'' Herbert S. Schlosser, the museum's chairman, said.
The museum opened in 1988 with a collection largely comprised of Ms. Slovin's flea market finds, like an early Shirley Temple doll. The museum now has more than 130,000 objects, among them the sequin get-up worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in ''Honeymoon in Vegas'' and the mold used to transform Dustin Hoffman's face in ''Little Big Man.''The building's redesign, by the architect Thomas Leeser, addresses problems like inefficient visitor circulation and outdated air-conditioning while trying to add a touch of glamour to the building on 36th Street at 35th Avenue, like a grand stair and a new auditorium with an arched ceiling of blue felt triangles.
''Especially now, with screens everywhere, it seems more important than ever to have a beautiful place to admire and respect this art form,'' Ms. Slovin said.
The building project has had its share of hurdles. Hatched in boom times, it had to cross the finish line during a recession. The reopening date was delayed by more than a year because of cost adjustments; the museum is only now digging out from an operating deficit of about $500,000 in fiscal year 2009. And running a larger institution will be a challenge; the operating budget is expected to grow to $6.3 million from $5.3 million; the staff to 70 from 48; visitors to 120,000 a year from around 80,000.
But the museum has the city behind it; the Cultural Affairs Department contributed $54.7 million to the new building. ''The whole idea of the museum and the quality of its programs spoke to the potential value of expanding its footprint,'' said Kate D. Levin, the city's cultural affairs commissioner.
Ms. Slovin said the prevalence of film courses and the transformation of Astoria into a trendy neighborhood had increased the museum's popularity.
Her vision and effort were also essential, though, said John T. McGuire, the founding chairman of the center's original foundation and a senior adviser to the Screen Actors Guild who is still on the museum's board.
''I think it takes the person who has that inner fire to get everybody else to see these sorts of things are possible,'' he said. ''That overcomes your reservations.''

HEADLINE: Malloy Declared Winner Over Foley for Governor

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; Robert Davey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The top election official in Connecticut declared on Wednesday that Dannel P. Malloy, a former Democratic mayor of Stamford, had edged Thomas C. Foley, a Republican financier, in the battle to become the state's next governor.
Susan Bysiewicz, the secretary of state, said at a news conference in Hartford that Mr. Malloy led Mr. Foley by 3,103 votes out of more than one million cast, according to unofficial results. Under Connecticut law, a statewide election is not subject to an automatic recount when candidates are separated by more than 2,000 votes.
''We don't believe that it would change, based on absentee ballots,'' said Av Harris, a spokesman for Ms. Bysiewicz. 
If the result stands, Mr. Malloy, 55, will become the first Democrat to capture the governor's office since 1986.
But Mr. Foley refused to concede. In an interview, he said his own internal results indicated that he had won, though by a margin smaller than 2,000. He also did not dismiss grousing, from some of his supporters, that Ms. Bysiewicz, a Democrat, might have been motivated by partisanship.
''It does raise an eyebrow,'' Mr. Foley said. ''I'm a little surprised that the secretary of state would announce an unofficial result when she admits that she doesn't have all the information. I think someone committed to acting impartially would have been more reserved.''
Mr. Foley said he had called on Ms. Bysiewicz's office to release the results, town by town, to check any discrepancies with his own totals. He added that he had not yet decided whether to explore options to challenge the results in court, or by other means.
Mr. Foley was so exasperated by the process, he called in to a radio program in Hartford on Wednesday afternoon to make his case -- while Ms. Bysiewicz was a guest.
''For you to be calling an unofficial result of an election is improper,'' Mr. Foley said to her on the ''Colin McEnroe Show'' on WNPR.
Ms. Bysiewicz said on the show that her results were based on vote totals provided by election officials in every town. ''We're just sharing information that we have and we're happy to share with you,'' she told Mr. Foley.
For his part, Mr. Malloy moved quickly to demonstrate that he was ready to take charge. In Hartford, he announced that he had chosen Timothy F. Bannon, a commissioner during the last Democratic administration in the 1980s, as his chief of staff. He also brushed aside concerns about any legal challenges that Mr. Foley or Republicans might mount over the election results, saying his internal numbers gave him an 11,000-vote cushion.
''We're transitioning,'' he said. ''Period.''
The uncertainty over the results, coupled with the prospect of legal challenges, seemed to be an appropriate latest chapter in a chaotic race that featured plenty of mudslinging and unusual ballot problems on Election Day. Indeed, a ballot shortage in Bridgeport, the state's largest city and a Democratic bedrock, prompted a Superior Court judge to order that the polls stay open an extra two hours there, until 10 p.m. That extension allowed an additional 500 people to cast their ballots, according to Ms. Bysiewicz's office.
The results must be certified by Nov. 25. If Mr. Malloy prevails, he will join a thoroughly Democratic administration in Hartford. Democratic candidates won the races for attorney general, comptroller, secretary of state and state treasurer, as well as most of the state legislature.
Mr. Malloy would succeed M. Jodi Rell, a Republican who decided not to run for re-election. Almost immediately, he would inherit a projected budget deficit of more than $3 billion, as well as deep concerns over the state's economy and its education system.
Mr. Malloy, a former prosecutor, had promised voters that he would apply the lessons he learned while helping to revitalize Stamford, the state's fourth-largest city. But Mr. Foley, 58, who was an ambassador to Ireland under President George W. Bush, promised to cut taxes and slash spending as a way to lift the sputtering economy.
Exit polling on Tuesday provided clues as to how Mr. Malloy might have eked out a victory. Nearly 90 percent of voters were worried about the nation's economic future, and those voters split evenly between Mr. Malloy and Mr. Foley. But of those who said the economy was not a great concern, four of every five went for Mr. Malloy.
''There are some things people don't like about him, but Dan Malloy was mayor of arguably one of the most successful cities in the United States,'' said Andy Bess, a Bridgeport resident, after he voted. ''I just know him.''

HEADLINE: Public Skepticism Undercuts Drive Against Al Qaeda in Yemen

BYLINE: By MONA EL-NAGGAR and ROBERT F. WORTH; Mona El-Naggar reported from Sana, and Robert F. Worth from Beirut, Lebanon.

 BODY:
SANA, Yemen -- As Yemen intensifies its military campaign against Al Qaeda's regional arm, it faces a serious obstacle: most Yemenis consider the group a myth, or a ploy by their president to squeeze the West for aid money and punish his domestic opponents.
Those cynical attitudes -- rooted in Yemen's history of manipulative politics -- complicate any effort to track down the perpetrators of the recent plot to send explosives by courier to the United States. They also make it harder to win public support for the fight against jihadist violence, whatever label one attaches to it.
''What is Al Qaeda? The truth is there is no Al Qaeda,'' said Lutfi Muhammad, a weary-looking unemployed 50-year-old walking through this city's tumultuous Tahrir Square. Instead, he said, the violence is ''because of the regime and the lack of stability and the internal struggles.''
That view, echoed across Yemen, is only partly a conspiracy theory. The Yemeni government has used jihadists as proxy soldiers in the past, and sometimes conflates the Qaeda threat and the unrelated political insurgencies it has fought in northern and southern Yemen in recent years. In a country where political and tribal violence is endemic, it is often impossible to tell who is killing whom, and why. 
One thing is clear: Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, has stepped up his commitment to fighting Al Qaeda in the past year, with far more military raids and airstrikes, including some carried out by the American military. His government has paid a price. On Saturday, a day after the discovery of the air freight bomb plot, Mr. Saleh said during a news conference that Al Qaeda had killed 70 police officers and soldiers in the past four weeks. That is a sharp increase over previous years, and some analysts have taken it as proof that Al Qaeda's Yemen-based branch is growing.
But many Yemenis seem doubtful that Al Qaeda was guilty in all or even most of those killings, which took place in the same southern parts of the country where a secessionist movement has been growing for the past three years.
''We cannot differentiate between what is propaganda and what is real,'' said Abdullah al-Faqih, a professor of political science at Sana University. ''It's impossible to tell who is killing who; you have tribal feuds, Al Qaeda and the Southern Movement, and the state is doing a lot of manipulation.''
In a sense, there are two narratives about Al Qaeda in Yemen. One of them, presented by both the Yemeni government and Al Qaeda's Internet postings -- and echoed in the West -- portrays a black-and-white struggle between the groups. The other narrative is the view from the ground in Yemen: a confusing welter of attacks by armed groups with shifting loyalties, some fighting under political or religious banners, some merely looking for money.
The Yemeni authorities have long paid tribal leaders to fight domestic enemies, or even other tribes that were causing trouble for the government. That policy has helped foster a culture of blackmail: some tribal figures promote violence, whether through jihadists or mere criminals, and then offer to quell it in exchange for cash.
''Some of what looks like Al Qaeda is really terror as a business,'' Mr. Faqih said.
Yemen's tribes are often cast as the chief obstacle in the fight against Al Qaeda, sheltering the militants because of tribal hospitality or even ideological kinship. In fact, few tribal leaders have any sympathy for the group, and some tribes have forced Qaeda members to leave their areas in the past year.
In a statement released Tuesday, a group identifying itself as Al Qaeda members from the Awlaq tribe -- one of Yemen's largest -- pleaded with their fellow tribesmen for support, noting that ''we were deeply saddened to see the leaders, chiefs, and dignitaries of our community go personally to meet with the government envoy.''
Instead, Al Qaeda seems to thrive where tribal authority has eroded, or in the southern areas where hatred of the government is most intense. In many of the recent attacks, it is difficult to draw a line between Al Qaeda and angry, impoverished young men who have easy access to weapons.
This is particularly true of the secessionist movement in the south. ''There are many unemployed young men and people with personal interests who rebelled against the state and against the movement itself,'' said Saleh al-Hanashi, an adviser to the governor of Abyan, a southern province where the protest movement thrives and many of the recent killings have taken place. ''They became these chaos-inciting groups. And these groups now in Abyan shoot at cars belonging to the state and do other destructive acts against the state.'' This kind of vandalism is easily attributed to Al Qaeda, whether the group claims responsibility for it or not. The latest issue of the group's English-language magazine, Inspire, features a banner headline on the front cover: ''Photos From the Operations of Abyan.'' Inside, there are gruesome pictures of burning Jeeps and dead Yemeni soldiers.
Many southerners view Mr. Saleh's government as an occupying force, and while the secessionist movement's leaders say they reject violence, some of its members may be willing to make common cause with jihadists. North and south Yemen, once separate countries, unified in 1990, then fought a bitter civil war four years later. Many in the south say they have been treated unequally ever since.
It is possible that the worsening carnage in southern Yemen, and Al Qaeda's claims of responsibility for it, will eventually lead to a shift in perceptions and broader support for the government's agenda. That is what happened in Saudi Arabia, where attitudes toward Al Qaeda were similar to those in Yemen until the group began carrying out bloody attacks in Saudi cities in 2003. Public opinion soon swung sharply against the jihadists, and by 2006 the Saudis had crushed the group.
That is far less likely in Yemen, with its terrible poverty and weak central government. For now, most Yemenis seem to dismiss reports of Al Qaeda killings as a ''masrah,'' or drama, staged by the government and its American backers. The suspicion runs so deep that any action by the Yemeni government seems to confirm it: counterterrorist raids are often described as punitive measures against domestic foes, and the failure to act decisively is derided as collusion.
''This latest episode with the packages is only making it worse,'' said Mr. Faqih, the Sana University professor. ''Many people think it was all about the elections in the U.S., or an excuse for American military intervention here.''

HEADLINE: Angels In Stripper Heels

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
THIS is how an angel earns her wings. First, she is born, in someplace like Belarus or Florianopolis, the spot in southern Brazil where an awful lot of folks with German names fetched up over the centuries, or, well, Saskatchewan.
Then the angel grows up pretty. (There are no homely angels.)
Next, the angel is discovered, most likely in a mall.
The angel, at this point, does not realize she is an angel, because the process of becoming an angel requires time and guidance and support and miracles and, O.K., occasionally a sleazy boyfriend, as well as a decision at some point by Steven Meisel, or by some other star-making fashion photographer to choose a woman from among the thousands who would gladly sign away their firstborn for a chance to appear in front of his lens. 
Although it is doubtless the dream of untold numbers of hopefuls to be discovered at a Victoria's Secret open call some day -- their beauty so radiant that they rise above the ranks of ordinary flesh-and-blood humans and appear as dazzling supernovas in underwear and stripper heels -- the truth is that those destined to be cast in the coveted role of a Victoria's Secret angel are not drawn from the general population. There is no democracy in angel land.
''We cast 30 models, but 10 times that many are sent to us by the agencies to be considered,'' Edward Razek, the chief marketing officer for the Limited Brand, the parent company of the lingerie powerhouse, said last week before a casting session for this year's Victoria's Secret show, which will be televised on Nov. 30 to 11 million people in 185 countries, but will be taped before a more modest crowd in New York on Nov. 10.
''And 100 times that many would want to,'' Mr. Razek said. ''That's why I hate castings, because I'm basically a softy and I hate the broken hearts and I hate saying no.''
As it happens, ''no'' is seldom heard at a Victoria's Secret casting, at least not within earshot of the hopefuls. What the aspirants instead hear, during the roughly 120 seconds each is given to present herself to a specially selected panel, are phrases polite and generic enough to be anodyne.
They hear, ''Lovely.'' They hear, ''Thank you for coming.'' They hear, ''Do it again, please, with a little more energy.''
The people who spoke these words one chilly fall morning, on the 12th floor of an office building in Midtown, under lighting that flattered no one, included Mr. Razek and Monica Mitro, the executive producer of the Victoria's Secret fashion show; Alexander Werz, a fashion show director; John Pfeiffer, a casting director; and Sophia Neophitou-Apostolou and Dan May, two London-based editors (Harper's Bazaar and the luxury quarterly 10 Magazine) who somehow eke out time in between intercontinental jet crossings to serve as highly paid stylists for global brands.
There were other professionals in the room -- production people and a photographer and a small group of assistants who stood beside a wall of model headshots. But the crucial people, the ones deciding the fate of the angels, sat at a folding table about 10 long strides away from a makeshift privacy screen created from a rack of Victoria's Secret panties and bras.
Behind that screen, for close to three hours, some of the most beautiful beings on the planet, one after another, stripped out of their street wear and underclothes and changed into a generic audition outfit consisting of a satin finish bra, a pair of lace bikini panties and champagne-colored platform heels.
Exiting the makeshift dressing area, these women then walked toward the table casually, or as casually as a nearly naked person can under the circumstances, and shook hands with the Victoria's Secret crew.
''What people don't realize is that they're rarer by far than superstar athletes,'' Mr. Razek said of women who fit precise but unwritten physical parameters for becoming a Victoria's Secret angel. ''The numbers of people who can do this are probably under 100 in the world,'' Mr. Razek said. ''And in the show it's only 30 girls.'' (Actually, there are 33 this year.)
Anyway, people do realize. And, as with most disagreeable facts, they block that one out.
This is worth noting because the fantasy (by merely laying out $53 for a Miraculous Multi-way Gel-Curve Bra one will somehow be transformed into a winged creature resembling Gisele Bundchen or Heidi Klum or Helena Christensen or Adriana Lima or Irina Shayk) is so powerful that the Limited, Victoria Secret's parent company, posted a 12 percent increase in comparable sales in September over the same period a year ago.
That growth, industry analysts said, was led by the Victoria's Secret division, which itself posted a 13 percent year-over-year increase. What is more, the company's October results, to be posted today, are expected to be stronger still. Call it the uplifting Gel-Curve effect.
Nobody that morning was thinking about any of that. The focus of those behind the table was on Carolyn Winberg, a tomboyish Swedish model with a board-flat belly and limited decolletage and well-toned buttocks and blond hair that, like that of so many successful models, had been frazzled by styling until it was the texture of wood shavings.
''Never mind the hair,'' Ms. Mitro said after Ms. Winberg had changed, walked, smiled, laughed, turned, laughed and changed again, packing up her T.G.I. Friday's tote bag and blowing the panel a kiss as she made her way out of the room.
''Carolyn always takes it away on the runway,'' said Mr. Werz, the show producer.
''She's a baby doll,'' Ms. Mitro said.
''The body's amazing,'' said Mr. Pfeiffer, the casting director. ''She's got this amazing, 1970s, Sharon Tate-y thing.''
''So much energy,'' Ms. Mitro added.
''And energy, grace, poise is what it's all about,'' said Mr. Razek, who added, ''You've got 16 or 18 cameras on you and the show is broadcast around the world, so you have to bring something special and unique.''
''Anyway, we can always do something about the hair,'' Ms. Mitro said.
Next up was Bruna Tenorio, an aquiline Brazilian beauty favored by European designers for their haute couture shows; followed by Chrishell Stubbs, 18, a newcomer with cascades of dark curls; and Marloes Horst, a Memling Madonna in a lace mesh bikini; and Liu Wen, a Beijing native with longer legs than most point guards; and Cameron Russell, a part-time (''very part-time'') economics major at Columbia; and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, the woman best known as Megan Fox's replacement in ''Transformers 3''; and Maryna Linchuk, a young woman from Belarus who, although she has already been anointed a Victoria's Secret angel, was auditioning again this year because, as Ms. Mitro said, bodies do change.
''You don't see them for a minute, and...'' Ms. Mitro said and then fell silent. She held her cupped hands wide in the universal gesture for hips as broad as a barn.
Does it go without saying that no Victoria's Secret angels are fat? It does. A person cannot be expected to attain the angelic heights on a diet of Tasti D-Lite cone or Cinnabons
''With the smile, the hello, the walk, they get maybe two minutes,'' to make an impression, said Mr. Razek, who has worked for the Limited since the early 1980s and who is notably tan and whose enviable shock of graying hair closely matched the salt and pepper flecks in his custom-made socks. ''Maybe it's not even that much.''
Maybe it's just seconds, which was all it took for Ms. Linchuk to win over the panel, partly because she is beautiful in an uncontroversial and generic blond way but also because she is brisk and efficient and works out five days a week. The model Angela Lindvall, another occasional angel, at a certain point compared her particular line of work with that of a boxer. ''You have to make weight,'' she said. Ms. Lindvall herself once shed 20 postpregnancy pounds to make angel weight by jumping rope and subsisting on nothing but spinach, chard and kale.
The fitness horizon for a model preparing to audition for the Victoria's Secret fashion show is perhaps 12 weeks, said Justin Gelband, a personal fitness trainer known in the business as the Model Whisperer. ''We've been killing ourselves for this show,'' Mr. Gelband explained before the casting call, referring to clients like Ms. Linchuk and Ms. Shayk and Anne Vyalitsyna, a model whose career has risen and fallen over tiny weight gains but whose physique that day was so starkly fit that it elicited a collective gasp.
''This all looks straightforward, but it's not,'' said Ms. Neophitou-Apostolou, the editor and stylist. ''It's not just women of a certain shape or size who can do this, although you might think so. And it's not such an obvious proposition,'' to choose from among so many seemingly flawless female specimens those who will best make the transformation to the status of mythic lingerie seraphim. Few are called, and fewer still are chosen to wear the strap-on wings of a Victoria's Secret angel.
''The girls actually dream about it,'' said Ms. Mitro, referring to the wearing of feathers. Flipping open a scrapbook, she pointed briskly to a photo of a teary model seeming to stagger under the weight of a costume that looked like a something Cher might wear to a powwow.
''These,'' she said, ''are the wings that made her cry.''
An earlier version of the article stated that the Victoria Secret show will be taped on Nov. 11. It will be taped on Nov. 10.
Correction: November 18, 2010, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Nov. 4 about aspiring Victoria's Secret models misspelled the surname of a model who attended a recent casting call. She is Anne Vyalitsyna, not Vialitsina.

HEADLINE: A 25-Year Run of Service Ends, Sunk by a Wave of Discontent

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
MOOSIC, Pa.
The epic song of the sports bar's television chorus, of glorious Republican conquest and crushing Democratic defeat, was helping those gathered for an election night victory party to prepare for its awkward opposite. Then came word that the guest of honor was about to arrive.
''Start cheering when he comes in,'' a woman in charge said. With smiles wide, the would-be celebrators applauded the white-haired Democrat as he entered, and trailed after him as he made his way to a lectern bathed in the hot, harsh lights of impatient cameras. 
It took a moment. But finally, Paul E. Kanjorski, 73, the dean of Pennsylvania's Congressional delegation, who, for a quarter-century, has represented Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and the towns and hollows beyond, said the words that instantly signaled concession to his Republican opponent, Lou Barletta:
''About 15 minutes ago...''
Across Pennsylvania and throughout the country, in vast hotel ballrooms and cramped campaign headquarters, fellow incumbent Democrats were delivering similar words of surrender, as television monitors everywhere showed a wave of Republican red spilling across maps of the United States.
Many of those Democrats were also accepting calls of consolation similar to the one Mr. Kanjorski received, moments after his concession, from his good friend Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The two veteran politicians spoke like battle-jarred lieutenants counting casualties. Did he make it? Did he make it? The answer, invariably: No.
As televised images of a grinning Mr. Barletta appeared in the background, someone handed Mr. Kanjorski a glass of white wine. Between sips he held the glass at chest level, as if poised to raise it in toast to a rough day and a long, even classic, career. ''Kanjo,'' they call him.
Born in the railroad and coal town of Nanticoke, Mr. Kanjorski struggled with dyslexia, became a Congressional page and was in the House when Puerto Rican terrorists opened fire in 1954. He helped to carry out the wounded on stretchers; he was 16.
He served in the Army, went to college and returned to establish a law practice in northeastern Pennsylvania. In 1984, he beat the Democratic incumbent in a primary for the House seat and, for many years after, rarely faced serious challenge in this heavily Democratic district.
He pushed for flood-control projects that kept the Susquehanna River at bay. He helped to acquire more than 16,000 acres of mine-scarred land for reclamation. He contributed significantly to the financial reform legislation that followed Wall Street's near collapse. He returned jobs and money to his district -- including some that benefited a few relatives, which is almost expected in these parts.
But, as often happens, people began grumbling that Mr. Kanjorski had forgotten where he came from; that he had shed his Nanticoke grit for Washington posturing. ''A disconnectedness,'' said Terry Madonna, a professor of public affairs at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, who recently conducted a poll in this Congressional district.
Mr. Kanjorski's challenger this year was familiar but formidable: Mr. Barletta, 54, the longtime Republican mayor of Hazleton, whom he beat in 2002 and again, though barely, in 2008. Mr. Barletta famously vowed to make his city unwelcoming to illegal immigrants, whom he partly blamed for its heartbreaking economic woes. He pushed an Illegal Immigration Relief Act that, among other things, fined landlords who rented to people without the proper papers. The act has since been declared unconstitutional by federal courts.
The two men spent the summer and fall battling over a district with high unemployment. Mr. Kanjorski cited the empty storefronts along Hazleton's Broad Street to suggest that Mr. Barletta would be out of his league in Washington. But the Republican wave was coming, and not even a fist-pumping visit by former President Bill Clinton could help him.
The congressman began Election Day by voting in his distressed hometown. He and his wife, Nancy, drove to the polling place, the gymnasium for the closed St. Stanislaus Roman Catholic Church, in a maroon Buick sedan that creaked in the early-morning cold. Before casting his ballot near a rack of basketballs and a ''Go Eagles!!!'' sign on the peeling white wall, he predicted victory, though without conviction. He knew.
He knew that, in a few hours, people like Cornelia Thompson, 70, a retired art teacher from a family of registered Democrats, would use her cane to climb the five concrete steps leading to the lobby of Hazleton City Hall -- first one foot, then the other -- and cast her vote for Mr. Barletta in the marble foyer, near a display reading, ''Great World War Honor Roll.''
''I think it's time for a change,'' she would say.
He knew, too, that in the same old St. Stan's gym where he had voted, people like Larry Saltz, 42, a paramedic and Democrat, would vote against Mr. Kanjorski -- even though he had voted for the congressman ever since he was eligible to vote. Mr. Saltz would cite the health care overhaul, government overspending and general unease as his reasons.
''It's just not working,'' he would say, standing across from a closed church. ''Everything seems broken.''
Tuesday night, while watching the election returns in a supporter's apartment, close to the Bo Brothers bar where his victory party awaited, Mr. Kanjorski heard the lackluster reports coming from Lackawanna County, one of his traditional strongholds. Now he really knew.
He and his wife, married now for nearly 48 years, gathered themselves and made their entrance into the victory party that wasn't.
Mr. Kanjorski spoke with grace of his persistent opponent, said he was truly honored by the privilege of having served, and blended into the crowd of wistful old friends and eager young aides to shake hands, comfort the distraught and accept that glass of wine.
When asked what he planned to do in the morning, the Democrat smiled a knowing smile and said,
''Wake up.''

HEADLINE: How the Fed's Move Could Trickle Down to Consumers

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In its latest move to help the economy, the Federal Reserve is about to restart its monetary printing press -- or rather, the electronic equivalent.
The Fed announced Wednesday that it intended to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities through June. It also signaled that it could make more purchases after that if unemployment remained too high and inflation too low.
The Fed is prohibited from directly lending to the Treasury Department, which issues government debt. So the Fed buys government securities on the open market from ''primary dealers,'' a network of 18 institutions, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, that constantly trade in such securities, both for their own accounts and on behalf of clients, including other financial institutions around the world. 
While monetary policy is set at the Fed's headquarters here, it is carried out in Lower Manhattan, at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which buys and sells Treasury securities and other assets on the Fed's behalf.
An adage among economists is that ''the Fed creates reserves and banks create money.''
In typical recessions, the Fed pumps money into the economy by buying assets like government bonds and creating an equivalent amount in liabilities -- reserve deposits that commercial banks keep at the Fed. Those deposits, currently over $1 trillion, along with currency in circulation, now $961.4 billion, make up the monetary base -- in essence, the raw material from which money is created and made available to consumers and businesses.
If banks were to quickly start using the reserves to make loans, the supply of money, currently $8.7 trillion by one estimate, could grow rapidly and lead to inflation even as the amount of reserves remained constant. The supply of money includes not just currency, but also things like bank deposits, savings accounts and money market funds.
For now, that seems highly unlikely. Banks say there is not much demand for loans, though some business owners say credit is too difficult to obtain.
Because current conditions are so dire, the Fed is now not only expanding liquidity but also focusing its purchases on Treasury securities -- from bills maturing in 18 months to bonds maturing in 30 years -- that have an average maturity of five to six years. Those purchases should drive up the prices of these securities (because there will be more demand) and consequently push down medium and longer term rates (because bond yields move inversely with prices).
The Fed bought $1.7 trillion in assets from December 2008 to March 2010. As of last week, the Fed held $834 billion of Treasury securities and nearly $1.1 trillion in mortgage-backed securities on its balance sheet.
But the volume of mortgage-backed securities on the Fed's balance sheet is gradually shrinking as mortgage loans are paid off early (usually because they are refinanced) or reach maturity.
To prevent such shrinking, which would have the undesired effect of contracting the Fed's balance sheet, the Fed announced in August that it would reinvest the proceeds from the mortgage-related holdings in Treasury securities -- about $35 billion a month. The Fed said Wednesday that it would continue those reinvestments through at least June.
Economic theory holds that unemployment is currently so high, and inflation so low, that the Fed should lower short-term interest rates. But those rates have been near zero since December 2008.
By some estimates, the Fed would have to buy as much as $5 trillion in Treasury securities to simulate the effects of lowering short-term rates as much as they should be lowered. But an amount that large is seen as unrealistic; it would sharply devalue the dollar and could unmoor inflation expectations and cause long-term rates to rise -- the opposite of what the Fed wants. Fed officials believe the $600 billion action announced Wednesday will be similar to lowering the benchmark Federal funds rate by 0.75 percentage points.
The Fed can buy only so much debt. Among other constraints, it does not control how much debt the Treasury issues, and there are only so many securities available in the open markets. In addition, the Fed has not allowed itself to own more than 35 percent of the outstanding amount of any particular security.
On Wednesday, the New York Fed said that it was ''temporarily relaxing'' the 35 percent limit to give itself flexibility but said it would exceed the threshold ''only in modest increments.''

HEADLINE: A New Feature For Checking

BYLINE: By ROBB MANDELBAUM

 BODY:
A little-known amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act could reshape the way small businesses bank. The amendment, added in the House of Representatives with no debate, repeals a law that prohibited financial institutions from paying interest on business checking accounts, which are known as demand deposit accounts. The prohibition had been part of the Glass-Steagall Act and was in force for nearly 70 years.
The amendment was sponsored by Representative Scott Murphy, a Democrat from New York who is facing a tough battle to save his seat in today's election.* ''I started my first business when I was 24,'' said Mr. Murphy in a phone interview between campaign appearances on Friday. ''And I went around to different banks and talked to them about getting set up, and I was amazed that I was paying them to have an account, and they weren't paying me any interest. It's just one of those antiquated rules that's left on the books but is hurting our small businesses, so we got rid of it.'' 
Though the overhaul became law in July, this provision will not take effect until next July and news of the repeal has yet to reach even some banking experts. Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University, heard about it from The Agenda. ''I was on a panel just the other day talking about how the interest-rate ban needed to be repealed,'' he said, a measure of both surprise and glee evident in his voice.
Lawmakers enacted the broad limitation on interest-bearing bank accounts in 1933 after concluding that competition among banks for deposits led them to make speculative investments, particularly on Wall Street. By some accounts, Congress also hoped to discourage businesses from socking away money that could be invested in plants or equipment.
Over the years, the prohibition has been weakened; in 1980, Congress repealed limitations on interest-bearing savings accounts, as well as the outright ban on interest for consumer checking accounts. Now a dynamic reminiscent of the Depression is playing out in the current recession, as hundreds of community banks around the country have failed. Government regulators say many of these banks paid high interest rates to out-of-state deposits, and often used those deposits to finance risky real estate loans.
But Mr. Murphy said that giving banks free deposits from small-business customers had not solved the problem of speculation. ''Frankly, the same incentive still applies,'' he said. ''Those are problems on the risk-taking side; it's not really a capitalization problem from my perspective.'' Economists contacted by The Agenda agreed. ''Bank regulators have lots of good alternatives, such as examinations and supervision fine-tuned to speculative lending, rather than dealing with it in an overly broad way by limiting the ability of banks to attract deposits,'' Mr. White said.
Jane D'Arista, of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, saw a further benefit to the economy: bringing more deposits into the banking system, principally from large companies, would re-pad a cushion of cash reserves, and could also give the Federal Reserve more control over the supply of credit. When big companies do bank their cash, they often use a so-called sweep account, in which the bank takes excess funds from a deposit account each day, and invests them overnight in money market funds or repurchase agreements. But sweep accounts can be expensive, and small businesses often don't have balances big enough to make them worthwhile.
At this point, it is too early to say whether banks will in fact make interest-bearing accounts available to smaller businesses. For the moment, with interest rates at or near zero, the point is probably moot. But should rates rise, banks will have a choice to make. The law doesn't force them to offer interest, and many smaller institutions will be reluctant to do so. ''It's an issue that typically splits the industry down the middle on how they approach the business model,'' said Paul Merski, the chief economist for the Independent Community Bankers of America.
''I think most of them are going to take a look at the competitive landscape, and see if it would give them an advantage to offer interest on transaction accounts,'' said Bob Seiwert, a vice president of the American Bankers Association. ''What's probably going to happen is that there will be a leader in each market. As soon as someone starts offering interest and starts gaining market share, most of the others will follow.''
For some businesses, though, that might come at a cost. Rusty Cloutier, president and chief executive of Midsouth Bank, based in Lafayette, La., said that pressure on deposit income, combined with new restrictions on fees, would lead banks to raise interest rates on loans. ''We're going to price it into the other side of the equation,'' Mr. Cloutier said. ''Customers who have big deposits, we give them a break on the interest on the loans. If people come and say they want interest on their deposits, that's fine, but they're going to pay more for their loans.
''It's not a free gift.''
*Mr. Murphy's legislation was embraced by, among other organizations, the National Federation of Independent Business. However, that did not keep the organization from endorsing Mr. Murphy's rival for his House seat in the midterm, Republican Chris Gibson, a retired army officer.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve upended the expectations of the financial markets Wednesday and shares .
Minutes after the Fed's decision sent the Dow Jones industrial average points, or percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index points and percent, and the Nasdaq points and percent.
In the bond market, 10-year Treasury bills were higher before the Fed announcement, with the rate slipping to 2.54 percent from 2.59 percent late Tuesday. 
The announcement came as somewhat of a surprise. For at least the last two months, investors had been pricing in their expectations that the Federal Reserve would embark on a second round of quantitative easing that has sent the stock market higher, driven gold prices up, and pushed the dollar and market interest rates lower.
Because official rates were already near zero, the Fed had been expected to buy United States Treasury securities, and perhaps other investments, to pump more money into the financial system. But Wednesday's long-awaited statement finally provided some clarity, or some would say surprise, as to the outstanding questions of the extent of their purchases and the timing.
Estimates of the size of the program had ranged from $500 billion to $2 trillion, although as Wednesday drew closer, many analysts had settled their expectations around the lower end of that range. Some analysts expected the purchases to be spread out over months, with one scenario being $80 billion to $100 billion a month, with the assumption that the central bank would then assess whether the program was having the desired effect.
Many analysts had expected the purchases to be mostly of 2- and 10-year Treasuries, although the Goldman Sachs Group recently predicted that the Fed might include 30-year Treasury bonds in its program.
The new program had been dubbed ''QE2'' in market jargon because it was the Fed's second round of quantitative easing. At the end of 2008, the Fed began a program to buy $1.7 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, purchases which were announced in advance and came in the aftermath of the financial crisis.
In recent weeks Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, had hinted that the central bank was likely to act. The annual inflation rate is running below 2 percent, while unemployment remains stubbornly high.
The dollar has been weakening against major currencies on the expectation of the Fed's move.
Gold, already at a high above $1,300 an ounce, was expected to benefit even more if investors read an aggressive move by the Fed as a sign that inflation may eventually accelerate, said Jeffrey Nichols, senior economic adviser to Rosland Capital, in a recent speech preceding the announcement.
For Wall Street, the Fed announcement took center stage after mid-term Congressional election results came in showed major gains for the Republican Party, an outcome that had been widely expected.
In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro-zone blue chips, was up 0.11 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London was 0.1 percent higher. The CAC 40 in Paris rose 0.25 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt gained 0.12 percent.
The Hang Seng in Hong Kong led the advance in Asia with a 2 percent gain that took the index to its highest level since mid-2008, and the Australia benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.5 percent. But the Shanghai composite lost 0.5 percent. Japanese markets were closed for a national holiday.
Though the outcome of Tuesday's election was met with cheers on Wall Street, much of the result had already been priced into the stock market, analysts said. Still, with a slim Democrat majority in the Senate and the Republicans reclaiming the House, analysts expect a shift in the legislative agenda.
For one, further legislative efforts that might curtail banks were likely to be scaled back or stalled, analysts said in various research reports and notes to clients.
''There simply aren't enough votes to further rein in Wall Street and the commercial banks,'' a financial services policy analyst at MF Global, Jaret Seiberg, said. ''At worst, the banks will get to enjoy gridlock. At best, there is an opening to start the process of deregulation that is a lot better than the environment.
While rolling back big swaths of last year's sweeping financial regulatory reform bill may be difficult, there may still be room for smaller tweaks that might loosen up some of the most stringent derivatives rules and other potential requirements.
The banking industry had spent heavily in the last year, directing a much bigger portion of their spending toward Republicans in the run-up to the election. More than 70 percent of campaign donations went toward Republican candidates in September, compared with 40 percent a year earlier, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group.
The election also could curtail some of the anti-Wall Street rhetoric that was so prevalent during the recent campaign. Several of the financial industry's most outspoken critics -- including Senators Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin -- failed to be re-elected. ''Blaming big Wall Street banks when you are running in the heartland proved not to be a winning strategy,'' Mr. Seiberg said.
Pressing for substantial changes to the housing finance system may be more difficult, analysts said, even as foreclosure policy and the overhaul of the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac moves to the top of the Congressional agenda. Another stimulus bill to give a jolt to the economy, or sharp increases in corporate taxes to narrow the budget gap also appear to be off the table.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Surged in October, Giving Industry Its Best Month in Two Years

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- October was the best month for new-vehicle sales in more than two years, outside of the brief period in 2009 helped by government rebates. In addition, General Motors surpassed expectations but still lost market share in the United States ahead of its public stock offering.
G.M. said Wednesday that its sales rose 4.2 percent last month from a year ago, compared with a gain of 13.4 percent for the industry over all. Its market share fell to 19.3 percent from 21 percent in October 2009, according to Autodata, a firm that tracks industry sales. 
In contrast, the Ford Motor Company said its sales were up 19.3 percent, and Chrysler reported a 37 percent increase.
Toyota was the only major automaker to report a decline, as its sales fell 4.4 percent. In contrast, several smaller companies, including Hyundai, Kia and Subaru, set October records, with each posting an increase of at least 25 percent.
The industry's seasonally adjusted annualized selling rate, a closely watched measure of demand, rose to 12.3 million. Except for August 2009, when buyers were offered federal rebates of up to $4,500 under the cash-for-clunkers program, that is the highest selling rate since September 2008, when auto sales began to collapse.
Automakers and analysts said they expected sales to keep improving in November and December and throughout 2011.
''Signs are there that the recovery continues and that it will be sustained,'' said Don Johnson, G.M.'s vice president for United States sales operations. ''We don't see a big risk at all of a double dip.''
For all of 2010 so far, G.M.'s sales are 6.6 percent higher than in the same portion of 2009, when the company dropped four brands after a brief trip through bankruptcy protection.
Counting only G.M.'s four active brands -- Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac and GMC -- the company's sales are up 22.1 percent this year. (October was the final month for three of the brands it eliminated -- Pontiac, Saturn and Hummer -- and the fourth, Saab, whose sales rose 44.4 percent last month, is now owned by a Dutch company, Spyker Cars.)
Over all, industry sales are up 10.6 percent so far this year, but they are still 17.5 percent below the first 10 months of 2008.
G.M. executives will highlight the company's rising sales as they begin a traveling road show to court investors starting this week. The company is expected to hold its initial public offering in mid-November, allowing the federal government to begin selling its 61 percent stake.
G.M. also will point to the higher prices and profits its vehicles are generating. Buyers paid almost $3,000 more, on average, for the Chevrolet Cruze, a compact sedan introduced in September, than they did a year earlier for its predecessor, the Chevrolet Cobalt.
''That clearly indicates that pure consumer demand must have improved for their products to pull that off,'' said Jesse Toprak, vice president of industry trends and insight for TrueCar.com, which tracks vehicle sales and pricing. Even though G.M. lost share in October, Mr. Toprak said, ''the trajectory of growth for G.M. sales has been quite strong.''
Higher truck sales are helping the industry recover and suggesting improvement in the broader economy. Light trucks, which include pickups, crossovers and sport utility vehicles, accounted for 52.8 percent of total sales in October, the most in nearly three years.
Truck sales rose 23.5 percent, versus a 3.9 percent increase for passenger cars.
Sales of full-size pickup trucks -- vehicles commonly bought by builders and other commercial users -- climbed to 122,774, an increase of 32 percent over an average month in 2009.
Ford sold nearly 50,000 of its F-series pickup, a 24.2 percent increase from a year ago and more than the combined sales of the industry's two best-selling passenger cars, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord sedans.
''We did in 10 months what we did in 12 months last year,'' Ken Czubay, Ford's vice president of United States marketing, sales and service.
Sales of midsize S.U.V.'s surged 86.6 percent. Sales of Chrysler's Jeep Cherokee, redesigned this summer, nearly quadrupled and helped the Jeep brand post a 111 percent increase.
Toyota, meanwhile, experienced more difficulty in October, as it announced another large recall and its market share declined to 15.3 percent from 18.2 percent a year ago. Mr. Toprak said the rate of sales at Toyota declined noticeably after the recall, which covers 1.5 million vehicles globally to fix problems with their brake fluid and fuel pumps, was announced Oct. 21.
Toyota has recalled more than 10 million vehicles this year, mostly in an effort to resolve complaints about sudden acceleration. It has been offering lease deals and free maintenance as the company tries to overcome their lingering effects.
''Those black clouds that stem from the recalls are still hovering over Toyota,'' Mr. Toprak said. ''Toyota needs to be a bit more aggressive on at least keeping their loyal customers in the brand if they don't want to lose any more share.''

HEADLINE: Fed Will Buy $600 Billion in Debt, Hoping to Spur Growth

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve, concerned about the slow recovery, announced a second, large purchase of Treasury bonds on Wednesday, an effort to spur economic growth by lowering long-term interest rates.
While the Fed has been signaling that it would act to bolster the economy, the announcement was the first major policy move since the midterm elections, which gave Republicans control of the House and heightened the potential for gridlock on fiscal policy including tax cuts and spending to encourage job creation and growth.
The Fed said it would buy an additional $600 billion in long-term Treasury securities by the end of June 2011, somewhat more than the $300 billion to $500 billion that many in the markets had expected.
The central bank said it would also continue its program, announced in August, of reinvesting proceeds from its mortgage-related holdings to buy Treasury debt. The Fed now expects to reinvest $250 billion to $300 billion under that program by the end of June, making the total asset purchases in the range of $850 billion to $900 billion. 
That would just about double the $800 billion or so in Treasury debt currently on the Fed's balance sheet.
In justifying its decision, the Fed noted that unemployment was high and inflation low, and judged that the recovery ''has been disappointingly slow.''
The Federal Open Market Committee, which ended a two-day meeting on Wednesday, also left open the possibility of additional purchases.
''The committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability,'' the committee said.
As expected, the Fed left the benchmark short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate, at which banks lend to one another overnight -- at nearly zero, where it has been since December 2008. The committee's vote was 9 to 1.
Thomas M. Hoenig, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, dissented, as he has at every meeting this year. Mr. Hoenig ''was concerned that this continued high level of monetary accommodation increased the risks of future financial imbalances and, over time, would cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations that could destabilize the economy,'' the Fed said in a statement.
In a statement after the F.O.M.C. announcement, the New York Federal Reserve, which handles the bond purchases, said the purchases will include bonds ranging for less than 2 year to 30 years, with ''an average duration of between 5 and 6 years.''
''The distribution of purchases could change if market conditions warrant,'' the New York Fedsaid in a statement, ''but such changes would be designed to not significantly alter the average duration of the assets purchased.''
Economists disagree about how much the new round of debt purchases -- a reprise of an initial, $1.7 trillion round that ended in March -- will have on spurring consumer and corporate demand.
Lower long-term interest rates in theory should ripple through the markets, affecting other rates, like those of 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages. That could encourage homeowners to refinance into cheaper mortgages, though it would not help the millions of Americans facing foreclosure.
But there are several significant risks. The new actions are likely to further drive down the value of the dollar, which as fallen about 7.5 percent since June against the currencies of major trading partners. That could exacerbate the trade and exchange-rate tensions that have threatened to unravel cooperation among the world's biggest economies.
Moreover, the Fed is exposing itself to the risk that the assets it has purchased, like the $1 trillion in mortgage-related securities on its balance sheets, could shrivel in value as interest rates rise. That could reduce the amount of money the central banks turns over to the Treasury each year, and expose the Fed -- which has been attacked for failing to prevent the 2008 financial crisis -- to further criticism.
And then there is a risk that the Fed's action could be neutralized by a new Congress that has vowed to contract government spending, a core argument that led to the overwhelming Republican victory on Tuesday.
Mr. Obama, at a news conference on Wednesday, talked of compromise with the new Republican majority in the House. But he also cited China's new high-speed trains and its advances in supercomputing to make the case that there are some areas where the United States needs to make investments, and insisted that the country would not shy away from those. ''They are making investments, because they know those investments will pay off in the long term,'' he said of the Chinese, seeming to suggest that the United States needs to do the same.
At the same moment, he reiterated that he would support continuing the Bush era tax cuts only for families earning less than $250,000 a year. ''It is very important we're not taking money out of the system from people who are most likely to spend that money,'' Mr. Obama said at the news conference.
But he hinted at flexibility, saying he expected to sit down with the new Republican leadership to see ''where we can move forward first of all in ways that can do no harm.''
Asked if he was willing to negotiate, he said, ''Absolutely.''
Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor who closely monitors the central bank, said the prospect of sustained fiscal gridlock had already pushed Mr. Bernanke to move.
''Bernanke has said that fiscal stimulus, accommodated by the Fed, is the single most powerful action the government can take for lowering the unemployment rate ,when short-term rates are already at zero,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''He has nearly pleaded with Congress for fiscal stimulus, but he can't count on it. So he has to act as if that's not going to happen. ''
Mr. Meyer predicted: ''The political drama is just beginning.''
Leonard J. Santow, an economic consultant, said he feared that the Fed was reacting to one mistake -- the failure of fiscal policy -- by adding another.
''Monetary policy is already unsustainably easy, and adding to the Fed's generosity through more quantitative easing will do little to stimulate the economy,'' Mr. Santow said. ''The main problem is on the fiscal side and there is nothing wrong with the Fed chairman making budget recommendations and admitting there is not a great deal left for monetary policy to achieve when it comes to stimulating the economy.''
The Fed lowered short-term interest rates to nearly zero in December 2008, and subsequently bought $1.7 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and government securities, a program that was phased out last March.
Only months ago, the Fed was talking about returning to normal monetary policy and discussing the timetable for eventually raising interest rates and tightening the supply of credit, as it would normally do after a recession has ended.
But this recession and its painful aftermath have been anything but normal. Global financial markets were set back in the spring by the European debt crisis in Europe, and over several months, Fed officials gradually became convinced that their only option was to step back in again.

HEADLINE: Orders to U.S. Factories Rose 2.1% in September

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders to American factories rose broadly in September, propelled by business spending on commercial airplanes, boats and machines. 
The Commerce Department said Wednesday that factory orders rose 2.1 percent in September, the steepest increase since January. Orders were flat in August.
Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders rose 0.4 percent, after gaining 1.3 percent in August.
Business spending on costly, long-lasting goods like airplanes and heavy machines produced most of the demand. But consumer spending also rose 1.0 percent, after running flat in August.
Economists have worried that recession-weary consumers will not spend enough to keep factories moving as business spending subsides. Wednesday's report may ease those fears.
A second report indicated that the United States service sector, the nation's predominant employer, grew faster in October than in the previous month and posted its 10th straight month of expansion.
The Institute for Supply Management said its service sector index rose to 54.3, up from 53.2 in September. A figure above 50 indicates that the sector is expanding. Wall Street analysts had expected a small drop, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.
The trade group gauges of new orders and employment also grew.
The services index covers about 80 percent of the economy, including the health care, retail, utilities and financial services industries.
Wednesday's reading was better than expected, but not enough to change economists' outlook for high unemployment and slow job growth the rest of this year.

HEADLINE: Rejecting Bid Sends Bad Signal

BYLINE: By ROB COX and AGNES T. CRANE

 BODY:
Canada may have just shot itself in the foot. The country's government said that BHP's $39 billion takeover bid for the Potash Corporation provided no net benefit to the nation.
There's some basis for this argument in this specific instance. But what the decision fails to reflect is the long-term damage that such a politicized rejection does to Canada's ability to attract capital.
While BHP still has 30 days to plead its case, the decision by the conservative government of Stephen Harper will be regarded as a major victory in Saskatchewan. The provincial government opposed the takeover of Potash, an asset that it used to own. It clearly marshaled some persuasive arguments for its resistance, though Tony Clement, Canada's industry minister, said he was prohibited from sharing them. 
However, the province had earlier estimated that the takeover could reduce tax revenues by 3 billion Canadian dollars over a decade. Two-thirds of the hit would arise if BHP used tax credits from developing its own potash assets to shelter its target's income. The rest would be the result of piling acquisition debt onto its target.
BHP had said it was willing to ensure that there was no tax impact. Of course, many companies that have made promises under the Investment Canada Act's requirement that takeovers create a benefit for the nation have failed to live up to their pledges.
But this highlights a flaw in the law's enforcement which can -- and perhaps ought to -- be fixed regardless of the merits of the BHP bid. However, that should not be the basis for a rejection of a deal that created no obvious threat to competition or consumers.
After all, the longer-term ramifications of protecting Potash may hurt Canada even more, particularly if investors now view the country's natural resources as takeover proof. Financing costs would rise, reducing Toronto's increasing might as a financial center for the global mining and metals sector and, ultimately, reducing Canadian wealth. It's hard to see how an outcome like that would be of any net benefit to the country.
Nigerian Bond Issue
Nigerian finance has a bad rap in the developed world. Renowned for e-mail scams and widespread corruption, the country runs the risk of being judged quite unfairly by investors looking warily at its planned $500 million bond offering. But Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, actually looks deserving of the funds.
First, Nigeria has very little debt -- it currently stands at just 16 percent of gross domestic product. Compare that with the United States, where public debt stands at 88 percent of G.D.P., or, worse, Greece, where the debt load has soared to 133 percent, according to JPMorgan. That also means a scarcity of Nigerian commercial paper may appeal to investors wanting to diversify into one of the biggest of the so-called frontier economies.
Second, the country is Africa's largest producer of crude. With oil prices about $85 a barrel, Nigeria, which assumes a $60-a-barrel price in its budget, should have little difficulty staying current on its debt payments. Ballpark estimates for the bond offering would put the yield at less than 6 percent, which is hardly crippling. Moreover, Nigeria's nonoil economy looks relatively robust, with growth clocking in at 8.3 percent in 2009, according to the most recent statistics from Fitch Ratings.
There's no getting around corruption in Nigeria, however. According to Transparency International, the country scores 2.4 on a scale of 10, with 0 being highly corrupt. But while bad, it's actually better than Russia, which scored 2.1 -- and investors still handed over $5.5 billion this year to that one-time defaulter.
Uncertainty surrounding Nigeria's presidential election in January may give some investors pause. But there is a good chance the bond deal will not hit the market until after voters go to the polls, not least because of the difficulty of shopping a debut dollar-denominated bond during the holiday seasons on Wall Street and the City of London.
That should give investors plenty of time to see whether Nigeria's debt offering, rather than suggesting markets have lost their marbles, shows that old assumptions and stereotypes are rightly being questioned.

HEADLINE: Trade Talks May Benefit From Bipartisan Approach

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama may find a rare opening for possible bipartisan cooperation, with a Republican House helping to re-energize American efforts to reduce trade barriers.
The president wants American exports to double by 2015, but to do that he will have to make progress on a trade agenda. At the top of the list are the completion of free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama that have languished since 2007; jump-starting the Doha round of world trade negotiations, which have been stalled for two years; and expansion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that could open the way for more trade between the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region.
''The pending free-trade agreements could be an early test of the capacity of split government to act in a bipartisan manner on substantive economic and foreign policy issues,'' said Susan C. Schwab, who was the United States trade representative during much of President George W. Bush's second term. 
At the least, Republican victories on Tuesday suggested that lawmakers with a strong interest in trade would have leading roles in the next Congress.
Rob Portman, a Republican and former trade representative, was easily elected to the Senate from Ohio even though trade had been a contentious issue there. The incoming House speaker, John A. Boehner, also of Ohio, has called for completion of the three pending agreements.
Two pro-trade Republicans are in line for leadership roles on the pivotal House Ways and Means Committee: Dave Camp of Michigan, who is likely to become chairman, and Kevin Brady of Texas, who will lead the trade subcommittee.
Meanwhile, world trade, which fell by 12.2 percent last year, is rebounding quickly. It is estimated to grow by 13.5 percent this year.
But trade experts warn that political pressure favoring restrictions, if not outright protectionism, will be hard to surmount.
Mickey Kantor, who served as trade representative and then as commerce secretary under President Bill Clinton, said the recession had eroded broad support for trade liberalization.
''Because of unemployment, because of the fact than median income has been going down, not up, the fact that the middle class has been hurt badly, and the fact that Congress has been in disrepute, whether rightly or wrongly, the American people are not exactly enamored of considering any new trade policy,'' he said.
Effective leadership can build support for trade accords, Mr. Kantor said, citing Mr. Clinton's advocacy of the North American Free Trade Agreement, approved in 1993.
But Nafta continues to be faulted as the cause of driving manufacturing jobs overseas and opening the door to illegal immigrant workers. As a candidate in states hard-hit by the loss of jobs overseas, Mr. Obama said that Nafta should be renegotiated; as president, though, he has softened his view.
In June, Mr. Obama announced plans to complete an agreement with South Korea before leaders of the Group of 20 economic powers gather in Seoul, on Nov. 11-12.
Mr. Obama's trade representative, Ron Kirk, and his Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-hoon, met in San Francisco on Oct. 26 to try to resolve outstanding differences over barriers to American exports of automobiles and beef, and the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, called Mr. Obama on Monday evening to discuss the matter.
''The president underscored that we hope to use the next week to make progress toward an agreement,'' the White House said in a statement. ''If we can reach a satisfactory agreement on the key issues for American workers, we will have a deal.''
The agreement with Colombia faces opposition from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and other labor groups concerned about violence against Colombian union leaders.
R. Scott Miller, who handles global trade policy for Procter & Gamble, said both parties would have to compromise to complete the free-trade agreements.
''The president will have to disappoint parts of his base to advance anything, including the Korea agreement,'' he said. ''The Republicans also have to want to work with the president.''
John K. Veroneau, who was a deputy trade representative from 2007 to 2009, said the toughest hurdle was getting the House leadership to schedule a vote. ''If you can get a vote, each of the pending agreements will pass,'' he predicted.
An even steeper challenge will be the Doha talks, which broke down in July 2008 over agricultural tariffs.
Some observers, like Mr. Kantor, believe it would be more fruitful to pursue separate agreements on intellectual property, financial services, agriculture and other sectors than to try to revive the talks.
However, Alan W. Wolff, a Washington lawyer, said that Congress could support the Doha round if it were reoriented around issues that had been neglected, like food and product safety and the sharing of scarce commodities.
''Republicans would be more likely to offer alternative approaches than would a House controlled by the president's party,'' he said.

HEADLINE: America's Political Map, Scrambled

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''G.O.P. Takes House'' (front page, Nov. 3):
In part because of the ebb and flow of politics, the 2010 election ushered out many incumbents, served up the House to Republicans and increased Republican numbers in the Senate.
There can be no question that Republicans have been working for these victories for two years, that they benefited enormously from a Supreme Court decision regarding corporate donors and that Democrats and the Obama administration arrived late to campaign mode.
The question now is, Can Republicans deliver on their rhetoric of creating jobs, bringing down the deficit and turning the economy around? 
The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said that should Republicans make the gains they expected, their No. 1 priority would be to work toward making President Obama a one-term president.
If this means that the poor and the middle class will have to wait for jobs and that the economy will be put on the back burner, then, sadly, the ugliness of politics will have prevailed, and the job requirements of our representatives will be so altered as to be unrecognizable.
Patricia A. Weller Emmitsburg, Md., Nov. 3, 2010
To the Editor:
Re ''Election 2010'' (editorial, Nov. 3):
For two years ''Yes, we can'' has been met by ''No, you can't'' as Republicans in Congress, in order to gain partisan advantage, put up a near-solid front to weaken or thwart measures that would benefit the vast majority of citizens.
Instead of taking his case to the American people at every turn, President Obama continued to reach across the aisle to grasp a hand that was never extended. The result of the kid-glove treatment of his Republican opposition? Significant Democratic midterm losses and the prospect of two years of stalemate that a nation facing critical challenges can ill afford.
Marcus Wiesner Montclair, N.J., Nov. 3, 2010
To the Editor:
Until they learn lessons of unified strategy and coherent messaging from their opponents, Democrats will continue to lose further ground to Republicans in the years to come.
Core strategies of Democratic campaigns generally seek public engagement in ways that are calculating, fact-heavy and overly dry. This sorely limits the likelihood of success beyond their base.
Conservatives and allied media have been so successful at channeling public disaffection into enthusiasm at the polls because of fundamentally distinct communication strategies. Their approach recognizes the critical importance of party unity, the public face of their leaders and finding a resonant emotional frequency with voters, both the party faithful and the undecided.
Democrats, on the other hand, arm themselves mainly with facts, leaving them ill prepared and incoherent when the battle is being waged so differently than they might prefer.

Re ''Republican Party Time,'' by Maureen Dowd (column, Nov. 3):
Thank you for the oh so perfect reminder on this very gloomy morning. Recalling Newt Gingrich's gloating in 1994 helps to put things into perspective.
Things will certainly swing back around -- especially when the stated Republican agenda is not to compromise at any cost and to make President Obama a one-term president.
Linda Chapman Stamford, Conn., Nov. 3, 2010
To the Editor:
Sadly, the American population was bombarded with almost $4 billion in campaign spending, -- most of which did not address issues in a thoughtful manner, but created vacuums into which an uninformed populace was swept.
So, we, the citizens of the United States, risk seating candidates who do not appeal to reason, but instead cater to our nation's lowest denominators: the prejudices, the simple answers to complex issues.
John Ruskin New Orleans, Nov. 3, 2010
To the Editor:
For the next two years I will come to my office and not do one thing that my boss asks me to do. I will not do one thing that will help move my company forward. At the end of those two years, I will ask to be greatly rewarded for those actions. Hey, it just worked for the Republicans.
Suzanne Victor Southampton, Pa., Nov. 3, 2010
To the Editor:
Now that the circus is over, perhaps the clowns will finally cease with the fund-raising, the backbiting and the promises that they don't intend to keep and go to work in Washington to actually serve all the people and the country.
After all, that is the reason we elect them, pay them a salary and fill their campaign coffers.
Jeff Peters Steamboat Springs, Colo., Nov. 3, 2010
To the Editor:
The biggest losers Tuesday night were not the Democratic candidates but the unions across the country. These unions spent tens of millions of dollars on losing Democrats in the midterm elections. This abuse of power has to be challenged by the rank-and-file members in the future.
Taking hard-earned dues and squandering it on politicians in this economy is a disgrace. The money should have been set aside for the benefit of the unions' members -- for health care, pensions or a strike fund.
When are union members going to stand up and say we will no longer allow our dues to be used against our interests?
Bob Jacobs Glendale, Ariz., Nov. 3, 2010
To the Editor:
After listening to months of campaign oratory from both political parties, and now to victory speeches, I find it shocking to have never heard a word about the need for our presence in Afghanistan, its terrible effect upon our country and economy, the sacrifices being made by members of our armed forces and what our objectives should be.
Doesn't anyone care anymore? For shame!
Mark Davis Forest Hills, Queens, Nov. 3, 2010
To the Editor:
In ''Where Do Democrats Go Next?'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 3), Senator Evan Bayh, Democrat of Indiana, urges the Democrats to ''seize the center.'' Others, too, analyze the election results in terms of, Was President Obama too far left or too far right? Let's drop the labels and get down to basics.
The Democrats have opposed the will of the people for two years. There was popular support for the public option, strict regulation of the banks, all steps necessary to provide jobs, and federal intervention to prevent unjust foreclosures, and there was public opposition to the individual health care mandate and the war in Afghanistan.
Politicians should start listening to the voters or they will face the consequences in the next election.
Gerald H. Abrams New York, Nov. 3, 2010
To the Editor:
I read Evan Bayh's Op-Ed essay with dismay. Citing ''a public unhappy about the economy,'' Mr. Bayh urges that Congressional Democrats move to the right (arguably well beyond ''center'' -- even President Richard M. Nixon favored universal health care). The policies and practices of the right in the prior administration brought us the Great Recession.
Mr. Bayh offers no specific suggestions for jobs creation or providing the educational and physical infrastructures on which a vibrant 21st-century economy can flourish.
Perhaps it is the Obama administration's indifference to its progressive base that proved so costly in Tuesday's elections.
Judith Green Teaneck, N.J., Nov. 3, 2010
To the Editor:
Out of frustration at the Republican and Democratic Parties' inability to work together, the electorate is swinging like a wild pendulum between them. We know that in between elections there's something called governance, but our elected officials seem to have forgotten that. It's way past time that our elected officials learn or relearn the skills needed to work together and to govern the country.
In the spirit of good governance, whether Democrat, Republican, independent or Tea Party, we should stop treating one another as enemies.
As a nation we have real enemies: terrorists, gangs, drug dealers. As a nation we have serious problems: the jobs crisis, the mortgage crisis, the education crisis.
These challenges can't be faced if petty self-interest keeps the government in gridlock.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Expands a Base From South to Midwest

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MONICA DAVEY; Adam Nagourney reported from Las Vegas, and Monica Davey from Chicago. Campbell Robertson contributed reporting from Nashville.

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- For Democrats, the new political map colored by the midterm elections was nothing short of bracing: Vast stretches of uninterrupted Republican victories across the Midwest and the South, with Democrats left clinging to the coasts, lonely strips of blue on a very red horizon.
Republicans made significant progress in capturing statehouses and governors' seats, which will give them a decided advantage in drawing legislative and Congressional districts based on the 2010 census. Democratic losses in governors' races in states like Iowa, Ohio and Florida could complicate President Obama's re-election in 2012. In Congress, Midwest Democrats are a declining breed, at least for now, meaning that the impact of Democratic views from the region, on issues like global warming and economic redevelopment, is likely to wane. 
But did the seismic upheaval in Tuesday's election signal a political realignment? Have the Democrats been marginalized in the Midwest and South and transformed into a bicoastal party?
Democrats have seen a steady fade in the South for years, and the results on Tuesday left the party there in the worst shape it has been since Reconstruction. ''It's been a long time coming,'' said Todd Shaw, a professor of political science at the University of South Carolina. ''But it finally came to pass.''
But the Midwest is a different matter. For all the losses, the region has a large number of Democratic voters, with a history of loyalty to the party. One election does not erase that. And few areas of the country have been as hard-hit by the recession as the Midwest, creating an environment where incumbents -- in this case, Democrats -- faced a decidedly rough road to re-election.
If these past 18 years have demonstrated anything, it is that allegiance shifts quickly, particularly among independents. Just two years ago, many were suggesting the Republican Party had been reduced to a regional party, representing only the South.
''It's a historic, epic change in the political dynamics of the country,'' said Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, a likely Republican presidential candidate in 2012. ''But we should be realistic about the lessons of history: It can change back very quickly, as President Obama learned between 2008 and 2010. The days of the pendulum swinging very slowly have become a digital clock ticking very quickly.''
Chet Culver, Iowa's Democratic governor who lost his re-election bid, called it a ''short-term swing of the pendulum,'' but described it as ''wake-up call'' for Democrats to talk about issues of concern to middle-class voters.
The only real bright spots for Democrats were on the East and West Coasts -- where voters selected two Democratic governors and three Democratic senators -- and in Western states like this one, where Senator Harry Reid was re-elected, and Colorado, which chose a Democratic governor and re-elected Democratic Senator Michael Bennet.
By contrast, ''a tsunami just hit the heartland,'' as Mark Steven Kirk, the Republican who won President Obama's former Senate seat from Illinois, put it. State legislatures sank to 38 percent Democrats across the Midwest, the lowest percentage there since 1956.
State legislatures that had been Democratically controlled, in one or both chambers, in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania will now be dominated by Republicans. Governors' seats flipped from Democratic to Republican in Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
''Can I brag for one moment?'' Mr. Pawlenty said. ''Minnesota's State Legislature, for the first time since party designation in Minnesota, both houses are in Republican hands.'' The designation change occurred in 1975.
In the South, in addition to winning the governorship, Republicans took over the State Legislature in Alabama for the first time in 136 years. They won control of the governor's office and the Tennessee State Legislature for the first time since Reconstruction, took over the North Carolina Legislature for the first time in more than a century, had their best showing ever in Arkansas, and won all statewide offices in Georgia and South Carolina. In five states, only one Democratic House member will remain, and in four of those cases that Democrat represents the state's majority-minority district.
Through the 1990s, Deep South states often sent Republicans to Washington while voting for Democrats back home. But white Southern voters may be dropping that habit: statewide offices in the South are becoming as overwhelmingly dominated by Republicans as they were by Democrats for most of the 20th century. With Republicans in control of so many statehouses on the eve of redistricting, the white Southern Democrat is a profoundly endangered species.
Democrats in the Midwest were quick to suggest that the scale of their losses appeared larger, in part, because Democrats had held so many offices. Any party in control, they said, would have been tossed aside given the dismal unemployment rates and state budgets laden with deficits and unfunded pension liabilities.
John J. Cullerton, the State Senate president in Illinois and a Democrat, said the same tide that hit Democrats this year could hit Republicans in two years. ''To govern, these people are either going to raise taxes, make cuts or borrow, and all of those, when they happen, will have political consequences,'' he said.
Tad Devine, a consultant for Lincoln Chafee, who was elected Tuesday as governor of Rhode Island as an independent, argued that voters were turning against political leaders who did not appear responsive to their concerns. ''They've decided to put politicians on a choke chain and pull the leash,'' Mr. Devine said. ''That doesn't mean they've become Republicans. If anything, there is a powerful independent movement in the country.''

HEADLINE: Power Shift Stirs Economic Worries Overseas

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN

 BODY:
As Republicans prepare to assert new authority in Congress, America's overseas trading partners worry that Washington's political upheaval may pose fresh challenges to the global economy.
Despite pledges to curb government spending and the huge United States budget deficit, Republicans are expected to address anxiety over unemployment and flagging growth by pushing for an extension of the income tax cuts passed during the presidency of George W. Bush -- a move that would add to the deficit and, by extension, further weaken the dollar.
''The rest of the world, including Asia, is looking at the United States and seeing no real effective policy measures in bringing the economy back on track,'' said Bart van Ark, the chief economist at the Conference Board, which measures American economic indicators. ''That is making the U.S. lose its legitimacy in the global economic community as a leader in terms of providing solutions.'' 
Maintaining taxes at their current relatively low rates could help lift consumer spending in the United States, while a cheaper dollar would make American exports more competitive. But analysts said those fixes would be only temporary and would be unlikely to reverse the waning of the United States economic clout, as emerging markets -- led by China, India and Brazil -- outpace industrial nations as drivers of global growth.
A weaker dollar, by making European exports priced in euros more expensive, may also damp efforts at an export-led recovery in European countries like Britain, Greece and Ireland that have adopted harsh austerity measures to rein in their excessive debts.
After the Obama administration pushed through changes to health care and to the financial system, voters signaled that they wanted reductions in federal spending. Representative John A. Boehner, the Ohio Republican set to become the next speaker of the House, reiterated a pledge after the elections to reduce the size of government, create jobs and change the way Congress does business.
That is no easy task. Voters also want to keep expensive entitlements and are hoping Republicans can reverse cuts to the Medicare program and extend the Bush tax cuts set to expire at year's end.
Those moves, if enacted into law, would make it harder -- not easier -- to keep Republican commitments to curb the national debt and the budget deficit. From the perspective of those outside the United States, ''Republican claims to fiscal probity are a little difficult to buy into,'' said Simon Tilford, the chief economist at the Center for European Reform in London. ''What they're advocating would probably increase the deficit rather than effect the dramatic reduction which they claim they want to bring about.''
There is also the risk that Congress, divided between Republican control of the House and a fragile Democratic majority in the Senate, will fall into gridlock. That would leave the task of supporting a United States economic recovery almost entirely to the Federal Reserve.
The Federal Reserve expressed concern Wednesday about a ''slow'' recovery and weak inflation in announcing plans to buy $600 billion in Treasury bonds, a process known as quantitative easing, aimed at stimulating growth and reducing unemployment. That move seems certain to further weaken the dollar, but its ability to stimulate the American economy remains to be seen.
It is also unclear just how much the lame-duck Congress still controlled by Democrats can push through before the new Republican-led House takes over. But the pressure is now on the Obama administration to cut a deal on taxes before the end of the year, even though there is no consensus on where to cut spending, analysts said.
Moreover, if the current income tax rates are extended for the wealthy as well as for middle class taxpayers for the next few years, the action could add an estimated one to two percentage points to the deficit as a share of overall economic activity, according to Klaus Gunter Deutsch, a senior economist with Deutsche Bank Research in Berlin.
If Washington ends up adding to the deficit rather than reducing it, one result could be a further weakening of the dollar against the euro, the pound and other floating currencies.
The dollar has slumped more than 15 percent against the euro alone since June on concerns about the federal fiscal situation and on expectations that the Federal Reserve would announce new efforts on Wednesday to pump more money into the weakened economy.
In times of full employment, a bigger deficit can be offset by tighter monetary policy and higher interest rates, said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''But now, with rates at zero and the Fed about to embark on a quantitative expansion, that will mean a bigger deficit and a weaker dollar, and that's the set of issues that would set off the biggest alarm overseas -- especially among the Europeans.''
Even if the dollar continues to weaken, helping American exporters, most political and economic experts expect lawmakers from both parties to keep up pressure on China to strengthen its currency. That would make it even harder for the Obama administration to support a more cooperative approach toward bringing the Chinese currency more into line with that country's strong economic fundamentals.
American manufacturers have long complained that China is keeping its currency, the renminbi, artificially weak, making it harder for United States exports to compete in the global marketplace.
The currency issue is part of a larger skirmish over trade, said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist and a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.
''If the Chinese were to give a little, that would buy a lot of time on trade policy,'' he said. ''Asians especially are extremely nervous about seeing the U.S. slap a tariff on Chinese imports or some such aggressive approach, not only because Republicans are taking the House, but because the economy is very weak.''
Until the dust settles, however, ''unpredictability is the word of the day,'' Mr. Rogoff added. ''We have a powerful and volatile new force,'' he added. The ''rest of world will be worried about that.''

HEADLINE: Obama to Face New Foes In Global Warming Fight

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration and the new Congress appear headed for early confrontations over the reach of environmental regulation and federal subsidies for fossil fuel development.
The administration is moving determinedly forward on a series of actions to limit emissions of greenhouse gases and other air pollutants, to restrict some coal mining practices and to eliminate multibillion-dollar tax breaks for the oil and gas industry.
Those initiatives have already generated bipartisan objections in both houses of Congress, and the numbers in opposition grew with Tuesday's voting. Many of the newly elected members have expressed skepticism about the existence of global warming and say they strongly oppose government action to combat it. 
The presumptive new Republican speaker of the House, John A. Boehner of Ohio, has dismissed the idea that carbon dioxide is affecting the climate and has characterized cap and trade and other proposed solutions to global warming as job-killing energy taxes.
He and other Republican leaders in both houses, along with many Democrats and a number of state attorneys general, support measures to block the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, as it plans to do starting in January.
They will find fervent and well-financed support from business interests that fear the effect of such regulation on their cost of doing business. John Engler, the former Republican governor of Michigan and now president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said on Wednesday that the new Congress should assert stronger control over E.P.A., which, as he put it, ''is getting way outside its authority in trying to regulate that which cannot pass in the legislative process.''
Mr. Obama has clearly narrowed his ambitions on environmental and energy policy, scrapping any hope of enacting comprehensive legislation to deal with climate change and the nation's dependence on imported oil. He said he was not seeking confrontation with Congress over regulation of greenhouse gases.
''Cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat; it was not the only way'' Mr. Obama said in his press conference Wednesday. ''And I'm going to be looking for other means to address this problem. And I think the E.P.A. wants help from the legislature on this. I don't think that, you know, the desire is to somehow be protective of their powers here. I think what they want to do is make sure that the issue's being dealt with.''
Instead of seeking a broad approach to energy and climate change, Mr. Obama said, he would look for smaller policy bites that could attract Republican support. He said he hoped to generate wide support in the new Congress for further development of electric vehicles, for converting some of the nation's heavy truck fleet to run on natural gas, for incentives for energy efficiency in buildings and appliances, and for more emphasis on renewable energy and nuclear power. He said such programs lead to innovation and can create thousands of jobs.
Tuesday's voting offered a brutal verdict for many of those members of the House who had voted for the cap-and-trade approach that Mr. Obama has now abandoned. Some three dozen House Democrats who supported the 2009 climate bill were turned out of office.
Supporters of the measure, sponsored by Democratic Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, noted that more than half of the 43 Democrats who voted against the measure also lost their seats, meaning that for most voters the election was not simply a referendum on the climate bill.
Even as voters in many states were issuing a rebuke to lawmakers who supported climate change legislation in Washington, the people of California, as is their custom, were moving in a different direction. They soundly defeated Proposition 23, an oil-industry-sponsored measure to gut the state's landmark global warming law that will set strict limits on greenhouse gas emissions and create a trading system for pollution permits.
California voters also re-elected the Democrat Barbara Boxer to the Senate and returned a Democrat, Jerry Brown, to the governor's office -- both strong supporters of state and federal action on climate change.
A coalition of unions, environmental groups, Silicon Valley investors and people in the clean energy industry raised $25 million to defeat Proposition 23, which was written and financed by out-of-state oil companies.
Thomas F. Steyer, a San Francisco hedge fund billionaire who served as co-chairman of the group that campaigned against the proposition, said the nation would follow California's lead.
''When it comes to huge, significant change, the history of the United States is that it does not come from Washington, D.C.,'' Mr. Steyer said. ''It comes from people outside the capital, people much closer to the real world, who force change gradually, bit by bit. A change in this nation's energy economy is inevitable. The question is, how soon?''

HEADLINE: Personality Intersects With Policy

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
DECISION POINTS
By George W. Bush
Illustrated. 497 pages. Crown Publishers. $35.
George W. Bush's memoir ''Decision Points'' could well have been titled ''The Decider Decides'': it's an autobiography focused around ''the most consequential decisions'' of his presidency and his personal life from his decision to give up drinking in 1986 to his decision to invade Iraq in 2003 to his decisions regarding the financial crisis of 2008. It is a book that is part spin, part mea culpa, part family scrapbook, part self-conscious effort to (re)shape his political legacy.
A dogged work of reminiscence by an author not naturally given to introspection, ''Decision Points'' lacks the emotional precision and evocative power of his wife Laura's book, ''Spoken From the Heart,'' published earlier this year, though it's a considerably more substantial effort than Mr. Bush's perfunctory 1999 campaign memoir, ''A Charge to Keep.'' 
Certainly it's the most casual of presidential memoirs: how many works in the genre start as a sort of evangelical, 12-step confession (''Could I continue to grow closer to the Almighty or was alcohol becoming my god?''), include some off-color jokes and conclude with an aside about dog poop?
The prose in ''Decision Points'' is utilitarian, the language staccato and blunt. Mr. Bush's default mode is regular-guy-politico, and his moods vacillate mainly among the defensive and the diligent -- frat boy irreverence, religious certainty and almost willful obliviousness.
The Bush who emerges from these pages will be highly familiar to readers of Bob Woodward's quartet of books on the administration or Robert Draper's 2007 ''Dead Certain'': a president fond of big ideas and small comforts (like a daily run); a chief executive known for his optimism, stubbornness and lack of curiosity. At the same time ''Decision Points'' -- sometimes deliberately, sometimes inadvertently -- gives the reader an uncanny sense of how personality and the fateful interplay of personalities within an administration can affect policies that affect the world.
Along the way Mr. Bush acknowledges various mistakes. On his administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina he says, ''As leader of the federal government, I should have recognized the deficiencies sooner and intervened faster.'' On Iraq he says he regrets that ''we did not respond more quickly or aggressively when the security situation started to deteriorate after Saddam's regime fell,'' that ''cutting troop levels too quickly was the most important failure of execution in the war,'' and that he still has ''a sickening feeling every time'' he thinks about the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
Still, he insists that ''removing Saddam from power was the right decision'': ''for all the difficulties that followed, America is safer without a homicidal dictator pursuing WMD and supporting terror at the heart of the Middle East.''
In the course of this book Mr. Bush hops and skips over many serious issues raised by critics, including the cherry-picking of intelligence by administration hawks in the walk up to the invasion of Iraq; the push for aggrandized executive power by the White House in the war on terror; and the ignoring of advice from the military and the State Department on troop levels and postwar planning.
The former president does not address the role that the decision to divert resources to the war in Iraq played in the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, instead arguing that ''the multilateral approach to rebuilding, hailed by so many in the international community, was failing.'' He tries to play down the problems of Guantanamo Bay, writing that detainees were given ''a personal copy of the Koran'' and access to a library among whose popular offerings was ''an Arabic translation of 'Harry Potter.' '' And he asserts that ''had I not authorized waterboarding on senior al Qaeda leaders, I would have had to accept a greater risk that the country would be attacked.''
Mr. Bush does not grapple with the role that his deregulatory, free market policies played in fueling the economic meltdown at the end of his second term. Nor does he take any responsibility for the fierce partisanship and political divisiveness that took root in his administration.
Several times in the book Mr. Bush uses the term ''blindsided'' to describe his feelings about a crisis that his advisers and cabinet seem not to have filled him in on. He says he felt ''blindsided'' over Abu Ghraib: Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ''had told me the military was investigating reports of abuse at the prison, but I had no idea how graphic or grotesque the photos would be,'' he writes. ''The first time I saw them was the day they were aired on '60 Minutes II.' ''
Mr. Bush says he told advisers he ''never wanted to be blindsided like that again,'' after a showdown between the White House and the Justice Department over a secret surveillance program. And he says ''we were blindsided by a financial crisis that had been more than a decade in the making'': his focus, he writes, ''had been kitchen-table economic issues like jobs and inflation. I assumed any major credit troubles would have been flagged by the regulators or rating agencies.''
Many books by reporters and former insiders have delineated the Bush administration as given to improvisatory decision making, wary of the traditional processes of policy review and inclined to favor loyalty over expertise. In ''The Assassins' Gate,'' the New Yorker writer George Packer quoted Richard N. Haass, a former director of policy planning in the State Department, saying that a real weighing of pros and cons about the Iraq war never took place. And in ''The Next Attack'' Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon wrote that planning efforts for the war were often not coordinated, that many officials were working out of channels, ''issuing directives without ever having their plans scrubbed in the kind of tedious, iterative process that the government typically uses to make sure it is ready for any contingency.''
In many respects this volume ratifies such observations. Mr. Bush, famous for being a ''gut player,'' writes that in assessing candidates for administration jobs, he looked at ''character and personality'' in an effort to create a culture that ''fostered loyalty -- not to me, but to the country and our ideals.'' In 2006 an aide told him that ''several people had spontaneously used the same unflattering term to describe the White House structure,'' he writes. ''It started with 'cluster' and ended with four more letters.'' And he writes about ''squabbling within the national security team'' and how ''nothing worked'' to cool these turf battles, including his own talks with Mr. Rumsfeld, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Vice President Dick Cheney and the national security adviser Condoleezza Rice.
Despite the eagerness of Mr. Bush to portray himself as a forward-leaning, resolute leader, this volume sometimes has the effect of showing the former president as both oddly passive and strangely cavalier.
For instance Mr. Bush writes about the failures to contain deteriorating security conditions in Iraq, continuing fights between the Pentagon and State Department, and his frustrations with Mr. Rumsfeld. But while he says that he had ''planned to make a change at Defense as part of a new national security team'' in 2004, he adds that he simply couldn't come up with a replacement for Mr. Rumsfeld. He considered and rejected the ideas of putting Ms. Rice or Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in the job, and was rebuffed by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who ''was enjoying his retirement.''
The situation in Iraq continued to deteriorate over the next two years with more and more soldiers and civilians getting killed and wounded, and in the spring of 2006 a group of retired generals spoke out against Mr. Rumsfeld. ''While I was still considering a personnel change,'' Mr. Bush writes, ''there was no way I was going to let a group of retired officers bully me into pushing out the civilian secretary of defense. It would have looked like a military coup and would have set a disastrous precedent.''
And so Mr. Rumsfeld stayed on in the job until an old friend of Mr. Bush's from high school and college (whom he had appointed to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board) suggested Robert M. Gates as a replacement. ''Why hadn't I thought of Bob?'' Mr. Bush wonders.
Mr. Bush's portrait of Mr. Cheney reaffirms many reporters' depiction of him as a steamrolling force for military intervention in Iraq. And Mr. Bush's description of the momentum toward war echoes that found in Mr. Woodward's book ''Plan of Attack,'' in which there was building pressure for action: Mr. Bush says that the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, told him ''the uncertainty was hurting the economy,'' and that Prince Bandar bin Sultan of Saudi Arabia told him ''the Middle East wanted a decision.''
But while many books like ''The Bushes'' by Peter Schweizer and Rochelle Schweizer and ''The Bush Tragedy'' by Jacob Weisberg have emphasized the differences between George W. Bush and his father -- and No. 43's need to differentiate himself from No. 41 -- the younger Bush takes pains in this memoir to underscore his closeness with his dad.
He says that during family Christmas celebrations in 2002 his father said: ''You know how tough war is, son, and you've got to try everything you can to avoid war,'' and then added, ''But if the man won't comply, you don't have any other choice.'' Later, after Bush the Younger gave the order to go to war, he says that his father sent him a note saying: ''You are doing the right thing. Your decision, just made, is the toughest decision you've had to make up until now. But you made it with strength and with compassion.''
Mr. Bush says he left office satisfied that ''I had always done what I believed was right.'' Since then, he says, he's comfortably settled back into ordinary life. Shortly after moving to Dallas, he writes, he took his dog Barney for an early morning walk: ''Barney spotted our neighbor's lawn, where he promptly took care of his business. There I was, the former president of the United States, with a plastic bag on my hand, picking up that which I had been dodging for the past eight years.''

HEADLINE: How Democrats Held On to the Senate

 BODY:
Despite Some Tea Party Victories . . .
Florida
Mr. Rubio picked up votes in counties that went Democratic in 2004, as Mr. Meek battled for moderate andliberal voters with Mr. Crist, a Republican who ran as an independent. 
Kentucky
Mr. Paul, who has never held public office and who is the son of Congressman Ron Paul of Texas, beat Mr. Conway in a marquee race for the Tea Party movement. Mr. Paul won most counties and ran up big margins in the Cincinnati suburbs. Mr. Conway's support was mostly in Louisville.
Pennsylvania
The Tea Party-backed Mr. Toomey won this race by a razor-thin margin with his antitax, small government agenda in a state that has a million more registered Democrats than Republicans. He was able to capture the vote of about 55 percent of independents.
. . . And a Stinging Defeat on Obama's Home Turf . . .
Illinois
President Obama cast a long shadow over the race for his former seat in Illinois, with nearly 70 percent of voters saying they wanted to send the president a message of support or opposition. But voters in urban areas with a lot of Obama supporters did not turn out as much as voters in rural areas.
. . . Democratic Incumbents Keep Their Seats . . .
California
Most California voters placed their bets on Mrs. Boxer's experience, re-electing the vulnerable incumbent to her fourth term. Her opponent, Ms. Fiorina, had pinned her hopes on ndependents, who make up 27 percent of the electorate, but she captured less than half their vote.
Colorado
The race drew $33 million in outside spending. Mr. Buck was a Tea Party favorite, but Colorado voters were less polarized than the rest of the nation. Interest was high, with about 200,000 more votes cast than in 2002, the last Senate race in a nonpresidential year.
Nevada
Although few were more closely identified with the Democratic agenda than Mr. Reid, hisopponent's eccentricity may have been too much for voters. Ms. Angle, a Tea Party favorite, drew votes from the economically distressed, but her support did not grow in the last few weeks.
. . . A New Democrat Is Elected . . .
Connecticut
In a tough negative campaign in which his opponent spent $46 million of her own fortune, Mr. Blumenthal prevailed over Ms. McMahon, a wrestling impresario, in a state where Mr. Obama is popular. Women seemed turned off by her, and voters said she was more unfair in her attacks.
. . . Though Some Races Are Still Too Close to Call
Alaska
Final results will not be in for two weeks, but Ms. Murkowski, the well-financed write-in candidate who lost to Mr. Miller in the Republican primary, has a chance to win.
Washington
The $11 million effort by Republican groups to defeat Ms. Murray in this blue state was dancing on a razor's edge. The Tea Party is less popular here than elsewhere, and few voters said they were trying to send a message to the president. But Mr. Rossi was within 14,000 votes of winning.

HEADLINE: In Florida's New Senator, Some Conservatives See Rise of the 'Great Right Hope'

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Catharine Skipp contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- For many Tea Party conservatives, Hispanics, and young Americans frustrated with the national debt that baby boomers have saddled on their future, Marco Rubio's victory in the Florida Senate race gave them an extra reason to celebrate.
The right finally had an action hero: young, dynamic, serious about policy, with a biography ready-made for inspiration.
''He's our Cuban Barack Obama,'' said Alex Lacayo, 36, a campaign volunteer at the Rubio victory party on Tuesday night who could not stop giving hugs to strangers. ''He gives us hope.''
The comparison has been made before, but by coming from behind to handily defeat Gov. Charlie Crist as well as Representative Kendrick B. Meek, Mr. Rubio, 39, has completed his entrance onto the national stage. With turbocharged help from the Tea Party, he has gone from a no-name former state lawmaker to what the conservative press calls the ''great right hope.'' 
And yet his path to the Senate has not been in a straight line, and neither, friends and supporters say, is his path forward. Mr. Rubio is not a libertarian like Rand Paul, the newly elected senator from Kentucky, and his policy expertise was honed by former Gov. Jeb Bush, not Sarah Palin.
His positions have shifted on issues like immigration, and after a campaign waged with ideological fervor and sprinkled with anti-Obama speeches, he now seems eager to play the pragmatist.
Who is Marco Rubio? At a news conference on Wednesday, at least, he was a young senator-elect who only mentioned President Obama once, in the context of finding a way to work with him, not against him. But he also was an insurgent who said voters were demanding change.
''You better not go up there and become like everybody else,'' Mr. Rubio said, describing the message he had heard.
The Republican establishment has been quick to claim Mr. Rubio as its own.
During the primary, before his momentum led Mr. Crist to leave the Republican fold to run as an independent, Mr. Rubio attracted support from a who's who of the party. Former Vice President Dick Cheney endorsed him. Mitt Romney, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Ms. Palin all campaigned with him. At times, it was as if he was the one being sought, not the other way around.
Those who have known Mr. Rubio for years said they had been surprised at how quickly his fortunes had changed. Rebeca Sosa, a member of the Miami-Dade County Board of Commissioners who has known Mr. Rubio since he entered politics, said voters in his own neighborhood failed to recognize him when he knocked on doors at the beginning of his Senate campaign.
It was a somewhat less humiliating experience than when he joined the State Legislature in 2000 and was mistaken for an aide three years later because of his youth.
Mr. Rubio said Wednesday that he was glad his campaign had faced long odds at first. ''When we didn't have money, when didn't have an organization, the only thing we had in this campaign was our principles, our message,'' he said. ''That's what kept us going.''
By late last year, that message -- to ''reclaim America'' and cut federal spending to protect the next generation -- had begun to catch on. The Tea Party was rising just as Mr. Rubio began attacking Governor Crist for the infamous hug he shared with Mr. Obama at a Florida rally for the federal stimulus package.
His bond with the Tea Party was a marriage of perfect timing.
''When you go back to last year, when this was being expressed, I noticed a real frustration that neither party spoke to the mainstream of America, their aspirations for their country and their families,'' Mr. Rubio told reporters on Wednesday. ''And the Tea Party movement became an expression of that.''
Or, as Steve Schale, who was Mr. Obama's Florida campaign director in 2008, put it: ''Rubio wasn't so much the Tea Party candidate as the candidate that the Tea Party embraced. It's like 2008. Did Barack Obama create the movement, or did the movement create Barack Obama?''
Mr. Rubio and activists on the right joined forces more officially in February, when Mr. Rubio gave the keynote address at the Conservative Political Action Conference. It was his first big hit on a national stage. His speech combined humor, patriotism and attacks on spending by the Democratic-controlled Congress.
''It was the perfect race for the narrative that defined the election,'' said Lisa De Pasquale, director of the conference. ''It said he was ready for prime time.''
About that time, Florida residents like Mr. Lacayo, a Nicaraguan immigrant who owns an import-export business, began to pay more attention. Mr. Lacayo said he volunteered for the campaign because he was inspired by the candidate's story of growing up with the values and work ethic that were passed down by his immigrant parents, who worked as a bartender and a maid.
Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist, said Mr. Rubio reflected the rise of a new generation of party leaders who could ''win the center with his principles, not despite them.''
Alberto R. Cardenas, a former chairman of the Florida Republican Party, said the victory provided Mr. Rubio the opportunity to redefine his party's appeal, particularly among Hispanics.
''Our message to Hispanics is going to driven by values,'' Mr. Cardenas said.
Mr. Rubio also faces several difficult challenges. Particularly on issues relating to immigration, he is a jumble of contradictions.
He is bilingual but supports making English the official language of the United States -- although he grew up in Miami-Dade County in the 1980s, when many Cuban immigrants saw an English-only requirement for local government as blatantly discriminatory.
He is a son of exiles who has made his parents' story a centerpiece of his campaign, but who also reversed his opposition to the new Arizona law cracking down on illegal immigrants after being pressured by conservatives. (He said adjustments to the law allayed his concerns that it went too far.)
Even his positions on economic policy can be difficult to pin down. In July, he laid out 12 steps to cut spending, which included raising the age for Social Security eligibility and giving the president a line-item veto over budget items.
Rarely, though, does Mr. Rubio talk about the programs he thinks should be cut.
Mr. Schale, the Democratic strategist, said Mr. Rubio's greatest challenge would be similar to Mr. Obama's when he joined the Senate in 2004: managing the expectations that have come less from detailed plans than from soaring language.
Mr. Castellanos said Mr. Rubio needed to be wary of all his new friends. ''His biggest challenge is not to get captured by either the G.O.P. or the Tea Party,'' he said. ''It is to remain Rubio.''
The senator-elect appears to understand that his work is just beginning. In his victory speech on Tuesday night, after the salsa band stopped playing and one of the speakers joked about his future run for president, Mr. Rubio asked the crowd to pray that he would stay true to his ideals. On Wednesday, he dismissed talk of a White House race.
''It's flattering and it's fleeting,'' he said. ''Politics is full of one-hit wonders, of people that stood in a room like this with a bunch of cameras, and no one hears from them anymore.''
He added, ''It's not going to get to my head.''

WASHINGTON -- President Obama may find a rare opening for possible bipartisan cooperation, with a Republican House helping to re-energize American efforts to reduce trade barriers.
The president wants American exports to double by 2015, but to do that he will have to make progress on a trade agenda. At the top of the list are the completion of free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama that have languished since 2007; jump-starting the Doha round of world trade negotiations, which have been stalled for two years; and expansion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that could open the way for more trade between the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region.
''The pending free-trade agreements could be an early test of the capacity of split government to act in a bipartisan manner on substantive economic and foreign policy issues,'' said Susan C. Schwab, who was the United States trade representative during much of President George W. Bush's second term. 
At the least, Republican victories on Tuesday suggested that lawmakers with a strong interest in trade would have leading roles in the next Congress.
Rob Portman, a Republican and former trade representative, was easily elected to the Senate from Ohio even though trade had been a contentious issue there. The incoming House speaker, John A. Boehner, also of Ohio, has called for completion of the three pending agreements.
Two pro-trade Republicans are in line for leadership roles on the pivotal House Ways and Means Committee: Dave Camp of Michigan, who is likely to become chairman, and Kevin Brady of Texas, who will lead the trade subcommittee.
Meanwhile, world trade, which fell by 12.2 percent last year, is rebounding quickly. It is estimated to grow by 13.5 percent this year.
But trade experts warn that political pressure favoring restrictions, if not outright protectionism, will be hard to surmount.
Mickey Kantor, who served as trade representative and then as commerce secretary under President Bill Clinton, said the recession had eroded broad support for trade liberalization.
''Because of unemployment, because of the fact than median income has been going down, not up, the fact that the middle class has been hurt badly, and the fact that Congress has been in disrepute, whether rightly or wrongly, the American people are not exactly enamored of considering any new trade policy,'' he said.
Effective leadership can build support for trade accords, Mr. Kantor said, citing Mr. Clinton's advocacy of the North American Free Trade Agreement, approved in 1993.
But Nafta continues to be faulted as the cause of driving manufacturing jobs overseas and opening the door to illegal immigrant workers. As a candidate in states hard-hit by the loss of jobs overseas, Mr. Obama said that Nafta should be renegotiated; as president, though, he has softened his view.
In June, Mr. Obama announced plans to complete an agreement with South Korea before leaders of the Group of 20 economic powers gather in Seoul, on Nov. 11-12.
Mr. Obama's trade representative, Ron Kirk, and his Korean counterpart, Kim Jong-hoon, met in San Francisco on Oct. 26 to try to resolve outstanding differences over barriers to American exports of automobiles and beef, and the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, called Mr. Obama on Monday evening to discuss the matter.
''The president underscored that we hope to use the next week to make progress toward an agreement,'' the White House said in a statement. ''If we can reach a satisfactory agreement on the key issues for American workers, we will have a deal.''
The agreement with Colombia faces opposition from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and other labor groups concerned about violence against Colombian union leaders.
R. Scott Miller, who handles global trade policy for Procter & Gamble, said both parties would have to compromise to complete the free-trade agreements.
''The president will have to disappoint parts of his base to advance anything, including the Korea agreement,'' he said. ''The Republicans also have to want to work with the president.''
John K. Veroneau, who was a deputy trade representative from 2007 to 2009, said the toughest hurdle was getting the House leadership to schedule a vote. ''If you can get a vote, each of the pending agreements will pass,'' he predicted.
An even steeper challenge will be the Doha talks, which broke down in July 2008 over agricultural tariffs.
Some observers, like Mr. Kantor, believe it would be more fruitful to pursue separate agreements on intellectual property, financial services, agriculture and other sectors than to try to revive the talks.
However, Alan W. Wolff, a Washington lawyer, said that Congress could support the Doha round if it were reoriented around issues that had been neglected, like food and product safety and the sharing of scarce commodities.
''Republicans would be more likely to offer alternative approaches than would a House controlled by the president's party,'' he said. SEWELL CHAN

HEADLINE: In New York, Cuomo Wins Easily

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON; Reporting was contributed by David W. Chen, Nicholas Confessore, Marjorie Connelly, Michael M. Grynbaum, Elizabeth A. Harris and Nate Schweber.

 BODY:
Andrew M. Cuomo, whose career in government appeared all but over just eight years ago, began preparing to take control of New York's beleaguered state government on Wednesday after Democrats swept the four statewide offices.
Mr. Cuomo, the state's attorney general, won a decisive victory on Tuesday over his Republican opponent, Carl P. Paladino, a Buffalo businessman whose often belligerent ways failed to catch on with voters, exit polls showed. Mr. Cuomo's running mate, Robert Duffy, the mayor of Rochester and a former police chief, defeated Gregory J. Edwards in the race for lieutenant governor.
In the two other statewide races, for attorney general and comptroller, Democrats also managed to win, but the margin of victory in comptroller's race turned out to be razor-thin. The Democratic incumbent, Thomas P. DiNapoli, a former state assemblyman who was named to the job in 2007, won by 3.4 percentage points with 97 percent of the precincts counted. His Republican opponent, Harry Wilson, a Wall Street trader who outspent Mr. DiNapoli by nearly 2 to 1 with roughly $4 million of his own money, did not concede. 
In the attorney general's race, Eric T. Schneiderman, a Democratic state senator from the Upper West Side of Manhattan who fiercely clung to Mr. Cuomo's coattails in the closing days of the campaign, was elected by a comfortable margin over the Republican candidate, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., the Staten Island district attorney, who argued that as a prosecutor and political outsider he was better equipped to tackle corruption in Albany.
With 97 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Schneiderman had 55 percent of the vote, to 43 percent for Mr. Donovan, in unofficial returns.
The state's two senators, Kirsten E. Gillibrand and Charles E. Schumer, easily won re-election, Ms. Gillibrand in a special election for the remainder of the six-year term to which Hillary Rodham Clinton was elected in 2006 and left last year to become Secretary of State. With 97 percent of the vote counted, Ms. Gillibrand led Joseph DioGuardi by 24.8 percentage points. Mr. Schumer was 33.1 percentage points ahead of Jay Townsend.
The success of Democrats in New York stood in stark contrast to the wave of setbacks that the party suffered across the country. In Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal, the state attorney general and Democratic stalwart, captured the United States Senate seat being vacated by Christopher J. Dodd after staving off a fierce challenge from Linda E. McMahon, a Republican and former pro wrestling executive who spent $40 million on her insurgent campaign.
The expensive and hard-fought contest, which included accusations that Mr. Blumenthal had exaggerated his military record, was considered a national bellwether on a night when Republicans were poised to make big gains in Congress on the strength of voter resentment toward Washington.
But while Republican challengers have already picked up key Senate seats in Florida and Kentucky, Mr. Blumenthal's victory, in a race where Republicans were hoping to poach a seat, underscored expectations that the Democrats would hold onto control of the Senate.
Mr. Blumenthal received substantial support from female voters, a group that Ms. McMahon failed to attract early in the race and may have eventually been her undoing. Mr. Blumenthal also benefited from a heavy Democratic turnout: several polling places in Bridgeport, one of the state's major Democratic strongholds, repeatedly ran out of ballots on Tuesday, prompting officials to extend voting hours there until 10 p.m.
In her concession speech, Ms. McMahon sounded defiant as she insisted that her campaign, while unsuccessful, still amounted to a victory. ''We have left no stone unturned in this race; we have made Washington listen,'' she told supporters. ''We are not going to fade into the woodwork.''
In New York, Mr. Cuomo enjoyed support from nearly every age and income demographic in the state, according to exit polls. Two-thirds of women, and 7 of 10 moderates, backed Mr. Cuomo, along with overwhelming majorities of black and Hispanic voters. Much of Mr. Paladino's support came from white voters without a college education, while independent white voters were divided between the two candidates.
Jimmy McMillan, who was running for governor as the candidate of the one-man Rent Is Too Damn High Party, received about 1 percent of the vote.
Voters in New York City, where a new electronic voting system made its debut this year, overwhelmingly voted to limit politicians to two consecutive terms, reversing a highly unpopular change engineered two years ago by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg so he could to run for a third term.
Fears about the state of the economy could be the determinant in many regional races on Tuesday, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium of the major television networks and The Associated Press.
Half of New York voters said they were very worried about the state of the economy, although Mr. Paladino's supporters were more likely to express this sentiment. Half of the voters surveyed in New York described Mr. Cuomo as an honest candidate; only a quarter said the same of Mr. Paladino.
More than half said they approved of President Obama's job performance, but fewer than 1 in 5 of Mr. Paladino's supporters agreed with that statement, according to the polls. About half of New York voters said the government was performing too many services that would be better left to businesses and individuals.
Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Paladino was asked if he would miss the stresses of the campaign trail. He laughed. ''I'm not a great campaigner,'' he said, adding that the process had been ''treacherous'' and ''confusing'' for him. He vowed never to do it again.
''No. More. Elections!'' he called out, enunciating each word. ''This is it.''
And his plans for the rest of the day? A prayer service, Mr. Paladino said, followed by a nap.

HEADLINE: Amid a Tea Party Whirlwind, Connecticut Is an Island of Calm

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HARTFORD
Maybe Connecticut really is the Land of Steady Habits after all.
Or perhaps, as the Connecticut columnist and blogger Colin McEnroe suggested, it's the Democratic version of Brigadoon.
Whatever the case, as voters nationally kicked the dog and upended the furniture on Tuesday, no state seemed more immune from the prevailing vapors than Connecticut.
Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, won the Senate seat, even though Linda E. McMahon spent nearly $50 million. The governor's race seemed in question after an earlier declaration that Dannel P. Malloy had defeated his Republican opponent, Thomas C. Foley, to become the first Democrat elected Connecticut governor since 1986. But the Democrats kept every House seat, despite tight races that imperiled Jim Himes in the 4th Congressional District and Chris Murphy in the 5th. George Jepsen, a former State Senate majority leader, will succeed Mr. Blumenthal as attorney general. Democrats swept all six constitutional offices. 
''Connecticut is, in a way, the common-sense state in asking what politicians have done and what they intend to do,'' Mr. Blumenthal, who is to political charisma what cold oatmeal is to haute cuisine, said at a postelection news conference Wednesday.
Chances are the Democratic sweep here says more about Connecticut than it does about lessons applicable elsewhere, but perhaps there's some of both.
It wasn't all bad news for Connecticut Republicans, who gained seats in both houses of the legislature, where, pending several recounts, Democrats will have advantages of 100 to 51 in the House and 23 to 13 in the Senate.
And the election was hardly sedate, given Ms. McMahon's wrestling-fueled campaign and its constant sideshows, including the attempt by her husband, Vince McMahon, to distribute wrestling swag outside polling places. In Bridgeport, the state's largest city, it ended in chaos after balloting was extended for two hours at 12 polling places because of voting malfunctions. As a result, Mr. Foley is challenging the outcome and refusing to concede.
But in a state with a penchant for buttoned-down politics, Connecticut's absence from the national Tea Party wasn't out of character.
''Connecticut, for lots of reasons, has proved itself almost immune not just to the kind of extremism that's overtaken the Republican Party nationally, but to extremism from both political parties,'' said Bill Curry, a former Democratic candidate for governor. ''We're a little courtlier than other states. Sarah Palin's endorsement of almost anyone in Connecticut would end their campaign.''
Connecticut is hurting economically, as are many other states, so the national angst over jobs and the economy certainly resonated. But the atmospherics that worked elsewhere probably didn't work as well here. Mr. Curry said some of the anonymous, over-the-top third-party attack ads, like ones against Mr. Murphy and Mr. Himes saying the health care overhaul provides free care for illegal immigrants and Viagra for convicted sex offenders, probably backfired with Connecticut voters.
And, though Republicans were entranced by Ms. McMahon's megamillions, the Republican commentator Ann Coulter was not alone before the primary in arguing: ''Any half-wit knows Connecticut will not vote for a professional wrestling 'impresario' for the U.S. Senate.'' In the end, wrestling's loutish image and the allegations of steroid abuse and wrestling deaths might have been too much to overcome.
Still, elections come down to many things. Chris Healy, the Republican Party state chairman, said that in a strong union state, with a fiscal crisis looming, unions, particularly public sector ones, had a huge incentive to turn out for Mr. Malloy, which translated to other Democratic votes. ''It wasn't lack of interest on our side,'' he said. ''We got our people out. They just had a higher level of interest based on the fear, in the governor's race, that Foley was going to be more active in reshaping the size of government.''
Still, if there's a broader lesson, it's that there are politicians whom people respect and admire, even these days. And, charisma-challenged as he may be, Mr. Blumenthal has a long record on issues involving health, safety, the environment, consumer rights, mortgage protection and other issues -- which made him a daunting candidate, even in the face of his misleading remarks on his Vietnam service.
No party always wins anywhere. Just ask New Jersey Democrats. Having complete control of state government could do for Connecticut Democrats what it did for national ones. But the lesson Mr. Blumenthal took from the elections in Connecticut probably sums up what happened in his race and the challenges for both parties as the political perpetual motion machine instantly pivots toward 2012.
''The lesson for public officials in this election is they need to get results,'' he said, ''in ways that make lives better for ordinary people, middle-class Americans, who are struggling to stay in their homes, find jobs and make ends meet in a very tough economy. People want results. Washington isn't producing results. And the anger and frustration isn't just understandable. It's well founded.''

HEADLINE: Shift May Push Democrats To Compromise on Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama on Wednesday invited Congressional Republican leaders to negotiate about extending the soon-to-expire Bush-era tax cuts, but he stood his ground by arguing against the Republicans' demand to keep those cuts for income above $250,000.
Yet Mr. Obama's overture opens the door for extending those top tax rates at least for a year as Republicans play from a strengthened hand in coming weeks. 
All the rates expire Dec. 31, a deadline set in 2001 to limit the cost. Extending them for another decade would cost nearly $4 trillion, and more counting the interest on that increase to the federal debt.
Both parties' strategies are in flux as the election results sink in. But the White House and many Congressional Democrats privately anticipate a compromise that would extend the Bush rates for the middle class for at least five years, and the rates for higher-income individuals for a year or two -- in a nod to Republicans' contention that no one's taxes should go up until the economy has fully recovered.
The Democrats' goal is to ''de-couple'' the tax cuts for middle and high incomes; they argue that if rates for the rich expire first and Republicans move to extend them, they will have a harder time justifying the cost of extending rates that apply to about 2 percent of taxpayers -- couples making more than $250,000 a year and individuals earning more than $200,000.
Extending the top rates for 2011 would cost roughly $33 billion; for the decade through 2020, the revenue loss would reach $700 billion.
Republicans continue to insist on a long-term extension for all the tax cuts -- as John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican in line to become House speaker, reiterated on Wednesday -- even as they protest the mounting federal debt.
Some Republicans say they will accept only a deal that extends the tax cuts for the middle class and the wealthy in tandem. And on Wednesday, they were hardly inclined to give ground, having withstood Democrats' attempts throughout the campaign to portray Republicans as blocking tax cuts for the middle class on behalf of those for the rich.
The Bush tax cuts are one of several pressing fiscal issues that Mr. Obama and Congress must address before year's end. Others are overdue appropriations for the government's operations, expiring tax breaks for individuals and businesses, action to forestall big cuts in reimbursements for doctors who treat Medicare patients and the expiration after November of assistance for an estimated two million Americans who have been unemployed for long periods.
All of those issues are crowding the agenda for what is likely to be a short lame-duck session of Congress at midmonth. It will pose a first test of whether Mr. Obama and Republicans can work together to solve knotty problems, though Democrats will remain in control of the House and Senate for that session.
Expectations are low on both sides. People in both parties said on Wednesday that without an agreement on the Bush tax cuts, resolving the other issues would be difficult. That would leave the government to operate on a short-term resolution maintaining existing spending levels and force Congress to extend tax cuts retroactively next year, causing confusion for taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service alike.
The disputes between the parties reflect a broader impasse over fiscal policy that predates the election, with Republicans blocking Mr. Obama's proposals for additional stimulus spending and business tax cuts to restart the recovery after its stall this year. Amid that impasse, not coincidentally, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday decided in effect to pump $600 billion more into the economy.
Mr. Obama said he would sit down with Mr. Boehner; the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky; and Democratic leaders in coming weeks to ''see where we can move forward in a way that, first of all, does no harm, that extends those tax cuts that are very important for middle-class families, also extends those provisions that are important to encourage businesses to invest and provide businesses some certainty over the next year or two.''
He added, ''How that negotiation works itself out, I think, is too early to say. But this is going to be one of my top priorities.''
Another is to expand a tax break so that businesses of all sizes could write off the full cost of equipment purchases through next year.
For all the campaign talk about reducing deficits, the range of other decisions facing Congress would add scores of billions of dollars to the nation's credit card.
The alternative minimum tax, which was intended to ensure that rich taxpayers with numerous credits and deductions pay some income tax, will ensnare millions of lower-income taxpayers without an adjustment this year. That would cost about $65 billion for 2010, according to the administration.
A package of longtime tax breaks -- the largest being a tax credit for corporations' research and development -- expired at the end of last year and would cost about $35 billion to extend. And a measure to prevent a scheduled 20 percent cut after November in doctors' pay for treating Medicare patients would cost $17 billion for one year.

ALABAMA
Midterm elections were largely a Republican sweep in Alabama. In some races, that outcome had been predicted: Robert Bentley, a retired dermatologist serving in the State Legislature, beat the Democratic candidate, Ron Sparks, in the governor's race, and Senator Richard C. Shelby easily defeated William G. Barnes, a Birmingham lawyer. But Republicans also took all but one of the state's seven seats in the House of Representatives -- including a hard- fought contest between Martha Roby, a Republican on the Montgomery City Council, who triumphed over the one-term Democratic incumbent, Bobby Bright. Republicans won a majority in the State Legislature for the first time in the 136 years since Reconstruction. ''It is historic,'' said William H. Stewart, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Alabama. ''Generally, the primaries were the election in Alabama. In November, balloting was amere formality.''
ARKANSAS 
Bill Clinton's election as president in 1992 was the single biggest political event ever in his home state, but it was hardly transformative: Arkansas remained Democratic territory, with islands of Republican dominance. Tuesday's results signaled a profound change. Perhaps most telling was the resounding defeat delivered to Senator Blanche Lincoln by John Boozman, who will be only the second Republican to represent Arkansas in the Senate since Reconstruction. Mr. Boozman's campaign strategy was simple: He stoked voters by highlighting Ms. Lincoln's connection to President Obama, particularly her vote for the health care bill. Republicans also gained two Congressional seats, but Democrats will hold onto the governor's office, as the incumbent, Mike Beebe, easily defeated his Republican challenger, Jim Keet, a former state legislator.
FLORIDA
With a message of fiscal restrain packaged in a fiery campaign style Marco Rubio, a Republican, easily won the three-way race for Senate. Mr. Rubio, a former speaker of the
Florida House who before this election season had not been well known outside South Florida, defeated a popular governor, Charlie Crist, a former Republican who ran as an independent, and Kendrick B. Meek, a Democrat. Exit polls suggested that Mr. Rubio's
economic themes resonated well with voters. Among the 62 percent of poll respondents who said the country was on the wrong track, 7 in 10 supported him. Mr. Rubio was also a favorite of the Tea Party, and received more than four of every five votes cast by the roughly 40 percent of voters who said they were Tea Party supporters. But Mr. Rubio
also did much better than his opponents among the 6 in 10 respondents who said
the Tea Party was not a factor in their vote. The exit surveys also showed that Mr Rubio ran well among most demographic groups, including wealthy voters men and Hispanics.
In a contest that was much closer and not settled until Wednesday morning Rick Scott, a Republican, was elected governor over his Democratic opponent, Alex Sink.The race between Mr. Scott, a health care executive, and Ms. Sink, the state's chief financial officer and a former bank executive, was marked by attacks on character by both sides. The negative campaigning had an impact, according to exit polls: among each candidate's supporters, roughly 20 percent said they voted for their candidate because they disliked the other. The attacks appeared to do more damage to Mr. Scott with just under half of those who voted for him saying they did so with reservations, according to the exit surveys. But Mr. Scott got more support from whites, especially white men. Wealthier voters also tended to choose Mr. Scott while Ms. Sink drew support from younger voters. Republicans picked up four Houseseats.
GEORGIA
Nathan Deal, a conservative nine-term Republican congressman, survived a bruising governor's race, claiming victory over Roy Barnes, a former Democratic governor who was trying to make a political comeback. The candidates' initial focus on economic policies soon gave way to personal attacks. The negative campaigning, and the presence of a third candidate, John Monds of the Libertarian Party, had led to speculation that neither major-party candidate would get more than half of the vote, forcing a runoff.
But Mr. Deal tallied above 50 percent. Senator Johnny Isakson, a Republican, scored an easy victory over his Democratic challenger, Mike Thurmond, the state labor commissioner. Republicans picked up one House seat, giving them an 8-to-5 edge in the
state. In the Eighth Congressional District, surrounding Macon in central Georgia, Austin Scott, a Republican state representative, ousted Representative Jim Marshall, one of the most conservative Democrats in the House.
KENTUCKY
In Kentucky, a majority of voters want the federal government to get out of the everyday lives of its citizens and let the private sector create jobs and provide health care to workers, and it elected Rand Paul, a political neophyte, to take its message to Washington. Mr. Paul defeated Jack Conway, the Democratic state attorney general. Mr. Paul ran as a Republican, but he made it clear that his allegiance was to the Tea Party.
In exit polls done by Edison Research, 6 of 10 voters said the economy was their biggest concern (Kentucky's unemployment rate is above 10 percent), followed distantly by health care, the war in Afghanistan and illegal immigration.
The Republicans who hold four of Kentucky's six House seats easily won re-election.
John Yarmuth, a two-term Democrat, easily retained his seat. Ben Chandler, a three-term Democrat who ended the night with a 600-vote advantage over Andy Barr, could face a second canvassing of the votes, in which state election officials would double-check voting machines and absentee ballots.
LOUISIANA
Widespread disenchantment with President Obama and his policies helped ensure a second term for Senator David Vitter, a Republican who was apparently forgiven by many voters for his involvement with a Washington prostitution ring. Mr. Vitter easily defeated Representative Charlie Melancon, a conservative Blue Dog Democrat.
In a caustic television advertisement for Mr. Melancon, the narrator said:
''Our tax dollars pay David Vitter's salary, and he used it for prostitutes. Our money paid for Vitter's 'serious sin.' ''Mr. Vitter acknowledged ''a very seri-ous sin'' after his telephone number hadshown up in logs of a prostitution ring in2007. In New Orleans, State Representative Cedric Richmond, a Democrat, won the Second District seat held by Representative Anh Cao, a freshman Republican. In the Third District, Jeff Landry, a Republican endorsed by the Tea Party of Louisiana, easily defeated Ravi Sangisetty, a conservative Democrat.
MISSISSIPPI
Perhaps it was an anomaly that three of Mississippi's four House seats were held by Democrats, because voters ousted two of them, Representatives Gene Taylor and Travis W. Childers, and replaced them with Republicans. Mr. Taylor had represented the
Fourth District, which encompasses the Gulf Coast and Hattiesburg, since 1989. He was a well-liked, anti-abortion, pro-gun, fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrat who voted against the healthcare law and the stimulus package. ''His politics fit down here pretty well,'' said Allan McBride, chairman of the political science department at the University of Southern Mississippi. Mr. Taylor's opponent, State Representative Steven Palazzo, seemed to catch him flat-footed, Mr. McBride added. ''The guy who ran against him was not well known,'' he said, ''and I think Taylor probably just figured he was going to be O.K. He didn't take him seriously.'' Mr. Childers, another conservative Democrat who had been in office since 2008, lost to State Senator Alan Nunnelee.
NORTH CAROLINA
Only one incumbent running for federal office fell in North Carolina on Tuesday night -- and even that may change. Bob Etheridge, a Democrat and seven-term member of the House of Representatives, was outpolled by his Republican opponent, Renee Ellmers, but he has asked for a recount because only about 2,000 votes separate them. Republicans had gone after four House seats held by Democrats who were considered vulnerable, using conservative-leaning outside groups pumping millions into the races, but Mr. Etheridge was not considered the most vulnerable of them. The other three --Heath Shuler, Larry Kissell and Mike McIntyre -- easily won re-election. The success of the state's Democratic House members in fending off Republican challenges, however, did not extend to the statehouse, which will be under Republican control for the first time
in 112 years. Another Republican, Senator Richard M. Burr, broke what he called a ''curse'' by winning re-election to a seat that has not had a two-term member since 1967.
OKLAHOMA
Oklahomans elected their first female governor, Representative Mary Fallin, a conservative Republican who opposed President Obama's health care over- haul while in Congress and has supported Arizona's tough immigration law. Ms. Fallin easily defeated Lt. Gov. Jari Askins, a Democrat. It was the first campaign for Oklahoma governor that was dominated by women. Ms. Fallin, who has cultivated ties to Oklahoma's aerospace industry, campaigned on making the state more friendly to business and reducing the size of state government. She vowed to get to work immediately on plugging Oklahoma's projected $1 billion deficit. Gov. Brad Henry, a Democrat who has served two four-year terms, is stepping down because of term limits. In Senate race, the incumbent Republican, Tom Coburn, easily defeated Jim Rogers, his Democratic challenger. Voters also approved a referendum that amends Oklahoma's Constitution to prohibit ''forced participation in healthcare systems,'' and another that prohibits state courts from considering international law or Islamic Shariah law when deciding cases.
SOUTH CAROLINA
South Carolina's transformation into a solidly Republican state began as the Democrats embraced civil rights as an issue in the 1960s. But never before has the face of the Republican Party in the state been as diverse as it became on Tuesday, when voters elected a black man to Congress and an Indian-American woman as governor. Tim Scott will be the first black Republican to represent South Carolina in Congress in more than a century. Nikki Haley will be the state's first governor who is not a white man. Mr. Scott and Ms. Haley are state representatives schooled in the type of fiscally conservative policies that have fueled the Tea Party movement and also lured centrist Democrats across party lines. They are young -- he is 45 and she is 38. Party aside, their profiles resemble the type of voter who catapulted Barack Obama into the White House, and the type of candidate that is more often associated with the Democratic Party. ''We are essentially a one-party state,'' said Kendra B. Stewart, a professor of political science at the College of Charleston. ''What's changing here is that this one party is looking more and more like the different people it represents.''
The midterm election results affirmed Republican rule in South Carolina. All but one candidate elected (or re-elected) on Tuesday -- including the agriculture commissioner, the lieutenant governor and a United States senator, Jim DeMint -- are Republican. The Democrats lost a House seat they had held for 28 years, when J. Michael Mulvaney, a Republican state legislator, defeated Representative John Spratt in a district that has become more conservative over time.
TENNESSEE
On the campaign trail in the Eighth Congressional District, in Tennessee's northwest corner, Roy Herron often described himself as a ''truck-driving,
shotgun-shooting, Bible-reading'' country boy. In the Fourth Congressional District, Lincoln Davis, a four-term in cumbent, spoke of endorsements from the National Rifle Association and the National Right to Life. Mr. Herron and Mr. Davis had many credentials that seemed appropriate to represent largely rural, mostly conservative areas. But on Tuesday, they lost to less experienced opponents. What went wrong? Both are Democrats. Republicans gained control of theTennessee Legislature and the governor's office for the first time since Reconstruction, and attained a majority in the state's Congressional delegation for the first time since 2002. The results underscore a decided political shift in a state where conservative credentials are measured not by stance on moral issues, but by degree of fiscal constraint. ''The Republicans turned this election
into a referendum on the state of the economy,'' said Bruce Oppenheimer, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
The strategy worked, even in once solidly Democratic areas like the Sixth
Congressional District, in central Tennessee. It will be represented by a Republican, Diane Black, for the first time since well before the Civil War.
TEXAS
How broad was the Republican victory in the Lone Star State? The Houston Chronicle put it this way: ''In Texas, D meant defeat.'' At the top of the ticket, Gov. Rick Perry won his third full term and continued a 25-year streak of electoral success that potentially puts him in position for a run for national office. While he defeated Bill White, a former Houston mayor, his hardest attacks were aimed at President Obama and Washington -- themes he will continue promoting in the tour for his new book, ''Fed Up! Our
Fight to Save America From Washington.''
''A lot of this is a dry run for a presidential campaign,'' said Paul Burka, the
senior executive editor at Texas Monthly magazine. Mr. Perry portrayed him-self as ''Sir Galahad of Texas,'' Mr. Burka said, working with the state's attorney general, Greg Abbott, to sue the federal government over issues like the health care law and regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency. In House races, two Democratic-held seats went to Republicans. Representative Chet Edwards, a 20-year veteran, lost to a Republican newcomer, Bill Flores, and Representative Ciro D. Rodriguez lost
Francisco Canseco. In South Texas, Blake Farenthold, a Republican, declared victory over Representative Solomon P. Ortiz, who has been in office since 1983; Mr. Ortiz has
not conceded. With 21 Democratic-held seats in the State House lost to Republican challengers, The Texas Tribune said the election could ''only be described as abloodbath'' that will greatly increase the Republican majority in the Legislature. Even in local races, longtime strong-holds of the Democratic Party like Galveston County were swept by Republican victories.
VIRGINIA
Virginia's Democratic Congressional candidates tried a range of strategies to keep their seats as voters who supported Barack Obama in 2008 repudiated
him this year. Representative Tom Perriello's plan in the Fifth Congressional District, which includes Charlottesville, was to stand by Mr. Obama's policies -- and the president returned the favor by campaigning for Mr. Perriello. It did not work. Robert Hurt, a Republican state senator, defeated Mr. Perriello. In the Second Congressional District, in southeast Virginia, the Democratic representative, Glenn Nye, ran against
Mr. Obama, even voting against the health care overhaul. That did not work either. Mr. Nye's Republican opponent, Scott Rigell, won by portraying Mr. Nye as a party-line Democrat.''Nye got swept away by the Republican wave,'' said Robert Dudley, a professor at George Mason University. Democrats lost to Republicans in 8 of
the state's 11 Congressional districts.The race in the 11th District, in Virginia's northern suburbs, remained undecided on Wednesday.

NortheastNotable Defeats: Paladino, O'Donnell andMcMahon.But Republicans Rise in Pennsylvania. And Lincoln Chafee Returns.
CONNECTICUT
Connecticut voters defied the national trend by electing Democratic candidates in several close races. AttorneyGeneral Richard Blumenthal defeatedhis Republican opponent, Linda E. McMahon, in a hard-fought and often vitriolic race that was the most expensiveSenate contest in the nation. Two Democrats in tight Congressional races heldonto their seats.The race for governor was too close tocall on Wednesday, with the Connecticutsecretary of state declaring that DanneP. Malloy, the Democrat, had won, eventhough some vote counts showed MrMalloy trailing because some votesfrom New Haven were missing. The Republican candidate, Thomas C. Foleyrefused to concede.Scott McLean, a political science professor at Quinnipiac University, saidDemocrats, particularly Mr. Blumenthal, benefited from well-timed visits byPresident Obama, Michelle Obama andformer President Bill Clinton, which energized the party's faithful. Mr. Malloya former seven-term mayor of Stamford, is trying to become the first Democrat to win the governorship since 1986Mr. Foley, a prominent Republicanfund-raiser and the former ambassadorto Ireland, used his own money to outspend Mr. Malloy by almost two to oneThe incumbent, M. Jodi Rell, a Republican, is retiring. In the Senate race, Mr. Blumenthawas forced to fend off a challenge byMs. McMahon, a former World Wrestling Entertainment executive whospent tens of millions of dollars of herown money on the race.
DELAWARE 
''Be encouraged -- we have won!''Christine O'Donnell shouted to support-ers in an upbeat concession speech onTuesday night.Not quite. In fact, Ms. O'Donnell wasone of relatively few Republican candidates to be decidedly beaten in the mid-term elections. Still, she insisted, ''Ourvoices were heard.'' Why did ChrisCoons, the New Castle County execu-tive, win when so many Democrats lost? Ms. O'Donnell, like Glen Urquhart,the Republican with Tea Party supportwho lost the House race to John C. Car-ney Jr., lacked crucial support in thenorthern part of the state, said David C.Wilson, an assistant professor of politi-cal science at the University of Dela-ware. The state has just three counties,and one of them, New Castle, in thenorth, is the most populous and is heav-ily Democratic. So even though Ms.O'Donnell won the primary against amainstream Republican, Michael N.Castle, when it came to the general elec-tion, positions that won points with theTea Party movement -- along with Ms.O'Donnell's propensity for seeminglybizarre statements -- cost her wide-spread support in a county where themiddle still matters. ''In order for theRepublicans to make inroads in theelectorate, they have to win that coun-ty,'' Professor Wilson said.Surveys of voters at polling sites onTuesday suggested that Sarah Palin'senthusiastic support for Ms. O'Donnellmight have hurt more than it helped: 45percent of the state's voters expressedopposition to the Tea Party, and nearlytwo-thirds held an unfavorable impres-sion of Ms. Palin.Delaware's voters are also noticeablyless angry than those in other states.Sixty-three percent of those in the sur-vey said they had a favorable view ofVice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.,whose seat Mr. Coons will fill, and near-ly 60 percent said they approved of thejob that President Obama is doing.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
There was no nail-biting on Tuesdayfor Vincent C. Gray. It has been clearthat barring some catastrophe, hewould be the next mayor after he de-feated the incumbent, Adrian M. Fenty,in the Democratic primary in Septem-ber. Another Democrat, Eleanor HolmesNorton, was elected for an 11th term asWashington's nonvoting delegate in theHouse of Representatives. Ms. Nortontold The Washington Post that the Sen-ate would have to be the backstop if theRepublican-controlled House interferedwith local decisions on issues like same-sex marriage and medical marijuana.Though Ms. Norton predicted that Dis-trict of Columbia business would become entangled in more floor debates,she said, ''I do not sit in fear of Repub-licans because I have been there before.''
MAINE
Paul LePage, a conservative Repub-lican and favorite of Tea Party activists,won the governorship in a three-wayrace whose outcome was uncertain untilWednesday morning.Mr. LePage, the mayor of Watervillewho said during the campaign that hewould not be afraid to tell PresidentObama to ''go to hell'' over his policies,had held a slight lead over Eliot Cutler,an independent, throughout the night,before Mr. Cutler finally conceded. Theonly clear loser Tuesday night had beenLibby Mitchell, the Democratic candi-date, who trailed badly.In the House, the state's two Demo-cratic incumbents, RepresentativesChellie Pingree and Mike Michaud, willbe going back to Washington.
MARYLAND
The Republican wave barely touchedthis increasingly Democratic state,where voters re-elected a Democraticsenator and governor. The party's onlymajor gain was in recapturing a histori-cally Republican House seat that itbarely lost two years ago, with StateSenator Andy Harris defeating Repre-sentative Frank Kratovil Jr., who beathim in 2008.Democrats won six of the state's eightHouse seats.In another rematch, Gov. MartinO'Malley defeated Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.,the Republican he ousted in 2006. AndSenator Barbara A. Mikulski won asweeping victory over Eric Wargotz togain a fifth term. In January, she will be-come the longest-serving woman in thehistory of the Senate.
MASSACHUSETTS
For Republicans hoping for a victorylike Scott Brown's in a special Senateelection early this year, Tuesday's re-sults served as a sobering reminderthat Democrats still have the advantagein Massachusetts. Gov. Deval Patrick held off his Repub-lican challenger, Charles D. Baker Jr.,and Democrats retained an open Houseseat in the 10th Congressional District.''The state is simply overwhelminglyDemocratic, and any Republican swimsupstream,'' said Jeffrey Berry, a politi-cal science professor at Tufts Universi-ty.In the 10th Congressional District,Bill Keating, a Democrat and the Nor-folk County district attorney, defeatedJeff Perry, a Republican state repre-sentative and former police sergeant.The Democratic incumbent, Bill Dela-hunt, is retiring after seven terms.Republicans had hoped to gainground in Massachusetts after Mr.Brown won the Senate seat long held byEdward M. Kennedy. (Martha Coakley,the Democrat who lost to Mr. Brown,was re-elected state attorney general onTuesday.) But Mr. Berry said voters inmany low-income, heavily Democraticareas turned out in far greater numbersthan they had in the special election.
NEW HAMPSHIRE
No state swung more sharply towardthe Democrats in the last few cycles,and few swung harder in the Repub-licans' direction on Tuesday. Voterselected a new Republican senator, andRepublicans captured both of the state'sHouse seats and nearly unseated a pop-ular Democratic governor. The questionis whether this is a temporary turn forwhat has become a swing state, or amore lasting reversion to its historic Re-publican dominance.In the race to succeed the retiringSenator Judd Gregg, Kelly Ayotte, theformer attorney general, swamped PaulHodes. Despite high approval ratings, Gov.John Lynch barely won a fourth two-year term against John Stephen, a Re-publican business consultant and for-mer state official. Representative CarolShea-Porter, the Democratic incum-bent, lost decisively to Frank Guinta,the former mayor of Manchester. Re-publicans also won big majorities inboth houses of the legislature, fouryears after Democrats did the same.
NEW JERSEY
Gov. Chris Christie, the Republicanwhose tight fiscal rein has made him arising star on the national politicalstage, stumped for local candidates,particularly Jon Runyan, a former Phil-adelphia Eagles linebacker who was theonly challenger to oust an incumbent inNew Jersey's 13 Congressional races. But the governor also devoted a lot oftime to campaigning outside New Jer-sey for Republican fiscal conservativesfrom some of the country's most populous states, which play prominently innational politics. ''Chris Christie sawthis as an opportunity to network,'' saidBrigid Callahan Harrison, a political sci-ence professor at Montclair State Uni-versity, ''to increase his name recogni-tion in other parts of the country and toput some favors in his corner.''At home, the Republican electionrecord was mixed, though a lot had todo with the structure of the state's Con-gressional districts, which are designedto protect incumbents. Mr. Runyan's victory was somewhatexpected in the Third District, a seatthat Republicans had held for more thana century but that fell to a Democrat,John Adler, in 2008.
NEW YORK
At first glance, it would be easy toconclude that the national shift towardRepublicans barely touched New York.Democrats swept the statewide offices,winning the governorship and both Sen-ate seats by very large margins, andthey took at least 21 of the state's 29House seats.But in fact, Republicans took fiveCongressional districts away from theDemocrats, tying New York with Ohiofor the biggest shift in House seats. Allof the New York districts that switchedwere traditionally Republican districtsthat Democrats had captured over thelast four years.Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney gen-eral, won the race for governor by oneof the widest margins in history, carry-ing every region except western NewYork, the base of his Republican oppo-nent, Carl P. Paladino, a businessman.Both candidates campaigned as reform-ers who could tackle Albany's dysfunc-tion and profligate spending, but Mr.Paladino's prospects faded badly as hismissteps and erratic behavior mounted.Most voters described the weak econ-omy as the top issue, but there was asharp partisan divide, according to exitpolls conducted by Edison Research.Paladino voters were almost twice aslikely as Cuomo voters to say that theywere very worried about the economy.Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Demo-crat, won a third term by a two-to-oneratio over a little-known challenger, JayTownsend, a businessman, and in theother Senate race, Kirsten E. Gillibrand,the Democratic incumbent, easily beatJoseph DioGuardi, a former congress-man. Democrats will continue to holdevery statewide office, as they have forthe last four years.In House races, Republicans madetheir most widely expected gain inwestern New York, where ThomasReed won the seat vacated by Eric Mas-sa. The most surprising switch came ina district covering Staten Island andpart of Brooklyn, where RepresentativeMichael E. McMahon, a Democrat, lostto Mike Grimm.Democrats continued to dominate theState Assembly, but control of the StateSenate remained balanced on a knife'sedge. As of Wednesday afternoon, Re-publicans had won 30 seats and Demo-crats 29, with three still too close to call.If the Senate is tied, 31-to-31, Democratswill retain control, with the new lieuten-ant governor, Robert J. Duffy, breaking the tie. Senate control could be essential todirecting the redrawing of legislativedistricts based on this year's census, aprocess in which New York is expectedto lose two House seats.
PENNSYLVANIA
Pennsylvania has been a blue state.Registered Democrats far outnumberRepublicans, and it voted Democratic inthe last five presidential elections. ButPennsylvania turned red on Tuesday.Republicans won the governorship,picked up a seat in the Senate, gainedfive seats in the House, and took controlof both chambers of the Legislature.''It was just a sweeping Republicanvictory,'' said Rogers Smith, a politicalscientist at the University of Pennsylva-nia.In the governor's race, Tom Corbett, aRepublican attorney general who cam-paigned as a government reformer on abroad investigation he led into legisla-tive corruption, defeated Dan Onorato,the Democratic executive of AlleghenyCounty. Gov. Edward G. Rendell, aDemocrat, is leaving office because ofterm limits.In the Senate race, the Republican,Pat Toomey, a former congressman andimmediate past president of the pro-business Club for Growth, defeatedRepresentative Joe Sestak, a Democratwho had championed President Oba-ma's economic stimulus and health carepolicies.Mr. Sestak, a former Navy admiral,began his political career in 2006 by de-feating a 10-term Republican in Phila-delphia's Delaware County suburbs.Patrick Meehan, a former United Statesattorney, reclaimed that seat for Repub-licans, defeating Democratic State Rep-resentative Bryan Lentz.
RHODE ISLAND
Rhode Island elected its first inde-pendent governor, Lincoln D. Chafee,who won despite a late surge for the Re-publican candidate, John Robitaille. Economic issues dominated the cam-paign in a three-way race, with the can-didates differing on whether new taxes,or tax cuts, would help most. But a non-endorsement by President Obama latelast month played an important role inshaping the outcome of the race.Mr. Obama withheld his support fromthe Democratic candidate, Frank T. Ca-prio as a favor to Mr. Chafee, who hadendorsed him in 2008. Mr. Caprio an-nounced that the president could ''takehis endorsement and really shove it.''The remark, in a state where Mr. Oba-ma's popularity is still relatively high,led to a drop in Mr. Caprio's support.The main beneficiary was Mr. Robi-taille, an aide to Gov. Donald L. Carcieri,who could not run again because ofterm limits. Democrats held onto both of thestate's House seats. The smallest state in the union re-tained its full name, the longest in theunion. Voters soundly rejected anamendment to the state constitutionthat would have shortened the name to''State of Rhode Island'' from ''State ofRhode Island and Providence Planta-tions.''
VERMONT
Vermont voters went to bed Tuesdaynight without knowing whether theyhad elected a Republican or Democratfor governor, the only opportunity forsuspense in this reliably left-leaningstate. By midday on Wednesday, the voteshad finally been counted, and Lt. Gov.Brian Dubie, the Republican candidate,conceded the race to his Democratic op-ponent, Peter Shumlin, the president ofthe State Senate. Mr. Shumlin, who was helped by last-minute campaign visits from Vice Presi-dent Joseph R. Biden Jr., won by a ra-zor-thin margin. It was one of the raregains for Democrats across the coun-try: the seat had been vacated by a pop-ular Republican governor, Jim Douglas. But it was typical for Vermont, wherethe governorship has alternated be-tween Republicans and Democrats fornearly 50 years. In the Senate race, Patrick J. Leahy,an incumbent Democrat, easily defeat-ed Len Britton, a Republican.
WEST VIRGINIA
Gov. Joe Manchin III, a Democrat,won by a surprisingly large margin inthe contest for the Senate seat that washeld for more than half a century byRobert C. Byrd, who died this year. Mr. Manchin's race against a wealthybusinessman, John Raese, was billed asa nail-biter, but he clearly knew the vot-ers in his state and adopted just enoughof the Republican Party's platform tosatisfy them.Mr. Manchin is likely to vex his ownparty in the Senate as much as the op-position does. He is in favor of dis-mantling parts of the health care lawand has no interest in passing cap-and-trade energy legislation, which is thebane of his state's coal industry. Be-cause he is serving out Mr. Byrd's term,he will join the Senate immediately andwill have to run again in 2012.Republicans had hoped to pick up twoof West Virginia's three seats in theHouse. But Nick J. Rahall II, who hasrepresented the state's Third Congres-sional District for more than 30 years,fought off a well-financed challenge byElliott E. Maynard, a Republican andstate supreme court judge.

ALASKA
The fiercest political battles in Alaska in recent years have not been across party lines but rather within the Republican Party. This election was no different. As ballots were still being counted on Wednesday, the Republican incumbent, Lisa Murkowski, who asked voters to write in her name, appeared to be leading the official Republican candidate and Tea Party favorite, Joe Miller, who defeated her in the primary. Alaska election officials said that they would begin counting write-in ballots next Tuesday and they expect the counting to take three days. A victory by Ms. Murkowski would be a stunning upset, as no senator has won a write-in campaign since 1954. It would also represent a significant setback for Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor who backed Mr. Miller. His conservative stance on issues like the budget deficit worried many Alaskans, whose economy is highly dependent on federal spending. Two other Republican incumbents, Gov. Sean Parnell and Representative Don Young, the state's sole House member, were re-elected by wide margins. 
This Republican-leaning state reverted to type on Tuesday, giving convincing victories to Gov. Jan Brewer and Senator John McCain, and reversing most of the gains Democrats had made in recent years. After losing three of Arizona's House seats in the last two cycles, Republicans took back two of them, and will hold a least five of eight in the new Congress The race for an open Republican sea was won by Ben Quayle, the son of former Vice President Dan Quayle. In the last two elections for governor Arizona had chosen a Democrat, Jane Napolitano, and in the current Congress it had a majority Democratic House delegation for the first time since the 1960s But in a sign of what kind of year this was, the greatest concern for both Mr McCain and Ms. Brewer was not winning over independents, but placating conservatives. After Ms. Brewer signed a strict anti immigration bill and joined in a lawsuit against the federal health care over haul, conservatives flocked back to her and her popularity soared. Mr. McCain drew fire from conservatives over his efforts to compromise with Democrats on climate change and immigration legislation. He moved to his right and survived a primary challenge from a
more conservative Republican, and on Tuesday easily dispensed with his Democratic opponent, Rodney Glassman. Arizonans approved a state constitutional amendment intended to under mine the new federal health care law and approved an initiative requiring secret-ballot elections for workers to unionize, which organized labor had vehemently opposed. On a measure to legalize the use of marijuana to treat certain medical conditions, the vote was too close to call.
CALIFORNIA
The political chasm separating California and much of the rest of the nation grew wider as voters reaffirmed their preference for Democrats by electing Jerry Brown governor and re-electing Barbara Boxer to the Senate. Californians also bucked the anti-incumbent mood that swept the nation by picking the experienced politicians over two newcomers, Meg Whitman, the former chief executive of eBay, who chal lenged Mr. Brown, and Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett- Packard, who tried to unseat Ms. Boxer. The results, along with exit polls, indicated that a majority of Californians continue to support President Obama's agenda. But Ms. Whitman and Ms. Fiorina failed for different reasons. California voters were turned off by Ms. Whitman's spending of more than $140 million of her own money on a barrage of negative ads. For Ms. Fiorina, her staunchly conservative, anti-abortion, pro-oil-drilling message proved a hard
sell in a liberal state. While several Congressional races were hard fought, no House seats had changed parties as of Wednesday evening. Two races that could deliver Republicans additional seats -- in the Central Valley and in the Sacramento River delta -- remained too close to call. Voters sent mixed messages on how they want the state's financial problems resolved. They may have hamstrung state officials by approving ballot measures that prevent the legislature from closing the state budget gap by borrowing from municipalities and that make it harder for government agencies to raise certain fees. However, a majority of voters told exit pollsters that they believed higher taxes were necessary to close the state budget gap. Voters defeated Proposition 19, which would have legalized and regulated the recreational use of marijuana, and roundly rejected Proposition 23, an effort backed by oil companies to suspendthe state's law limiting greenhouse gas emissions.
COLORADO
Michael F. Bennet, the incumbent Democrat, claimed victory on Wednesday afternoon in his bid for his first full Senate term. His opponent, Kenneth R. Buck, a Republican district attorney, conceded several hours later. Exit polls showed that even when voters agreed on the major issues, they split evenly on which candidate would best address the problems. Seven in 10 respondents said the economy was the biggest issue, but Mr. Bennet and Mr. Buck divided their votes. Economic issues also played a role in
the governor's race, in which John Hickenlooper, the Democratic mayor of Denver, won easily over Tom Tancredo, a former Republican congressman, who ran on a third-party line, and Dan Maes, a Republican businessman who finished a distant third.
HAWAII
President Obama's birth state gave him a rare sweep of Democratic victories.
Neil Abercrombie, who left Congress to run for governor, defeated James R. Aiona Jr., the Republican lieutenant governor. He will succeed Gov. Linda Lingle, a Republican. Colleen Hanabusa, a Democrat and president of the State Senate, unseated Representative Charles Djou, a Republican who won the district this year in a special election.
Democrat Daniel K. Inouye, 86, won an easy re-election to a ninth term.
IDAHO
The G.O.P. swept Idaho, as Raul Labrador, a state representative from the Boise area, unseated Representative alt Minnick, a one-term Democrat ho outspent his opponent by more than four to one. Mr. Minnick, one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, had backed away from his party's agenda on economic issues and voted against the health care overhaul and the federal stimulus package. But even those positions proved insufficient to voters. Idaho voters also re-elected three Republican incumbents -- Senator Michael D. Crapo, Gov. C. L. Otter and Representative Mike Simpson-- by large margins.
MONTANA
Representative Denny Rehberg, Montana's sole congressman, easily defeated his Democratic challenger, Dennis McDonald, in this heavily Republican state. Voters also approved three ballot initiatives, including one that put a limit on interest rates for payday loans. Despite his affiliation with the ruling party in Congress, Mr. McDonald sought to capitalize on anti-incumbent sentiments this year by portraying Mr. Rehberg, who has held the seat for 10 years, as a political insider. In addition to the typical television commercials and rallies, Mr. McDonald tried to attract attention to his long-shot campaign: he often showed up at campaign events atop his horse, Rowboat, andwith a donkey, Justice, in tow.
NEVADA
To bolster her credentials in her strong conservative base, Sharron Angle, a Republican, shaped her candidacy for the Senate along a few lines of attack-- against big government, against high taxes and against illegal immigration. Her economic message resonated across party lines, but was particularly effective among independents, most of
whom voted for her over the Democratic incumbent, Senator Harry Reid, according to exit polls. Ms. Angle's approach to immigration, though, drove a wedge in the electorate, not just alienating Latino voters, but possibly pushing a lot of them to vote for Mr. Reid. Latinos accounted for 15 percent of the overall vote in Nevada, and, based on exit polls, two-thirds of Latinos cast ballots for Mr. Reid, who beat Ms. Angle by a five-point margin. From the start, Ms. Angle took a hard line on border security, running ads portraying Latinos -- though not explicitly naming them -- as menacing invaders.
She also repeatedly expressed her support of Arizona's controversial immigration law.
Mr. Reid's campaign, meanwhile, led a big push over the summer to register thousands of Latino voters. And he gained the endorsement of the state's influential hospitality and gaming unions, where half of the membership is Latino.
A recent poll by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and Brookings Mountain West, an arm of the Brookings Institution in Washington, showed that a plurality of Latinos in Nevada had a favorable view of the state's Democratic legislators. Prof. John Tuman, chairman of the University of Nevada's political science department, noted that while il- legal immigration did not resonate as a particularly salient issue for Latinos in Nevada, immigration reform did. Mr. Reid sought to capitalize on that, stress- ing his support of immigration legislation, but also promoting President Obama's economic recovery measures, particularly in the housing sector, which employs many Latinos.''When Republicans run a very negative campaign on immigration, Latinos feel targeted, threatened, and that will push them to vote for a Democrat,'' Professor Tuman said.
The state elected a Latino governor, Brian Sandoval, a Republican. Mr. Sandoval beat the incumbent, Jim Gibbons, for the party nomination and then Mr. eid's son Rory Reid, a Democrat, on Tuesday. Two incumbents -- a Republican and a Democrat -- won re-election for Congress, while a third, Dina Titus, a Democrat, lost her seat to Joe Heck, a Republican who ran with Tea Party support.
NEW MEXICO
Voters in New Mexico delivered the ame rebuke to the Democratic Party as thers around he country. Susana Martinez, a Republican who has served as istrict attorney in Las Cruces, defeated her Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov.Diane Denish, in the governor's race.
Ms. Martinez, who will be the first woman to hold the governor's office, drew support among Hispanics, who typically vote Democratic, and independents. She capitalized on the campaign finance scandal that has tarnished the current governor, Bill Richardson, and in turn the Democratic Party. Ms. Martinez's biggest challenge will be closing a budget deficit estimated at more than $250 million. She has said she plans to make spending cuts of up to $500 million but has not yet clearly detailed what those might be.
Two of the three Democrats who rode President Obama's coattails into the House in 2008 managed to hang on to their seats, spoiling Republican hopes of a rout.
OREGON
Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat and an expert on health policy who likes to work with Republicans when possible, easily won re-election, defeating his Republican challenger, Jim Huffman, a law school professor. In the governor's race, the Republican, Chris Dudley, conceded to the Democratic nominee, John Kitzhaber, on Wednesday night. Mr. Kitzhaber, a former emergency room physician, had trailed early, but votes in Multnomah County (Portland) gave him the lead over Mr. Dudley, a former professional basketball player. During the campaign, Mr. Kitzhaber, who was governor from 1995 to 2003, said Mr. Dudley had ''no meaningful experience'' and no record of public service.
Mr. Dudley, a wealth management adviser, had said he would reignite job growth by cutting the state's capital gains tax and creating a business- friendly climate. All five House members from Oregon, four Democrats and one Republican, were re-elected.
UTAH
Utah was already largely Republican, but the midterm elections showed that it has shifted even further to the right. In the Senate race, the Republican State Convention tossed out Robert F. Bennett after 18 years in office, and put two candidates with values aligned with the Tea Party movement in the primary. The winner of that contest, Mike Lee, a 39-year-old former clerk for Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. of the Supreme Court, defeated the Democratic candidate, Sam Granato, with promises to pass a balanced-budget amendment and repeal the health care overhaul. The governor's race pitted the Republican incumbent, Gary R. Herbert, against Peter Corroon, a Democrat. Mr. Herbert, who has held the governorship since last year, when Jon Huntsman Jr. was appointed ambassador to China, won after maintaining a very comfortable lead throughout the campaign. In the state's three Congressional races, the sole Democratic incumbent, Jim Matheson, defeated the Republican challenger, Morgan Philpot.
WASHINGTON
A vast majority of the ballots are cast by mail in Washington and were still being counted on Wednesday, but Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat, held a thin edge over Dino Rossi, a Republican former state senator who twice lost bids to become governor. Exit polls showed that Ms. Murray was weaker with almost all demographic groups than in her previous re-election race. Only a slender majority of voters said they supported President Obama's job performance. Voters who identified themselves as moderates supported Ms. Murray. Mr. Rossi had attempted to paint Ms. Murray, who has a long record of securing federal money for state projects, as a spendthrift liberal.Ms. Murray defended her record and countered that Mr. Rossi would bankrupt America by giving tax breaks to the rich.
Mr. Rossi was not able to capitalize on strong opposition to a ballot measure that would have imposed a state income tax in Washington. The measure, which was supportedmost famously by the father of Bill Gates, would have imposed the tax on the wealthiest 2 percent and would have reduced property taxes for everyone. But it was defeated, as middle-class voters feared that over time, the income tax would be imposed on a greater part of the population. Republicans picked up one Congressional seat in the southern part of the state.
WYOMING
Wyoming did its native son, former Vice President Dick Cheney, proud on Tuesday night as voters pushed the already conservative state even further to the right. The governor elect, Matt Mead, a Republican who served as a United States attorney during the administration of President George W. Bush, has promised to add Wyoming to the list of states suing the federal government over the constitutionality of the new health care
law. He is firmly opposed to same-sex marriage and approves of abortion only under limited circumstances. Unlike most other states, Wyoming is anticipating increased revenue, and one of Mr. Mead's first tasks will be to determine how to spend it. He has said he favors investing in infrastructure projects, but he will face some pressure
to set aside reserves. Representative Cynthia M. Lummis, a Republican and Wyoming's only House member, easily overcame her Democratic challenger, who lacked the money to buy any television advertising.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 8, 2010

 CORRECTION:
A report about Wyoming in the State by State election roundup on Thursday misstated the birthplace of Dick Cheney, the former vice president. He was born in Nebraska; he is not a ''native son'' of Wyoming, though his family moved there when he was young.

ILLINOIS
The Democratic wave that washed across Illinois two years ago receded on Tuesday, with voters narrowly electing a Republican to the Senate seat vacated by President Obama and at least three Republicans to House seats currently held by Democrats. The race for governor was still too close to call, with the Democratic incumbent, Patrick J. Quinn, holding a slim lead over Bill Brady, a Republican state senator from downstate. The outcome was also undecided in the Eighth Congressional District race, where Republican Joe Walsh held a narrow edge over the Democratic incumbent, Melissa Bean.
The Senate race held symbolic meaning for both parties because it was for Mr. Obama's former seat. Mark Steven Kirk, a five-term Republican congressman, held a significant fund-raising advantage over Alexi Giannoulias, the Democratic state treasurer. Senator Roland W. Burris, a Democrat who was appointed to the post temporarily, did not
run. Republicans picked up Congressional seats in the 14th District, where the Republican, Randy Hultgren, upset the Democratic incumbent, Bill Foster; in the 17th, where Representative Phil Hare lost to the Republican, Bobby Schilling; and in the 11th, where the Republican challenger, Adam Kinzinger, unseated Representative Debbie Halvorson. All three Democrats were relative newcomers and that made them vulnerable to anti-incumbent sentiments, said Dick Simpson, head of the political science department at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
INDIANA
Indiana was a surprise victory for Barack Obama in 2008, and this year Republicans set their sights on bringing the conservative-leaning state solidly back into the red column. They succeeded in part, winning the Senate seat being vacated by Evan Bayh, a Democrat. Daniel R. Coats, a former senator who has worked as a Washington lobbyist for the last several years, defeated Representative Brad Ellsworth, a Democrat and former sheriff from Vanderburgh County in the southwest part of the state. Republicans also took two Houseseats from Democrats, including the one in the Ninth Congressional District,where Representative Baron P. Hill was ousted by Todd Young, a lawyer. Representative Joe Donnelly, a two- term fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrat, barely survived a challenge by Jackie Walorski, a Republican with ties to the Tea Party.
That left Democrats with control of three of Indiana's eight Congressional districts, including the First, in the northwest corner of the state, and the Seventh, which encompasses Indianapolis.
IOWA
Terry E. Branstad, a Republican former governor, capped a yearlong campaign to regain the office by defeating Gov. Chet Culver, a Democrat. And Senator Charles E. Grassley, a Republican who has served for nearly 30 years, cruised to victory over his Democratic opponent, Roxanne Conlin, a former United States attorney. Mr. Culver, the son of a former United States senator, John C. Culver, said hehad steered the state through the worst flood in its history and through a worldwide recession without raising taxes. But given the state's economic difficulties, he had an uphill struggle in his bid for a second term. Mr. Branstad, who served four terms as governor, from 1983 to 1999, won a fifth term by promising a smaller, more efficient state government. He said his record showed that he would be more effective in creating jobs and attracting business investment. In the Senate race, Ms. Conlin portrayed Mr. Grassley as a career politician, but the label did not stick. Mr.Grassley, a reliable Republican vote on economic issues, has built a reputation as a scourge of wasteful federal spending under presidents of both parties.All five House members from Iowa, three Democrats and two Republicans,
were re-elected.
KANSAS
Kansas sent Sam Brownback to Washington 16 years ago, first as a congressman and then as a senator. Now he will be coming home. On Tuesday Mr. Brownback blew past his Democratic opponent, Tom Holland, to win the race for governor. The Senate seat that Mr. Brownback leaves behind did not change parties. Representative Jerry Moran used advantages in name recognition and fundraising to defeat his Democratic opponent, Lisa Johnston, a college administrator. In the House races, Republicans won all four seats. In one of the toughest fights, Stephene Moore -- the wife of Representative Dennis Moore, who did not seek re-election -- unsuccessfully tried to hold the seat against Kevin Yoder, a Republican state representative. Several top state offices also went to
Republicans, including secretary of state, which was won by Kris Kobach, a conservative law professor who helped draft Arizona's immigration law and other measures around the country. Mr Kobach has said he will propose similarly tough measures for Kansas.
MICHIGAN
Rick Snyder, a moderate Republican and former chief executive of the Gateway computer company, sailed to victory in the race for governor, defeating Virg Bernero, the mayor of Lansing.Though he had no government experience, Mr. Snyder described himself as a ''tough nerd'' who would use his business skills to revitalize the economy.
Mr. Snyder talked more about jobs than divisive social issues in the race to succeed Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm, a Democrat. Representative John D. Dingell, a Democrat who is the longest-serving member of the House, won a 29th term. In the First District, which includes the Upper Peninsula, Dan Benishek, a Republican favorite of Tea Party supporters, defeated Gary McDowell, a Democratic state representative. Mr. Benishek, a surgeon, will take the seat held for 18 years by Representative Bart Stupak, a Democrat who is retiring. In the Seventh District, which includes Battle Creek, Tim Walberg, a
conservative Republican, took back the seat he lost in 2008 to Mark Schauer, a
moderate Democrat. In the Ninth District, which includes Detroit suburbs, Representative Gary Peters, a freshman Democrat, held onto his seat by narrowly defeating the Republican challenger, Rocky Raczkowski.
MISSOURI
Vicky Hartzler, a Republican backed by many Tea Party members, scored a stunning victory over Representative Ike Skelton, a 17-term Democrat who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. ''I've told people all along that this district has been fed up and fired up and ready to stand up, and we did,'' Ms. Hartzler told cheering supporters on election night. Ms. Hartzler, a former state representative who was endorsed by Sarah Palin, said Mr. Skelton had lost touch with the district. She criticized him as an ally of President Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In the Senate race, Representative Roy Blunt, a Republican, defeated Robin Carnahan, a Democrat who is the Missouri secretary of state. He will succeed Senator Christopher S. Bond, a Republican retiring after four terms.
MINNESOTA
Minnesotans, who endured a seven-month recount after a deadlocked 2008 Senate election, are in for more uncertainty. The governor's race remained undecided on Wednesday, with Mark Dayton, a Democrat and former one-term senator, clinging to a narrow lead over Tom Emmer, a Republican state representative. Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a two-term Republican who is stepping down and may run for president, said he was willing to stay on the job through the duration of a recount under the terms of the State Constitution. A recount appeared likely to be automatically triggered because Mr. Dayton's 9,000-vote lead was less than half of 1 percent of the 2.1 million
votes cast. Mr. Dayton's showing was one of the few bright spots for Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer Labor Party. For the first time in 38 years, Republicans captured control of the State Senate, and they also took back the Minnesota House, said Kathyrn Ellison, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota. Republicans scored another surprising victory in the northeastern Congressional district that includes the Iron Range. A political newcomer, Chip Cravaack, defeated Representative James L. Oberstar, an 18-term Democrat and chairman of the House Transportation Committee. An issue frequently debated in the governor's race was what to do about Minnesota's projected $6 billion deficit. Mr. Dayton said he would raise taxes on the wealthy, while Mr. Emmer pledged to cut government spending.
NEBRASKA
A heavily Republican state with Republican incumbents made for minimal
drama in Nebraska. Gov. Dave Heineman barely broke a sweat in winning a second term, overwhelming Mike Meister, a Democratic lawyer, by a 3-to-1 margin. In fact, Republicans easily won all the statewide races. The main question raised by the results is whether they signal danger for Senator Ben Nelson, the only Democrat to hold statewide office, who faces re-election in 2012. There has been speculation that Mr. Nelson, who has bucked his party's leaders on many issues, might become a Republican.
NORTH DAKOTA
The political landscape in North Dakota shifted overnight as voters elected Republicans to a House and a Senate seat currently held by Democrats. Republicans also made gains in the State Senate and House. In the Senate race, voters overwhelmingly chose the state's popular governor, John Hoeven, to succeed Byron L. Dorgan, a Democrat who is retiring after nearly two decades. Mr. Hoeven, whom voters credited for the state's economic success and low unemployment rate, easily defeated Tracy Potter, a Democratic state senator. The race for the state's sole Congressional seat was closer. Rick Berg, a Fargo real estate developer and longtime member of the State House, defeated Representative Earl Pomeroy, a Democrat who was seeking a 10th term. The loss came just two years after Mr. Pomeroy won re-election by 24 percentage points.
OHIO
The defeat of Gov. Ted Strickland by John Kasich, a Republican, was one of the most painful outcomes of the election for Democrats and President Obama, who campaigned repeatedly in Ohio, as did Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former President Bill Clinton.The ouster of 5 of the 10 Democrats serving in Ohio's 18-member Congressional delegation also caused Democrats plenty of heartburn. But a string of other Republican victories in the state could hurt Democrats for years to come. Republicans defeated Democrats in all major races for statewide office, putting them in control of the once-a-decade redrawing of Ohio's legislative and Congressional districts, scheduled
to begin next year. The five-member board that draws Ohio's district boundaries -- with the clout to gerrymander them to favor the party in power -- includes the governor,
the secretary of state, the state auditor and a legislator from each party. After Tuesday's vote, four of the officeholders wielding that powerful pen will be Republicans.
And there was more trouble on the horizon for Democrats. The Republican who won Ohio's race for attorney general, Mike DeWine, pledged during the campaign to join other states in suing to block Mr. Obama's health care over-
haul. Mr. DeWine defeated Richard Cordray, the populist Democratic attorney general who had successfully filed a string of lawsuits against Wall Street powerhouses, wresting some $2 billion from global financial firms and subprime lenders on behalf of Ohio taxpayers.In Ohio's Senate race, Rob Portman, a former Republican congressman and United States trade representative in the administration of President George W. Bush, defeated Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, a Democrat. The retirement of Senator George V. Voinovich, a Republican, left the seat open. Ohio has lost 400,000 jobs since Mr. Strickland won election in 2006, and the dismal economy tilted the environment in favor of Mr. Kasich and other Republicans. Mr. Kasich served in Congress from 1982 through 2000. During the past decade, he worked in an Ohio office of Lehman Brothers and also for the Fox News Channel. Both candidates made Mr. Obama an issue -- Mr. Strickland by supporting the health care overhaul and other administration policies, and Mr. Kasich by attacking them. Mr. Kasich also proposed phasing out Ohio's income tax.
SOUTH DAKOTA
Even one of the most conservative Democrats in the House could not survive the anti-incumbency mood that swept South Dakota this year. Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, a three-term incumbent and member of a powerful political family in the state, was ousted from South Dakota's lone House seat by State Representative Kristi Noem. The revelation that Ms. Noem had a lengthy record of driving violations, including 20 speeding tickets, did not seem to bother voters, who were eager for a change in Washington. Ms. Herseth Sandlin, a fiery speaker who was considered a rising star in the Democratic Party, had cruised to victory in her last two elections. Since 2008, she was careful to stay away from the Democratic Party leadership, and she voted against the health care overhaul.Voters, though, decided it was not enough.
In 2008, when Barack Obama handily won Wisconsin by 14 points, giddy Democrats declared that the historically progressive state had finally gone solidly blue. Not so fast. The Republican Party grabbed huge wins across the state on Tuesday, unseating Senator Russ Feingold, beating a Democrat for the open governorship and winning two formerly Democratic Congressional districts that cover nearly the entire northern half of the state. One of those two was the Seventh District, which had been held for 41 years by Representative David R. Obey, a Democrat who is retiring. Scott Walker, a Republican and Milwaukee County executive, was elected governor, succeeding James E. Doyle, a Democrat who opted not to run. Mr. Feingold, a liberal known for his unorthodox votes (he was the only senator to vote against the Patriot Act), was beaten by Ron Johnson, a businessman from Oshkosh who gained support almost immediately after receiving the State Republican Party's endorsement.
''The public was substantially alreadybehind Johnson before they knew any- thing about him,'' said Charles H. Franklin, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. ''It's very interesting that a guy withFeingold's record of 18 years could be beaten by such a neophyte, who himself admitted that he wasn't going to be specific about the details because he hadn't studied them very well. The answer to that is a combination of just how powerful these national forces were.''
Concerns over the economy appeared to drive the sentiment against Democrats in Wisconsin. Exit polls revealed that more than 4 in 10 voters said their family's financial situation had worsened in the last two years. And two-thirds of those voters supported Mr.Johnson. Fewer than half of the voters said they had favorable views of either the Democratic or Republican Party. (Wisconsin voters tend to favor moderate politicians, regardless of party, like Tommy Thompson, a progressive Republican who was governor from 1987 to 2001.) Mr. Franklin cautioned that Tuesday's results were no more permanently binding than those in 2008. ''They're the result of short-term forces,'' he said. ''I think we've remained pretty much a purple state.''

HEADLINE: The States' Role in Gambling Addiction

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Dr. Timothy Fong on gambling, lotteries and the role of government in gambling addiction.

 BODY:
Gambling was among the issues on local ballots in Tuesday's election. But do lotteries and other state initiatives promote gambling addiction? This was among the questions recently posed by readers of the Consults blog. Dr. Timothy Fong, co-director of the gambling studies program and an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles, responds. For more information, see Dr. Fong's earlier responses in "When Is Gambling an Addiction?" and "Seeking Help for Gambling Addiction."
Do Governments Promote Gambling Addiction?Q.I find it appalling that states spend money on advertising designed to hook people with gambling addictions. Why hasn't anyone insisted that gambling advertisements have warnings like cigarette ads? Why is it legal for the states to act like con men, alluring people with the promise of easy money?Debbie R., Brookline, Mass.A.Dr. Fong responds:
Legalized gambling is available in every state in America except Hawaii and Utah. During the last 20 years, expansion of gambling has occurred quickly and oftentimes is a direct result of the state needing to increase revenue without having to raise taxes. As a result, the pace of gambling has proceeded faster than our ability to understand its direct impact on individuals, family and society. The gambling industry understands that its product is addictive, and it has taken steps to reduce the harm. Many of these warnings are on gambling ads in the form of helplines.
State Lotteries and Gambling AddictionQ.In your opinion, do you think the state lotteries are complicit in creating addictions to gambling?M. Klein, N.Y.A.Dr. Fong responds:
State lotteries come in a variety of different formats and games. There is no scientific data that I have seen that shows that lottery play can lead directly to gambling addiction. Playing the lottery is still gambling, though, so lottery games that offer a high reward with high frequency -- for example, "scratch" games or video lottery terminals -- probably carry a higher chance of harm.Q.Many if not all states now partially fund their education systems by preying off of gamblers' addictions by means of state lotteries. These same states are reluctant to fully fund the education but spend vast amounts of money on the prison systems, whose capacity is substantially swollen by nonviolent drug offenders. The rationale of criminalization of drug use depends largely on the notion that it is addictive. So gambling indirectly funds the prison system by enabling states to transfer monies from education to incarceration. In a certain sense, the entire population is complicit, buying into the notion that drugs are evil because they are addictive, and then rationalizing the role of gambling because it "contributes" to education. Moreover, casinos are spreading nationwide, a process enabled by the same rationalization mechanism.
My questions: Shouldn't addiction be seen as the "prey" endpoint of a larger predation psycho-dynamic? Without discounting the responsibility of individuals, isn't our society as a whole responsible for this larger predation dynamic?
It seems clear that this larger dynamic spills over to our politics and our foreign relations. For example, our military as "uber-assassin" using drones, which are conveniently called "predator drones." How do we analyze and understand this spill over and its implications for our individual relationship to our country and each other?CharlieR, Somerville, Mass.A.Dr. Fong responds:
America's history with gambling has been characterized by ambivalence. There have been periods of full embrace of gambling within communities, followed by movements seeking temperance and prohibition.
Starting in the 1970s, there was a slow movement to accept gambling as a regulated pastime. As gambling expanded over the last 20 years, regulation of gambling has been an issue at the state level, meaning that there has not been a national, consistent plan to address the impact of gambling problems.
The result has been that each state has different approaches, resources and attitudes on how to deal with gambling addiction. Legalizing gambling has significantly contributed to the economy and has supported many different businesses and industries. The negative impact, though, of pathological gambling remains under-addressed in many states. It is my belief that there is a shared responsibility between the gambling industry, the government and individuals who gamble to work together to develop policies and procedures that limit harm from gambling.

HEADLINE: Midwest at Dusk

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
If Balzac were alive today, he would plant himself in that region of America that starts in central New York and Pennsylvania and then stretches out through Ohio and Indiana before spreading out to include Wisconsin and Arkansas. He'd plant himself in the working-class families in this area.
He'd do it because this is the beating center of American life -- the place where the trajectory of American politics is being determined. If America can figure out how to build a decent future for the working-class people in this region, then the U.S. will remain a predominant power. If it can't, it won't. 
It would take a Balzac to understand the perplexities and contradictions one finds in these neighborhoods. On the one hand, people are living with the daily grind of getting by on $40,000 a year, but they're also living with Xboxes and smartphones. People in these places have traditional bourgeois values, but they live amid a decaying social fabric, with high divorce rates and skyrocketing single parenthood numbers.
Many people in these neighborhoods distrust government but still look to it for help. They disdain Wall Street but admire capitalism. They are intensely patriotic but accustomed to globalization. If you talk to people on the coasts about The Sixties, they often think of Woodstock. If you ask people in this region about The Sixties, they might remember the last time there were plenty of good jobs instead.
The Midwest has lost a manufacturing empire but hasn't yet found a role. Working-class people in this region overwhelmingly backed George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 but then lost faith in the Republican Party's ability to solve their problems. By 2008, they were willing to take a flier on Barack Obama. He carried Ohio, Indiana and Iowa.
Over the past two years, these voters have watched government radically increase spending in an attempt to put people back to work. According to the Office of Management and Budget, federal spending increased from about 21 percent of G.D.P. in 2008 to nearly 26 percent of G.D.P. this year. There was an $800 billion stimulus package, along with auto bailouts aimed directly at the Midwest.
Economists are debating the effects of all this, but voters have reached a verdict. According to exit polls on Tuesday, two-thirds of the Americans who voted said that the stimulus package was either harmful to the American economy or made no difference whatsoever.
Between June and August of 2009, the working class became disillusioned with Democratic policies. Working-class voters used to move toward the Democrats in recessions; this time, they moved to the right, shifting attitudes on everything from global warming to gun control. In Tuesday's exit polls, 56 percent of voters said government does too much, while only 38 percent said it should do more.
On Tuesday, the Democrats got destroyed in this region. They lost five House seats in Pennsylvania and another five in Ohio. They lost governorships in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa. Republicans gained control of both state legislative houses in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Indiana and Minnesota.
As Ronald Brownstein of the National Journal noted, ''The stampede toward the GOP among blue collar whites was powerful almost everywhere.'' Republicans captured at least 35 seats in the U.S. House in districts where the percentage of whites with college degrees lags behind the national average. The old industry towns in the Midwest were the epicenter of the disaster.
Some Democrats believe their policies have nothing to do with the debacle. It was the unemployment rate, they say. But it was Democratic economic policies that first repelled these voters. There's been a sharp rise in the number of voters who think the Democrats are ''too liberal.'' Signature policy initiatives like health care remain gigantically unpopular. Republicans didn't score gains everywhere unemployment was high (see California, for example). But they did score gains nearly everywhere where disapproval of President Obama and his policies was high.
When the successful Democratic Senate candidate in West Virginia takes a rifle and literally blows a hole in one of your major pieces of legislation in a campaign commercial, that is a sign that the voters are unhappy with your policies, not just the economy.
Democrats have, at least temporarily, blown the opportunity they were given to connect with the industrial Midwest. Voters in this region face structural problems, not cyclical ones. Intensely suspicious of government, they are nonetheless casting about for somebody, anybody, who can revive their towns and neighborhoods. Disillusioned with big spending and big debt, they at least want to see their government reflect their values of discipline, order and responsibility. Not only in America, but also in Germany, Sweden, France, Britain and across Europe, working-class voters these days are putting center-right governments in power.
American politics are volatile because nobody has an answer for these people. They will remain volatile until somebody finds one.

HEADLINE: Still in Dorm, Because Class Is on the Web

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- Like most other undergraduates, Anish Patel likes to sleep in. Even though his Principles of Microeconomics class at 9:35 a.m. is just a five-minute stroll from his dorm, he would rather flip open his laptop in his room to watch the lecture, streamed live over the campus network.
On a recent morning, as Mr. Patel's two roommates slept with covers pulled tightly over their heads, he sat at his desk taking notes on Prof. Mark Rush's explanation of the term ''perfect competition.'' A camera zoomed in for a close-up of the blackboard, where Dr. Rush scribbled in chalk, ''lots of firms and lots of buyers.''
The curtains were drawn in the dorm room. The floor was awash in the flotsam of three freshmen -- clothes, backpacks, homework, packages of Chips Ahoy and Cap'n Crunch's Crunch Berries. 
The University of Florida broadcasts and archives Dr. Rush's lectures less for the convenience of sleepy students like Mr. Patel than for a simple principle of economics: 1,500 undergraduates are enrolled and no lecture hall could possibly hold them.
Dozens of popular courses in psychology, statistics, biology and other fields are also offered primarily online. Students on this scenic campus of stately oaks rarely meet classmates in these courses.
Online education is best known for serving older, nontraditional students who can not travel to colleges because of jobs and family. But the same technologies of ''distance learning'' are now finding their way onto brick-and-mortar campuses, especially public institutions hit hard by declining state funds. At the University of Florida, for example, resident students are earning 12 percent of their credit hours online this semester, a figure expected to grow to 25 percent in five years.
This may delight undergraduates who do not have to change out of pajamas to ''attend'' class. But it also raises questions that go to the core of a college's mission: Is it possible to learn as much when your professor is a mass of pixels whom you never meet? How much of a student's education and growth -- academic and personal -- depends on face-to-face contact with instructors and fellow students?
''When I look back, I think it took away from my freshman year,'' said Kaitlyn Hartsock, a senior psychology major at Florida who was assigned to two online classes during her first semester in Gainesville. ''My mom was really upset about it. She felt like she's paying for me to go to college and not sit at home and watch through a computer.''
Across the country, online education is exploding: 4.6 million students took a college-level online course during fall 2008, up 17 percent from a year earlier, according to the Sloan Survey of Online Learning. A large majority -- about three million -- were simultaneously enrolled in face-to-face courses, belying the popular notion that most online students live far from campuses, said Jeff Seaman, co-director of the survey. Many are in community colleges, he said. Very few attend private colleges; families paying $53,000 a year demand low student-faculty ratios.
Colleges and universities that have plunged into the online field, mostly public, cite their dual missions to serve as many students as possible while remaining affordable, as well as a desire to exploit the latest technologies.
At the University of Iowa, as many as 10 percent of 14,000 liberal arts undergraduates take an online course each semester, including Classical Mythology and Introduction to American Politics.
At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, first-year Spanish students are no longer offered a face-to-face class; the university moved all instruction online, despite internal research showing that online students do slightly less well in grammar and speaking.
''You have X amount of money, what are you going to do with it?'' said Larry King, chairman of the Romance languages department, where budget cuts have forced difficult choices. ''You can't be all things to all people.''
The University of Florida has faced sweeping budget cuts from the State Legislature totaling 25 percent over three years. That is a main reason the university is moving aggressively to offer more online instruction. ''We see this as the future of higher education,'' said Joe Glover, the university provost.
''Quite honestly, the higher education industry in the United States has not been tremendously effective in the face-to-face mode if you look at national graduation rates,'' he added. ''At the very least we should be experimenting with other modes of delivery of education.''
A sampling of Florida professors teaching online found both enthusiasm and doubts. ''I would prefer to teach classes of 50 and know every student's name, but that's not where we are financially and space-wise,'' said Megan Mocko, who teaches statistics to 1,650 students. She said an advantage of the Internet is that students can stop the lecture and rewind when they do not understand something.
Ilan Shrira, who teaches developmental psychology to 300, said that he chose his field because of the passion of a professor who taught him as an undergraduate. But he thought it unlikely that anyone could be so inspired by an online course.
Kristin Joos built interactivity into her Principles of Sociology course to keep students engaged. There are small-group online discussions, and students join a virtual classroom once a week using a conferencing software called WiZiQ.
''Hi, everyone, welcome to Week 9. Hello!'' Dr. Joos said in a peppy voice recently to about 60 students who had logged on. She sat at a desk in her home office; a live video feed she switched on at one point showed her in black librarian's glasses and a tank top.
Ms. Hartsock, the senior psychology major, followed the class from her own off-campus home, her laptop open on the dining room table. As Dr. Joos lectured, a chat box scrolled with students' comments and questions.
The topic was sexual identity, which Dr. Joos defined as ''a determination made through the application of socially agreed-upon biological criteria for classifying persons as females and males.''
She asked students for their own definitions. One, bringing an online-chat sensibility to an academic discussion, typed: ''If someone looks like a chick and wants to be called a chick even though they're not, now they can be one.''
Ms. Hartsock, 23, diligently typed notes. A hard-working student who maintains an A average, she was frustrated by the online format. Other members of her discussion group were not pulling their weight, she said. The one test so far, online, required answering five questions in 10 minutes -- a lightning round meant to prevent cheating by Googling answers.
In a conventional class, ''I'm someone who sits toward the front and shares my thoughts with the teacher,'' she said. In the 10 or so online courses she has taken in her four years, ''it's all the same,'' she said. ''No comments. No feedback. And the grades are always late.''
As her attention wandered, she got up to microwave some leftover rice.

HEADLINE: Live vs. Distance Learning: Measuring the Differences

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
The educational value of online courses has been debated for years, based on a large but uneven body of research. An analysis of 99 studies by the federal Department of Education concluded last year that online instruction, on average, was more effective than face-to-face learning by a modest amount. 
But that analysis has been challenged because so few of the underlying studies include apples-to-apples comparisons. Mark Rush of the University of Florida and colleagues tried to do just that by contrasting grades of students who sat through a semester of his live microeconomics lectures with those who watched online.
Their conclusion, reported in June by the National Bureau of Economic Research: some groups of online students did notably worse. Hispanic students watching online earned a full grade lower, on average, than Hispanics who attended class, and all male students who watched online were about a half-grade lower.
The results surprised the researchers; after all, the live lectures were delivered in a hall to scores of students, who rarely engaged the professor or one another. David N. Figlio, a professor of education and social policy at Northwestern University and a co-author of the study, had been prepared to find that ''watching online didn't make a lick of difference,'' he said. ''What we're saying is, 'Hang on for a second, maybe it does.' ''
Without the nudge of having to attend classes, the authors suggested, it can be easy to let recorded lectures pile up unwatched. Indeed, it is common at Florida to see students in libraries cramming viewings of a dozen lectures back to back before exams.

HEADLINE: Once on a Sleepy Beat, Regulator Is Suddenly Busy

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Cotton, sugar, silver, wheat: in investment circles, commodities like these are hot.
Maybe too hot. At a time when prices of many commodities are soaring -- cotton has jumped 95 percent in the last 12 months, silver 43 percent -- alarms are going off inside the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington.
Long dismissed as a lackadaisical regulator, the commission is suddenly on the move. Indeed, it is busier than ever: It opened a record 419 investigations over the last year, into things as diverse as small-time Ponzi schemes and claims of market manipulation. 
It is a remarkable turnabout for the agency, which not long ago seemed on the brink of extinction. Its chairman, Gary Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs executive, has surprised some of his former Wall Street colleagues by flexing his agency's muscles. He is rushing to expand the C.F.T.C.'s power now that the agency is poised to take on a new role in overseeing the vast market for derivatives that were traded off formal exchanges in the so-called over-the-counter market. He recently hired a former United States prosecutor as his new head of enforcement.
Granted, the C.F.T.C., like its bigger cousin, the Securities and Exchange Commission, often reels in relatively small fish. One recent case centers on what it calls the Aloha scam -- a $3 million suspected Ponzi scheme in Hawaii that the agency says was overseen by a man in prison. Bernie Madoff, this is not. What is more, agency outsiders question whether it has the means and experience to police new markets and take on the biggest players.
''They had the whole commodities market, and now they're getting an entire new market,'' said Therese M. Doherty, a partner at the law firm of Herrick Feinstein. ''I don't think people have gotten their arms around just how big this market is.''
The C.F.T.C., for instance, has about 200 lawyers in its enforcement division, while the S.E.C. has more than 1,200, Ms. Doherty said.
The agency is certainly talking tougher. Last week, one of its commissioners, Bart Chilton, urged the agency to strengthen its two-year investigation into suspected manipulation in silver trading.
''I believe that there have been repeated attempts to influence prices in the silver markets,'' Mr. Chilton said at a hearing last month in Washington. ''There have been fraudulent efforts to persuade and deviously control that price.''
A day after Mr. Chilton made his comments, two silver traders filed separate lawsuits in Manhattan federal court against two banking giants, JPMorgan Chase and HSBC Holdings. They accused the banks of conspiring to suppress prices of silver futures on the Commodity Exchange division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, beginning in the spring of 2008. A third suit, this one charging actions in violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, was filed this week.
In the relatively thinly traded silver futures markets, a handful of large banks and financial firms dominate trading. In March 2008 when JPMorgan acquired the foundering Bear Stearns, Bear Stearns had made a significant bet that the price of silver would fall, one of the lawsuits says. A few months later, in August, JPMorgan and Bear Stearns's bet against the market totaled about 25 percent of the annual world mining production of silver, the lawsuit states.
The lawsuits say that JPMorgan and HSBC used their dominant positions in the market to manipulate silver prices.
Starting last spring as the two banks cut back on their activities in the silver market, the prices of silver futures increased about 50 percent ''even though no fundamental changes in supply or demand for silver, including industrial demand, have occurred during this time period,'' one lawsuit states.
A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment on the lawsuits. HSBC officials did not return a telephone call for comment.
The investigation comes at a time when individual investors are increasingly interested in investing in commodities, following the lead of hedge fund giants like John A. Paulson and George Soros.
Given the uncertain outlook for the economy, many investors have sought safety in precious metals like gold. Silver, copper, wheat and oil have also gained amid concern that new efforts to spur growth -- including the $600 billion in new Treasury bond purchases announced by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday -- could eventually ignite inflation.
Now, as many are making millions legitimately as gold and silver streak to record highs, others are falling foul of frauds in the darker underbelly of the commodities boom.
The C.F.T.C. filed 57 enforcement actions in the 12 months ended in September, 14 percent more than in the period a year earlier. And the pace shows no signs of slowing. On Wednesday, the agency took enforcement actions against five different groups or individuals, including accusing three individuals of running a $28 million Ponzi scheme in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
A senior enforcement official said the commission was working more closely with other law enforcement agencies. Its success in securing convictions has shown that commodities fraud is a crime, encouraging other investors to come forward with their complaints, he said.
The increase in investigations also reflects a shakeout in Ponzi schemes during the financial crisis. Several of the successful cases over the last year came to light during the 2008 crisis.
The agency is also now looking harder for these schemes. It saw a big increase in enforcement actions in the early 2000s, but the number declined in the following years as commodities fell out of fashion and the agency cut back its staff.
Now the commission is expanding under Mr. Gensler. Its reach has recently grown to overseeing foreign exchange dealers, and it will share a large part of the burden of the new financial regulation, including new responsibilities for the swaps market. Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the agency new authority to fight manipulation in the swaps market, as well as new powers against disruptive practices in the swaps and futures markets.
Mr. Gensler, who was one of the strongest proponents for moving over-the-counter derivatives onto public exchanges, estimates that his agency will need an additional 400 employees, taking staff levels from 688 now to 1,100 over the next two years. ''Markets work best when they are transparent and they have an effective cop on the beat,'' he said.
Another sign of the change in attitude at the agency is that it hired David Meister, a former securities fraud prosecutor in New York, to run the agency's enforcement division. Since 2008, the division has been overseen by acting directors.

HEADLINE: Scans Cut Deaths By Lung Cancer Among Smokers

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Annual CT scans of current and former heavy smokers reduced their risk of death from lung cancer by 20 percent, a huge government-financed study has found. Even more surprising, the scans seem to reduce the risks of death from other causes as well, suggesting that the scans could be catching other illnesses.
The findings represent an enormous advance in cancer detection that could potentially save thousands of lives annually, although at considerable expense. Lung cancer will claim about 157,000 lives this year, more than the deaths from colorectal, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers combined. Most patients discover their disease too late for treatment, and 85 percent die from it.
No screening method had proved effective at reducing mortality from the disease. Four randomized controlled trials done during the 1970s showed that chest X-rays, while they helped catch cancers at an earlier stage, had no effect on overall death rates. Since then, researchers have suggested that CT scans -- which use coordinated X-rays to provide three-dimensional views -- could detect lung tumors at an even earlier stage than X-rays. 
''This is the first time that we have seen clear evidence of a significant reduction in lung cancer mortality with a screening test in a randomized controlled trial,'' said Dr. Christine Berg of the National Cancer Institute.
Cancer doctors and others predicted that the study's results would soon lead to widespread use of CT scans, in particular for older smokers, who have a one in 10 chance of contracting lung cancer.
''These people are worried about lung cancer, and now there is an opportunity to offer them something,'' said Dr. Mary Reid, an associate professor of oncology at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo.
But health officials involved in the study refused to endorse widespread screening of current or former smokers, saying more analysis of the study's results is needed to further identify who benefited most. Such an analysis is months away. And they pointed out that the study offers no reassurance about the safety of smoking or the advisability of CT scans for younger smokers or nonsmokers.
''No one should come away from this thinking that it's now safe to continue to smoke,'' said Dr. Harold E. Varmus, director of the National Cancer Institute.
Patients wishing to get a CT lung screen will most likely have to pay the roughly $300 charge themselves, since few insurers pay for such scans unless an illness is suspected. The federal Medicare program will soon reconsider paying for such screens, a Medicare official said.
The study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, was conducted by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network and the cancer institute. It involved more than 53,000 people ages 55 to 74 who had smoked at least 30 pack-years -- one pack a day for 30 years or two packs a day for 15 years. Ex-smokers who had quit within the previous 15 years were included in the group.
Each was given either a standard chest X-ray or a low-dose CT scan at the start of the trial and then twice more over the next two years. Participants were followed for up to five years. There were 354 lung cancer deaths among those who received CT scans and 442 among those who got X-rays. The $250 million study, which began in 2002, was paid for by the cancer institute and carried out at 33 sites.
Its preliminary results were announced days after an independent monitoring board determined that the benefits of CT scans were strong enough to stop the trial. The study will be published in the coming months.
The study found that for every 300 people who were screened, one person lived who would otherwise have died during the study. But one-quarter of those given CT scans were found to have anomalies, nearly all of which were benign. These false signals generally led to more worry, more CT scans and sometimes to lung biopsies and thoracic surgery.
''There are economic, medical and psychological consequences of finding these abnormalities,'' Dr. Varmus said.
Deaths due to all causes declined by 7 percent among study participants who received CT scans, suggesting the tests helped to detect other life-threatening diseases besides lung cancer.
Dr. Claudia Henschke, a clinical professor of radiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center and a longtime advocate for use of CT to screen for lung cancer, said the study was likely to have underestimated the benefits of CT scans because participants were screened only three times. Had the screening continued for 10 years, as many as 80 percent of lung cancer deaths could have been averted, she said. Dr. Henschke's research has been controversial because of its statistical methods and its financing, which included money from a tobacco company. She earns royalties from makers of CT machines.
''What we also have found is that low-dose CT scan gives information on cardiovascular disease, emphysema'' and other pulmonary diseases, Dr. Henschke said. ''Those are the three big killers of older people. There is just tremendous potential.''
But Dr. Edward F. Patz Jr., professor of radiology at Duke who helped devise the study, said he was far from convinced that a thorough analysis would show that widespread CT screening would prove beneficial in preventing most lung cancer deaths. Dr. Patz said that the biology of lung cancer has long suggested that the size of cancerous lung tumors tells little about the stage of the disease.
''If we look at this study carefully, we may suggest that there is some benefit in high-risk individuals, but I'm not there yet,'' Dr. Patz said.
Since 46 million people in the United States smoke and tens of millions more once smoked, a widespread screening program could cost billions annually. Any further refinement of those most at risk could reduce those costs. Low-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms. Little is known about how the cumulative risks of years of such scans would balance the benefits.
The study's results could have both legal and political consequences. Suits against tobacco companies have sought to force cigarette makers to pay for annual CT screens of former smokers. But with the science uncertain, those claims have so far been rebuffed. Congress has diverted some research money to create pilot CT lung screening programs, diversions that may gain momentum now.
Some Obama administration officials argued during the debate on the health care law that patients' health was often harmed by getting too many tests and procedures that, if reduced, would improve health while reducing costs. This study suggests that, at least in lung cancer, spending more on tests saves lives.
Laurie Fenton, president of the Lung Cancer Alliance, which has lobbied for widespread CT lung screening, said the debate about the advisability of such scans is now over.
''The challenge now shifts from proving the efficacy of the method to developing the proper quality standards, infrastructure and guidelines to bring this needed benefit to those at high risk for the disease -- now,'' Ms. Fenton said.
But Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said no one should rush out and get a CT scan yet because further analysis will better define whom the screening helped.
''Very soon we'll have an answer about who should be screened and how frequently,'' Dr. Bach said, ''but we don't have that answer today.''

HEADLINE: Is It Really A Pension? It's a Problem

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
Is Social Security a pension plan?
No, but it was sold to the public in the 1930s as if it were one, and that matters.
Social Security is one of the issues that Congress will eventually have to address, but it was almost absent from the campaign that just ended. The conventional political wisdom is that serious changes to entitlement programs can be made only on a bipartisan basis, in which each party implicitly promises not to attack the other for the deal. For now, such a spirit seems unlikely, to say the least.
And yet it was interesting that the National Bureau of Economic Research chose the election week to release a new study on the impact of previous changes in the system on Social Security benefits. The paper concludes that a significant part of tax increases have not helped cure projected deficits because they are used to pay additional benefits -- and that those added benefits go primarily to higher-income Americans.
If you look at Social Security as a pension plan, that result seems not only fair, but required. If you contribute more to a normal pension plan, you expect to get higher benefits. Why else would you contribute? And Social Security taxes are often called contributions. 
But the reality is that Social Security is not a normal pension plan, even though it somewhat resembles one because the benefit level is related to the recipient's income while he or she was working. It is what it was when it was created in the Great Depression: a plan to tax working Americans to pay for benefits given to retired and disabled workers, and to their families.
Over the years, the government has tried a couple of ways to increase revenue for the Social Security system as the retirement of the baby boom generation grew closer. One was to raise the payroll tax, which is now 12.4 percent of the first $106,800 earned by an employee. (The total tax is somewhat obscured because half of it is withheld from paychecks and the other half is paid directly by the employer.)
That tax rate is visible to everyone, and an increase hits hardest for people making less than the maximum that is taxed. For many lower-income wage earners, there is no federal income tax. But there is no escaping the Social Security payroll tax.
The other method has been to raise the maximum income subject to the tax. From 1937 to 1949, the limit was $3,000. That meant that workers earning more than that -- and most earned less during the early years -- did not pay taxes on income above that level. Nor was that income counted in determining benefits. As recently as 1965, the limit was $4,800.
Raising the limit brings in more money, of course, and gets that money from the higher-wage workers. But that comes at a cost to the system, because people who make more than the old cutoff also earn higher benefits.
The new paper, by Alan L. Gustman, an economics professor at Dartmouth; Thomas Steinmeier, an economics professor at Texas Tech; and Nahid Tabatabai, a researcher at Dartmouth, set out to estimate just how much those added benefits cost. That is harder than it seems, given the complexity of changes in Social Security law over the decades. But the authors had access to a lot of data from the Social Security Administration, which financed the study through the Michigan Retirement Research Center, and their estimates seem reasonable.
They compare three groups of Social Security recipients, the youngest being those born from 1948 through 1953, a group that is starting to retire now. That group is compared with a group 12 years older, born from 1936 through 1941, and to a group 24 years older, born from 1924 to 1929. They take into account inflation and increases in median income.
Comparing the youngest of these groups to those born 12 years earlier, they conclude that ''for a person earning at the maximum level covered by Social Security, about a fifth of the additional taxes collected due to the increase in the earnings cap are used to pay for incremental benefits, reducing the incremental funds available for addressing the Social Security revenue shortfall by about a fifth.'' Comparing the youngest group with the workers 24 years older, the increase in benefits is even greater.
Is this structure fair? It depends on how you look at it. In one view, all the extra taxes are paid by relatively high-income workers, but they get only about a fifth of the extra payments back. If you think of Social Security as a pension plan, that is the appropriate way to look at it, and you can conclude that those higher-income workers are being treated unfairly.
That results from the fact that Social Security is formulated to be somewhat progressive by replacing a large percentage of the first $8,000 in annual earnings and a much smaller proportion of additional earnings. A major purpose of Social Security was to reduce poverty among senior citizens, and it worked.
But if you think of Social Security as a transfer payment system, in which taxes are transferred to the retired, it may not seem fair that the well-off get extra benefits at all. If government spending must be reduced in some areas to deal with the soaring level of national debt, would it make sense to cut spending that benefits those who need it least?
Such an issue was confronted by David Cameron, the new Conservative prime minister of Britain, when he imposed a new austerity budget. Heretofore, Britain has provided cash grants for all parents; now high-income workers will not get them. There was speculation that would provoke outrage from those who are losing the benefits, but that reaction seems to have been mild. There were complaints over the way the system handled two-income couples as opposed to couples in which one parent stays home, but generally the idea seems to have substantial support.
In this country, there is no way to cut off Social Security payments to the well-off, even if it does seem a little absurd for Warren Buffett to be getting a government check every month.
''Having sold Social Security as a retirement plan, I think it is important that the promise not be abandoned,'' Mr. Gustman, the Dartmouth professor, told me in a telephone interview. ''I would like to see the feature of an indexed annuity preserved.'' But he also talks about adjusting benefits for changes in life expectancy -- a somewhat subtle way of suggesting cuts in benefits.
You can get into an argument any time you discuss just how badly off Social Security is, although it clearly is not in fiscal straits as severe as those that will confront Medicare if its costs continue to rise.
Every year the Social Security system's trustees release a new estimate, which politicians and advocates use to justify the views they already had. Those estimates are extremely sensitive to economic estimates for coming decades. If you assume there will be more economic growth, the situation looks better.
Given that, it is possible the best thing that could be done for Social Security now would be to adjust fiscal policy to stimulate the economy, even if, temporarily, that does produce higher budget deficits. It seems clear that the previous stimulus spending was neither large enough nor well enough fashioned to completely offset the drag on the economy caused by the financial crisis.
That crisis, however, also caused reported budget deficits to soar, and both Republicans and Democrats -- but particularly Republicans -- campaigned this year on promises to cut spending. Reaching an accommodation that would help the economy seems unlikely in the new Congress. The Federal Reserve's new bond-buying plan may not be the best way to help the economy, but it may be the only one available given the fiscal stalemate.
Eventually, Congress will have to address whether to change Social Security. Politically, much of the support for the program stems from the perception that it is an earned benefit, not a welfare program. But in a time of fiscal austerity, Congress should at least consider whether it makes sense that an increase in taxes to finance the system automatically increases the benefits paid to those who need help the least.

HEADLINE: Wealthy and Worried, India Is Rich Arms Market

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW and HEATHER TIMMONS; Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A big item on President Obama's India to-do list this weekend is securing a $5 billion deal for Boeing to sell 10 of its C-17 cargo planes.
The agreement, for which Boeing and American officials have long laid the groundwork, would be part of a flurry of military equipment deals that foreign suppliers are eager to nail down with India. Mr. Obama's French and Russian counterparts are expected to visit New Delhi this year, with their own military sales contracts in hand.
India, flush with new wealth but worried about its national security, is rapidly turning into one of the world's most lucrative arms markets.
In the last several years, as its budget and appetite for more sophisticated weaponry have grown, India has reduced its traditional reliance on Russia for planes, ships and missiles. 
The White House is backing sales like the C-17s, which India would use to transport its rapid-response forces, to help make India a regional counterweight to China.
But there is a big trade motive, too. As the United States and European nations trim military spending, the biggest weapons contractors, including Boeing and Lockheed Martin, see India as a sales lifeline.
Still, American companies face complex political and bureaucratic obstacles to gaining a large part of India's business. The president's trip will be focused in part on trying to cut through some of those problems.
Perhaps the biggest concern is Indian leaders' wariness about relying too much on the United States, which they see as a new, untested military partner, and one that is also arming Pakistan, India's main adversary.
In India, the United States ''starts with a handicap'' on arms sales, said K. Raja Menon, a retired admiral who is chairman of an Indian government task force that studies security risks.
India's accelerating economy gives it the resources to join Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as the biggest arms buyers. And its desire to upgrade its military was spurred by the terror attacks in Mumbai in late 2008, when militants slipped in by sea and killed 160 people.
''There's nothing to galvanize the psyche of the Indian people toward better defense and homeland security than what happened in Mumbai,'' said Tom Captain, who leads the aerospace and defense group at Deloitte, the global consultancy.
Mr. Captain and other analysts estimate that, as its military budget expands by 7 percent to 8 percent annually, India could spend $50 billion to $80 billion in the next five years on equipment.
Besides the Pakistan issue, Indian military officials say that trade sanctions imposed after India conducted nuclear tests in 1998 have also put the United States at a disadvantage.
Most of the sanctions, which prohibited military exports to India and exports to Indian companies believed to be involved in the nuclear program, were repealed in 2001. But the sanctions have left concerns about Americans. ''There is an entrenched view in bureaucracies in India that these guys will turn off the tap,'' said Mr. Menon, the retired admiral.
Indian officials are also upset that other technology controls remain in place, including bans on the sale of software that could also be used for weapons. The officials will press Mr. Obama to ease those strictures. Another sticking point could be that India has balked at signing agreements to protect American secrets that are a standard part of any sales.
India also uses the lure of big military contracts to require foreign companies to farm out work to Indian companies and create high-paying jobs there. But India's fledging military industries cannot handle all the work, and American officials want more flexibility in those arrangements.
At the same time, American analysts say that India's military spending process is so chaotic and unfocused that it is proving difficult to complete deals.
''India at the moment has the money to buy weapons, but behind this there is not much strategic direction,'' said Stephen P. Cohen, an analyst with the Brookings Institution.
Still, India's plan to modernize its military is so sweeping that industry officials say there should be plenty of business to go around.
''All I can say is that the market potential here is so significant that there is room for various countries and companies,'' said Vivek Lall, the vice president in charge of Boeing's military business in India.
One of the biggest prizes would be a $10 billion contract to replace old Russian fighter planes with 126 new jets. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and four companies from Europe and Russia have bid, and the contract could be awarded next year.
Mr. Obama is likely to talk up the American companies during his visit, just as Nicolas Sarkozy of France and President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia are expected to make pitches for their manufacturers when they visit India.
American companies are also bidding on major contracts involving helicopters and missile systems, while some earlier deals are coming to fruition.
Lockheed Martin, for example, is about to deliver the first of six C-130J cargo planes that India ordered for $1 billion in 2007. Boeing, meanwhile, is building maritime surveillance planes under a $2.1 billion contract awarded in early 2009.
But American executives say they realize that success in India will depend on how well they can unite with Indian companies, a process that could help them win more political support.
Several American contractors have created joint ventures with a government-owned company, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited. Boeing signed a 10-year, $1 billion deal with the Indian company in 2007. Hindustan is making parts for Boeing's 777 commercial jets and for planes it is building for the Pentagon and India.
And the Tata Group, India's largest business conglomerate, is expected to deliver the first Indian-made cabins for the Sikorsky S-92 helicopter in November.
Bharat Wakhlu, the resident director of Tata in New Delhi, said labor costs in India were one-eighth or less than in the United States. So even though productivity levels are lower, he said, the American companies can still realize significant savings by moving work there.
American officials, however, say that Indian rules limiting foreign contractors to minority stakes in joint ventures, and requiring them to spend 30 percent of any contract money on work in India, are too onerous.
But as long as India's economy is booming, American arms suppliers may still make big gains. The cost of weapons is simply not as much a factor as it was just a few years ago, when India relied mainly on Russia for military equipment, said Gurmeet Kanwal, a retired brigadier and the director of the Center for Land Warfare Studies, a research organization in New Delhi.
American technology is seen as the ''top of the top,'' he said, and ''we should aim to pay a little more for the best equipment.''

HEADLINE: A Quick Move From Tea Party To Flex Muscle

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Kate Zernike contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The incoming leadership of the new House Republican majority hardly had a chance to relish its dismantling of the Democrats before the Tea Party came calling in the form of Representative Michele Bachmann.
Ms. Bachmann, the Minnesota Republican and Tea Party heroine often seen exhorting conservative activists at rallies and on cable television, announced that she intended to seek the No. 4 position among House Republicans.
She said she could provide the viewpoint of a constitutional conservative, one she evidently sees lacking in Representatives John A. Boehner of Ohio, Eric Cantor of Virginia and Kevin McCarthy of California -- the three likely leaders. 
Mr. Cantor and other influential Republicans are rallying instead behind Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, a fiscal conservative, and Ms. Bachmann has only an outside shot at winning the race.
But her candidacy vividly illustrates the central tension facing Mr. Boehner and his team: balancing the demands of new lawmakers, some of whom ran against the Republican establishment and advocate a no-compromise stance toward the Obama administration and Democratic policies, against the need to deliver some accomplishments at a time of economic distress.
Ms. Bachmann is by no means the only Tea Party voice moving to exert influence over the new Congress.
In a draft of a confidential memo to be distributed to all incoming House Republican lawmakers, Dick Armey, a former Republican majority leader who is chairman of the conservative group FreedomWorks, and Matt Kibbe, its president, told lawmakers that a repeal of the Democrats' health care law was ''nonnegotiable'' and warned that they would face a severe backlash from voters if they did not succeed in reversing the law.
''Politically speaking, your only choice is to get on offense and start moving boldly ahead to repeal, replace and defund Obamacare in 2011, or risk rejection by the voters in 2012,'' Mr. Armey and Mr. Kibbe wrote.
House Republicans said they recognized the inherent conflicts, and the pressure that they would be under from the new majority-makers. But they also said they believed they could meet the challenge, given that veteran Republicans shared many of the newcomers' goals.
When asked how the leadership planned to educate new members, particularly those who had never served in government, Representative Greg Walden of Oregon said, ''My guess is these incoming freshmen are going to be giving us the training session.''
Mr. Walden, who is leading the Republican transition effort for the new majority, added: ''They are coming with that energy, to bring that skill set and what they have heard in the heartland. They are going to be telling us.''
Flush with victory, top House Republicans and strategists said they saw little distinction between incumbent members and those who would be joining them as freshmen. They noted that both benefited from the Tea Party activism that helped them trounce Democrats and said that the support deserved to be rewarded.
''We are who we said we are, and we are ready to do what we said we would do,'' said Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for Mr. Cantor. ''We need to produce results for the people who spoke out so loudly on Tuesday.''
Mr. Boehner, the presumptive House speaker, has political views that make him attractive to Tea Party followers even though he has been in the House since 1991 and hardly qualifies as an outsider.
He has long opposed providing money for the home-state projects known as earmarks, even as his fellow Republicans have feasted on them, and he entered Congress as a rabble-rouser himself. He courted the Tea Party heavily during the campaign and has made repealing the health care law a priority.
Even as he and his fellow Republicans tried to chart a path forward, Mr. Boehner said Thursday that he was seeing signs that President Obama and Congressional Democrats failed to realize that Republican gains in Congress resulted from a potent backlash against the Democratic agenda.
''There seems to be some denial on the part of the president and other Democratic leaders of the message that was sent by the American people,'' Mr. Boehner said in an interview with ABC News. ''When you have the most historic election in over 60, 70 years, you would think the other party would understand that the American people have clearly repudiated the policies they've put forward in the last few years.''
Given the chance in the interview to agree with Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, that the party's goal should be to make Mr. Obama a one-term president, Mr. Boehner responded only that this was Mr. McConnell's opinion, suggesting that Mr. Boehner was interested in staying out of that particular fight right now.
While the leadership team sees a chance to meld the Tea Party view into the House Republican ideology, there are bound to be conflicts. As the party now controlling the House, Republicans have to produce a budget, spending bills and other legislation that the 40 or so new lawmakers strongly allied to the Tea Party might balk at supporting, leaving the leadership scrambling for votes. Over all, there are at least 80 incoming Republican freshman, and the party is expected to control at least 239 seats. A vote next year on increasing the debt limit -- an increase many Tea Party candidates could reject as a fundamental matter of principle -- looms as a real test case.
And with the newly energized movement promising to watch closely, the incoming lawmakers will be very leery of seeming to be co-opted by the Congressional establishment, even if it is the leadership of their own party.
Ms. Bachmann's candidacy suggests that while Republican leaders may face pressure from their Tea Party caucus, it could be manageable. Mr. Hensarling, while not as closely associated with the movement as Ms. Bachmann, is a popular lawmaker who headed the Republican Study Committee, a group of more than 100 conservatives. He has received praise from Tea Party leaders and Republican activists along with his leadership endorsements.
It is not clear if Ms. Bachmann can rally the incoming lawmakers to her side, though she has already won a few public supporters, including Representative John Kline, a fellow Minnesotan, and Representative Steve King, a conservative ally from Iowa.
Mr. Walden predicted that House Republicans would ultimately be able to band together.
''Remember, all of us just stood for election, all of us just faced the same voters in our own states,'' he said. ''All of us are coming back here understanding that voters want this place to change, and in a meaningful way.''

HEADLINE: The Focus Hocus-Pocus

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Democrats, declared Evan Bayh in an Op-Ed article on Wednesday in The Times, ''overreached by focusing on health care rather than job creation during a severe recession.'' Many others have been saying the same thing: the notion that the Obama administration erred by not focusing on the economy is hardening into conventional wisdom.
But I have no idea what, if anything, people mean when they say that. The whole focus on ''focus'' is, as I see it, an act of intellectual cowardice -- a way to criticize President Obama's record without explaining what you would have done differently. 
After all, are people who say that Mr. Obama should have focused on the economy saying that he should have pursued a bigger stimulus package? Are they saying that he should have taken a tougher line with the banks? If not, what are they saying? That he should have walked around with furrowed brow muttering, ''I'm focused, I'm focused''?
Mr. Obama's problem wasn't lack of focus; it was lack of audacity. At the start of his administration he settled for an economic plan that was far too weak. He compounded this original sin both by pretending that everything was on track and by adopting the rhetoric of his enemies.
The aftermath of major financial crises is almost always terrible: severe crises are typically followed by multiple years of very high unemployment. And when Mr. Obama took office, America had just suffered its worst financial crisis since the 1930s. What the nation needed, given this grim prospect, was a really ambitious recovery plan.
Could Mr. Obama actually have offered such a plan? He might not have been able to get a big plan through Congress, or at least not without using extraordinary political tactics. Still, he could have chosen to be bold -- to make Plan A the passage of a truly adequate economic plan, with Plan B being to place blame for the economy's troubles on Republicans if they succeeded in blocking such a plan.
But he chose a seemingly safer course: a medium-size stimulus package that was clearly not up to the task. And that's not 20/20 hindsight. In early 2009, many economists, yours truly included, were more or less frantically warning that the administration's proposals were nowhere near bold enough.
Worse, there was no Plan B. By late 2009, it was already obvious that the worriers had been right, that the program was much too small. Mr. Obama could have gone to the nation and said, ''My predecessor left the economy in even worse shape than we realized, and we need further action.'' But he didn't. Instead, he and his officials continued to claim that their original plan was just right, damaging their credibility even further as the economy continued to fall short.
Meanwhile, the administration's bank-friendly policies and rhetoric -- dictated by fear of hurting financial confidence -- ended up fueling populist anger, to the benefit of even more bank-friendly Republicans. Mr. Obama added to his problems by effectively conceding the argument over the role of government in a depressed economy.
I felt a sense of despair during Mr. Obama's first State of the Union address, in which he declared that ''families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do the same.'' Not only was this bad economics -- right now the government must spend, because the private sector can't or won't -- it was almost a verbatim repeat of what John Boehner, the soon-to-be House speaker, said when attacking the original stimulus. If the president won't speak up for his own economic philosophy, who will?
So where, in this story, does ''focus'' come in? Lack of nerve? Yes. Lack of courage in one's own convictions? Definitely. Lack of focus? No.
And why would failing to tackle health care have produced a better outcome? The focus people never explain.
Of course, there's a subtext to the whole line that health reform was a mistake: namely, that Democrats should stop acting like Democrats and go back to being Republicans-lite. Parse what people like Mr. Bayh are saying, and it amounts to demanding that Mr. Obama spend the next two years cringing and admitting that conservatives were right.
There is an alternative: Mr. Obama can take a stand.
For one thing, he still has the ability to engineer significant relief to homeowners, one area where his administration completely dropped the ball during its first two years. Beyond that, Plan B is still available. He can propose real measures to create jobs and aid the unemployed and put Republicans on the spot for standing in the way of the help Americans need.
Would taking such a stand be politically risky? Yes, of course. But Mr. Obama's economic policy ended up being a political disaster precisely because he tried to play it safe. It's time for him to try something different.

HEADLINE: Fearing Fate Of Japan, Not Greece

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- By placing a $600 billion bet on the Federal Reserve's ability to encourage the recovery, Ben S. Bernanke is gingerly trying to avoid the mistakes of Japan, where deflation has stymied growth. But the antideficit Republicans who seized control of the House on Tuesday draw cautionary lessons from a different country: debt-stricken Greece.
Regardless of which comparison is more apt, the Fed's decision on Wednesday to renew a no-holds-barred effort to nudge the recovery by lowering long-term interest rates was a notable display of Mr. Bernanke's determination to act at a time when the effectiveness of both monetary policy, which he controls, and fiscal policy, which he does not, is under debate.
The impact of the Fed's decision to embark on a new round of debt-buying rippled through world markets on Thursday. Stocks in Asia and Europe were up, as was the Dow Jones industrial average, which surged nearly 2 percent. But as Treasury yields fell, along with the dollar, officials from emerging markets expressed alarm about the prospect of a wave of foreign capital crashing on their shores in search of higher returns. 
That unwelcome flood of cash has already pushed up their currencies, and the new Fed action is certain to be a topic of contention when President Obama and other leaders of the Group of 20 economic powers gather in Seoul, South Korea on Thursday of next week for a two-day summit meeting.
But Mr. Bernanke has by now made it clear that his top priority was to get the American economy going again, even at the risk of unsettling the nation's trading partners. His decision to act -- a culmination of months of debate within the Fed -- occurred against the backdrop of political gridlock at home, and despite a conservative resurgence more concerned about Greek-style debt than Japanese-style stagnation.
In an op-ed article published Thursday in The Washington Post, Mr. Bernanke described the ''body blow'' that the financial crisis dealt the world economy two years ago, and said the Fed's actions -- lowering short-term interest rates to nearly zero and then buying $1.7 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and Treasury debt -- ''helped end the economic free fall.''
He described the Fed's experience with quantitative easing, the strategy of buying assets to lower long-term rates, in optimistic terms. ''This approach eased financial conditions in the past and, so far, looks to be effective again,'' Mr. Bernanke wrote, predicting lower mortgage rates, cheaper corporate borrowing and higher stock prices that would encourage consumer confidence. ''Increased spending will lead to higher incomes and profits that, in a virtuous circle, will further support economic expansion,'' Mr. Bernanke predicted.
He said the economic fix ''will take time and the combined efforts of many parties, including the central bank, Congress, the administration, regulators and the private sector.''
However, Robert J. Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, said that without additional government spending to match the Fed's loose monetary policy, the economic frailty was bound to persist.
''Virtually everything on the fiscal policy side will be off the table in the deadlocked partisan world we face in 2011 and 2012,'' he said. ''This greatly increases the probability of a Japanese-style lost decade that would span the decade 2007-17.''
Mr. Bernanke has said that the economy needs continued fiscal support from Congress, as long as it is paired with a longer-range plan to rein in deficits and stabilize public debt levels.
But his appeals for fiscal help have been muted.
''The chances of getting some stimulus from fiscal policy are close to zero,'' said Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fed governor. ''I think Bernanke is well aware of that, so he probably feels that there is little use in belaboring the point.''
Perry G. Mehrling, an economist at Barnard College, said Mr. Bernanke was being careful not to overstep the Fed's role. ''Probably he would prefer fiscal easing over quantitative easing, but that decision is ultimately a political one,'' he said.
Robert E. Hall, a Stanford economist who is chairman of the committee that determines the start and end dates of recessions, said it would be ''very wise'' for Mr. Bernanke to keep out of the fiscal policy debates.
''He should stick to what he controls -- Fed policy, broadly conceived,'' Mr. Hall said. ''Ben has his hands full with enlarged powers to keep banks under control and to manage his big portfolio.''
That portfolio -- a $2.3 trillion balance sheet that has already more than doubled -- is about to grow even more.
Along with $600 billion in Treasury securities to be purchased by the end of June, the Fed is continuing an earlier effort, begun in August, to use mortgage-related proceeds to buy government securities.
In a research note, Jan Hatzius, the chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, predicted that the program ''will grow significantly beyond the initial $600 billion.''
If his forecasts of 10 percent unemployment and a further decline in core inflation to around 0.5 percent by late 2011 prove correct, the Fed could continue buying Treasuries into 2012 for a total of around $2 trillion, Mr. Hatzius wrote.
Most business economists expect the Fed to start tightening monetary policy, by raising interest rates, in 2012, but Mr. Hatzius said that tightening might not begin ''until 2015 or later.''
Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the sole dissenter from the Fed's decision, believes such a delay would be a mistake. In a phone interview, he said the fears of Japanese-style deflation were overblown.
''High inflation or strong deflation, like we had in the Depression, is of course abhorrent,'' he said. ''But we can't use the fact that we had this negative event, the Depression, to say we can't have any deflation. I'm not any more afraid of very modest deflation than I am of very modest inflation.''
Mr. Hoenig said the Fed erred after the 2001 recession by holding interest rates low for too long, which he views as having contributed to the housing bubble. The Fed is at risk of repeating that mistake, he said.
But at the moment the Fed seems to be paying more heed to people like Kazuo Ueda, an economist at the University of Tokyo.
In a conference organized by the Boston Fed in October 1999, Mr. Ueda warned that fighting deflation when short-term rates are at zero ''will be a lot more painful than you can possibly imagine.''
In a reprise of that conference last month, the Boston Fed's president, Eric S. Rosengren, called that prediction ''accurate and prophetic.''
Mr. Ueda, looking back on the past decade, took little satisfaction from that praise. ''Despite the adoption of various unconventional, nontraditional monetary policy measures, we are still in deflation,'' he told a crowd that included numerous Fed officials. ''So in a sense, we failed to stop it.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Lists Sweeping Goals, But Their Impact Is Uncertain

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Republican leaders in Congress are preparing to take power in two months with ambitious and sometimes contradictory goals for economic and fiscal policies, leaving little common ground with President Obama and much uncertainty about the potential impact on the nation's problems.
Republicans are standing by their campaign vows to slash spending for domestic programs immediately by at least one-fifth -- $100 billion in a single year -- even as many mainstream economists say such deep cuts could further strain the economy and should await its full recovery. Republicans also say they will try to deny money to put Mr. Obama's new health care law into effect, though they have not made clear what they would do to make up the cost savings that would be lost if they succeeded in repealing the law.
In policy documents, including a blueprint this week from Representative Eric Cantor, the likely Republican majority leader in the new Congress, the party has made clear that its main proposals for creating jobs are to cut regulations and taxes -- in particular to make the Bush-era tax cuts permanent for all incomes. Extending the tax cuts, however, would add nearly $4 trillion to the debt by 2020, and hundreds of billions more in interest owed for the additional government borrowing, greatly complicating another Republican goal: balancing the budget. 
With the Bush tax rates due to expire Dec. 31, that fight between Republicans and Mr. Obama, who favors extending the rates only for income below $250,000, will play out in Congress's lame-duck session this month. On Thursday, the White House served notice that Mr. Obama, who a day earlier signaled a willingness to compromise, would not sign on to any deal making permanent the lower rates for income above $250,000.
''The president does not believe, and I think would not accept, permanently extending the upper-end tax cuts,'' said his press secretary, Robert Gibbs.
The two sides could settle for something less than a permanent extension of the top rates, Mr. Gibbs suggested. Democrats say they might agree to a one- or two-year increase, and longer for the middle-income rates.
But Republicans say they will insist that, whatever the duration, all rates must be extended in tandem -- the easier to extend them together again in the future. Both sides recognize that, politically, Republicans would have a harder time in the future trying to extend only the rates that benefited the richest Americans, about 2 percent of taxpayers.
Republicans' pledge to ''defund'' the health care law portends another battle. Mr. Obama could veto such legislation, though Republicans could package such moves in larger bills he wants, making a veto problematic. It is unclear whether federal agencies could perhaps reprogram money intended for other purposes to make up for any money blocked by Congress.
Mr. Obama and Republicans appear to agree on one thing: a continued moratorium on spending earmarks, which are the designations in each year's budget bills for projects sought by individual lawmakers for their constituents or for special interests.
The blueprint circulated by Mr. Cantor, of Virginia, to incoming Republicans endorsed the moratorium. Mr. Obama quickly agreed on Wednesday, saying, ''That's something I think we can -- we can work on together.''
But eliminating all earmarks would hardly dent annual deficits. In the 2006 fiscal year, when Republicans last controlled Congress, they approved nearly 10,000 earmarks, a record; the $29 billion cost was about 11 percent of the year's deficit. But now deficits are much larger, swollen by the recession.
In Republicans' overall policy statements, they have not specified exactly how they would fulfill the promise to cut more than $100 billion from the budget for domestic discretionary programs. That would be the largest reduction in such spending from one year to the next since it began to be tracked in 1962.
Once they take control of the House in January, however, Republicans will have to begin work on their alternative to the annual budget Mr. Obama will outline soon after Congress convenes, an exercise that will test Republicans' unity once the scale of such reductions sinks in for them, for their allies among business lobbyists and for constituents back home.
''Neither party dealt with this in the campaign, particularly with asking the middle class to face up to what costs it may have to bear,'' said C. Eugene Steuerle, an economist at the Urban Institute and a Treasury official in the Reagan administration.
Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats also have promised to work to reduce projected deficits, lest they inflate the already high federal debt to an unsustainable level. But Democrats do not favor major spending reductions until the economy recovers, perhaps by 2012, and even then they would not consider anything near the $100 billion in one-year cuts that Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House speaker-in-waiting, has proposed.
''To have cuts that deep -- cutting nondefense spending on average by a fifth -- will require deep cuts in programs that most Americans think are very important,'' said James R. Horney, the director of federal fiscal policy at the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Reductions inevitably would hit education, the national parks, health research and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, just to name a few, Mr. Horney said. ''And if you start saying you're going to protect certain popular programs,'' he said, ''then the cuts in everything else become really draconian.''
The cuts in discretionary programs would not apply to the so-called entitlement programs -- chiefly Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- whose rising costs, along with inadequate tax revenues, are driving the deficit projections.
Domestic discretionary programs account for about 15 percent of the annual budget, a portion that is not growing. Entitlement programs are 40 percent and national security spending 23 percent; both are expanding.
Mr. Cantor, in his document to other Republicans this week, has acknowledged that the debt problem could not be solved without reining in the growth of the entitlement programs. But he said that would be hard to do because Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats ''have made it abundantly clear that they will attack anyone who puts forward a plan that even tries to begin a conversation about the tough choices that are needed.''
Yet Republicans have done the same. In campaigns this year, they assailed incumbent Democrats for voting to slash Medicare as part of the new health care law, though the projected reductions save money through insurance changes, not reductions in basic Medicare benefits.
Republicans have promised to offset any new spending with additional spending cuts. They have not said they would require such offsetting savings for new tax cuts. Mr. Obama signed a pay-as-you-go law that applies to new spending and tax cuts, but Republicans in Congress could seek a vote to waive it.

HEADLINE: Bank of America Fights Pressure on Mortgages

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Bank of America on Thursday rebuffed claims by a lawyer for several big investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, that it should buy back troubled mortgages because the loans were made improperly.
In its first response to the investor claims, Bank of America argued that the effort would have the effect of speeding up the foreclosure process and force it to evict more homeowners. The investors' claims have become a major worry on Wall Street as the foreclosure crisis has escalated.
A group of investors, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Pimco, the money management firm, is pressing Bank of America to buy back a portion of some $47 billion worth of mortgages. They argue that Countrywide, a unit of Bank of America, has not been servicing the mortgages correctly and that the loans did not conform to underwriting standards. 
In a letter from its lawyers Thursday, Bank of America said the problems stemmed from the economic downturn rather than any underlying problem with how the mortgages were sold to investors. It called the investor claims ''utterly baseless.''
Signaling a much more aggressive legal stance, the bank also criticized the lawyer behind the effort, Kathy D. Patrick. It argued that a letter she wrote last month that was signed by clients was ''written for an improper purpose, or in furtherance of an ulterior agenda.'' Ms. Patrick did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment.
Since Ms. Patrick's letter was released last month, Bank of America shares have slumped on fears that investor efforts to force it to buy back mortgages -- known as put-backs -- could be a drain on earnings for years. In recent days, several reports by Wall Street research firms have estimated the put-back claims could cost the industry $43 billion to $90 billion.
At the same time, Bank of America's chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, went on the offensive at a conference with bank analysts in Boston on Thursday. ''I don't think we should be put in a position where we aren't trying to help homeowners through this strife because people want us to foreclose faster,'' he said.
In addition, Mr. Moynihan said, he was caught off guard by the decision of the Federal Reserve and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled giant, as well as private investors to sign the letter.
Bank of America and other large institutions like JPMorgan Chase and GMAC Mortgage themselves have faced criticism that foreclosures have been pursued without the proper paperwork or with signatures by so-called robo-signers. But on Wall Street, the worry is that the investor effort to get the banks to buy back defaulted mortgages could actually be a longer and more expensive fight for the industry.
At the same time, Bank of America faces pressure to slow the foreclosure process, even as large investors -- including the government in the case of the Federal Reserve and Freddie Mac -- push for the foreclosures to proceed.
In Thursday's letter, written by Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, one of New York's top law firms, Bank of America's lawyers note that Freddie Mac has stated publicly that it is committed to help troubled mortgage holders keep their homes.
''Your demands to hasten foreclosures and to reduce loan modifications are patently inconsistent with that stated aim,'' the letter said.
The investors also argue that Bank of America is keeping the mortgages on its books to collect fees, rather than proceed with foreclosures. But Barbara J. Desoer, president of Bank of America Home Loans, said that charge was false.
''We have no financial incentive to keep mortgages on the books longer,'' she said. ''Isn't it better to modify the loan and keep people in their homes rather than foreclosing?''
Ms. Desoer said the underlying reason for the surge in foreclosures was the broader economic downturn, taking issue with critics who claim many of these loans should never have been made in the first place. ''The economy declined, unemployment went up and house prices declined,'' she said. ''That's not a reason for a loan to be put back.''

HEADLINE: Cablevision Posts Higher Profit With Gains in Internet Subscriptions

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Cablevision Systems posted a higher quarterly profit Thursday as it added more Internet and telephone customers.
The cable operator, however, lost more video customers than expected and posted a reduction in the number of total products sold for the first time in recent years as pressure from the weak economy hurt growth. 
Cablevision, which has more than three million customers over all, added 9,600 Internet subscribers and 9,300 phone subscribers during the quarter. But it lost 24,500 basic video customers.
Analysts at Bernstein Research had forecast Internet additions of 12,000 subscribers and phone additions of 18,000 subscribers. Bernstein had also expected Cablevision to lose just 14,000 basic video customers.
Cablevision had been locked in a prominent programming fee dispute with the News Corporation, which resulted in the operator losing Fox's local stations in New York and Philadelphia for 15 days until the two sides resolved their differences last week.
While the company declined to say how many customers in the current quarter had canceled their subscriptions as a result of the Fox issue, Cablevision's chief operating officer, Tom Rutledge, said the standoff had been justified.
''Our behavior was not uneconomic,'' Mr. Rutledge said on a conference call. ''We were doing a rational thing.'' He said that the number of losses was warranted given the kind of deal it was able to reach with Fox.
Third-quarter profit was $112.1 million, or 37 cents a share, compared with $98.9 million, or 33 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 5.6 percent to $1.81 billion.
Analysts on average had forecast profit of 41 cents a share on revenue of $1.79 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.
Cablevision has been successful in driving up the average revenue per user by 5.7 percent to $149.04.

HEADLINE: Sponsor Drops Jazz Festivals In New York and Newport

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
Once again, George Wein's jazz festivals in New York and Newport, R.I., are without title sponsors.
CareFusion, the medical technology company that supported the New York series this summer and the Newport festival for the last two, will not be renewing its deal, the company said in an announcement circulated by Mr. Wein, 85, who helped found the Newport Jazz Festival in 1954. 
CareFusion, an independent spinoff of the pharmaceutical wholesaler Cardinal Health, surprised the jazz world last year with its deal with Mr. Wein, who was rebuilding his festival franchises after the financial crisis of the company that had bought him out in 2007, Festival Network. Explaining its entry into jazz, CareFusion said that music was a major avocation of doctors and other health professionals. (In an interview with The New York Times this year, Mr. Wein said that CareFusion's support of the New York festival amounted to about half a million dollars; before CareFusion, the audio company JVC sponsored the two festivals for 23 years.)
''CareFusion came forward at a very crucial time when my company was facing decisions about the future of this historic event,'' Mr. Wein said in a statement. ''They understood the worldwide appeal of jazz and tapped into its magic to launch their brand, and we're pleased that jazz helped to make the company a household name.''
Mr. Wein's statement added that the Newport Jazz Festival was scheduled for Aug. 5 to 7, and that it and the New York series are ''available for title sponsorship'' - as is Mr. Wein's other major summer event, the Newport Folk Festival, which CareFusion did not support.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Human Development Report Shows Great Gains, and Some Slides

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Celia Dugger contributed reporting from Johannesburg.

 BODY:
UNITED NATIONS -- The world has made significant progress in income, education and health over the past 40 years, but the gains have been uneven and in some places war and the ravages of AIDS shortened life spans, according to a United Nations report on Thursday.
Over all, average life expectancy around the globe jumped to 70 years in 2010, up from 59 in 1970. School enrollment through high school reached 70 percent of eligible pupils, up from 55 percent, and average per capita income doubled to more than $10,000 in the 135 countries for which numbers were available. The statistics cover about 92 percent of the world's population. 
While the broad measures advanced globally, life expectancy declined in nine countries and improved by varying degrees in others. Arab states measured an 18-year jump in life span, according to the report, while the average for people in sub-Saharan Africa increased by 8 years.
The authors of the report said the changes among such a variety of nations underscored that there was no one policy answer to the question of development. ''There are no universal prescriptions which we can see taking effect in all of the countries,'' said Jeni Klugman, the lead author.
Even within countries, the progress was sometimes asymmetrical. China jumped way up the income scale, registering a 2,000 percent increase in daily wages, but did not improve markedly in education or health, the authors said. On the other hand, Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria managed to do both, broadening access to health and education, and improving average income, though disparities remained.
In certain African nations -- the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Swaziland -- life expectancy decreased because of the AIDS epidemic or war, the report found.
But in some parts of the former Soviet Union where life spans shortened, specifically Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, the reasons were harder to gauge. The report noted that alcohol consumption combined with the stress of changing to a market economy was the likely cause.
The countries improving most since 1970 are Oman, China, Nepal, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Laos, Tunisia, South Korea, Algeria and Morocco.
The Arab gulf state of Oman benefited from a huge jump in income from oil and a coup that removed an aging ruler who had opposed basic services like roads and telephones. In 1970, for example, the country had three elementary schools and one vocational institute, the report noted, and a child born in 1975 had a 10 percent chance of dying before reaching its first birthday. Now, only 1 percent of such infants die, while elementary school enrollment has reached 100 percent and secondary school 90 percent.
Developed nations still ranked the highest in terms of overall well-being, particularly Norway, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Ireland, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden and Germany.
The United States, which once dominated the top of all the indexes, has gradually been shifting downward. Some of that slide is linked to the introduction of new measurements -- this year's report included a ranking for gender equality, for example, in which the United States ranked 37th. It does poorly in relation to its income peers in terms of the number of women in Congress, as well as on maternal health.
Some countries have essentially switched places since 1970. In Africa, Benin had a life expectancy of 45.5 in 1970, while Zimbabwe's was 54.9. But since then, it rose to 62 years in Benin and dropped to 47 in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is one of three countries -- along with Congo and Zambia -- that rank lower now over all than in 1970, with Zimbabwe at the very bottom of the list.
Zimbabwe was once one of the continent's most promising nations, known as a regional breadbasket whose people were highly literate. But it now has the lowest per capita income of the countries and territories for which the United Nations has data, two-fifths lower than the second worst-off nation, Congo.
Zimbabwe's per capita gross domestic project peaked in 1998, and has plunged since then to a level far below what it was in 1970.
President Robert Mugabe, 86, and his state-controlled media daily blame Western economic sanctions for the impoverishment of Zimbabweans, but most economists say mismanagement caused economic collapse.

HEADLINE: To Harlem Churchgoers, Marathon Is a Nuisance

BYLINE: By TRYMAINE LEE

 BODY:
There is dancing along the streets. Gospel, soul and salsa music blare from speakers and bandstands. Spectators jockey for position on sidewalks and side streets, while thousands of runners pass in dribbles and waves. Crowds cheer.
At Mile 21, the New York City Marathon cuts through Harlem, and runners enter the home stretch, down Fifth Avenue from 138th Street. Here many runners ''hit the wall'' and drop out, or begin a slower hobble toward the finish line in Central Park.
And here, with Harlem essentially divided east and west at Fifth Avenue, life is seriously disrupted, especially during the midday churchgoing hours. Streets are blocked, and it can take an hour and a half to drive crosstown. Sunday routines are abandoned to allow every last runner the chance to fulfill his or her goal of completing that boast-worthy 26.2 miles.
Throughout the five boroughs, the first Sunday in November brings excitement, anticipation and crowds. Who does not love, or at least admire, the pageantry, athleticism and revelry of it all? 
But the marathon, which is this Sunday, also inspires a fair amount of anxiety and strategic planning. How can I get through the crowds to get my food shopping done? Where should I park my car? Will I be able to cross the street to pick up my child from her sleepover last night?
Nowhere is that ambivalence about the marathon more keenly felt than around Mile 21.
Attendance at many churches is cut in half on race days, ministers and congregants said. Preachers and their choirs have to compete with the whir of helicopters, the screaming of crowds and loud music. The elderly and the infirm have trouble negotiating crowded sidewalks, and even ministers have to head down to 96th Street to get to their churches across town. Finding parking nearby is virtually impossible. And with the congregations so slimmed down, tithes and church offerings are minimal, ministers said.
''What is so bothersome is that this event is always held on our day of worship,'' said the Rev. Charles A. Curtis, of Mount Olivet Baptist Church at Lenox Avenue and 120th Street, a grand sanctuary a block west of the marathon route.
Adding to the inconvenience, many other street events during the year are held on Sunday, he said. ''If it's not the marathon it's a walkathon, if not a walkathon then it's a bikeathon,'' he said. ''And they are always held on our holy day.''
Over the years, speaking out against the marathon has become ''almost taboo, something to remain unspoken,'' Mr. Curtis said. But the issue has been raised time and again at weekly ministers' conferences in Harlem.
Ministers have lobbied the New York Road Runners, the organizers of the event. They have held meetings with the city, the police and community boards. Many have become weary of the topic.
''Everybody's disrupted -- people usually an hour or two hours late,'' said Bishop S. N. Snipes, pastor of the House of Prayer Acts of the Apostles, on Third Avenue near 120th Street. ''But we've learned to deal with it.''
Some ministers suggest moving the marathon to a Saturday or, like the Boston Marathon, to a holiday Monday.
Mary Wittenberg, chief executive officer of the New York Road Runners, said she sympathized but that was unlikely to happen. ''Hard to see it changing,'' she said.
Ms. Wittenberg said marathon organizers did their best to win over neighborhoods by including them in the race day experience. In Harlem they have formed a partnership with the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, sponsored bands to play along the route and teamed with programs at local schools to introduce young people to running.
''Obviously this event, running on Sunday through the five boroughs, it's inevitable that there are going to be trade-offs with all of the benefits of the marathon,'' Ms. Wittenberg said. ''But we run through the streets with the support of many people who would normally be doing what they usually do on a Sunday afternoon.''
Not all churches along the route take issue with the race. Some have offered refreshments or had their choirs serenade the runners and the crowds. But Mr. Curtis said that what irked him was the city's unresponsiveness to the ministers' concerns.
''We're not against sports or physical fitness,'' Mr. Curtis said. ''But it's the callousness on the part of the city and the organizers. And it hurts us in many ways. We are disgusted by it.''
The Rev. Jerome Washington, pastor of the New Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 144th Street near Lenox Avenue, was unexpectedly caught up in the struggle for Fifth Avenue a few years ago, when he was arrested on marathon day while trying to get through a police barricade to get to his church.
''For some people it's like going to hell and back,'' said Mr. Washington, a former police officer. ''At least make us feel that you care about us getting to our services, because it's our religious day, so don't treat us as though we don't matter.''
A police spokesman said that the police try to use lulls in the race to allow people to cross the route, and that there are designated crossing points that officers will direct people to.
''It is disruptive to vehicle and pedestrian traffic, no question,'' said Paul J. Browne, the police spokesman. ''But we try to accommodate people when we get breaks in the race.''
The Harlem stretch begins at the Madison Avenue Bridge and is considered ''a turning point,'' said Russel Shuler, who serves as the Mile 21 captain, managing events and hydration stations there. ''It will make or break you.''
It is also one of the best stretches of the course, Ms. Wittenberg said, full of the neighborhood's music and culture.
The older congregants of Mount Olivet do not share the excitement of the runners and spectators.
''It just ruins everything,'' said Nicola Licorish, 60, at the church Wednesday afternoon. The church van cannot get close enough to drop people off. The choir director and her husband, the lead soloist, probably will not make it.
''I realize it's a great community event that is good for Manhattan and good for the economy, but it certainly is not good for us,'' Ms. Licorish said
Katherine Johnson, 87, who uses a wheelchair, said: ''Me being handicapped, I just can't do it. It's too much for me. I don't even try anymore.''

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rise 1.6% In Mixed Performance

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
Retailers hoping for clear indicators about the strength of the holiday shopping season did not get much guidance from their October sales results, which left some of them with more confidence and others with increased caution.
At the 28 stores tracked by Thomson Reuters, an index that excludes the nation's largest retailer, Wal-Mart, there was a 1.6 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year. That met analysts' expectations, and was the 14th month of increased sales, but the increase was the lowest since April.
''It gives one some degree of optimism, but October, generally speaking, is a slower month, so we have to look at the overall trends in terms of what's going to happen with consumers,'' said Michael Appel, a director at the consulting firm AlixPartners. ''Consumers are still concerned about the economy and the macro issues, and that's going to drive their purchasing behavior.'' 
Many consumers are closely watching their spending amid the uncertainties about the economy, and in particular the job market. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that the number of people filing for first-time jobless benefits increased last week after two weeks of declines.
About half of consumers say that this holiday season, they plan to spend less than last year or not spend at all, according to a survey issued this week by the United Services Automobile Association, which provides insurance to military members and their families.
Other factors playing into retailers' results and projections include the weather and whether the new Congress will act to spur consumer spending, change corporate or individual taxes or adopt any policies that would change labor costs.
Trying to snag shoppers' limited money, many retailers have turned to the kind of promotional sales typically reserved for the day after Thanksgiving to draw shoppers.
Outside of pure discounts, stores are focusing on financing to help get customers to spend. Kmart, for example, extended the length of time for customers to pay for layaway items to as long as 12 weeks, from eight weeks, while Target is offering people who use its branded credit card a 5 percent discount on purchases.
One consultant said that she still expected increased holiday spending this year.
''No one is running out and saying things are back to pre-recession ways, but consumers are telling us that they plan to spend more or the same on holidays than last year,'' Alison Paul, the head of the retail practice at Deloitte Consulting, said.
Thursday's results for October suggested a tug-of-war among retail competitors, as most categories showed a wide variance in results.
Several retailers, including J. C. Penney, Kohl's, Stage Stores, Macy's and Stein Mart, blamed unusually warm weather for their results, saying it suppressed interest in cold-weather clothing.
Since the need to buy sweaters and coats does not usually disappear, the warm October most likely just delayed those sorts of sales. ''November should be a colder month, which will likely be a catalyst to unleash demand for winter apparel and other seasonal items,'' Michael P. Niemira, chief economist and director of research for the International Council of Shopping Centers, said in a statement.
Discount retailers posted the best results over all, with an average increase of 3.8 percent from a year ago. Costco led that category, with a 6 percent rise in sales.
Meanwhile, the department, teenage and drugstore categories all came in below analysts' estimates. Drugstores were the sole category to decline from last year, down 1.4 percent, while stores aimed at teenagers were almost flat, with a 0.1 percent increase, and department stores had just a 0.2 percent increase.
A resurgence in luxury spending seemed to have legs, with the two higher-end department stores that reported October results -- Saks Fifth Avenue and Nordstrom -- posting the highest increases in the department-store category.
Saks's sales were up 8.1 percent, and at Nordstrom's full-price stores (as opposed to its discount outlets), sales rose 4.8 percent. But Dillard's, Bon-Ton Stores, J. C. Penney, Kohl's and Stage Stores all reported declines from last year, and the latter three missed analysts' expectations.
''In terms of the upper segment, the luxury segment, the recovery in the market has certainly helped,'' Mr. Appel said.
Drugstores did not seem to get a lift from Halloween merchandise, with Walgreens declining 1.3 percent and Rite Aid declining 1.7 percent.
Several retailers adjusted their forecasts.
Limited Brands, for example, increased its third-quarter guidance significantly -- it said on Thursday it expected earnings of 15 to 17 cents a share, up from the 3 to 8 cents it predicted earlier. Limited reported one of the best same-store sales results, up 9 percent, well ahead of analysts' forecast of a 2.9 percent increase.
Other retailers, like Stage Stores, Kohl's and Hot Topic, said the October results meant their earnings would come in at the low end of previously issued guidance.
''The environment remains uncertain,'' said Gregg Steinhafel, chairman and chief executive of Target, in a statement.
As November continues, retailers are trying to gauge whether a new Congress will affect consumer spending or their own businesses.
Mr. Appel said he expected the election might make rich consumers feel more secure and spur them to spend, but would not do much at the lower end.
''If we see, for example, a continued increase in the price of gasoline, that's going to take money out of discretionary spending -- there's certain must-haves for consumers at that level,'' he said.
Analysts are watching to see whether the markdown wars of 2008 will happen again this year. In 2009, retailers cut inventory levels, but this holiday, analysts expect them to be higher.

HEADLINE: With Governor's Office in the Balance, 2 Candidates in Connecticut Claim Victory

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN; Robert Davey and Elizabeth Maker contributed reporting from Connecticut.

 BODY:
Thursday was the first full day of work for the transition team of Dannel P. Malloy, the Democrat who was certain he was the winner in the race for governor of Connecticut.
It was also the first full day of work for the transition team of Thomas C. Foley, the Republican who was equally sure he was the victor.
Clearly, one of these men was going to be terribly disappointed. But when and how was still, well, unclear. 
Ever since the polls closed on Tuesday night -- or, more precisely, ever since the polls closed two hours later than normal in Bridgeport because of ballot troubles -- Mr. Malloy and Mr. Foley have played political chicken over who will actually become the state's 88th governor.
The two were separated, it would seem, by a few thousand votes. But beyond that, voters across the state were experiencing symptoms of political whiplash, given all the confusion and contradictions over the past three days.
''I'm hoping that Connecticut is not becoming Florida,'' said Thomas J. D'Amore Jr., a political consultant who was chief of staff to Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. ''Or California. For all of the ribbing that California takes with so-called Governor Moonbeam, he is beginning to make California look like the Land of Steady Habits. At least they seem to know who they've elected to office.''
State and local election officials managed to add to the chaos on Thursday. At first, Connecticut's top election official, Susan Bysiewicz, the secretary of state, declared that she would have the official results at noon. But that was delayed, and then delayed again, when state officials learned that a Bridgeport election official had gone home to take a nap only to be summoned by a police officer to return to work.
The drama, perhaps predictably, was prolonged when election officials said there were too many ballots from Bridgeport to be counted before the end of the business day. The work would resume on Friday.
Some officials criticized Ms. Bysiewicz, a Democrat who had once been considered the leading contender for governor, before opting to run for attorney general, only to be disqualified by a state court. She, in turn, blamed Bridgeport officials.
Regardless of the results, Republicans said they expected Mr. Foley, a wealthy financier who spent $10 million of his own money on the race, to explore every legal option.
''I'm sure there'll be lively litigation over it,'' Ms. Bysiewicz said on a radio program Wednesday.
The first sign of trouble came on Election Day, when officials in Bridgeport, the state's largest city, ran out of ballots a few hours before the polls closed at 8 p.m. They had been banking on low turnout and did not order more. So Ms. Bysiewicz, over the objections of Republicans, persuaded a state judge to extend voting hours at 12 Bridgeport polling locations until 10 p.m.
Mr. Foley led the returns most of the night. But Mr. Malloy then declared victory, sort of, in a speech after 1 a.m. Not to be outdone, Mr. Foley declared victory, too, and then said he was going to bed.
On Wednesday, Ms. Bysiewicz declared that Mr. Malloy was indeed the winner, by 3,103 votes, unofficially, based on information provided by election officials in every town. But Mr. Foley was having none of it. Declaring that his own numbers indicated that he had won, he even called a radio program on Wednesday, when Ms. Bysiewicz was on as a guest, and chastised her.
''It was a bit out of character for him,'' said Richard Foley, a former Republican Party chairman in Connecticut, who has known Thomas Foley for 20 years (they are not related). ''He is not given to flights of fancy. This was not his normal M.O.''
Mr. Malloy, hoping to give his candidacy an aura of inevitability, held a defiant news conference later on Wednesday in Hartford, and announced a transition team, led by a former official in the last Democratic administration to run the state, in the 1980s. Not to be outdone, Mr. Foley announced his own transition team, led by a utilities executive and a former state representative.
By Wednesday night, the story took another twist. The Associated Press, which had originally called the race for Mr. Malloy, withdrew its declaration and said Mr. Foley held the upper hand.
By Thursday, though, The A.P. had revised its numbers, based on more information from New Haven, yet another Democratic stronghold.
Gary L. Rose, chairman of the government department at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, said the confusion made him wonder, ''What is happening to the quality of our politics in this state?''
''Bring back the bosses,'' Dr. Rose said, half-jokingly. ''They sure stabilized things, and things ran better.''
Connecticut voters, meanwhile, could barely keep up. Over burgers and beer at the White Horse Country Pub and Restaurant in Marble Dale, patrons watched big screen TVs that announced periodically that there was still no answer.
Michael Garrity of Washington, who classified himself as ''an unemployed salesman who would vote for Mickey Mouse as long as he was a Democrat,'' said he voted for Mr. Malloy and ''was overjoyed'' when he heard on the radio that he had won.
''But then I heard he didn't win,'' Mr. Garrity said. ''And my heart sunk. Then I heard he won again. Then didn't win.
''It's just too weird. Now I'm just sitting here drinking wine, and waiting.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Surges Day After a Fed Move

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks surged Thursday as the markets responded positively to the Federal Reserve's decision to buy more government securities to stimulate the economy.
The Fed announced on Wednesday that it would buy $600 billion in new Treasury securities, in addition to continuing a previous program of asset purchases.
Investors had been anticipating the announcement for weeks and initially had a muted response to it. 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose just 26.41 points on Wednesday.
A day later, however, stock traders seemed much more enthusiastic.
After the Fed decision, the markets ''pretty much had a global recovery,'' said Anthony Conroy, head equity trader at the BNY ConvergEx Group. ''The Fed is being very accommodating.''
On Thursday, markets in Asia and Europe rose, and then markets in the United States picked up the momentum.
In addition, stocks in the consumer services sector were lifted by reports that the nation's retailers had higher sales last month.
The Dow Jones industrial average soared 219.71 points, or 1.96 percent, to 11,434.84. It has risen more than 14 percent in the last two months on the expectation that the Fed would begin the program, called quantitative easing, and is at its highest since the fall of 2008.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 23.10 points, or 1.93 percent, to 1,221.06, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 37.07 points, or 1.46 percent, to 2,577.34.
All three gauges set highs for the year on Thursday.
There is still some uncertainty as to how effective the Fed's measure will be in bolstering the economy.
A director of investment strategy for Glenmede, Jason D. Pride, said Mr. Bernanke's remarks might have been an effort to deflect any criticism that the Fed was ''pushing on a string,'' a phrase that is used to describe the fact that even by making conditions better for borrowing, it is unable to induce it at the other end.
There were also some readjustments in positions that investors had taken ahead of time. The Fed revealed that just a small percentage of its purchases would be in the long-term maturity debt, contrary to many expectations.
''A lot of these trades are being unwound,'' said Thomas L. di Galoma, head of fixed-income rates trading at Guggenheim Partners.
The Treasury's 10-year note rose 22/32, to 101 5/32. The yield fell to 2.49 percent, from 2.57 percent late Wednesday.
''By definition around election periods, especially midterm, you tend to get sentiment boosts,'' Mr. Pride said. ''And the overall message from U.S. policy makers seems to be fairly positive for the economy.''
He added that investors were likely to remain upbeat for a while. ''The fact that we do have a more supportive policy for the economy and the markets should help equities on a whole,'' Mr. Pride said.
In Europe, the FTSE 100 in London was up 113.82 points, or 1.98 percent, at 5,862.79, while the DAX in Frankfurt rose 116.89 points, or 1.77 percent. The CAC 40 in France gained 73.84 points, or 1.92 percent.
In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index jumped 2.2 percent after being closed Wednesday for a holiday.
Hang Seng index in Hong Kong climbed 1.6 percent and China's Shanghai Composite index closed up 1.9 percent, hitting a seven-month high.

HEADLINE: More High School Students Acquire Online Credits

BYLINE: By BRIAN THEVENOT and SARAH BUTRYMOWICZ

 BODY:
Brett Rusnock can follow his students' every move on his laptop: how much time they spend on computers each day at Waltrip High School in Houston, their scores on quizzes and when they stop working. He even gets e-mail alerts when they toil at home into the wee hours. ''I can play Big Brother a little bit with this,'' Mr. Rusnock said.
Mr. Rusnock is not a teacher. He is a grad coach, one of 27 in Houston monitoring thousands of students who take so called credit-recovery courses online. Like many other districts across the state, particularly those with high dropout rates, the Houston Independent School District offers these self-paced make-ups to any student who fails a class. In the spring and summer terms, 6,127 Houston I.S.D. students earned 9,774 credits in such courses, which are generally taken in conjunction with a full load of regular classes. About 2,500 more students are enrolled this fall.
The program reflects a trend in Texas and nationally as school districts seek cost-effective ways to bolster graduation rates. But questions remain over whether the digital curriculum -- which school districts buy from Apex Learning and other providers -- offers the same quality of education as traditional courses. Little research exists on how much, or how little, students learn. 
The Texas Education Agency does not regulate credit-recovery courses or even track their proliferation, though the courses have expanded rapidly over the last decade. The Austin I.S.D. and the Dallas I.S.D. each reported educating about 4,000 students in credit-recovery courses last year. Pearson Education, makers of the popular credit-recovery software NovaNet, reported its use in 400 Texas schools.
Robert Scott, the state's commissioner of education, said he was concerned that some districts might be offering an easy way out of a rigorous curriculum, rather than an avenue back to regular classes.
''Any tool that helps get kids credit toward graduation is certainly worth having,'' Mr. Scott said. ''But any time you're accelerating education that quickly, there's a concern that the quality of the content standards you're going over will be lessened.''
Apex Learning, Houston's provider, supplies written tests in addition to the standard computer-based multiple-choice assessments, and school districts determine whether to use them. NovaNet does not provide such tests. The Austin I.S.D. uses its own written tests in combination with the company's online curriculum; without this safeguard, students would be able to earn an English credit without writing a single sentence.
Credit recovery is just part of a larger devolution in the traditional 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., lecture-and-textbook high school model, which educators increasingly acknowledge fails many children. Other trends include raising the maximum age for Texas high school students to 25. There has also been a rapid growth of ''dropout recovery'' charter schools that exclusively serve troubled teenagers. For accelerated students, the number of dual-credit classes taught in partnership with local colleges has increased.
T. Jack Blackmon, who heads up the Dallas I.S.D. credit-recovery program, said the old model would continue to crumble.
''It's the vision for the future as far as I'm concerned: kids going at their own pace,'' Mr. Blackmon said. ''The traditional school is only good for about a third of the kids, the ones who want football or choir or social activities -- kids who have the school bug. For the rest of them, it's just standing in line, waiting for the factory model to give them an education. A lot of kids don't want to wait in line.''
Terry Grier, superintendent of the Houston I.S.D., expanded Houston's credit-recovery offerings in January. He had successfully started similar classes in San Diego and in Guilford County, N.C. In those cases, the dropout rate was cut in half during his tenure, though credit-recovery was just one of the programs at play.
One of Mr. Grier's goals upon arriving in Houston last year was to make similar improvements. District officials put Houston's dropout rate at 15.8 percent -- higher than the self-reported rate in New York (13.5 percent), but lower than Indianapolis (29.8 percent) and Los Angeles (34.9 percent).
The district prides itself on academic rigor and student support, provided mostly by grad coaches who make daily decisions about when students have mastered the material and how much time they should spend on a particular skill. Students in Houston take an average of 61 days to complete credit-recovery courses -- about 26 days less than a typical semester-long course -- and they are required to take written tests.
Mr. Rusnock supervises statistical progress, but he also looks beyond the numbers and tries to divine learning. Students retake quizzes until they pass them, but if a student fails one three times in a row, it is up to Mr. Rusnock to decide how to proceed. Frequently, he will make a student stay on that lesson, but he assesses case by case. ''We're not producing cars here,'' he said.
In Houston, students can work from home or in a grad lab at their school. In Austin, every high school has a Delta credit-recovery lab. During a recent day at Austin High School, students got a heavy dose of one-on-one help. In a long, skinny classroom, about 40 computers lined cinder-block walls adorned with motivational sayings and posters, including one that showed a frog hanging halfway out of the mouth of a pelican, reaching its arms out to strangle the bird. The message was, never give up.
Martha Louis, a 37-year teaching veteran, runs the Delta lab with the help of another teacher and two assistants. Twenty to 40 students drop by throughout the school day. Ms. Louis said that the classes were a great alternative for students who might struggle for a variety of reasons, but that they were not a replacement for traditional learning.
Ms. Louis insists that students, even those working rapidly, must work methodically through the content. ''They can't just click-click-click-click-click and go straight to the quiz,'' she said. ''They have to take notes.''
But students are permitted to use those notes on quizzes, which is a tremendous help to Monique Romero, a freshman.
''I have trouble remembering,'' Monique said, while she scribbled in her notebook about the Russian geography unit on her screen. Several students describe the courses as ''easier,'' a reference more to the method than to the material.
Students end up in the Delta lab for various reasons. Krendon Reynolds, a junior, takes mostly advanced-placement classes. But he failed one of his classes, Krendon said, because he did not do the homework. ''I've just got a lot of other things to do at home,'' including a job, he said.
In one extreme case, a 19-year-old who was a freshman last year earned enough recovery credits to become a senior this year. The student raced through economics in just four weeks, Ms. Louis said. Most take longer, but the main reason that all of them can move faster is because they have seen the material before; even though they got an F, they learned something.
Quilson Norales, a senior at Yates High School in Houston, snoozed through Spanish -- his native language -- and failed. The Apex Learning version of the class took him only three hours to earn back the credit he had squandered during a semester's worth of naps.
Some grad coaches worry that such extreme examples might give other students the wrong impression. Mr. Rusnock said he tried to get across the message that passing the first time beat staring at the same material on a screen.
Quilson seems to be getting it. As he slouched in a plastic chair and worked his way through his final English test, he vowed never to take another class twice. ''I ain't going through this again,'' he said.

HEADLINE: China Urges Europeans To Boycott Nobel Event

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES. 
Sharon LaFraniere contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China is pressing European governments to boycott the ceremony awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to the Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, warning that the award interferes in China's internal affairs and that Mr. Liu is a criminal, Western diplomats said on Thursday.
Beijing also urged governments not to issue the statements of support and congratulation that are customary for Nobel laureates, they said. 
The unusual request was delivered to European embassies in Oslo, the site of the award ceremony in December, in a written demarche, or diplomatic note, the highest level of communication between diplomatic outposts. How many embassies received the note was unclear.
Mr. Liu, a Beijing author and intellectual, was convicted of subversion and sentenced to 11 years in prison last year for his role in writing Charter 08, an Internet manifesto that calls for democratic reforms and an end to the Communist Party's monopoly on power.
The police detained him shortly before the document was issued in December 2008, and he has remained in custody since. His wife, Liu Xia, is under constant guard in the couple's Beijing apartment.
Whether by Beijing's design or otherwise, the Nobel award is emerging as an early test of China's newfound diplomatic clout, the product of its emergence as a global economic power.
China is investing heavily in Europe, buying debt and assets depressed by the global financial crisis and becoming a significant partner for hard-hit nations like Spain and Greece. Britain is sending its largest-ever ministerial delegation, including Prime Minister David Cameron, to Beijing next week in search of business deals. President Hu Jintao of China visited France on Thursday, apparently to purchase 110 Airbus passenger jets for Chinese airlines.
Since the October announcement of the Nobel award, the United States and other governments have urged China to free Mr. Liu, while some governments, including some Western democracies, have pointedly limited their statements to congratulations without calling for his release.
Chinese officials have attacked the Nobel award committee, insisting that the award demeans the peace prize. China's state-controlled media have published polls purporting to reflect ordinary Chinese citizens' unhappiness with the award, and newspapers have defended China's human rights record while assailing those of the United States and other nations.
Beijing also warned Norway before the prize was announced that naming Mr. Liu would strain diplomatic relations. In recent days, Chinese officials have also called foreign diplomats to meetings to deliver warnings similar to those in the diplomatic note, The Associated Press reported.
In an interview on Thursday, one European diplomat in Beijing called the demands undiplomatic, but not particularly surprising.
''You could expect it, because if you look at their reaction, it's been really unreasonable,'' said the diplomat, who refused to be named, citing diplomatic protocol. ''It's not something that looks very good, but it's something that it seems they cannot understand.''
Since the award was announced, Chinese authorities have intensified a crackdown on political and human rights activists, detaining some and placing others under tight surveillance. Mr. Liu's wife publicly invited scores of Chinese activists and celebrities to attend the Oslo ceremony, but it is widely expected that the government will bar them and her from leaving the country.
Yu Jie, a Beijing writer and one of Liu Xiaobo's close friends, said in an interview five days ago that domestic security officers were preventing him and his wife from leaving their apartment. He said that the couple's cellphone service had been halted and that three video cameras had been installed on the building opposite their apartment.
Although security officers refuse to explain their mission, Mr. Yu said that he believed ''they are afraid we are going to Oslo for the award ceremony.''
''The situation is getting really bad,'' he said.
Pu Zhiqiang, a human-rights lawyer, said he had been under surveillance since Mr. Liu's award was announced. ''They know they don't have any legal grounds for this,'' he said. ''But they fear nothing.''
Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher for the New York-based organization Human Rights Watch, said the government was nervous about figures like Mr. Pu and Mr. Yu because they ''are people who can spread the news within Chinese society.''
''The police know these people are not going to cause the collapse of the Communist Party,'' Mr. Bequelin said, ''but this is all about information control. These are activists who sense that this is a historic moment and want to make the most of it.''
Even some obscure people appear to have been swept up in the crackdown. News agencies reported that Guo Xianliang, an engineer, disappeared while on a business trip in Guangzhou after handing out fliers about the peace prize. Mr. Guo is not a well-known activist, the reports said, but may have provoked the ire of authorities by calling attention to Mr. Liu's imprisonment.
Online Correction: November 4, 2010, Thursday
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the date of the awards ceremony for the Nobel Peace Prize. The ceremony will take place on Dec. 10, not next week.

'Aftershock' (No rating, 2:10, in Mandarin) Feng Xiaogang's patriotic tear-jerker about a woman who loses half her family in the 1976 Tangshan earthquake is melodrama on an epic scale; despite Mr. Feng's abundant skill and some lovely performances, its overall effect is bludgeoning. That hasn't stopped it from becoming the highest-grossing domestic film in China's history, earning $100 million since its release in July. (Mike Hale)20101104
'Alpha and Omega' (PG, 1:28) This animated film about talking wolves in the Canadian Rockies that learn lessons about cooperation and love occasionally has a touch of old-fashioned grandeur in its western vistas, but otherwise it's funny-animal and noble-beast business as usual. (Hale)20101104
'Amer' (No rating, 1:30, in French) This elegantly photographed, nearly wordless tribute to Italian giallo films of the 1970s is a voluptuous wallow in recycled psychosexual kitsch. (Stephen Holden)20101104 
- 'Boxing Gym' (No rating, 1:31) Pugilists and philosophers of all kinds converge in Frederick Wiseman's mesmerizing documentary about an Austin, Tex., gym where people of assorted colors, means, grace, beauty and abilities meet among the heavy bags. (Manohla Dargis)20101104
- 'Carlos' (No rating, in English, French, Spanish, Japanese, German, Arabic, Russian and Hungarian) An excited, exciting, epic dramatization about the international terrorism brand known as Carlos the Jackal (Edgar Ramirez) from the wildly talented French director Olivier Assayas. Try to catch the five-hour version. (Dargis)20101104
'Catfish' (PG-13, 1:26) A sloppy, shallow, ethically compromised documentary and also a fascinating document of life, love and self-creation in the age of Facebook. (A. O. Scott)20101104
'Conviction' (R, 1:46) Hilary Swank plays Betty Anne Warren, a New England woman who dedicates her life to exonerating her brother, Kenny (Sam Rockwell), who is serving a life sentence for murder. Based on a true story, this melodrama starts out strong and interesting, but then becomes plodding and earnest -- a made-for-TV movie with superior acting. (Scott)20101104
'Devil' (PG-13, 1:20) This serviceable burst of high-end hokum traps five strangers in an elevator in a Philadelphia office tower, all harboring sins in dire need of atonement. Classing up a flimsy, religion-themed plot (by M. Night Shyamalan) with the kind of limber cinematography only someone like Tak Fujimoto can deliver, the director John Erick Dowdle remains cool when the lights fail and the blood begins to flow. (Jeannette Catsoulis)20101104
'Easy A' (PG-13, 1:33) Whatever else it accomplishes, the sassy high school comedy ''Easy A'' commands attention for the irresistible presence of Emma Stone, playing a good girl who pretends to be bad. (Holden)20101104
- 'Enter the Void' (No rating, 2:17, in French) This is your brain. This is your brain on a Gaspar Noe movie. (Dargis)20101104
'The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' (No rating, 2:32, in Swedish) As the tattooed, nose-ringed, scowling computer hacker of the title, Noomi Rapace more or less looks the part that the filmmakers don't let her fully play in a slack, second-rate Swedish adaptation of the Stieg Larsson best seller. (Dargis)20101104
'The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest' (R, 2:28, in Swedish) Lisbeth Salander (Noomi Rapace) finally wipes the blood off her face in this, the final cinematic installment of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, which feels like the concluding chapter it is, with neatly tied loose ends and closing remarks. (Dargis)20101104
'Heartbreaker' (No rating, 1:44, in French) This slapstick-infused French imitation of a Hollywood romantic comedy is saved by Romain Duris's frisky portrayal of an ethical gigolo who is hired to break up mismatched couples, without sleeping with the women. (Holden)20101104
- 'Hereafter' (PG-13, 2:09) Neither the director, Clint Eastwood, nor the screenwriter, Peter Morgan, is a name that comes to mind when you think of ghost stories, which may be why this contemplative venture into supernaturalism seems so strange and persuasive. Three stories run in parallel, converging at the end and leaving a haunting sense of possibility in their wake. (Scott)20101104
- 'I Am Love' (No rating, 2:00, in Italian) A visually lush melodrama from Luca Guadagnino about the young matriarch (Tilda Swinton) of a wealthy Milanese family whose passions and suffering fuel this art-house gloss on the women's picture. (Dargis)20101104
'Inception' (PG-13, 2:32) This elegantly action-filled brainteaser from Christopher Nolan (''The Dark Knight,'' ''Memento'') stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a spy for hire who burrows into the dreams of his targets and nearly gets lost in his own subconscious, where a mysterious woman played by Marion Cotillard is waiting for him. The film is entertaining enough but not quite up to its grandest ambitions, and it works best as a heist movie with a few extra twists and visual surprises. (Scott)20101104
- 'Inside Job' (PG-13, 1:45) Charles Ferguson's anatomy of the 2008 financial disaster is meticulous, informative and infuriating. In a strong year for documentaries, this one is essential viewing. (Scott)20101104
'Inspector Bellamy' (No rating, 1:50, in French) The last film from the great French director Claude Chabrol, who died at 80 in September, is a murder mystery, a domestic comedy, a melodrama of sibling rivalry and above all a showcase for Gerard Depardieu, who plays a detective tackling a host of personal and professional challenges. (Scott)20101104
'It's Kind of a Funny Story' (PG-13, 1:41) Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck (''Half Nelson,'' ''Sugar'') turn Ned Vizzini's young-adult loony-bin adventure into a wry, sensitive story of teenage confusion. Keir Gilchrist is Craig, a New York high school student whose suicidal thoughts land him in the psychiatric wing of a large hospital. It turns out to be a friendly place, where he meets an eccentric mentor (Zach Galifianakis) and a girl (Emma Roberts). There is something cautious and a little patronizing about the movie, which feels as if it were made by responsible adults trying, with all good intentions, to reach out to the youth. (Scott)20101104
'Jackass 3D' (R, 1:34) America's favorite jackasses are back, making mischief in stunts and skits of varying ambition and impact in three generally unmemorable dimensions. Jeff Tremaine directed, though he probably just stood around laughing. (Dargis)20101104
'Jolene' (R, 1:55) Adapted from an E. L. Doctorow short story, Dan Ireland's panting soap drags its nubile, titular heroine (Jessica Chastain, digging deep) through 10 years and multiple sexual partners. Transitioning from corn-pone Lolita to willing victim of male desire, the actress surrenders to an exploitative script and her character's disastrous judgment, finding pockets of soul in a role that's part Jessica Rabbit, part Marilyn Monroe. (Catsoulis)20101104
- 'The Kids Grow Up' (No rating, 1:30) Doug Block's latest autobiographical documentary chronicles the year leading up to his daughter Lucy's departure for college. Like ''51 Birch Street,'' Mr. Block's examination of his parents' marriage, this film, despite its unassuming, diaristic manner, reaches deep into the mysteries of ordinary life. (Scott)20101104
- 'The Last Exorcism' (PG-13, 1:28) Perched at the intersection of faith, folklore and female puberty, this genuinely eerie little movie trails a Louisiana preacher (Patrick Fabian) as he films an expose-exorcism of a teenage girl (Ashley Bell). Relying on dry humor and an accumulating atmosphere of psychological dysfunction, Daniel Stamm directs his single-camera viewpoint cleanly and with a confidence that falters only in the final reel. (Catsoulis)20101104
- 'Last Train Home' (No rating, 1:27, in Mandarin language and Sichuan dialect) Lixin Fan's wrenching and compassionate documentary examines a complex and overwhelming social phenomenon -- the role of migrant laborers in China's fast-changing economy -- from the standpoint of a family that is tested and fractured by globalization. (Scott)20101104
'Leaving' (No rating, 1:25, in French) A proper bourgeois wife and mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) and an earthy (more like furry) day laborer (Sergi Lopez) embark on an illicit affair in an increasingly improbable French drama from Catherine Corsini. (Dargis)20101104
'Legend of the Guardians: the Owls of Ga'Hoole' (PG, 1:30) Or (after Harry Potter's postal pet) ''Hedwig of the Rings.'' Zack Snyder, director of ''300,'' aims for younger males with this animated all-avian opus based on Kathryn Lasky's books. And it's a hoot, full of winged warriors in helmets and metal claws, swooping vengefully in slow-motion conflagration. Each feather, sunset and 3-D perspective is rendered impeccably, and the voice talent, much of it Australian, is top-notch. But a trite setup (and some retrograde female characterizations) keep it from soaring. (Andy Webster)20101104
- 'Let Me In' (R, 1:55) This remake of the spooky, heartfelt Swedish vampire film ''Let the Right One In'' is full of strange emotions and effects, not the least of which are two haunting and subtle performances, by Kodi Smit-McPhee as a misfit 12-year-old boy and Chloe Grace Moretz as the undead girl who eases his loneliness. The director, Matt Reeves (''Cloverfield''), uses some of the techniques of horror to create feelings far weirder and more interesting than fear and suspense. Not that horror fans will be disappointed. (Scott)20101104
'Life As We Know It' (PG, 1:55) It's enough to say that this bland romantic comedy (starring an abrasive Katherine Heigl) is well made for its corporate type. But there is not a single deviation from rom-com formula. (Holden)20101104
'Mao's Last Dancer' (PG, 1:57) In Bruce Beresford's film, based on the true story of a Chinese dancer who was allowed to go to Houston to study in the early 1980s and subsequently defected, ballet and modern Chinese history are window dressing for what's essentially a deluxe old-fashioned tear-jerker. (Hale)20101104
- 'Monsters' (R, 1:33) Set in 2015, six years after a space probe accidentally seeded a large slice of Northern Mexico with extraterrestrials, Gareth Edwards's wondrously atmospheric love story-cum-road movie effortlessly compels. As a news photographer (Scoot McNairy) and his boss's daughter (Whitney Able) journey to the United States from Mexico through an alien-infected swath of land, the director's beautiful, otherworldly effects cast an eerie pall over every frame. (Catsoulis)20101104
'Nora's Will' (No rating, 1:32, in Spanish) A slight, sentimental film from the Mexican newcomer Mariana Chenillo about a woman who carefully stage-manages the aftermath of her death. A very fine Fernando Lujan plays the woman's former husband. (Dargis)20101104
'N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz' (No rating, 1:14) A documentary look at Jerome Robbins's 1958 ballet of the same name, about gangs, teenage romance, alienation, confrontations, unanswered need and a flouting of all the rules of elegant deportment that characterize civilized adult behavior. Besides a performance of the work, the film features contemporary interviews with the dancers -- including two who dance the fourth movement on the High Line. ReRun Gastropub Theater, 147 Front Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn , reruntheater.com; $5. (Alastair Macaulay)20101104
'Paranormal Activity 2' (R, 1:31) Both prequel and sequel to its 2007 parent (eventually released in 2009), this new story follows a distraught couple (Sprague Grayden and Brian Boland) whose California home has been invaded by foul stenches, maleficent roars and crashing crockery. Clinging faithfully to a formula that makes virtues of inelegance and incoherence, the director, Tod Williams, is nevertheless unable to mask the strain of stretching the gimmick to a second movie. (Catsoulis)20101104
'Red' (PG-13, 1:51) An intriguing cast of mature performers -- including Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Brian Cox -- goes through the motions of a loud action-comedy based on a series of graphic novels. Better than it might have been, but not nearly as good as it should be. (Scott)20101104
'Saw 3D' (R, 1:31) The ''Saw'' series ends (or so we're told) with a clang and quite a few whimpers. The seventh film in this flesh-rending franchise brings the tale full circle, with an appearance by Cary Elwes, who got things started back in 2004 by sawing off his own foot. (Hale)20101104
'Secretariat' (PG, 1:56) Diane Lane plays Penny Chenery, the owner of the 1970s four-legged racing sensation, in a gauzy Disney movie that's as square as a military flattop. The director Randall Wallace whips the uplift until it's frothy. (Dargis)20101104
- 'The Social Network' (PG-13, 2:00) David Fincher, working from Aaron Sorkin's script, directs a fleet, weirdly funny, exhilarating, alarming, fictionalized look at the boot-up, log-on, plug-in generation and the man (Jesse Eisenberg as Mark Zuckerberg) behind the social-media phenomenon Facebook. Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake also star. (Dargis)20101104
'Stone' (R, 1:45) The director John Curran's recipe for pulp fiction: Dim the lights. Take Edward Norton (as a prisoner), Milla Jovovich (as a wife), Robert De Niro (as a prison official) and Frances Conroy (as another wife). Stir. (Dargis)20101104
'Takers' (PG-13, 1:47) A movie about guys who take stuff that is every bit as imaginative as its title. The clothes are nice, though, and there are some decent action sequences and performances (notably from Matt Dillon and Tip Harris, better known as the rapper T. I.). (Scott)20101104
'Tamara Drewe' (R, 1:47) Stephen Frears's fizzy pastoral sex farce -- adapted from Posy Simmonds's graphic novel, itself an updating of Thomas Hardy's ''Far From the Madding Crowd'' -- is mildly naughty, admirably frank in its approach to sex and finally not all that interesting. Gemma Arterton is the title character, who returns to her rural hometown to juggle three suitors: a rock star; a married, older novelist; and a hunky rustic swain. (Scott)20101104
'The Town' (R, 2:05) Ben Affleck directs and stars in this not-bad Boston crime thriller, with decent action, good performances -- notably from Jon Hamm, Jeremy Renner and Blake Lively -- and some fine, if somewhat fetishized, local color. (Scott)20101104
'Vision' (No rating, 1:51, in German) Margarethe von Trotta's sympathetic imagining of the life of the protofeminist 12th-century Benedictine nun, Hildegard von Bingen, offers a hard-headed view of religiosity in which church politics and money conflict with the characters' asceticism. (Holden)20101104
- 'Waiting for ''Superman'' ' (PG, 1:42) Davis Guggenheim's powerful, alarming documentary about America's failing public schools is a call to arms to modify a system that he portrays as held hostage by teachers' unions. The potential saviors are reformers like Geoffrey Canada, founder of the Harlem Children's Zone. (Holden)20101104
'Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps' (PG-13, 2:13) Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) returns in Oliver Stone's unwieldy and entertaining attempt at a moral anatomy of the financial debacle of 2008. If Mr. Stone misses the chance to turn that event into great drama, he nonetheless turns it into a sweeping, racing and intermittently pithy show. Shia LeBeouf is Gekko's would-be son-in-law; Carey Mulligan is the rogue financier's estranged daughter; and Josh Brolin is a suave titan of the Street who very nearly out-Gekkos Gekko. (Scott)20101104
'Welcome to the Rileys' (R, 1:50) Kristen Stewart plays a New Orleans stripper who upends the lives of a middle-aged couple (played by James Gandolfini and Melissa Leo) grieving for their dead daughter. Jake Scott directs from a screenplay by Ken Hixon. (Dargis)20101104
'Wild Target' (PG-13, 1:38) This remake of a French comic thriller does nothing terribly original or interesting as it swerves from brutality to hilarity and back again, but Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt are nonetheless fun to watch as a fussy hitman and the charming grifter who melts his steely professional resolve. (Scott)20101104
'Winston Churchill: Walking With Destiny' (No rating, 1:40) This handsomely produced, television-scaled documentary celebrates Britain's wartime prime minister (no mention here of Churchill's imperialist dark side) while also noting his early recognition of Hitler's anti-Semitism and his efforts during the war to publicize the plight of Jews in Europe and provide aid where he could. It has its small charms, but it isn't clear why it belongs in a theater rather than on the History Channel. (Hale)20101104
'You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger' (R, 1:38) Sexual longing and metaphysical emptiness with an all-start cast in London, written and directed by -- no points for guessing right! -- Woody Allen. (Scott)20101104
Film Series
DOC NYC (Friday through Tuesday) This ambitious new festival of nonfiction films grows out of the Stranger Than Fiction series at the IFC Center and includes a wide range of work across many different genres, from the concert documentary (D. A. Pennebaker's 1973 David Bowie film, ''Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars,'' screening Saturday at midnight) to the diary film (Josh Freed's ''Five Weddings and a Felony,'' filmed with a Flip camera and screening Saturday and Tuesday). A tribute to Kevin Brownlow, the British filmmaker who will be receiving an honorary Oscar at the next ceremonies, samples both his documentaries on silent film history (''Lon Chaney: A Thousand Faces'' and ''Garbo,'' both on Friday) and his historical dramatizations (''It Happened Here'' and ''Winstanley,'' screening on Sunday); Errol Morris will be present Sunday to introduce his new documentary, ''Tabloid,'' about a former beauty queen accused of abducting a young Mormon missionary. Daylong symposia on Friday and Saturday focus on issues creative, financial and legal. Events will be held in four locations: IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street; New York University's Kimmel Center, 60 Washington Square South; the university's Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 LaGuardia Place, at Washington Square South; and Ziegfeld Theater, 141 West 54th Street. (212) 924-7771, docnyc.net; most tickets are $16. (Dave Kehr)20101104
The One, the Only Stanley Donen (Friday through Wednesday) There's nothing wrong with American movies right now that a new Stanley Donen couldn't fix, but the likelihood of anyone coming along with Mr. Donen's combination of buoyancy, charm and formal sophistication seems distant and hopeless. This series shows off the Donen touch as demonstrated in the closely related genres for which he's best known -- the musical (''The Pajama Game,'' ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,'' both screening Saturday) and the romantic comedy (''The Grass Is Greener'' and ''Two for the Road,'' on Sunday) -- as well as his forays into suspense (''Arabesque'') and social satire (''Bedazzled''), both screening on Friday. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center , (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $5 to $12. (Kehr)20101104

HEADLINE: Rare Earths Stand Is Asked of G-20

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- One of the broadest international coalitions of business groups ever assembled on a trade issue involving China has asked the leaders of the Group of 20 nations to reach a consensus when they meet this month in Seoul that trade in crucial rare earth minerals will not be interrupted because of industrial policies or political disputes.
The range of countries and industries whose business groups signed a letter that made the request underscores the level of worry in companies around the world over recent export restrictions placed on rare earths by China, which mines 95 percent of those materials. These minerals are needed for things ranging from cellphones and cars to glass manufacturing, oil refining, clean energy and the production of missiles and sonar for the military. 
Some of the groups signing the letter, like the United States Chamber of Commerce, also signed a letter last winter asking that the Chinese government not discriminate in favor of domestic companies in the purchase of high-tech equipment. But the latest letter was also signed by business groups that have previously been wary of challenging an increasingly wealthy China. They include the business federations of Germany and France and the Keidanren, a broad grouping of big Japanese corporations that has historically been extremely cautious on China issues.
The letter was dated Wednesday but not publicly released. It was obtained Thursday from an official at one of the business groups that signed it.
The Chinese government has collected export taxes of 15 to 25 percent on rare earths for years and has further restricted exports in the last two years with steep reductions in export quotas for rare earths. When China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, it agreed to refrain from imposing export taxes and quotas.
The Chinese government halted exports of raw rare earths to Japan on Sept. 21 during a dispute over Japan's detention of a Chinese fishing trawler and expanded the interruption to all countries on Oct. 18. Beijing authorized a resumption in shipments on Oct. 28. This has not been followed in any clear pattern, earth industry officials said.
Chinese officials have denied that they issued any official ban on rare earth exports and contend that export quotas and taxes are needed to conserve scarce supplies and protect the environment, which W.T.O. rules allow. American trade lawyers say that China would have a hard time winning the conservation case if another country challenges its policies before a W.T.O. tribunal because China's own consumption of rare earths is soaring.
China has pursued an industrial policy in recent years of forcing companies to move factories to China so as to have access to rare earths. The letter from the business groups objected to this, asking that the Group of 20 leaders and their governments commit themselves to, ''refrain from export taxes, quotas or other market-distorting measures on rare earth elements that restrict global supply and unnecessarily contribute to price volatility, including through respect for the rules of the World Trade Organization and commitments resulting from its members' accession protocols.''
The letter also called for the Group of 20 leaders and governments to ''renounce interference with commercial sale of rare earth elements, domestically or internationally, to advance industrial policy or political objectives.''
Among the 37 groups signing the letter were the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the American Petroleum Institute, the Business Roundtable, the Consumer Electronics Association, the National Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Magnetic Materials Association, as well as the Brazil-U.S. Business Council, Business Europe, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the Federation of Korean Industries and the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association.

HEADLINE: Ready to Take the Reins in Two Troubled States: In Florida, a C.E.O. Prepared for Cuts

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Many of the newly elected Republican governors have said they want to run their state like a business. But few have been as brash and bold in corporate life -- or with their economic campaign proposals -- as Rick Scott, Florida's new chief executive.
Mr. Scott spent a decade buying up hospitals to create the country's largest health care chain, Columbia/HCA. And while his Democratic opponent tried to convince voters that he was an untrustworthy ''corporate raider,'' even former colleagues describe Mr. Scott as a no-nonsense leader, fixated on costs, and willing to cut programs and employees if they fall short of his goals.
'' 'Chummy' is not the word I would ever use to describe Rick Scott,'' said Joshua Nemzoff, a mergers and acquisitions expert who has known Mr. Scott for 21 years. ''He's extremely focused, and very, very aggressive.'' 
For many Floridians, that may be a welcome change. For most of its history, the Sunshine State has coasted along on tourism, real estate and population growth. But with the Great Recession driving unemployment to record levels, Florida has become desperate for something different.
One in three voters on Tuesday said that a relative or member of their household had lost a job in the past two years, according to exit polls, which also showed that 73 percent believe the economy is in a serious, long-term decline, not just a cyclical downturn.
Enter Rick Scott, presenting himself as a turnaround expert. ''I won't rest until we make Florida a model for the country in job creation and education,'' he told supporters Wednesday in his victory speech.
Yet if he manages to institute his plan for Florida -- and chances are good, since the Legislature is overwhelmingly Republican -- Floridians, and the country, may be in for a shock. His proposals, and his approach to business, suggest that residents here may soon see an approach to government closer to the conservative, budget-slashing overhaul proposed for Britain.
Behind Mr. Scott's campaign slogans (''Let's get to work'' with ''seven steps to 700,000 jobs in seven years'') are proposals to privatize more prisons, give vouchers to parents for schools and to Medicaid recipients for health insurance, and to reduce what businesses have to pay for injured workers.
To ''lighten the burden of government on every Florida family,'' as he said Wednesday, Mr. Scott has also pledged to shrink the state payroll by thousands of jobs, and to usher in hefty tax cuts -- even though that would mean less revenue to help fill the projected $2.5 billion deficit that Florida faces next year.
Democrats are predicting a return ''to the Dark Ages.'' Republicans are thrilled. ''It's a real opportunity for us,'' said Mike Haridopolos, the State Senate president.
Not since the 1860s, Mr. Haridopolos said, has the state had such a conservative concentration of power, and as a result, he said a lot of legislation would be likely to pass. Specifically, he said the state would probably revisit a Senate bill vetoed by Gov. Charlie Crist that would have established merit-based pay for teachers.
Former Gov. Jeb Bush agreed that Mr. Scott ''will have willing partners in the Legislature to do bigger things.''
Mr. Bush said that Mr. Scott's business expertise would be particularly useful. ''Medicaid reform, continued education reform and business climate improvements are all places where I expect our new governor's experience will be helpful,'' he said.
But Mr. Scott's corporate past is likely to be both a blessing and a handicap.
He grew up in Kansas City, Mo., the son of a truck driver, and he often describes himself as a self-made success. He was the hard-working child of strict parents who joined the Navy and worked as a transaction lawyer before starting his hospital company in 1987 with his life savings of $125,000.
Over the next 10 years, he built the company into a behemoth with around 285,000 employees and annual revenue of $20 billion.
His former colleagues say he was particularly successful in two areas: negotiating deals, and imposing more financial discipline (''accountability'' is one of his favorite words) into the health care system.
He may have been famous outside his company for $1.7 billion in fines that Columbia/HCA paid for defrauding Medicare and other federal programs. But inside his company, he was known for setting up a report card system for individual hospitals and their administrators, tracking everything from patient outcomes to revenue and growth in admissions
''It was the classic management case; he gave them responsibilities, he gave them authority, and if they didn't perform, he got rid of them,'' said Mr. Nemzoff, who sold Columbia/HCA a series of hospitals during Mr. Scott's tenure. Then Mr. Nemzoff laughed, adding, ''It's sort of the direct opposite of government.''
And that may be Mr. Scott's biggest challenge. He is a proud outsider who has never served in elected or appointed office.
Critics and some supporters say they are worried that the new governor-elect has little or no experience with the web of state agencies and financing mechanisms that he will oversee.
Despite his having named a transition team of conservative state lawmakers, they ask whether he can be trusted to make cuts, without dire consequences.
For instance, his seven-step plan calls for laying off 5 percent of the state work force, rolling back state and local spending to 2004 levels, and adding drug screening as a requirement for welfare recipients.
If he is unable to make such cuts, how will be pay for his other proposals -- like a $1.4 billion reduction in the property taxes that support Florida's schools?
Republicans and Democrats predict a major clash with unions on many of these issues. ''His only enemy in Tallahassee is the public service unions and the teachers union,'' said Claude Kirk Jr., whose term as Florida's first Republican governor in 90 years was rocked by a teacher's strike in 1968. ''They are still dominant.''
Matthew Dowd, the chief pollster for George W. Bush's 2004 presidential campaign, said that Mr. Scott had more going for him because the public mood has changed. ''Voters want less government jobs in the system,'' he said, ''and more jobs in business, especially small business.''
But Mr. Scott's job creation plans -- mainly cuts to regulations and taxes -- are likely to have a lagging impact if they work, and he still has to win over more Floridians.
He defeated Alex Sink, a Democrat, by only a single percentage point after spending $73 million on his own campaign, and 62 percent of voters said they still had reservations about him, according to exit polls.
Mr. Dowd said Mr. Scott would be smart ''to prepare people that the path to the promised land is not without struggle and pain.''
For now, Mr. Scott seems to heading in a sunnier direction. ''Here in Florida our problems are solvable and our blessings are countless,'' he said Wednesday. ''Even in these hard times, Florida is still pretty close to paradise.''

HEADLINE: Guiding a Child to Financial Independence

BYLINE: By BETH KOBLINER

 BODY:
LAST spring, Jamie McGurk, an independent producer in Los Angeles, knew that the rough economic climate would make it difficult for her 22-year-old daughter Stephanie to get a job. So when Stephanie decided to move back home after graduating from Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., her mother was delighted. ''We didn't get to spend that much time with her when she was on the East Coast, so it was the best thing ever,'' she said.
Unlike many adult children, however, Stephanie invited her boyfriend, Alex, to join her. The good-humored Ms. McGurk embraced the idea wholeheartedly. ''I was happy they moved here and not Delaware, where he's from,'' she said.
Welcome to parenthood in 2010. Of course, parents of adult children face all types of challenges, even in the best of times. These days, though, they have to help their offspring cope with a tough job market and, often, debt from credit cards and student loans. 
Many parents are also worried about their own jobs, shrinking home values and fading retirement dreams. That is a lot to handle. But with a bit of preparation, parents can prevent themselves from flying off the handle every time they see their child idling on the sofa watching ''Family Guy.''
These are particularly difficult times for people in their 20s, who had a 12.5 percent unemployment rate in September, compared with 9.2 percent for the general population on a nonseasonally adjusted basis, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
''The labor market has been a disaster for young people,'' according to Andrew Sum, a professor of economics and the director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University. Not only is it difficult for young people to find work, he said, but ''40 percent of college graduates under 25 who have jobs are mal-employed, meaning they're working at jobs that don't require college degrees.'' That is up from 30 percent in 2000.
Stephanie McGurk, who majored in environmental studies, eventually took a job as a nanny. On Oct. 15, four months after she had moved home, she and Alex, who landed a job in his field of graphic design, found a small rental in Burbank, Calif.
Not all young people are able to transition as smoothly. As a result, parents are improvising as they find themselves in the role of life coach, career counselor, financial adviser, real estate agent and pseudo-psychologist for their adult children. Here are some tips:
EXPECT CHILDREN TO MOVE HOME It no longer has the same stigma. One in five people aged 25 to 34 lives in a multigenerational household, typically with their parents, according to a study released this year by the Pew Research Center. That figure has nearly doubled since 1980.
A survey released last month by Twentysomething, a market research firm, found that 85 percent of those graduating last spring planned to move back home, up from 67 percent as recently as 2006. Even when children get jobs, parents should encourage them to continue living at home -- at least as long as everyone can tolerate it, some personal finance experts say. Money that would have been spent on rent could be saved, or used to pay off credit cards and student loans.
DO NOT SACRIFICE TOO MUCH If children move back home, it is reasonable to have them contribute in some way, said Ann Diamond, a financial counselor in New York City. ''If they're making enough money, you can ask them to pay some rent,'' she said.
Otherwise, agree on responsibilities, like making dinner a few nights a week or doing the laundry. Most important, parents should not put their own financial security at risk, experts say. ''I see too many parents, especially mothers, helping out grown children when they should be squirreling away more money for their own retirement,'' said Cindy Hounsell, president of the Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement, a nonprofit organization in Washington.
DO NOT MICROMANAGE CAREERS Parents should make it clear to their children that they are expected to be moving toward financial independence and give them a specific time frame to get a job, experts say. It is a good idea, however, to resist pointing out that their hopes of becoming rock stars, poets or even Internet entrepreneurs may not be realistic.
''Instead of saying you have to compromise on your dream job, let them figure this out by themselves,'' said Ms. McGurk. She added that she and her husband had let their daughter and houseguest know that their comfortable arrangement was not intended to be indefinite. ''Right now there aren't too many jobs available in the fair trade, natural food movement, dealing with indigenous farmers in L.A.,'' she joked, referring to her daughter's college major.
HELP WITH FINANCIAL PLANNING Even if the subject of personal finance terrifies parents, it is a good idea to confront it for their children's sake. Ms. Diamond suggested that parents sit down and talk through their basic monthly expenses, including cellphone charges, credit card debt and car insurance. Introducing a Web site like mint.com to assist with budgeting, debt repayment and savings goals can help a parent avoid being the one doing the nudging.
''It's a rude awakening for many people recently out of school,'' said Ms. Diamond. ''But you need to start the conversation and talk to them like adults.''
HAVE THE DEBT TALK The average college student leaves school with more than $4,000 in credit card debt and $24,000 in student loan debt. It is wise for parents to make sure that children know the rates on their student loans and credit cards, and that they should pay the highest interest debts first.
Parents should not co-sign credit cards for their children because the parents' credit score will most likely drop if the child misses just one payment, finance experts say. Also, have them find out if they are eligible for the government's Income-Based Repayment plan, which can reduce the cost of their federal student loans significantly. Try finaid.org and ibrinfo.org.
If your children need money for graduate school, steer them to the federal Graduate Plus loan program, which charge a fixed rate of 7.9 percent. That may be lower than many private student loans. Go to studentaid.ed.gov.
CONSIDER HEALTH INSURANCE Grown children may want help in paying off their car loans, but if money is tight, springing for their health coverage is a better idea. Under the new Obama health care rules, you may already be allowed to cover your children under 26 years old on your policy, whether they live at home or not. (Check state laws, too. New Jersey, for example, allows parents' policies to cover their children through age 30.)
LET THEM DEFINE SUCCESS More young people are pursuing nontraditional paths because of the abysmal job market. (Applications to the Peace Corps, for example, were up 18 percent last year, the highest since 1998.)
After graduating from high school in 2008, Zach Cooper trained at the French Culinary Institute in New York City for a year and then went to college. After his freshman year, he told his parents that he was not returning to school because he had been offered a full-time job as a line cook at Morandi, a Keith McNally restaurant in New York.
His mother, Lynn Sonberg, was not thrilled at first. ''I wanted him to have the luxury of a period of intellectual exploration,'' she said. But she is proud of his achievement. ''He's almost financially independent at age 20 at doing something he loves,'' she said, ''and that's a blessing.''

HEADLINE: Georgia Democrat's Win Was Rare One in State

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
ALBANY, Ga. -- In an election cycle with few success stories for Democrats, the unlikely re-election of Representative Sanford D. Bishop Jr., 63, in Georgia's Second District, has lifted the spirits of demoralized liberal Southern Democrats. 
Conventional wisdom suggested that Mr. Bishop's district would probably be yet another tally on the Republican chalkboard. He is a longtime incumbent in an anti-Washington year. He is black in a district where whites narrowly outnumber blacks and elections often split along racial lines. He was chairman of President Obama's state campaign, and voted for the stimulus and the health care overhaul, in a state where national Democrats are so unpopular that the party's nominee for governor left town during the president's recent visit.
And Mr. Bishop was marred by scandal: He was accused of steering a nonprofit group's scholarships to his stepdaughter and his wife's niece. (Mr. Bishop says his family members got the money before rules prohibiting such awards were enacted.)
Yet there Mr. Bishop was Wednesday morning in the Albany Civic Center -- hours after The Associated Press had declared his opponent the winner, based on an incomplete vote count, then retracted its decision -- celebrating with supporters and thanking God. Final results showed Mr. Bishop with 51.4 percent of the vote and his Republican challenger, Mike Keown, a state lawmaker, with 48.6 percent.
Elsewhere, his fellow centrist Blue Dog Democrats were less successful. More than half of the coalition's 54 members lost on Tuesday. Across the South, already dominant Republicans won every Senate race, all but one governor's race and nearly every rural House race.
So, on Wednesday, in barber shops, at dinner tables and on talk radio stations across the region, the parlor game was to answer the question: ''How did Sanford Bishop pull it off?''
Jerome Belle, 67, a photographer, Democrat and longtime friend who attends church in Albany with Mr. Bishop, suggested that the win was partly a result of Mr. Bishop's focusing on the needs of farmers (the congressman is on the House subcommittee on agriculture). ''He just knows how to talk to people, to stop his car and shake every hand in a small town,'' Mr. Belle said.
But many white Republicans suggested that the results were driven by high black voter turnout (Mr. Keown is white). Forty-seven percent of registered voters in the district are black, and 49 percent are white. Politics here are still heavily influenced by race.
''It was blacks. That's how he won,'' said W. P. Wilson, 86, a retired economics teacher and a Republican from Albany. ''Bishop voted for everything Pelosi wanted, and that didn't work for most Republicans. But enough Democrats showed up to vote.''
An Alabama-born former lawyer, Mr. Bishop said in an interview that he had campaigned across the district, even in heavily Republican areas, to persuade moderate voters to evaluate him, not the entire Democratic Party.
''It was a sweet victory,'' he said. ''I am grateful to God for allowing me to continue this work.''

HEADLINE: Raising Cash From the Less Usual Places

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SARANOW SCHULTZ

 BODY:
SUPPORTING a family can be tough in a good economy. Add today's tight credit market, high unemployment and depressed home prices, and there's a good chance many stuck in the generation sandwich are thinking about last resorts for obtaining additional cash to pay for expenses like senior living care.
The good news: Because of new developments from the financial industry, last resorts no longer necessarily mean fire sales of the house and stocks.
''There is a whole raft of new financial products that are designed to help this market,'' said Troy E. Thompson, founder of Thompson Advisory Services, a financial planning company in Portland, Ore. ''We're talking about people with substantial resources even though they are having difficulty making their expenses for various reasons. There still is a great deal of wealth and the financial product market is trying to tap into it.'' 
These relatively new options include opting for do-it-yourself intrafamily reverse mortgages, signing up for bridge loans specifically designed for elder care and selling life insurance policies. But while these options exist, they aren't right for every family. No one wants to use these types of options to support themselves, but to support parents who are running out of money, they may be necessary. Here's a look at various options and their pros and cons.
REVERSE MORTGAGES Taking out a reverse mortgage can enable homeowners to stay in their home while also letting the family tap into the home's equity.
With a reverse mortgage, elderly homeowners receive either a lump sum payment or a monthly amount from the lender. Then, when the homeowner dies, moves or sells the house, the loan, plus interest, is repaid.
Obtaining a reverse mortgage through traditional sources like the Federal Housing Administration's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program can be costly, even with new lower fee options, and it can have other drawbacks, such as limits on how much can be borrowed against equity.
But another option has increasingly been promoted in recent years: a reverse mortgage financed by family members. With such an intrafamily mortgage, which can be formally set up by a lawyer, the homeowner could potentially tap into more of the home's value at a lower cost and have more leeway for which properties to use as equity for the loan -- a vacation home, for example.
Still, despite these advantages over a traditional reverse mortgage, financial planners and estate planning experts generally aren't fans of this option. ''I think a family reverse mortgage adds enormous complexities and I'm very hard pressed to think of a situation where the benefits are big enough to justify them,'' said Deborah L. Jacobs, author of ''Estate Planning Smarts.''
Financial planners say those in need of cash would probably be better off selling the house outright and downsizing to something affordable rather than setting up such a loan. ''A reverse mortgage is kind of like treating a boil instead of that systematic issue that is causing your financial system to have a problem,'' said David H. Diesslin, owner of the financial advisory firm Diesslin & Associates in Fort Worth.
But even if the whole family agrees that keeping the house is important, there are other downsides to such loans. A reverse mortgage ''puts the borrower at odds with the lender,'' said Mark M. Gleason, senior financial adviser with the Wescap Group in Burbank, Calif. ''When it's a family member, this opens the door to intrafamily tensions.'' And if the borrower lives longer than expected, he said, the lending family members need to ensure they have enough assets to continue to finance the mortgage. This could be hard if a member of the family loses a job or gets sick.
Plus, if the homeowner dies, the holder of the reverse mortgage won't get certain tax benefits he or she would have received if the house had just been inherited.
Financial planners recommend that families with the means to set up such a mortgage look into other options, like buying the house outright from the homeowner and leasing it back or simply picking up the bill for some of the homeowner's other expenses.
A lawyer's services would be needed to set up such a mortgage, but there could be new offerings on the horizon. National Family Mortgage, which recently opened for business to help families set up intrafamily mortgages, doesn't yet offer the ability to set up intrafamily reverse mortgages. ''It's in the pipeline,'' said the company's founder, Tim Burke, noting that there are particular challenges involved with such loans.
ELDER CARE LOANS There's also the relatively new option of taking out a bridge loan to finance Mom and Dad's move to and stay in housing for elderly people. Elias Papasavvas started Elderlife Financial Services for that purpose. ''The concept of taking out a loan for elder care might be novel today, but when the car loan first came out, it was also considered a very strange thought,'' said Mr. Papasavvas, chief executive of Elderlife, which offers two different products for this purpose.
The first, offered since 2003 and called the Elderlife Line of Credit for Senior Living, is an unsecured line to cover the gap between the monthly cost of living in one of 3,000 independent communities or assisted-living homes nationwide that Elderlife works with and the amount people can pay until some liquidity-producing event occurs, like the sale of a home. Elderlife offers lines of credit up to $50,000, requires payback in five years and pays the monthly gap amount directly to the living community. ''Most families use this as a short-term bridge to selling a home or other benefits,'' said Mr. Papasavvas, who added that most of the loans were paid back in a year or less. ''It is a quick solution that gives families some breathing room.''
Approval of the loan and its interest rate, which can range from 8.25 to 12.50 percent, is based on the applicant's credit score, debt-to-income ratio and credit history. The older parent, an adult child or children or some combination can apply for the loan.
In addition, just this year, the company introduced another financial product: bridge loans to finance the entry fees into continuing-care retirement communities. This type of housing requires an upfront payment -- from $50,000 to $1 million or more, Elderlife said -- and then allows the resident to move through various levels of care as needed. Unlike the basic line of credit, this loan is secured by real estate or securities, and so has a lower interest rate.
For both products, up to six family members can cosign, but by doing so, they become liable. Lauren Locker, a certified financial planner with Locker Financial Services in Little Falls, N.J., said families considering these loans should be sure to read the fine print, especially about the interest rates. They should consider their family situation, she said, and consult with other family members before making a decision. ''It's a matter of family dynamics,'' she said. ''Everybody has to go into it feeling good.''
LIFE SETTLEMENTS The notion of selling one's life insurance policy for cash originated in the 1980s with the advent of AIDS. Before new treatments were developed, patients who believed they had little time left to live and who needed money for expensive treatment would sell their policies to investors in what are called viatical settlements. The investors' hope was that the cash they put out to buy and keep the policy would be less than the payout of the eventual death benefit.
Gradually, as AIDS patients began to live longer thanks to new treatments, investors expanded from buying the life insurance policies of the terminally ill to buying policies of the elderly, creating the so-called life settlement industry. Still, selling one's policy is not necessarily a good idea, or even an option, for every family that no longer needs the insurance or can't afford it.
First, partly as a result of tight capital markets, fewer investors are willing to buy such policies, so supply now outstrips demand. According to Doug Head, executive director of the Life Insurance Settlement Association in Orlando, the total face value of policies (the amount to be paid when the insured person dies) sold this year is expected to be about $7 billion, the same as last year and down from a peak of about $10 billion in 2007.
As a result, ''it's a buyer's market right now,'' said Stephan Leimberg, editor of the book ''Tools and Techniques of Life Settlement Planning.'' Mr. Head estimated that sellers who could get 20 percent of face value a couple years ago can probably get about 15 percent today.
Even more, buyers in the life settlement market, generally institutional investors, are looking for only certain types of policies. First, they typically want only the policies of those who have reached at least a certain age, most frequently from age 65 to 70.
In addition, life settlement companies seek policies that offer certainty regarding death benefits, low premiums and flexibility to skip premiums, among other characteristics. As a result, life settlement companies prefer to buy universal and certain types of term policies rather than whole life or variable life policies. They also prefer to buy policies from top-rated insurance companies and those that have a death benefit of $500,000 or above. ''It's a question of efficiency of capital. Investors don't want to put all that effort into buying the policy if they don't get a big enough return,'' Mr. Leimberg said.
Experts say a life settlement really makes sense only for policies with little or no cash value. Whether to opt for a life settlement ''depends on how much cash value do you have as a percentage of the death benefit,'' said Michael Brink, a principal at Pelagos Advisors, a life insurance and life settlement advisory firm in Atlanta. Surrendering the policy to the insurance company -- turning it in for its cash value -- is a sensible alternative if the cash value is large, he said. A life settlement is typically an option for someone with ''universal or term insurance, 65 to 70 years old, and where the policy's cash value is not substantial,'' Mr. Brink said.
Financial planners also recommend considering other factors when deciding whether to sell a life insurance policy. One such factor is taxes. If the policyholder dies with life insurance, the entire death benefit is considered tax-free income. This is not the case if the policyholder surrenders or sells the policy, though the tax treatment for these two approaches differs.
The Internal Revenue Service in 2009 released guidance clarifying the tax treatment for the proceeds of life settlements, and it's not as generous as that for a cash surrender. With the surrender of a policy for cash, the cost of the insurance and the premiums are both included in the calculation of the cost basis. This cost basis is then not considered part of the proceeds taxed as income. With a life settlement, on the other hand, the cost of the insurance is not included as part of the cost basis so more of the proceeds are taxed as income or capital gains. With the new rules, ''at the margin if you assume that the price that the insurance company is willing to pay you is the same as the life settlement company, the after-tax result favors the surrender to the insurer,'' said Mr. Thompson of Thompson Advisory Services.
If one sells a policy, there's the possibly uncomfortable notion that an investor is going to benefit when the former policyholder dies. The sale is likely to take 90 to 180 days and involve extensive underwriting, with buyers wanting to see medical records. The former policyholder will have no control over what happens to the policy after it's sold, and it could be resold repeatedly, with buyers checking up from time to time on how the former owner of the policy is doing. ''This is all kind of the ghoulish factor. A lot of people say 'No, that is not acceptable.' But if you are down to your last dollar and last resort, you may say, 'Who cares?' '' said Mr. Brink.
Selling an old policy may make it difficult to get a new one. The proceeds from a life settlement also may make one ineligible for certain need-based government benefits like Medicaid, said Bernard A. Krooks, an elder-law specialist and founding partner of Littman Krooks law firm in New York. Mr. Thompson added: ''People should understand what the bottom-line impact is going to be before committing to a sale.'' Families also should compare selling a policy to other options, like borrowing money from it, restructuring it somehow or exchanging one policy for another.
If after considering all these caveats, a life settlement still sounds like a good idea, experts suggest finding a good broker through the Life Insurance Settlement Association or by asking an agent or insurance company.
Telltale signs of a good broker, and what any potential seller should insist on, include treating the policy as a security; uniform and capped compensation, regardless of the buyer; and disclosure and transparency about how many life settlement companies are being approached for offers (there should be several) and about gross offers and all compensation to all parties.
Mr. Brink said that while the life settlement industry ''really used to be the Wild West,'' unregulated, with a lot of room for abuse, many states have put in place regulations and laws in recent years that require such consumer-focused practices, often updating older laws covering viatical settlements. There's been an effort at the federal level as well to better police the life settlement industry and practices, he said.

HEADLINE: Georgia Shops for Fleet of Eco-Friendly Cars

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER; Bill Vlasic contributed reporting from Detroit.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Never let it be said that the government of Georgia thinks small.
Among the audacious plans to come out of Tbilisi in recent years: To become the first city with free WiFi throughout (has not happened). To replace all Russian-language college textbooks with equivalents in English (efforts well under way). To expunge the hulking legacy of Soviet architecture (good luck). 
In that spirit, this week Georgia announced plans to replace its entire fleet of state-owned cars with electric or hybrid vehicles within four years. Georgia is the first country in the world to make this commitment, said Vera Kobalia, whose ministry -- formerly the Ministry of the Economy -- has been renamed the Ministry of the Economy and Sustainable Development.
Ms. Kobalia said Georgia -- which has a rich supply of cheap hydroelectric power from dams in the Caucasus Mountains -- could act as a global laboratory for the use of electric cars.
''We can see how the program will work in Georgia, on a smaller scale, and we hope that other countries will catch up,'' she said.
Mikheil Saakashvili, the New York-educated lawyer turned president, has a predilection for bold initiatives. His government is also flush with foreign aid, having received commitments of $4.55 billion after the 2008 war with Russia; the $1 billion pledged by the United States at the time made Georgia one of the largest recipients of American aid, after Israel, Egypt and Iraq.
Georgia is in talks with several companies, including General Motors, about the purchase of about 4,000 vehicles. Trucks and larger cars, including those in the presidential motorcade, will be exempted, since the electric vehicles available today are inadequately powered or armored, Ms. Kobalia said.
As part of the sale, manufacturers will be asked to build service and recharging stations, easing the way for ordinary Georgians to switch to electric cars.
Based on retail prices in the United States, and not including the American federal income tax rebate, 4,000 Chevy Volt sedans would cost Georgia about $164 million, while the same number of Nissan Leafs or Toyota Priuses would cost $128 million and $88 million, respectively.
Since becoming president in 2004, Mr. Saakashvili has vigorously cultivated ties with the United States and sought to reduce dependency on Russia. The Georgian Army has committed troops to Iraq and Afghanistan and switched from Kalashnikovs to American-made M-4 rifles.
General Motors, a majority of which is still owned by the United States government, confirmed it is in talks with Tbilisi, but suggested in a statement that its initial production run of Chevy Volts was not focused on Georgia.
''We appreciate their strong interest and will continue the dialogue,'' the statement said. ''At this time, our primary focus is on a successful U.S. Volt launch.''

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.
Museums
- Asia Society Museum: 'Yoshitomo Nara: Nobody's Fool,' through Jan. 2. This Japanese artist, known for paintings and sculptures of big-eyed toddlers and friendly dogs redolent of children's books, makes over the entire museum into a homey, deceptively beguiling blend of art, life, music and make-believe that includes a wonderland of wood-scrap passages, rooms, houses and clapboard walls. But the inspirations for the raw emotions of childhood here range from punk rock to Thoreau. Take the under-10 set; don't be surprised if the kids get ideas. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street , (212) 327-9271, asiasociety.org. (Roberta Smith)20101104 
Brooklyn Museum: Fred Tomaselli, through Jan. 2. Mr. Tomaselli became known in the 1990s for paintings in which pills of all sorts, including psychedelics, aspirin, anti-depressants and other prescription medications, as well as marijuana leaves and images clipped from books and magazines, were arranged into compositions of dazzling, hallucinogenic complexity and sealed under glossy, transparent coats of plastic resin. This beautifully organized, two-decade retrospective does full justice to his mind-expanding art. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20101104
Brooklyn Museum: 'Seductive Subversion: Women Pop Artists, 1958-1968,' through Jan. 9. Why have there been no great female Pop artists? That's the question we are invited to ask by this entertaining hodgepodge of paintings and sculptures by two dozen women who trafficked in mass culture imagery and styles but were overshadowed by the kings of Pop in the 1960s. Though it includes smart and cool works by Rosalyn Drexler, Idelle Weber, Chryssa, Vija Celmins and Kay Kurt, the show won't overturn standard histories of an era that refused to take female artists seriously. But it infectiously evokes a mood of exuberant creative optimism that affected countless artists, men as well as women. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)20101104
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum: 'National Design Triennial: Why Design Now?,' through Jan. 9. The fourth edition of this triennial is the largest yet and the most international in its reach. It is also, hands down, the most ecology-conscious. Design as defined here isn't about how to make the House Beautiful more beautiful, but about how to keep the globe afloat and give all its occupants access to a healthy patch of it. Reduce, reuse, recycle are the imperatives embodied in the work, which includes a hand-cranked grain thresher made from repurposed materials, a light bulb fueled by dirt, and digital images of a new all-green, no-car city to be built in the desert outside Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The architectural projects included are particularly impressive, and if not every idea in the show is strong, many are already generating winds of change. 2 East 91st Street , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Holland Cotter)20101104
Frick Collection: 'The Spanish Manner: Drawings From Ribera to Goya,' through Jan. 9. This special exhibition in the Frick's lower-level galleries includes diverting studies and sketches by Jusepe de Ribera, Bartolome Esteban Murillo and others, followed by a scintillating room of 23 drawings by Goya. The works, among them naturalistic figure studies, anguished martyrdom scenes and mischievous grotesques, are drawn largely from New York-area institutions. 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan , (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20101104
- Guggenheim Museum: 'Chaos and Classicism: Art in France, Italy, and Germany, 1918-1936,' through Jan. 9. This unusually probing, incisive and dramatic big exhibition traces the retreat to Classical themes in modern art between World War I and World War II by artists like Picasso and Leger to others, now little-known, favored by Hitler and Mussolini. With its intense fusion of art and politics, the result is totally engrossing: a survey-style piece of investigative history with a bomb ticking away inside. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter)20101104
- International Center of Photography: 'The Mexican Suitcase,' through Jan. 9. In 1939, at the start of World War II, the photographer Robert Capa fled Paris. Before leaving, he packed up some 4,500 negatives and gave them to a friend to forward to him in New York. The negatives were almost all for images of the Spanish Civil War taken by Capa; David Seymour, also known as Chim; and by Gerda Taro, who had died in action two years before. The negatives, which finally arrived in New York in 2007 after a mysterious journey, are the subject of a fascinating show that rewards the close looking it requires. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0045, icp.org. (Cotter)20101104
Jewish Museum: 'Shifting the Gaze: Painting and Feminism,' through Jan. 30. This smart, surprising look at the women's art movement as it played out in painting begins with a studious but assertive self-portrait by a young Lee Krasner and ends with Nicole Eisenman's new canvas ''Seder,'' a distinctly nontraditional depiction of that festival meal. In between are plenty of other works that grapple with feminism and Judaism, often simultaneously. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20101104
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Between Here and There: Passages in Contemporary Photography,' through Feb. 13. This lively little collection show gathers photographs and videos about travel of one kind or another. The trip might be Ed Ruscha's drive down the Sunset Strip, Doug Aitken's airplane flight, Richard Long's walk through the British countryside or Bruce Nauman's jerky, robotic march across the floor of his studio. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20101104
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Celebration: The Birthday in Chinese Art,' through Nov. 28. In China, birthdays are many-happy-returns-of-the-day affairs. You want to make merry, but mainly you want to live long, and the Ming and Qing dynasty objects in this show, with their symbols of immortality, reflect that sentiment. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20101104
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'John Baldessari: Pure Beauty,' through Jan. 9. With this full-dress, lucidly installed retrospective of a prime mover -- and jokester -- in the Conceptual Art revolution, the Metropolitan Museum of Art may finally be catching up to the 21st century. And Mr. Baldessari's achievement expands as well, given the gallery of his little-known early Pop paintings and the often imposing large photo pieces toward the end. Saved from its own rigors by a love of color and a passion for film, or at least the film still of obscure B movies, it forms a remarkable line from the Pop 1960s to the appropriation-art '80s. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20101104
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Katrin Sigurdardottir at the Met,' through March 6. This Icelandic New Yorker has created a pair of fanciful, quasi-architectural constructions inspired by two of the museum's French neo-Classical period rooms. Ms. Sigurdardottir's versions are all-white abstractions of their models, made with exacting craft but with simplified details. One with skewed windows and doors in a descending spiral of abutted panels could be a Modernist set for ''Alice in Wonderland.'' At 85 percent life-size, the other, an octagonal interior viewable only through one-way mirrors, has a magical, otherworldly glow. (212) 535-7710, met.org. (Johnson)20101104
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Man, Myth, and Sensual Pleasure: Jan Gossart's Renaissance,' through Jan. 17. Do not miss the first -- and superb -- American exhibition devoted to the Flemish artist Jan Gossart, also known as Mabuse, which contains 50 of his 63 surviving paintings and 35 drawings, as well as some 40 works by his predecessors (including Jan van Eyck), contemporaries (Albrecht Durer) and a follower or two. You'll see the history of Northern European art nearly turn on a dime, from Gothic (both High and Mannered) to the Italian Renaissance's special blend of fleshy and mythological knowledge that Gossart extracted from the recently unearthed Greco-Roman sculptures he saw on an early, crucial visit to Rome. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20101104
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Masterpieces of French Art Deco,' continuing. The largest exhibition of works from the Met's extensive holdings in French Art Deco fills a large gallery to overflowing with nearly 150 examples of art, furniture, wallpaper, decorative objects and the odd painting. Far more aristocratic than its American counterpart, French Deco devoted exquisite craftsmanship, opulent materials and historicizing design to the creation of one-of-a-kind luxury items. The desks and cabinets of the incomparable Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann quietly dominate, along with vases by Jacques Dunand and silver by Jean Puiforcat. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20101104
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Sounding the Pacific: Musical Instruments of Oceania,' through Jan. 23. This fascinating survey of aural sculpture covers the waterfront from a 19th-century Hawaiian ukulele to a tree-size slit-gong from Papua New Guinea. An Indonesian zither, with a delicate, balloonlike resonator of bent palm leaves, looks ethereal enough to drift away on a breeze and was used to accompany fatalistic songs that depict life as baffling and brief. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20101104
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty,' through Jan. 2. The Yuan dynasty was established in the 13th century by Mongol invaders in China. No clear profile of their rule coheres in this big, understated show, but there are many fascinating objects to ponder. A much clearer picture of China's cultural response to the Mongol presence can be found in a concurrent Met exhibition (through Jan. 9), ''The Yuan Revolution: Art and Dynastic Change,'' drawn from the museum's permanent collection. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20101104
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Tibetan Arms and Armor From the Permanent Collection,' through fall 2011. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Met's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Later Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, created this follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including five acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense; examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20101104
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Young Archer,' continuing. This life-size marble carving, of a naked boy drawing an arrow from his lion's paw quiver, might be the earliest known sculpture by Michelangelo. Scholars disagree. On a 10-year loan from France, the legless, armless boy with a yearning expression is in the Met's bright and airy Velez Blanco Patio, where viewers may decide for themselves if it is the real thing. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20101104
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Roy Lichtenstein: The Black-and-White Drawings, 1961-1968,' through Jan. 2. This brilliant show zeroes in on the large finished drawings that brought Lichtenstein's bold Pop Art style to full flower. It counters the notion of his anonymous touch by stressing an egalitarian mix of commercial and fine art techniques (and displaying his drawing tools). The works are free of virtuosic refinement but full of striking contrasts -- the chiseled density of graphite versus the porosity of soft-edged Benday dots and frottage, for example. Formal and physical resonance keeps pace with the pop-cultural kind, which is no mean feat. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Smith)20101104
- Museum of Modern Art: 'Abstract Expressionist New York: Ideas Not Theories,' through Feb. 28. This exhibition, one of two smaller shows inspired by the Modern's Abstract Expressionist extravaganza, delves into the movement's legendary intellectual forum, the Club, with a cornucopia of prints, drawings, small paintings and oddities like a rug by John Ferren and a mosaic by Jeanne Reynal, the early abstract films of Len Lye and architectural projects by R. Buckminster Fuller and Oscar Niemeyer. The prevalence of lively contextualizing material and sense of MoMA's incalculably rich holdings impress, although the very premise reinforces the members-only ambience of the larger show. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20101104
- Museum of Modern Art: 'Abstract Expressionist New York: Rock Paper Scissors,' through Feb. 28. The second accompaniment to MoMA's Abstract Expressionist show examines the objects of 10 sculptors supplemented by prints and other works on, or of, paper. Forgotten names include David Hare, Dorothy Dehner and Seymour Lipton. Other artists are in the main (David Smith, Louise Nevelson) or should have been (Louise Bourgeois, Isamu Noguchi). A prevailing period look suggests that much of the material is of historical interest. But don't miss Stanley William Hayter's 1940 plaster ''Hand Sculpture,'' whose squeezed undulations presage the directness of drip painting. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20101104
- Museum of Modern Art: 'Abstract Expressionist New York: The Big Picture,' through April 25. More generous retrenchment than expansive revision, this landmark show culls some 100 paintings, and related sculptures, prints, drawings and photographs, from the unrivaled permanent collection. Yes, a shortage of works by lesser-known artists makes it all a little too MoMA-as-usual, despite the presence of works unseen for decades. But there is something for everyone -- whether the eerily abstract photographs of Aaron Siskind, the immersive gallery of Mark Rothko's radiant canvases or the no-holds-barred ambition of Jackson Pollock, at full tilt in the show's astounding first gallery. The total illuminates, thrills and provides much useful grist -- both artistic and museological -- for the art-world mill. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20101104
- Museum of Modern Art: 'Counter Space: Design and the Modern Kitchen,' through March 14. Sometimes a kitchen is just a kitchen, but not often. This elaborate show, which draws from every department in the museum and includes some 300 design objects, examines the kitchen's complex role in everyday life (and lifestyle), product development, advertising, sexual stereotyping, at least two war efforts, contemporary art and, throughout, in the evolution of design itself. The centerpiece is a rare, nearly complete example of the cockpitlike, mass-produced Frankfurt Kitchen from 1926-27, an exemplar of the modern spirit that still looks invitingly usable. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20101104
Museum of Modern Art: 'New Photography 2010: Roe Ethridge, Elad Lassry, Alex Prager and Amanda Ross-Ho,' through Jan. 10. The four artists in this stimulating 25th-anniversary edition of the New Photography series move freely among art photography, film and editorial work. Roe Ethridge, Elad Lassry, Alex Prager and Amanda Ross-Ho appropriate images from movies and magazines, with varying degrees of distance and criticism. The installation combines photography, 16-millimeter film and sculpture, often seamlessly. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)20101104
- Museum of Modern Art: 'Pictures by Women: A History of Modern Photography,' through March 21. MoMA's photography collection is sufficiently strong in work by women that this show comes close to meeting the promise of its title. The span of 200 works by 120 artists starts around 1850 and comes up to the present, and it is packed with fantastic things. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20101104
- Museum of Modern Art: 'Project 93: Dinh Q. Le,' through Jan. 24. The centerpiece of this moving solo show is a video about the war in Vietnam composed of documentary footage, Hollywood action film clips and contemporary interviews. In the interviews older people recall the terror created by helicopters sweeping down from the sky, but two younger men speak of their recent efforts to build helicopters that, while based on wartime models, are meant for use in farming. The small exhibition, by an artist born in Vietnam, is a swords-into-ploughshares show, with one handmade helicopter, constructed from scraps but neat as a pin, in the gallery. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20101104
Museum of the City of New York: 'Notorious & Notable: 20th-Century Women of Style,' through Jan. 2. This sweeping, three-dimensional best-dressed list pays homage to fashionable women from the wives of robber barons to modern business executives. Their outfits, from the museum's costume and textile collection, are arranged by color on either side of a long aisle. There's jewelry, too, coaxed from private collections with the help of the National Jewelry Institute. Everything looks spectacular, though the show isn't quite as plugged in to contemporary ideas of celebrity as its title would suggest. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street , (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)20101104
Neue Galerie: 'Franz Xaver Messerschmidt 1736-1783: From Neoclassicism to Expressionism,' through Jan. 10. In the annals of creativity and craziness, Messerschmidt holds a secure place with his series of metal and alabaster heads, some of them self-portraits, depicting extremes of human emotion, from hilarity to terror. Several examples of these ''character heads'' have been assembled for this small but potent retrospective, which also includes the artist's commissioned portraits of Central European aristocrats and Enlightenment-era intellectuals. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Cotter)20101104
New Museum: 'Free,' through Jan. 23. This group show exploring the Internet as a public art space includes plenty of engaging off-line works: sculptures that use objects found on eBay, or collages of Web-based imagery, for instance. But the art doesn't always rise to the level of the dialogue, which is heavily influenced by Lawrence Lessig's book ''Free Culture'' and the artist Seth Price's essay ''Dispersion.'' 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20101104
New Museum: 'The Last Newspaper,' through Jan. 9. Despite its dramatic title, this visually austere show is far less about the death of print journalism than about how that medium has been recycled and repurposed in contemporary art going back 40 years. As if a vote of confidence in print's future, two newspapers are being produced in the galleries during the run of the exhibition. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)20101104
Onassis Cultural Center: 'Heroes: Mortals and Myths in Ancient Greece,' through Jan. 3. This touring exhibition, organized by the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, offers an unusually down-to-earth look at some major figures from myths and epics. It features about 90 objects from the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic periods (the sixth through the first centuries B.C.), many of which come from major museums across North America and Europe. 645 Fifth Avenue, near 52nd Street , (212) 486-4448, onassisusa.org. (Rosenberg)20101104
Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian: 'A Song for the Horse Nation,' through July 7. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing, beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navajo, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu. (Johnson)20101104
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Collecting Biennials,' through Nov. 28. This permanent-collection show has works by artists who were in past Whitney Annuals and Biennials. It caps an extravaganza of new art with a humbling and diverting mix of classics, oldies and one-hit wonders. Figurative paintings from the 1950s Annuals are paired with contemporaneous Abstract Expressionism, and some big names from the 1980s (Schnabel, Condo) look refreshed. Most eye-opening is the sense that some of the most influential artists (Warhol, Hammons) barely register on the Biennial scorecard. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20101104
- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Modern Life: Edward Hopper and His Time,' through April 10. Mixing and matching 32 of Hopper's paintings and works on paper with the efforts of nearly 30 artists and photographers whose lives overlapped with his, this is more of a hanging from the permanent collection than it is an exhibition. Friends and mentors like John Sloan, Guy Pene du Bois and Charles Burchfield are emphasized, and some must-see Hoppers from nearby museums beef things up. The ensemble may not get to the heart of Hopper's sublimely unreal realism, but it outlines the profound, still under-appreciated vastness of his seemingly single-minded art. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20101104
- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Paul Thek: Diver, A Retrospective,' through Jan. 9. Paul Thek, the subject of this ragged, moving and much-anticipated retrospective, was a star in Europe in the 1960s and '70s but had slipped through the cracks of art history by the 1980s, when he died of AIDS in his native New York City. Now his reputation is high among young artists internationally, and the Whitney has made a valiant effort to restore to view a sense of his varied, provoking, poetic and largely ephemeral work. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20101104
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lee Friedlander: America by Car,' through Nov. 28. The black-and-white, square-format photographs in this exhibition were taken from the interior of standard rental cars on road trips over the past 15 years. In these pictures -- nearly 200 in all, in Mr. Friedlander's characteristically dense installation at the Whitney -- our vast, diverse country is buffered by molded plastic dashboards and miniaturized in side-view mirrors. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20101104
Galleries: Uptown
Jeff Koons: 'Made in Heaven Paintings,' through Jan. 21. Whether taken as bad art, nonart or a crucial nadir in the career of an often brilliant mega-artist, painting is too strong a word for these inkjet monstrosities on canvas from 1990-91. Depicting Mr. Koons ghoulishly miming various sex acts with his then-wife, the Italian porn star and politician Ilona Staller, a k a Cicciolina, they are thoroughly repellent as both art objects and images -- all the more for being confined to the small boudoirlike spaces of a swank town house gallery. Yet Mr. Koons clearly had to do them and has been the better, more accessible artist for them. Self-debasement works in mysterious ways. Luxembourg & Dayan, 64 East 77th Street , (212) 452-4646, luxembourgdayan.com. (Smith)20101104
Galleries: Chelsea
C. K. Wilde: 'Tender,' through Nov. 13. The gimmick of making collages from paper currency is for the most part transcended here, with works involving the often radiant, maniacally engraved legal tender of some 40 countries, not all of which still exist. Appropriately, the imagery often touches on economics, history and politics. High points include two beautiful redos from Goya's ''Disasters of War.'' The collages pay tribute to the amazing color and fastidious craftsmanship typically expended on the printing of money, while repurposing them to brilliant effect.

Galleries: SoHo
- Gerhard Richter: 'Lines Which Do Not Exist,' through Nov. 18. This small, beautifully proportioned five-decade survey of drawings by Mr. Richter is, without even trying to be, an event; it's his first career overview in the United States since his much-praised ''40 Years of Painting'' at the Museum of Modern Art in 2002. The show presents seldom-exhibited work, most of it abstract, in a medium that would seem a natural adjunct to Mr. Richter's paintings and that contributes to his reputation for enigmatic virtuosity.

James Franco: 'The Dangerous Book Four Boys,' through Dec. 1. The determined multitasking of this famous actor has raised skeptical and envious eyebrows, but his first New York exhibition has its moments. The sculpture, installation pieces and drawings rely on received ideas, and the single-action short videos don't get much beyond Process Art 101, despite the technical finesse. But when he works at an arty tangent to conventional film narratives, as in ''Bill and Tenn'' and ''Masculinity & Me'' especially, a genuinely personal sense of style, texture and emotional tone emerges. Clocktower Gallery, Art International Radio, 108 Leonard Street, 13th floor, Lower Manhattan , (212) 233-1096, artonair.org. (Smith)20101104
'Kunstlerplakate: Artists' Posters from East Germany, 1967-1990,' through Dec. 4. Before the Berlin Wall fell, Socialist Realism was the officially preferred style in art on the east side. But as this show of 120 posters promoting art exhibitions, print fairs and related events demonstrates, East German artists often worked in more personal styles, expressing dissent in subtle ways. Focusing mainly on the 1980s, when government censorship was loosening, the silk screens, lithographs and etchings in the show tend toward neo-Expressionist style and symbolically obscure imagery. Though not terrifically arousing visually, for students of prelapsarian East Germany it offers a gold mine of historical information. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East , (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)20101104
Out of Town
- African Art Museum of the SMA Fathers: 'Permanent Collection, Part I,' through Jan. 31. If you're looking for some visual magic -- a Yoruba dance mask with a mini-zoo on top; a brocaded body wrap from Ivory Coast that seems to float on air; a 10-foot-high figure of the 1960s Malian soccer hero Salif Keita -- this small, unorthodox museum in a stained-glass-windowed hall beside a church, on the residential campus of a Roman Catholic missionary order in a leafy New Jersey suburb, is for you. 23 Bliss Avenue, Tenafly, N.J. , (201) 894-8611, smafathers.org/museum. (Cotter)20101104
Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum: 'Rackstraw Downes: Under the West Side Highway,' through Jan. 2. This exhibition focuses on the creation of one work by a painter of exceptionally vivid, anti-picturesque scenes in and around New York City. Mr. Downes executed the work, a three-panel, panoramic view from under the West Side Highway at 145th Street, on the spot over a 15-month period ending in 2009. Dozens of drawings and diary entries in notebooks shed light on this painter's process. 258 Main Street, Ridgefield, Conn. , (203) 438-4519, aldrichart.org. (Johnson)20101104
- Anacostia Community Museum: 'Word, Shout, Song: Lorenzo Dow Turner, Connecting Communities Through Language,' through March 27. Housed in a converted movie theater in a predominantly African-American neighborhood that is a cab ride's distance from the National Mall, the Anacostia Community Museum is one of Washington's cultural secrets. Its current exhibition on the scholar Lorenzo Dow Turner (1890-1972), who documented surviving traces of African languages and customs in modern African-American culture, is both an archival homage and a well-paced drama of ideas. Smithsonian Institution, 1901 Fort Place SE, Washington , (202) 633-4820, anacostia.si.edu. (Cotter)20101104
- 'Gods of Angkor: Bronzes From the National Museum of Cambodia,' through Jan. 23. The 36 metal sculptures in this show are all from the National Museum of Cambodia in Phnom Penh, where the Sackler recently helped establish a metals conservation laboratory. Some of the Hindu and Buddhist sculptures in this compact have been beneficiaries of restorative treatment; all are resplendent examples of one of the great art traditions of Asia. Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, 1050 Independence Avenue SW, Washington , (202) 633-1000, asia.si.edu. (Cotter)20101104
Hessel Museum of Art: 'At Home/Not at Home: Works From the Collection of Martin and Rebecca Eisenberg,' through Dec. 19. The handmade art object -- and generally art as something to be lived with every day -- finds a strong advocate in this exhibition of 150 paintings, sculptures, photographs and derivatives or hybrids, mostly from the last decade. David Hammons, Mary Heilmann, Cindy Sherman, Richard Tuttle, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Martin Creed and Philippe Parreno serve as eminences grises to fivescore younger artists of wildly divergent sensibilities. Matthew Higgs, director of the Manhattan alternate space White Columns, chose the works and expertly corralled them in related clusters, where they talk vociferously among themselves. Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. , (845) 758-7598, bard.edu. (Smith)20101104
- High Museum of Art: 'Dali: The Late Work,' through Jan. 9. The belief that late Dali is bad Dali, and most Dali is late, is once more disproved -- this time by a sprawling show that will not travel. It affirms that Salvador Dali was some kind of genius with supernal depictive skills and a desperate need to be current, which made him a precursor of Pop, Performance and Pictures art. His self-degrading hucksterism is evident here, along with his willingness to try anything, be it jewelry or holograms. But he is at his feverish best in his paintings, which encompass his faith in God and science, his rivalry with Abstract Expressionism and his determination to modernize Renaissance space. The show is well worth the trip to Atlanta. 1280 Peachtree Street, N.E., Atlanta , (404) 733-4444, high.org. (Smith)20101104
Last Chance
Liz Cohen: 'Trabantimino'; closes on Thursday. What do you get when you cross a Trabant, the ''people's car'' of East Germany, with an all-American Chevrolet El Camino? The ''Trabantimino,'' a clunkily seductive lowrider conceived and engineered by the Detroit-based artist Liz Cohen. It comes from a long line of cars as sculpture, one that includes Richard Prince's muscle-car hoods, Gabriel Orozco's narrowed Citroen DS and Damian Ortega's deconstructed Volkswagen Beetle. But where others might have been content to delegate the manual labor, Ms. Cohen did most of it herself -- and satirized macho garage culture along the way, posing as a car-show model in a related series of photographs. Salon 94 Bowery, 243 Bowery, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side , (212) 979-0001, salon94.com. (Rosenberg)20101104
Guillermo Kuitca: 'Paintings 2008-2010 and Le Sacre 1992'; closes on Saturday. New paintings and an installation of hand-painted, child-size mattresses from the early '90s, in a freight-size elevator designed to serve as a moving gallery, inaugurate Sperone Westwater's new eight-story edifice designed by Foster + Partners. The building is weirdly narrow -- a sliver -- and Mr. Kuitca's paintings, which sample conventions of Cubism, cartography and architectural planning, with coils of thorny vines adding an allegory of tragedy to comment on the trials of modernity, are pretentious and dull. Let's hope future exhibitions liven up the place. Sperone Westwater, 257 Bowery , (212) 999-7337, speronewestwater.com. (Johnson)20101104
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Vienna Circa 1780: An Imperial Silver Service Rediscovered'; closes on Sunday. Extravagant tableware was de rigueur for aristocratic dining in 18th-century Europe, and the silver plates, tureens, wine coolers and candelabra in this exhibition are part of an ensemble made for a daughter of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. If you consider elaborate craftsmanship the measure of beauty, what's here is pretty breathtaking. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20101104
Museum of the City of New York: 'Samurai in New York: The First Japanese Delegation, 1860'; closes on Sunday. This exhibition commemorates a visit 150 years ago by more than 70 samurai, the first known group to leave Japan after the Tokugawa Shogunate closed the country in 1630 (in response to Spanish and Portuguese attempts to convert the Japanese to Catholicism). Small cartes de viste and stereograph photographs show the samurai -- among the first Japanese ever photographed -- stern in their robes, exhibiting Bushido, the strict code of behavior to which the military elite was bound. The jarring collision of cultures is seen in a Japanese woodcut of a hot-air balloon with two American flags poking out of its basket, next to a haiku in Japanese calligraphy. The show offers a lot to think about in terms of photography and its role in early publicity and celebrity culture as well as a fascinating look at how societies responded to 19th-century stirrings of globalization. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street , (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Martha Schwendener)20101104

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CHAOS AND CLASSICISM: ART IN FRANCE, ITALY, AND GERMANY, 1918-1936,' through Jan. 9. This unusually probing, incisive and dramatic big exhibition traces the retreat to Classical themes in Modern art between World War I and World War II by artists like Picasso and Leger, and others, now little known, favored by Hitler and Mussolini. With its intense fusion of art and politics, the result is totally engrossing: a survey-style piece of investigative history with a bomb ticking away inside.

HEADLINE: Delays at New York Airports Aren't Improving, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Flights through New York's three major airports are delayed or canceled more often than anywhere else in the nation, and the government's efforts to correct the problem have so far come up short, the federal Transportation Department said Thursday. 
Told to uncover the cause of the delays, the office of the department's inspector general discovered what generations of air passengers already knew: New York's skies are not so friendly. A relatively dense airspace means problems at one airport can cause trouble at others in the region, the report said, and the limited runway capacity cannot keep up with overwhelming passenger demand.
To cope, the Federal Aviation Administration has limited the number of flights per hour that can take off or land at Kennedy International, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International Airports, an effort to avoid traffic jams on the taxiway. Officials said fewer scheduled flights would mean fewer chances for a bottleneck.
But the inspector general's office said those limits had not been effective. Regulators based the caps on overly optimistic numbers that reflected how many flights each airport could handle under ideal conditions, the report said, despite the fact that about half of delayed flights resulted from poor weather.
The report said that the true capacity of the airports was far lower than the caps might suggest -- resulting in a glut of scheduled flights and, inevitably, delays -- and that a decision to allow airlines to exceed the limits under certain conditions ''exacerbated the delay situation in New York.''
''To prevent delay rates from again rising to record levels,'' the report said, ''F.A.A. will need to re-examine its flight caps, basing them on realistic airport operating conditions.''
Airlines, wary of losing business, typically resist limits on how many flights they can schedule. And a no-cap policy can result in cheaper tickets and additional service. But demand at the New York airports has ballooned in recent years, with the recent creation of new hubs for Delta and JetBlue at Kennedy. While delays have fallen in the past two years, officials attribute this drop to the sagging economy and expect that problems will soon start to creep up again.
The last new runway at the three airports was built in the early 1970s, at Newark, although officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the region's three major airports, noted that they had renovated runways and installed additional taxiway routes that can help alleviate congestion.
Still, the Port Authority and the F.A.A. both said significant improvements would be possible only with federal investment in GPS plane-tracking technology, a satellite-based system that allows for more accurate coordination of flights.
The inspector general's office also tried to determine the ripple effects of New York delays on airports across the country, but officials could not so do. ''No one fully understands the impact of New York flight delays nationwide,'' the report said.
More than 1,400 planes fly through the three airports on a typical summer day, and one-third of those planes fly through multiple times, the report said.

HEADLINE: Worker Productivity Rebounded in 3rd Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Worker productivity showed a modest rebound in the July-September quarter, the government reported, while another economic snapshot showed a jump in the number of people seeking jobless benefits last week after two weeks of declines.
Productivity grew at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the third quarter, a rebound from a decline of 1.8 percent in the second quarter, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The second quarter decline had been the biggest drop in nearly four years. 
Labor costs fell at a 0.1 percent rate in the third quarter after having risen 1.3 percent in the second quarter.
Even with the gain in productivity, the efficiency of American workers is still growing at a much weaker pace than last year. Economists see that as an encouraging sign that companies will have to step up their hiring of laid-off workers.
The 1.9 percent rise in productivity in the third quarter was still well below the 3.5 percent increase turned in for all of 2009, the biggest advance in six years. Productivity is the amount of output per hour of work.
Companies, struggling in the midst of the worst recession since the 1930s, cut payrolls during the recession by 8.4 million jobs from December 2007 to December 2009. Productivity surged as companies were able to produce more with fewer workers.
Many economists believe many companies have reached the limit of how much they can stretch their existing work forces.
But that was not evident in another report issued by the Labor Department on Thursday: initial claims for unemployment insurance rose by 20,000 to a seasonally adjusted 457,000 for the week that ended Oct. 30. Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a smaller rise.
The increase comes after claims fell in four of the previous five weeks. Those drops had brought claims to their lowest level since July and raised hopes the job market was improving.
Instead, claims have risen back above the 450,000 level they have fluctuated around all year. They will need to drop below 425,000 to signal sustained job gains.
The weekly applications for unemployment benefits are volatile, but are considered a real-time snapshot of the job market. They reflect the pace of layoffs and indicate whether companies are hiring.
The four-week average of claims, a less volatile measure, rose by 2,000 to 456,000.
Claims fell steadily last year, from about 600,000 in June 2009 when the recession ended to about 470,000 at the end of the year. There has been little improvement since then.
The unemployment claims report comes a day before the Labor Department is scheduled to release the jobs figures for October. Economists project that report will show that employers added a net total of 60,000 jobs last month, while the unemployment rate remained 9.6 percent for a third month.
That would be an improvement from September, when the economy lost 95,000 jobs. But September's figures were made worse by a loss of 77,000 temporary Census Bureau workers. Few temporary census workers remain and will not have much impact on Friday's report.
The economy needs to add at least 200,000 jobs a month to keep up with population growth and to help get some of the 15 million people who are unemployed back to work.
The number of people continuing to claim unemployment benefits dropped by 42,000 to 4.34 million, the lowest since November 2008. But that does not include several million people claiming extended unemployment aid, paid for by the federal government. More than 5 million people received the emergency benefits during the week ending Oct. 16, the latest data available. All told, more than 8.7 million people received jobless benefits that week.
The emergency benefits program, extended several times by Congress, is set to expire at the end of the month. Many analysts doubt Congress will extend it again. That could cause as many as a million people a month to lose benefits, according to the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit group.

- Ideal Bread (Thursday) This renegade jazz-repertory group, led by the baritone saxophonist Josh Sinton, puts a new shine on music by Steve Lacy, the great soprano saxophonist (and, briefly, Mr. Sinton's mentor). For this one-nighter, that means material originally heard on Lacy albums like ''Roba,'' ''Lapis'' and ''The Forest and the Zoo.'' Along with Mr. Sinton, the band will feature an extended lineup with Kirk Knuffke on trumpet, Curtis Hasselbring on trombone, Jonathan Goldberger on guitar, Pascal Niggenkemper on bass and Tomas Fujiwara on drums.

Julian Lage Group (Tuesday and Wednesday) The guitarist Julian Lage, a featured presence in Gary Burton's new band, takes another turn in the spotlight here, drawing from ''Sounding Point'' (EmArcy), last year's impeccably polished debut. His rhythm section is the same here as on the album, with the cellist Aristides Rivas, the bassist Jorge Roeder and the percussionist Tupac Mantilla; Dan Blake joins on saxophone. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan , (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20. (Chinen)20101104
Pamela Luss With Houston Person (Saturday and Thursday) The title notwithstanding, ''Sweet and Saxy'' (Savant/HighNote) is a solid recent entry in the jazz-vocal catalog and an accurate showcase for both Ms. Luss, a coyly sentimental singer, and Mr. Person, an ever-soulful tenor saxophonist. They appear here with Jon Weber on piano, Jon Burr on bass and Alvin Atkinson Jr. on drums.

Christian McBride and Inside Straight (Wednesday and Thursday) On his most recent album, ''Kind of Brown'' (Mack Avenue), Mr. McBride, an effortlessly charismatic bassist, focuses on his version of the hard-bop tradition. Drawing partly from the album here, he leads an ace band with two seasoned hands (the saxophonist Steve Wilson and the drummer Carl Allen) and a pair of dynamic youngsters (the vibraphonist Warren Wolf and the pianist Christian Sands).

HEADLINE: India Stock Index Reaches Record on Foreign Buying

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India (AP) -- India's benchmark Sensex index closed at a record high Thursday, after the Federal Reserve's decision to buy $600 billion in government bonds to shore up the United States recovery drove a surge of foreign investment into fast-growing India. 
The Sensex closed up 2.1 percent, at 20,893.6 points, topping a January 2008 closing high of 20,873.33, according to Bombay Stock Exchange data. The index touched an intraday high of 20,917.0, 290 points shy of its record intraday high on Jan. 10, 2008.
''It's the Fed's quantitative easing,'' said Nandan Chakraborty, managing director of institutional equity research at Mumbai's Enam Securities. ''It's great for India.''
Mr. Chakraborty said the Fed's announcement, against a backdrop of slow growth and near zero interest rates in the developed world, would continue to bolster emerging market stocks, commodities and the rupee. A rising rupee will help India's importers, like engineering, infrastructure and telecom companies, but will hurt its software services exporters, like Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, which get more than half their revenue from North America.
On Thursday, foreign investors poured $635.9 million into Indian equities and debt, bringing the year-to-date total to a record $36.3 billion, according to the securities regulator.
India's central bank has been less concerned about the flood of foreign investment -- and its export-bruising impact on the rupee -- than other emerging Asian economies because India must finance a growing current-account deficit and an ambitious $9 billion government divestment program.
The central bank has warned that it will intervene if capital flows become disruptive.
India also suffers from higher consumer price inflation than any other major world economy, which makes the Reserve Bank of India more tolerant of the rupee's rise. The bank seems more concerned about the damage to export competitiveness from inflation than rupee appreciation.
Coal India touched a high of 344.75 rupees ($7.80) on the Bombay Stock Exchange before settling at 342.35 rupees compared with an offering price of 245 rupees a share.
The government sold 10 percent of its stake in Coal India, which controls about 80 percent of the nation's coal market, raising $3.4 billion in India's largest initial offering ever.
Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India and Tata Motors all closed up 3 percent or more.

HEADLINE: Making Mortgage Lending a Family Affair

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SARANOW SCHULTZ

 BODY:
MATT RADO is in the market for his first home, but the 41-year-old in Santa Ana, Calif., does not plan to get a loan from a bank. Instead, Mr. Rado, who works in sales for a technology company, plans to have his retired parents lend him the money.
The idea behind the lending strategy is this: Mr. Rado, who is preapproved for a 30-year fixed mortgage at about 4.75 percent from a commercial lender, will get at least as favorable a rate from his parents along with lower closing costs. At the same time, his parents will get a higher rate of return than is offered by a traditional savings vehicle like a savings account.
In addition, the mortgage payments will function like the annuitylike investments that Mr. Rado's 71-year-old father had been considering. ''I just feel better about the money going to my dad as opposed to going to some bank,'' Mr. Rado said. 
With credit tight and interest rates at historic lows, such intrafamily loans can be a win-win for parents and children. ''It's an absolutely terrific time to make an intrafamily loan,'' said Carol G. Kroch, head of wealth planning for Wilmington Trust.
Such loans, whether for a home, car or education, are essentially family bonds that could protect money from risky behavior by others.
Rick Kahler, a financial adviser in Rapid City, S.D., who has experience in the real estate industry and is the author of four books on financial planning, said such loans could potentially deliver higher returns than a double-A-rated 10-year corporate bond, which he said was returning about 4 percent; a triple-A bond, which he said was delivering around 3 percent; or a certificate of deposit, which has rates that are even lower. Still, he said, the intrafamily loans are much riskier than such investments, and so are not necessarily equivalent to them. With an intrafamily loan, parents are betting that their children and their children's significant others will have the income to repay the loan. And even if the children have excellent credit scores now, their status could change drastically -- much faster than a corporation's -- if a job loss or illness were to occur. To help lessen these risks, financial planners have specific recommendations about who should make and get such loans.
With all the news about faulty foreclosures, ''even a dysfunctional family could look like a financial refuge right now,'' said Deborah L. Jacobs, author of the book ''Estate Planning Smarts.''
According to the 2010 National Association of Realtors Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, to be released on Friday, 9 percent of first-time home buyers received a loan from a friend or relative this year to help with down payment costs, up from 6 percent last year and a record high since the survey began. That is still a much smaller percentage than those receiving gifts of money from friends or relatives. The association attributed the increase to more parents trying to help children take advantage of the home buyer's tax credit.
The following are tips for families considering intrafamily loans.
HOW IS THE FAMILY SITUATION? Financial planners say such loans are good options for parents who have enough money in the bank to comfortably make the loan, want a safe and secure investment and want to earn a higher rate than offered by C.D.'s, Treasuries or corporate bonds. Such loans are also good options for parents who may not have enough money to give outright to their child or don't want to spoil their grown children with gifts.
Intrafamily loans probably aren't right for parents who ''have a lot of opinions about the lifestyle of their children'' because a loan could make them become overly critical of the grown child's spending habits and potentially damage the parent-child relationship, said Lauren Locker, a certified financial planner at Locker Financial Services in Little Falls, N.J. Instead, she said, such parents ''may want to give the money.''
THE BANK LOAN QUESTION Most financial planners recommend that parents make such loans only to children who would receive a loan on their own from a commercial lender.
While parents may be able to give their adult children a lower interest rate than the bank, ''the family is taking too much risk to lend to someone who can't get bank approval,'' said Donald Martin, a certified financial planner with Mayflower Capital in Los Altos, Calif.
A loan to a child unable to get a bank loan, planners say, is more likely to be a bad investment with a greater chance of default. In such circumstances, gifts are a better idea.
For parents, ''you are engineering a dilemma where you will need to ask yourself if you will foreclose or forgive the loan,'' said David H. Diesslin, a financial adviser and owner of the financial advisory firm Diesslin & Associates in Fort Worth.
SETTING UP THE LOAN To avoid tax consequences, the parents will need to charge an interest rate for loans with a set term that is at least what the government's applicable federal rates are at the time the loan is created.
The Internal Revenue Service sets the rates monthly for short-term loans (like loans to pay off credit debt), intermediate-term loans (like car loans) and long-term loans (like mortgages) with various compounding periods. For November, for instance, the long-term rate for loans over nine years was 3.35 percent, the midterm rate for loans of three to nine years was 1.59 percent, and the short-term rate for loans of up to three years was 0.35 percent, according to Ms. Kroch of Wilmington Trust, who said those rates were near historical lows.
WATCH THAT GIFT TAX By charging at least the applicable federal rate, parents lower the risk of gift tax and other tax consequences. For 2010, a person can give up to $13,000 annually per recipient without paying gift taxes. But any gift above that amount requires the filing of a gift tax return and counts toward the $1 million limit people are allowed to give tax-free during their lifetimes. If the government recharacterizes a loan as a gift, the amount transferred would count toward that $1 million and could affect other gift and estate plans.
To make sure the money is considered a loan and not a gift for tax purposes, experts also recommend that the loans be documented as formal promissory notes that state the terms of the loan, including repayments, the interest rates and what will happen if the loan is not repaid. Mark M. Gleason, a senior financial adviser with the Wescap Group in Burbank, Calif., also recommended that the lending family member ''be prepared to write off a substantial part of the loan if things don't turn out well -- just like banks have been doing the last few years.''
Financial planners say the formal structure also can help lessen the chance of loan-related family strife if the lender were to pass away. ''With the right documentation, the money is treated as a loan when splitting up the estate,'' said Mr. Kahler, the financial adviser in South Dakota. ''It's very clear that the child owes that money to the estate and it can be adjusted out of his or her share.''
REGISTERING THE LOAN Such official mortgage paperwork can even be registered with the appropriate government authority, so the borrower can legally deduct annual interest payments and the consequences of not repaying are much more official.
To get the loan documentation drawn up, lenders can consult with lawyers willing to do the work for a lump sum, or check out companies like National Family Mortgage, which will help create notes for intrafamily loans. For $599, National Family Mortgage, which focuses on intrafamily mortgages specifically, will help families structure a promissory note, including penalty terms, and will also file the loan with the appropriate government authority. For about $15 a month, the company will also keep the loan an arm's-length transaction, for instance, by collecting payments from the borrower's bank account and depositing them in the lender's account.
Tim Burke, founder of National Family Mortgage, was previously social-lending sales manager for Virgin Money in the United States, which offered similar services for all customers until about a year ago and recently closed its operation in the United States, according to a spokeswoman for Virgin USA. ''Virgin Money U.S. is no longer in operation,'' she said. ''The difficult macro environment in the U.S. made it tough to scale the social-lending business as anticipated.''
RATE CHANGES AND PREPAYING Financial planners say parents can build clauses into loans that ensure neither party is hurt if rates change. For instance, the lender could have the option to raise rates after a certain time period and the borrower could have the option to prepay with no penalty. And they recommend including all children in the discussion when setting up the loan and making sure to reflect the loan in estate plans.
Such provisions can go a long way toward protecting relationships. Intrafamily loans can also benefit families in ways beyond financial returns. For Roey Diefendorf, 58, chief executive of financial planning firm Diefendorf Capital in Locust Valley, N.Y., giving his daughter an intrafamily mortgage enabled her to buy a house close to his that she might not otherwise have been able to afford. ''The best investment I can have is to have my grandchildren eight minutes away,'' he said.

HEADLINE: German Artist Wins $100,000 Prize

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Hans-Peter Feldmann, a German artist known for creating carefully conceived installations from everyday images, has won this year's Hugo Boss Prize, the Guggenheim announced on Thursday night.
The $100,000 award, established in 1996 by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation and named for the German men's wear company that sponsors it, is given every two years for significant achievement in contemporary art.
Mr. Feldmann, 69, is the oldest artist ever to win the prize, officials at the Guggenheim said. It is generally given to an emerging candidate, but the jury said Mr. Feldmann epitomized the best of contemporary art right now.
''This prize should not be limited by age but by how the work is perceived over many, many years,'' said Udo Kittelmann, director of the Nationalgalerie in Berlin, who was a member of the six-person jury of arts professionals. ''If you look at his work, you would not know he is over 60 years old, it seems so energetic and fresh and has been so influential to a younger generation of artists.'' 
The other artists on the shortlist, who were in their 30s and 40s, included Cao Fei, a Beijing artist whose work explores the evolution of Chinese society and cultural trends; Natascha Sadr Haghighian, a conceptual artist who lives in Berlin and creates video, performance, computer and sound pieces; Roman Ondak, a Slovakian artist who lives and works in the capital, Bratislava, where he stages performances and installations; Walid Raad, a Lebanese conceptual artist who lives and works in Beirut and New York and whose political commentary includes a multimedia piece depicting the Lebanese civil war of the 1980s; and Apichatpong Weerasethakul, a Thai filmmaker who investigates political and sociological subjects in his work.
Mr. Feldmann is better known in Europe; he lives in Dusseldorf and has had many exhibitions in Spain, Sweden and Germany.
His series ''100 Years'' was featured in a show at MoMAP.S. 1 in Long Island City, Queens, in 2004-5. And two years ago his work was on view at the International Center of Photography in Midtown Manhattan, when he filled a room with the framed front pages of 100 newspapers -- from New York, Paris, Dubai, Sydney, Seoul and elsewhere -- printed on Sept. 12, 2001.
In addition to the financial award, the prize includes an exhibition of the winner's work, which will be on view at the Guggenheim Museum in New York from May 20 to Sept. 5.
RELIGHTING THE FRICK
If things are looking a bit brighter at the Frick Collection these days, that's because they are. For the past four years Anne L. Poulet, the Frick's director, has been overseeing a gentle renovation of parts of this 1913-14 mansion, which was built for Henry Clay Frick, the Pittsburgh industrialist.
Last year the Living Hall was refurbished, its oak paneling waxed to a honeyed sheen, the ceiling repainted and the rug cleaned. And the nearby East Gallery got a facelift too. For the first time since 1945, its wall fabric was replaced (the new material closely matched an original swatch that was discovered in its archives); the floors and wall paneling were refinished; and subtle pinpoint lighting was installed.
Now the noted Boucher Room has reopened after being closed for three months for restoration and relighting. ''It's like decorating one's own home,'' Ms. Poulet said in a telephone interview. ''Once you get done with one room, the others suddenly look shabby.''
Ms. Poulet hired a Paris-trained artisan, Pierre Finkelstein, to restore the 1916 wood paneling. Using a technique inspired by 18th-century craftsmen who used glue-based paints, he has recreated the polychrome details and gilding. This treatment, officials at the Frick said, is thought to have been used by Andre Carlhian, the Paris decorator whom the art dealer Joseph Duveen hired to create the paneling when he put together the entire room -- paintings and all -- for Frick.
''There was a complete rethinking of the entire room,'' Ms. Poulet explained. The parquet floors were refinished and the crystal chandelier cleaned. But perhaps the biggest change visitors will notice is the lighting.
''It had to be completely redone because there were hot spots, and one couldn't see the entire paintings or objects,'' Ms. Poulet said.
Richard Renfro, the lighting designer who recently installed new lighting in the Morgan Library & Museum's refurbished building, has been working on rooms in the Frick. Most recently he created a system of tungsten halogen lighting in the Boucher Room so that visitors can better focus on the paintings as well as on the Sevres porcelains and the furnishings, which include a writing table by the French royal cabinetmaker Jean-Henri Riesener.
The Frick's long West Gallery has been relighted by Anita Jorgensen. The largest space in the museum, it was once Frick's private picture gallery, and it is where visitors can see Renaissance bronzes along with paintings by Vermeer and Rembrandt, Van Dyck and Veronese.
In both spaces the lighting can be adjusted as natural illumination changes during the day.
This isn't the end of Ms. Poulet's projects. Right now the Enamels Room is closed while the lighting is being updated. And next is the dining room, which hasn't been touched for decades.
NEW AT THE GALLERIES
The contemporary-art auctions that start here next week may be packed with Pop Art, Minimalism and more, but they don't seem to be stunting the growth of many of the city's top galleries. Here are some of the latest developments.
In June, after Jeffrey Deitch became director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, and his SoHo gallery, Deitch Projects, closed, several artists and artist estates were left scrambling for representation. Among them was the Keith Haring Foundation, which since the death of the graffiti artist Keith Haring in 1990 has administered his estate and studio. This week the Chelsea dealer Barbara Gladstone announced that she would represent the Haring Studio in Manhattan.
''I've been interested in Keith's work since I commissioned him to do his first set of prints in 1982,'' Ms. Gladstone said. ''So I see this as a homecoming.''
Meanwhile the Gagosian empire continues to grow, adding the German photographer Andreas Gursky to the long list of artists it represents. The gallery will show Mr. Gursky in the United States, while Spruth Magers, a dealer with space in Berlin and London, will continue to represent him in Europe. This year Gagosian showed Mr. Gursky's new ''Ocean'' series in Los Angeles. Now it plans a large exhibition of more new work in one of its Chelsea galleries in the fall.
Another Chelsea dealer, Paul Kasmin, is opening a European gallery. But instead of space in an art capital like London, Paris or Rome, Mr. Kasmin has chosen an Ottoman town house by the Bosphorus in Istanbul. The site opens on Dec. 9 with a show of work by the photographer David LaChapelle.
''I've been looking to expand in Europe for quite some time,'' Mr. Kasmin said via e-mail. ''Istanbul seemed to be the city with the most exciting possibilities, both geographic and economic.''

HEADLINE: Income Security in Your 80s, Bought in Your 60s

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
WOULD you be willing to place a bet that you'll live past the age of 80? What about 85?
A relatively new product, known as longevity insurance, allows you to put money on those odds -- and the longer you can beat them, the more money you stand to collect. But the point isn't about making a ghoulish gamble. The insurance is a way to protect you from running out of money should you live to a ripe old age, though it turns your retirement years into something of a contest with the insurance company.
At its core, longevity insurance is simply a deferred annuity: you hand over a pile of cash to an insurance company, usually around the time you retire. But the guaranteed payments begin much later, usually around 80 or 85, and last for the rest of your life. As with homeowner's policies and other types of insurance, the idea is to give up a smaller amount of money now, for a potentially larger payout later. 
Though many retirees are loath to part with thousands of dollars for a benefit they may never receive, some baby boomers may decide it's worth the gamble. Consider this: for a healthy 65-year-old couple, there is a 50 percent chance that at least one of them will live until 92, according to the Society of Actuaries.
Even if you don't live that long, the insurance removes some of the uncertainty of how much you can afford to spend in retirement. If you know you have a guaranteed stream of income that will kick in at age 85, for instance, you may be able to spend down your portfolio a little more aggressively before then. The idea is to buy enough insurance so that you'll be able to maintain your lifestyle after the payments begin.
''I think it is going to be one of the most important investment vehicles of the next decade,'' said Harold R. Evensky, an independent financial planner in Coral Gables, Fla., who has been critical of annuities in the past. ''There is no question that a large percentage of the public will be facing a problem maintaining their lifestyle in retirement as daily expenses and inflation erodes their nest egg.''
As attractive as the product sounds, at least in theory, there are several caveats. The biggest drawback, obviously, is that you may never recoup your initial premium. Some companies allow your heirs to receive some or all of your money, but adding those features can double your costs. It may be more cost-effective to view the annuity as a pure insurance policy.
''Unlike other annuity products, this has more in common with fire insurance,'' said Christopher O. Blunt, an executive vice president at New York Life. ''To leverage it properly, you don't want to think of it as an investment. You want to think about the risk of running out of money and how devastating that would be, and how much money you would have to put up to take that risk off the table.''
Given the odds, it's cheaper to buy longevity insurance than to build, say, a bond portfolio that will produce the same amount of income, experts said. It is also significantly less expensive than buying an immediate annuity, whose payments begin right away. It's hard to generalize, but Jason S. Scott, the managing director of the Financial Engines Retiree Research Center who has analyzed longevity insurance, said that retirees might consider carving out about 15 percent of their retirement savings to buy the insurance.
At the Hartford Financial Services Group, for instance, it would cost a 65-year-old man $18,425 to buy $1,000 in guaranteed monthly income that begins at age 85, compared to $23,272 for a woman. It would cost $33,203 to cover both partners' lives -- which is much less than the $211,000 they would need to buy an immediate annuity. The longer you wait to collect the income, the lower your premium.
There are risks to consider. Since your payments don't begin for many years, perhaps even decades, inflation can diminish your future payments' purchasing power. Social Security, which increases with inflation, will provide a partial hedge. But it may pay to buy a larger amount of income, especially if you believe most of your expenses will be vulnerable to inflation, said Mr. Scott of Financial Engines. If you don't expect to receive the income for 15 years, you might increase the amount you need by 2 to 3 percent a year over that time period to arrive at an inflation-adjusted number, he added.
Another big question is the financial stability of specific insurance companies many years in the future. That's why financial planners suggest buying annuities from several providers. Should a company fail, the states have guarantee associations that would provide coverage up to certain limits -- typically $100,000 to $250,000 -- based on the value of your projected annuity benefits.
Here is a look at what types of longevity insurance are available or coming soon:
METLIFE In its ''maximum income version,'' payments begin at age 85, but if you die before then, you get nothing. MetLife's second type of longevity insurance is more flexible and therefore more popular because it provides a death benefit for your heirs, it permits you to back out of the contract, and you can choose when you would like to start receiving income.
If you die before the payouts begin, your heirs will get back your lump sum, plus 3 percent interest or, if you chose to lock in a so-called guaranteed period, your beneficiaries would receive the income until that period was completed. On top of that, you can decide to take all or part of your lump sum back, as long as you do it within two months after your payouts begin.
All of the added flexibility comes at a cost. A 65-year-old couple would pay about $60,600 for the more flexible insurance that pays $1,000 a month beginning at age 85. A contract with no extras would cost about half, or $29,900.
HARTFORD This company sells pure longevity insurance without any extra features, or you can customize a policy with various options. Unlike MetLife, for instance, you can arrange to have your paychecks rise each year to protect against inflation. Or, your heirs can receive a refund should you die before you collect the money initially paid.
NEW YORK LIFE The insurer initially developed a longevity insurance product five years ago, but it never made it available because there wasn't much demand. It expects to start offering its products in the first half of 2011. Consumers will be able to choose when they want their paychecks to start, though they must begin by age 85.
Meanwhile, the company also offers an immediate annuity that allows you to schedule a one-time increase in your payment, up to five times the original amount (you can also choose to decrease it by half). Like longevity insurance, a guaranteed jump in your future income allows you to more freely spend down your retirement savings.
Another company, Symetra Financial, offers longevity insurance, while Vanguard continues to monitor the market. ''The thing we have been struggling with is how many investors are far-sighted enough to purchase it,'' said Stephen P. Utkus, director of the Vanguard Center for Retirement Research. ''People in general are impatient, and they struggle with making very far-sighted decisions.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 15, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article in the Your Money special section on Nov. 5, about longevity insurance, a product that allows people to insure against outliving their retirement assets, described imprecisely the benefits of a state guarantee association should an insurance company fail. The association would provide coverage based on the value of the insured's projected annuity benefits; it would not be based on the amount paid for the insurance and thus would not necessarily ''pay back the amount you invested.''

HEADLINE: Greece Charges 2 Suspects in Bomb Plot

BYLINE: By NIKI KITSANTONIS and RACHEL DONADIO; Niki Kitsantonis reported from Athens, and Rachel Donadio from Rome.

 BODY:
ATHENS -- With the eyes of the world -- and the financial markets -- paying close attention to Greece ahead of crucial regional elections this weekend, the country was on high alert on Thursday as developments regarding an elaborate plot involving letter bombs addressed to foreign embassies in Athens stretched into a fourth day.
The authorities in Athens found another explosive device on Thursday, this one addressed to the French Embassy, and also formally charged two men, accusing them of sending similar crude explosive devices to the German, Italian and French Embassies in Athens this week in packages addressed to those countries' leaders. 
In a country where 1970s-style political terrorism has never entirely disappeared, the police said that one of the two men charged was believed to have ties to the Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire, a leftist group that since its founding in 2008 has claimed responsibility for several bomb attacks against the Greek police, politicians and other targets.
Although the authorities said the explosives were relatively mild -- one security expert called them the product of ''inventive amateurism'' -- the packages contributed to a growing sense of instability here ahead of elections on Sunday. The vote is expected to be a referendum on the deeply unpopular austerity measures of the government of Prime Minister George Papandreou.
''I do think there is a danger, even though these groups are modest and amateurish, that this will only exacerbate Greece's image problem at a very critical time,'' said Ian Lesser, who directs the Mediterranean affairs programs at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.
''When you are facing the prospect of the restructuring of Greek debt, and the international community is looking on a daily basis, it does become critical,'' Mr. Lesser added.
Indeed, Greece has been under an international microscope since May, when it adopted a raft of austerity measures in exchange for a pledge of more than $150 billion in loans from its European Union partners and the International Monetary Fund.
Those measures, which included cuts to pensions and civil servants' wages as well as tax increases, were aimed at reducing the country's debt and budget deficit, but they have not gone over well with Greeks.
On Nov. 15, the Communist-backed labor union, PAME, plans to hold a protest rally in central Athens to coincide with the scheduled arrival of I.M.F. inspectors. On Dec. 15, the main labor union, GSEE, which represents half a million people, is expected to hold a 24-hour strike.
On Thursday, hundreds of firemen and dock workers staged vehement rallies in the city center, protesting salary cuts and demanding job security. The police cordoned off the area in front of Parliament after another package set off an alert; the area was reopened after the package turned out to contain books.
This week, Mr. Papandreou took pains to say that the letter-bomb plot was not linked to the powerful parcel bombs suspected of having been shipped from Yemen last week by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and intercepted in Britain and Dubai when officials acted on a tip from Saudi intelligence.
In Greece, one device exploded Monday and two exploded on Tuesday; one person suffered minor injuries.
Most of the devices were sent to foreign embassies in Athens. But one, addressed to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, was found in her office's mailroom in Germany, and another, addressed to the Italian leader, Silvio Berlusconi, was intercepted in Italy.
On Thursday, a package addressed to President Nicolas Sarkozy of France was returned by French Embassy officials in Athens to a courier service in the Athens area, where bomb experts detonated it. The explosives were hidden in a hollowed-out volume of the complete works of George Souris, a Greek satirical poet of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Agence France-Presse reported.
In all, officials have dealt with 12 confirmed bombs in Greece this week, including ones addressed to the embassies of Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Chile, Mexico and Russia. Three bombs exploded, two at the Swiss and Russian Embassies. The third, which had been destined for the Mexican Embassy, blew up in the hands of a courier company worker, causing minor burns.
On Thursday, the police in Athens formally charged two men, Gerasimos Tsakalos, 24, and Panagiotis Argyrou, 22, with terrorism offenses. Citing court papers, The Associated Press reported that one was a college student and the other unemployed.
The police said that Mr. Argyrou was charged with membership in a criminal organization and involvement in three attacks on Greek targets in 2009. The Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire claimed responsibility in each case. Greek officers have intensified their search for five other people suspected of being members of the Conspiracy of the Cells of Fire.
Security experts said the senders of the letters wanted to send a message.
''A crucial goal of the anarchists is always to humiliate the authorities,'' said J. Brady Kiesling, a former United States diplomat and a terrorism expert in Greece. ''Especially to say, 'You spend all this time cracking down, and we can still get a bomb into Merkel's office.' ''
Mary Bossis, a security expert at the University of Piraeus, said the letter bombers had clearly wanted ''to internationalize their activity.'' But she added that they had an incoherent agenda. ''We can call it inventive amateurism,'' she said. ''Very dangerous, but very inventive.''
The Greek police and civil aviation authority said shipments of foreign-bound letters and small packages would resume Friday, after a 48-hour suspension.

HEADLINE: After Months of Feuding, Obama Makes Overture to Business Group

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama is moving to cool down his war with the United States Chamber of Commerce, one of the most bitter political feuds of the last two years.
By last summer, the chief executive of the chamber, one of the nation's leading business groups, accused Mr. Obama and the administration of pursuing ''an ill-advised course of government expansion, major tax increases, massive deficits and job-destroying regulations.''
But this week, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, met with the chief executive, Thomas J. Donohue, to discuss international economic issues. In his news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Obama came close to conceding the chamber's main argument, that American businesses had concluded -- wrongly, in Mr. Obama's view -- that his policies were antibusiness. 
''I think business took the message that, well, gosh, it seems like we may be always painted as the bad guy,'' Mr. Obama told reporters. He acknowledged that a relationship with the business community had not been ''managed by me as well as it needed to be.''
Almost from the day Mr. Obama began pushing the health care overhaul in his first year, he began drawing the ire of top officials in the chamber's headquarters, on the other side of Lafayette Park from the White House. And during the midterm campaigns, the president essentially accused the chamber of illegally funneling money from foreign sources to Republican candidates, a charge the chamber vehemently denied.
Given the administration's agenda, business groups will continue to have plenty to disagree about, and the chamber has pledged to be aggressive. But the hope is that the difficult early stages of the relationship will cool in favor of consultation and agreements to disagree.
In the news conference, Mr. Obama did not mention the chamber. But he seemed to suggest that his often-repeated goal of creating ''new rules of the road'' for business needed to be better balanced against a new appreciation for the need to buck up firms that were struggling in the faltering economy.
''I've got to take responsibility in terms of making sure that I make clear to the business community as well as to the country that the most important thing we can do is to boost and encourage our business sector, and make sure that they're hiring,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We do have specific plans in terms of how we can structure that outreach.''
The outreach includes the meeting this week between Mr. Geithner and Mr. Donohue, according to an administration official briefed on the discussions. The pair talked about the president's coming Asia trip, including issues relating to the Group of 20 economic meeting, China and South Korea, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private meeting.
The administration official said the meeting with Mr. Donohue was ''actually pretty constructive on the international economic front.'' In an interview, Tami Overby, the vice president for Asia at the Chamber of Commerce, said she would give Mr. Obama ''high marks'' for his recent work to complete a trade pact with South Korea.
Mr. Obama said his administration had already been ''talking to C.E.O.'s constantly.'' But he declined to be specific about the outreach he intended with business. He also said he would be taking American executives along with him on Friday when he leaves for Asia in the hopes of helping to open foreign markets to more American businesses.
Less than a month ago, in a public letter, Mr. Donohue accused the White House of a ''smear campaign'' against his organization. He wrote: ''The administration and its Congressional allies are desperately trying to change the subject away from our stalled economy and nearly double-digit unemployment. They hope that by demonizing those who oppose their failed policies, they can fire up their dispirited and disappointed base and silence our voice.''
And yet, both sides have now had victories. Mr. Obama bested the chamber in the first two years of his term, passing health care legislation and an overhaul of financial regulations over the group's heated opposition. The chamber clearly won the most recent round, helping Republicans seize control of the House.
In his remarks, Mr. Obama hinted at a new direction from the White House that could help reassure businesses.
''I think setting the right tone publicly is going to be important,'' he said, ''and could end up making a difference at the margins in terms of how businesses make investment decisions.''

HEADLINE: 2 Major European Banks Keep Record-Low Rates

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER and JACK EWING; Julia Werdigier reported from London and Jack Ewing from Frankfurt.

 BODY:
LONDON -- With the economic recovery showing some resilience in Europe, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank left their main interest rates at record lows on Thursday.
The Bank of England decided against any new stimulus measures for Britain, a day after the Federal Reserve moved to buy an additional $600 billion in government bonds to strengthen the United States economy. The British bank left its bond purchasing program at $:200 billion, or $322 billion, and its main interest rate at 0.5 percent.
And the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, indicated at a news conference Thursday in Frankfurt that the Fed's move would not force the bank to change its monetary strategy, adding that the current rate at 1 percent was ''appropriate.'' 
Unlike the United States, Europe continues to experience some growth momentum. While the American economy has stumbled amid uncertainty about the housing market, and as consumers remain reluctant to spend, relatively strong growth in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, more than made up for weaker growth in countries like Spain and Ireland. Germany mainly benefited from rising demand for its exports, made more attractive by a drop in the euro.
Mr. Trichet said that a ''positive underlying momentum,'' helped by continued demand for Europe's exports, ''remains in place'' for the euro zone. Still he said that, despite the encouraging developments, ''uncertainties are remaining.'' He mentioned the ''re-emergence of tensions in financial markets'' and possible increases in the prices of oil and other commodities.
Growth in the 16-country euro zone has allowed the central bank to effectively tighten monetary policy by gradually withdrawing the low-interest loans it provided to banks that were short of cash.
Some economists warned that another round of government debt purchases, or quantitative easing, by the Federal Reserve could prove to be a roadblock for Europe's recovery by lifting the euro and the pound against the dollar and pushing up commodity prices.
Mr. Trichet said Thursday that he had no reason to believe that the United States was ''playing the strategy of a weak dollar.''
But Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays Capital in London, said that ''the E.C.B.'s task is clearly complicated considerably by the Fed's action.''
''It could push up global asset prices and commodities,'' which could fuel inflation, and ''the E.C.B. is likely to be more concerned that the Fed could end up pushing the dollar down too far at this stage,'' Mr. Callow said.
The Bank of England considered expanding purchases of government debt last month, but positive economic data released since then eased pressure for it to act.
The services sector, including banks and airlines, and manufacturing reported unexpected growth in October, and growth of Britain's gross domestic product beat economists' forecasts in the third quarter.
The Bank of England would find it ''hard to justify further purchases without some evidence,'' Jens Larsen, chief European economist at RBC Capital Markets in London and a former Bank of England official, said.
''The rebound has been pretty robust and inflation has surprised us on the upside,'' he said. ''At the same time there are clearly some big risks facing the economy. Quantitative easing is not off the table.''
The main risk for Britain's sustained recovery is the government's austerity program, which is expected to affect consumers beginning early next year. An increase in sales tax combined with deep cuts in government spending, including the elimination of an estimated 490,000 jobs, might slow the recovery despite the recent encouraging signs.
Signs that consumers hold back on spending because of job uncertainty have already been seen. Sales at Next, one of the biggest clothing retailers in Britain, fell in the third quarter, and the company expects the last three months of the year to be more difficult. Last month, house prices fell the most since January 2009, as buyers postponed investments and more property came to the market.
Many economists expect Bank of England policy makers to postpone any decision on more stimulus until next year, when the impact of the largest spending cuts since World War II becomes clearer. Britain's opposition Labour Party has warned that the private sector might not be able to fill the gap and that spending cuts that are too extensive risk a recession.
At the same time, inflation remains well above the Bank of England's target of 2 percent, making it harder for policy makers to argue for pumping more capital into the economy. But many economists expect interest rates to remain unchanged for at least six months, and the Bank of England has said that it expected inflation to drop by 2012.
The European Central Bank, which sets monetary policy for the euro zone, has left its benchmark interest rate at 1 percent since May 2009.

HEADLINE: Gauging the New Political Atmosphere

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Great Divide: Obama and G.O.P.'' (front page, Nov. 4):
I wonder if any of the Republicans who are now touting the ''mandate'' of Tuesday's election and how they will support ''the will of the people'' see any irony in the fact that their party just spent the last two years completely ignoring both the mandate of the 2008 presidential election and the will of the people by systematically opposing virtually every piece of legislation the president sought to introduce and the change he sought to bring about.
Neil Kurlander Livingston, N.J., Nov. 4, 2010 
To the Editor:
I was an enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama in 2008. And despite his many missteps over the last two years, I supported him and the Democratic Party this year by once again giving my time, money and vote. But I am now suffering some serious buyer's remorse, even more so after seeing his news conference the day after the election. He still doesn't get it.
For two years, I watched Mr. Obama naively seek to placate the right by sacrificing core demands of the center-left electorate that gave him power in the first place. To win just a few Republican votes, he caved on getting a real stimulus bill and meaningful health reform.
Time and again, Mr. Obama has naively reached out across the aisle, and time and again he has been rebuffed. And now that the Republican Party has lurched even further to the right, what is his response? To reach out yet again, even though the Republican leadership has explicitly stated that its goal over the next two years is to reverse his few successes and ensure that he is a one-term president.
Meanwhile, what do we on the left get? Nothing.
You just don't get it, Mr. President: you will never please the right wing of this country, and trying to do so just betrays your base. As the old saying from my native South goes, you should ''dance with the one that brung you.''
Christopher J. Hughey Belmont, Mass., Nov. 4, 2010
To the Editor:
The stinging rebuke of President Obama and the Democratic Party on Tuesday was not just the result of a bad economy and a failure of the administration to communicate its so-called accomplishments, as Democrats and their many allies in the media would have us believe.
It was a repudiation of the liberal agenda and, not incidentally, the way that agenda was pursued. Closed-door meetings and back-room deals were the hallmarks of the health care legislation. Lip service was given to bipartisanship while Republicans were bashed at every opportunity. The financial crisis was used to enshrine larger government.
Meanwhile, hope and change had turned into pray and wait.
The country does not want bigger government, bigger deficits and bigger unemployment rolls. It wants the opposite.
Mark R. Godburn North Canaan, Conn., Nov. 4, 2010
To the Editor:
It is convenient, perhaps even correct, and certainly exculpatory for Democrats to blame President Obama for the disastrous midterm election results. But the stupefying ignorance that seems to prevail among Tea Party candidates and voters is surely not the president's fault.
It suggests a failure of civic education, a disturbing inadequacy in teaching the basic facts of America's history and political development. The Tea Partiers' simplistic appeals to an imaginary past that has no relevance to the present reverberate in the resulting vacuum.
We now face not only gridlock in the next two years but also a basic question about the governability of our country. And the nation's responsibility is great. Our friends abroad watch all this in dismay and disbelief, while our opponents rejoice at our disarray.

To the Editor:
In ''Mr. Obama, It's Time for Some Poetry'' (column, Nov. 4), Nicholas D. Kristof writes that ''it's time for Mr. Obama to sweat like a racehorse.'' But an enormous photograph of a grimacing President Obama on the front page the same day vividly demonstrates just how undesirable that option is.
Give me the cool, collected president any day! You know, the one who has quietly and patiently gone about preventing a global economic collapse and successfully restructuring two auto companies.
Give me the capable, ''remote'' (although I beg to differ) man who raised fuel-efficiency standards, negotiated a nuclear arms treaty with Russia, inspired education reforms and reformed health care. Mr. Obama did all this and more while maintaining exemplary dignity at all times.
I say, Mr. Obama, keep governing in prose. I'll stick to Pope and Shakespeare for my poetry.
Victoria A. Bond Brooklyn, Nov. 4, 2010
To the Editor:
I want to offer my thanks to the defeated Democrats. Last year when there was a brief window of opportunity to pass a major health bill, Democrats pushed it through because they knew in the long run it was for the good of the country. They used all their political capital, and on Tuesday too many paid the price.
What an odd concept: placing the good of the nation over the good of the party.
William Sarokin Mount Kisco, N.Y., Nov. 4, 2010
To the Editor:
Little-known fact: more than 200 years ago, John Adams predicted the rise of the Tea Party:
''We may please ourselves with the prospect of free and popular governments. But there is great danger that those governments will not make us happy. God grant they may. But I fear that in every assembly, members will obtain an influence by noise not sense. By meanness, not greatness. By ignorance, not learning. By contracted hearts, not large souls ...''

HEADLINE: Protracted Wait for G.M. Payback

BYLINE: By ANTONY CURRIE and GEORGE HAY

 BODY:
Taxpayers will have to wait a while to reclaim the money invested to keep General Motors out of the scrapyard. The carmaker is running far more smoothly after declaring bankruptcy last year: it earned as much as $2.1 billion in the three months to September, its third straight quarter of profits. But the terms of G.M.'s coming share sale show that, once public, the stock will have to as much as double before its biggest shareholder, the United States government, gets close to breaking even.
Assume G.M.'s initial public offering starts at $26, the bottom of the projected price range. That would mean the Treasury, which owns 61 percent, would be taking a 42 percent loss on any stock it sells in the offering. It is planning to sell 263 million shares. If it does, G.M. shares would need to more than double to get back into the black on its investment, reaching more than $52 a share, according to a Reuters Breakingviews analysis. 
The hurdle for G.M.'s debut performance lowers if G.M.'s bankers can sell the shares at the top of the price range. But if the underwriters sell more of the Treasury's stock in the I.P.O., the barrier to breaking even increases. The calculation is similar for the G.M. stakes held by the governments of Canada and Ontario.
Over all, this sounds like a tall order. All things being equal, it implies that G.M. will have to essentially double its profits. But it could have been worse. Had the Treasury insisted on dumping more stock on the market, as appeared to be the case just a few months ago, the I.P.O. price might have been lower and the need for a huge increase in G.M.'s value afterward far greater.
The Treasury, whose G.M. efforts are being led by Ron Bloom, changed its tune and focused less on getting out quickly and more on exiting with minimal damage to taxpayers. That is a sensible about-face, but it still leaves getting back in the black a ways off.
Buffett's Swiss Stake
Warren E. Buffett may struggle to repeat his Swiss Re exit. The billionaire bailed out three big companies during the financial crisis: the Swiss insurer, General Electric and Goldman Sachs. On Thursday, he allowed Swiss Re to buy back its expensive convertible stock. He may have less leeway to be as generous with the other two.
Of the three deals, Mr. Buffett's $3.1 billion investment in Swiss Re convertible shares had the most stipulations. Negotiated at the depths of the market slump, the stock paid a 12 percent annual coupon until March 2012, when it would convert into ordinary shares at 25 Swiss francs, or $25.53.
As Swiss Re's share price is now twice that, the insurer was eager to buy back the convertibles. But it had also agreed to pay Mr. Buffett a 40 percent premium if it redeemed before March 2011, and a 20 percent premium after that.
Mr. Buffett is allowing Swiss Re to pay only a 20 percent premium, as well as the interest he would have received next March. That means he collects $1 billion, rather than the $1.6 billion to which he was entitled. That may look generous. But Mr. Buffett also owns 3 percent of Swiss Re's stock, which will benefit from the redemption of the expensive convertible securities. The shares jumped more than 6 percent
At first glance, Mr. Buffett faces a similar situation with Goldman and G.E., where he holds preferred shares worth $5 billion and $3 billion, respectively. Both would like to buy back the stock, which pays an annual coupon of 10 percent. He also has warrants over shares of both companies, giving him an incentive to help raise the stock price.
But there is less room for a Swiss Re-style agreement. Because Goldman can redeem its preferred stock at any time for a 10 percent premium, it does not need Mr. Buffett to give it an early discount. G.E.'s stock cannot be redeemed until October 2011, opening the door for a negotiation. But Berkshire Hathaway's G.E. warrants are deeply out of the money. That means it is unlikely to benefit from any short-term boost to GE's shares.
Despite Mr. Buffett's apparent generosity with Swiss Re, Goldman and G.E. should not assume he will take the same approach with them.

HEADLINE: Finding a Passage to India

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and HEATHER TIMMONS; Vikas Bajaj reported from Mumbai and Heather Timmons from New Delhi.

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India -- As President Obama pays his first visit to India this weekend, he may want to take his lead from Mary Kay.
Or Harley-Davidson, Cinnabon or Bristol-Myers Squibb.
Since Mr. Obama took office two years ago, America's top economic policy makers have visited India numerous times but left with little to show for their long flights. This time, too, officials on both sides have tried to temper expectations, given the geopolitical and trade tensions between the two nations.
But, even without a big policy push from Washington, companies from both countries have already been forging deals at a fast and furious pace.
American brands as diverse as Mary Kay cosmetics, Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Cinnabon sticky buns have recently set up shop or expanded in India, often with local partners helping them navigate this country's notoriously convoluted bureaucracy. Meanwhile, American corporate giants like General Motors and the drug maker Bristol-Myers are expanding factories, sales outlets and research laboratories in India. 
As a result of such moves, American exports to India in the first six months of 2010 hit $14.6 billion, up 14 percent from the period a year earlier and nearly five times what it was a decade earlier.
Corporate America mainly hopes the visit by the president, with more than 200 American executives in tow, can help better define the common economic interests of the United States and India and build on the trade and investment foundations the business community has already laid.
''Business had been leading the way from the very beginning,'' said Ron Somers, the head of the United States India Business Council, a business advocacy group. Now, Mr. Somers said, ''we want to crown that with a genuine strategic partnership.''
Harold McGraw 3rd, the chairman of McGraw Hill and one of the executives in the Obama entourage, said the visit was ''all about economic and job growth for both the U.S. and India.'' India is America's 14th-largest trade partner, he noted, but ''should be a lot higher.''
For many American executives, India seems to have become the ''new China'' -- a place where they feel compelled to do business, lest they miss getting a foothold in a nation with low-cost labor and a potentially billion-person consumer market.
But American government officials still seem to be struggling to define India's role, beyond saying that ''it's not China.''
India, with its lively democracy and messy infrastructure, is certainly no China, with its forced-march development model. In fact, encouraging India as a counterweight to China -- both economically and militarily -- is a motive for President Obama's visit, with potential sales of military technology high on the American agenda.
Compared with China, trade between India and the United States is relatively balanced. In 2009, America bought only $7.2 billion more in goods and services from India than it sold. Total trade between the countries was $60.2 billion. But that is just a small fraction of the $434 billion annual trade between China and the United States, which is lopsided $262 billion in China's favor.
On paper, at least, India and the United States already have many shared interests and common goals. But Mr. Obama and his New Delhi counterpart, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, have few significant bilateral achievements on economic issues. And one promising partnership, involving nuclear energy, may not even get off the ground.
In 2005, President George W. Bush and Mr. Singh announced what is considered the most ambitious agreement yet between their countries. The United States would remove restrictions on the export of civil nuclear technology to India and American companies would sell power equipment to India, which hopes to increase its nuclear power generation more than tenfold.
This past August, though, the Indian Parliament set that deal back by voting to make contractors and suppliers partly liable for any damages from nuclear accidents that might occur at the new plants. American companies say the new law deviates from international nuclear norms and would keep them from selling power equipment. Many economists and corporate executives say the power plant impasse and other tensions between the countries -- most notably Washington's continued, if wary, military embrace of Pakistan -- suggest that Mr. Obama and Mr. Singh may be unable to reach any meaningful economic concord on this trip.
Both leaders face difficult economic and political realities at home. High unemployment, concern over the outsourcing of American jobs and the threat of a more confrontational Congress will limit Mr. Obama's ability to strike deals with India.
Mr. Singh, meanwhile, is hemmed in by a coalition government that is conflicted about its relationship with the United States and is uncertain about the pace at which India should open its economy to the world.
''There is a limited amount that the visit can achieve,'' said Arvind Panagariya, an economist at Columbia University and an India expert. ''As long as they give a good communique and send some positive signals, that's the best we can expect.''
Analysts say the more concrete results may come from corporate, not government, meetings. The chief executives accompanying Mr. Obama will include Jeffrey R. Immelt of General Electric and Indra K. Nooyi, the Indian-born head of PepsiCo. They will meet with the likes of Ratan Tata, chairman of the multinational conglomerate Tata Group, and Mukesh Ambani, head of India's biggest company, Reliance Industries.
Various events will also give executives from smaller companies a chance to mingle.
''The most immediate benefit of the visit could be that another group of American industry executives become aware of the India opportunity,'' said one of the scheduled attendees, Gunjan Bagla, the managing director of Amritt Ventures, which advises American companies coming to India.
Trade and investment between the countries has grown sharply since the Indian government began easing state control of its economy in 1991.
But disagreements between the United States and India have been a big roadblock in negotiations in the Doha round of global trade talks, which have been stalled since 2008. American officials have been pushing for India and other developing nations to open more industries like financial services to foreign competition, while the Indians are seeking reductions in American farm subsidies.
American jobs are also a sore point. In Washington, Democratic lawmakers earlier this year pushed through a $2,000 increase in fees for employment visas, writing the law in such a way that it primarily hurt Indian technology companies. Mr. Obama has also advocated changing tax law to make it more expensive for American companies to outsource work to India and other countries.
That is why President Obama will probably focus his talks here on securing deals for American companies that can demonstrably create jobs in the United States, according to administration officials. Some of those deals, which might include the sale of Boeing cargo planes to India's military forces, have been in negotiation for some time.
American companies like Wal-Mart are also hoping that New Delhi will allow them to set up retail stores in India. Right now, foreign companies cannot operate retail stores that sell products from multiple brands. Indian officials have recently signaled that they might soon change those rules.
The Indians, for their part, have said they hope Mr. Obama will agree to ease export restrictions on so-called dual-use technologies, like cryptography, that can be used for both military and civilian purposes.

HEADLINE: Hard Work and Money Helped State Democrats Resist G.O.P. Tide

BYLINE: By DAN MIHALOPOULOS. 
dmihalopoulos@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
Campaigning in the crowded Schaumburg Metra station before the election this week, Michael Noland, a Democratic state senator in one of the state's most hotly contested races, lowered his voice to make what he described as a confession: ''I voted for Ronald Reagan.''
Most voters in Illinois, including the overwhelming majority of Mr. Noland's neighbors in the northwest suburbs, supported President Reagan a generation ago and an almost 30-year string of Republican governors. But Tuesday, although Democrats suffered in races across the country and lost many high-profile Congressional contests across the state, the party's dominance in state government was only eroded, not ended.
The state Democrats' defense of their legislative majorities meant that voters did not repudiate the Springfield status quo. At week's end, Mr. Noland clung to a thin lead in his race as absentee ballots were being tallied. 
While the tight contests for governor and United States senator attracted most of the news media's attention, the state's Democrats expended record piles of campaign cash in targeted General Assembly districts, particularly in the suburbs and Downstate.
Campaign aides for Michael J. Madigan, the chairman of the State Democratic Party and longtime speaker of the State House, and John Cullerton, the Senate president, fanned out across Illinois with the goal of protecting the party's gains in recent elections in swing districts like Mr. Noland's, which stretches from the western edge of Schaumburg into Kane County.
The strategy succeeded in blunting the Republican trend that prevailed elsewhere in the country and in the races for most Illinois Congressional seats and President Obama's old Senate post.
''If you look at the carnage around the nation, I think Illinois will stand out for Democrats as the one place where, if you can get your story out, your candidates are going to win,'' said Steve Brown, Mr. Madigan's spokesman. ''When you go door to door talking to people, voters understood the message and supported the Democratic candidates.''
The groundwork for holding onto Springfield began more than six months ago and peaked in recent weeks behind paid precinct canvassers and legions of volunteers provided by unions, Democratic operatives said.
Mr. Madigan was eager to avoid a repeat of the 1994 election, when Republicans took over the Illinois House as well as Congress, said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University. The two years after that election were the only interruption in Mr. Madigan's 26-year run as House speaker.
''There was a Republican wave in the state again, but the Democrats saw it coming,'' Mr. Yepsen said. ''Madigan had his firewall this time. Where Madigan was playing defense, they got out early.''
The legislative victories did not come cheaply. Although the total spending numbers are not yet available, candidates from both parties pulled in at least $1 million in each of 14 legislative races, according to the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform. As of Monday, Democratic candidates had the fund-raising advantage in all but one of those 14 races, and almost two-thirds of the money came from state party organizations.
Democrats captured 6 of the 10 costliest House races. They could claim victory or led in unofficial vote counts in four of the seven million-dollar campaigns for Senate seats.
Maintaining the majorities in this election was especially vital because it will allow Democrats to redraw legislative district boundaries. Aides to the party leaders will use mapping software to tweak boundaries to split up Republican voter blocs and create more districts that tend to favor Democratic candidates.
Mr. Madigan could also revel in several other important proxy victories:
Joseph Berrios, the chairman of the party organization in Cook County, was elected county assessor over Forrest Claypool, who mounted an independent bid. Mr. Madigan's law firm has frequently engineered property tax cuts for its clients from the county's Board of Review, where Mr. Berrios served for more than 20 years.
Another friend of Mr. Madigan, Thomas Kilbride, survived the efforts of business groups that challenged his campaign to continue as a State Supreme Court justice. Thanks in great part to more than $1.4 million from state Democrats, Mr. Kilbride's retention bid became ''the national leader both in campaign fund-raising as well as TV ad spending'' for a judicial race, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.
Mr. Madigan's daughter, Lisa Madigan, was easily re-elected to a third term as the state's attorney general. At her election night party, Ms. Madigan declined to rule out a run for mayor of Chicago in February.
Democrats have controlled City Hall for almost a century, yet in some of the city's more distant suburbs, Mr. Madigan has played a large role in shifting the balance of power toward Democrats in recent years. Once dominated by Republicans at every level, the northwest suburbs in Mr. Noland's district have become to Illinois politics what bellwether states Missouri or Ohio are to national politics.
Mr. Noland, a lawyer from Elgin, first ran for the state legislature in 2002 and lost as the Democratic nominee for a House seat and again two years later. He said he did not receive help from state party leaders until after he exceeded low expectations by losing only narrowly.
''This area has been changing quite a lot,'' Mr. Noland said. ''They realized in 2004 that this area is doable for Democrats.''
Voters finally sent Mr. Noland to the State Senate in 2006. Both State House seats in his constituency are held by Democratic incumbents, Frank Crespo and Keith Farnham. They won re-election Tuesday, while Mr. Noland held an advantage of about 400 votes over his Republican challenger, Steve Rauschenberger, with some absentee ballots left to be counted.
Demographics played a role in the political sea change. Mr. Noland said whites were now only about half of the voters in his district, with the remainder being about 30 percent Hispanic, 10 percent South Asian and 5 percent black. All those groups were represented in each trainload of downtown-bound commuters whom Mr. Noland lobbied Monday in Schaumburg.
The district is also diverse economically. A drive from Schaumburg to Elgin takes motorists past factories as well as farm stands, new-construction town houses and 19th-century Victorian homes on bluffs overlooking the Fox River.
''You have the confluence of every aspiration right here in the district,'' Mr. Noland said. ''Everything from McMansions to little pink houses. As this district goes, so goes the state of Illinois.''
Mr. Rauschenberger, who had been a state legislator from 1992 until 2006, said he had believed he could regain the district for Republicans by opposing tax increases and calling for sharp cuts in state spending.
He noted that the Democrats had won state legislative races in an area where all the Congressional balloting favored Republicans.
''A lot of people voted for Republican Congressional candidates to send a message to Obama, but then they switched to send Democrats to Springfield,'' Mr. Rauschenberger said Wednesday.
The importance that both parties placed on the legislative races in the suburbs was clearly evident in the mountains of campaign literature that the Elgin post office had struggled to deliver.
The volume of mail in the week before the election was 179 percent heavier than in the same period last year, said Sue Meathe, the postmaster in Elgin. Fluctuations of greater than 10 percent above or below average are rare, she said.
Mr. Rauschenberger, who used to head the Senate Appropriations Committee, said it was curious that the record campaign spending came at a time of huge budget deficits in Springfield, which have forced the state to delay paying its bills.
''We could have wiped out the past-due bills of most of the Elgin social service agencies if we just could have agreed to limit campaign expenditures,'' he said.

HEADLINE: McConnell Ends Talk Of a Thaw

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said Thursday that ''the only way'' his party would succeed in advancing its agenda was to ensure that President Obama was defeated in two years, seemingly bringing a quick end to post-election professions from both sides about working together.
Even as President Obama announced that he had invited Congressional leaders of both parties to meet him this month to discuss the legislative agenda for the rest of the year, Senate Republicans were flexing their muscles in the new playground of divided government, scrambling to fill leadership posts, announcing a legislative agenda and warning their Democratic counterparts to change their ways or else. 
Mr. McConnell's comments about Mr. Obama -- echoing a line he used before the election -- suggested that he had heard the no-compromise message coming from the most conservative members of his party and that he intended to wage an aggressive battle in the Senate even though Republicans failed on Tuesday to gain a majority there.
Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, who survived a tight race in Nevada on Tuesday, said, ''It looks like Senate Republicans have already set the terms of this new legislative session: it's our way or the highway.''
The White House gave a more muted response.
''The message of Tuesday's election was the American people want both political parties to work together,'' said Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary.
Noting that the president had just invited Mr. McConnell and other Congressional leaders to dinner, Mr. Gibbs added, ''I hope that Senator McConnell comes to the White House with that in mind in a couple weeks.''
But not long after Mr. Obama told reporters at the White House that he had issued the invitation, Mr. McConnell was giving his speech.
''The American people want us to put aside the left-wing wish list and work together on helping to create jobs and restore the economy to health and prosperity,'' he said. ''There is no reason the two parties can't work together on achieving these goals. But whether or not the administration has a midcourse correction, Republicans have a plan for following through on the wishes of the American people.''
Mr. McConnell suggested, though, that he did not hold out much hope that his party would get what it wanted in the next two years with Mr. Obama in the White House.
''The fact is,'' he said in a speech at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group in Washington, ''if our primary legislative goals are to repeal and replace the health spending bill, to end the bailouts, cut spending and shrink the size and scope of government, the only way to do all of those things is to put someone in the White House who won't veto any of these things.''
With their Senate majority now shrunken by at least six, Democrats will find it harder to overcome Republican filibusters, leaving Mr. McConnell in a stronger position to impede the White House agenda and to work with the new Republican majority in the House to impose a more conservative stamp on legislation and force showdowns with Mr. Obama.
''This gives McConnell immense clout and doesn't leave Reid with much sway,'' said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. ''Now that the Democratic majority is even narrower and more Democrats will be worried about supporting Obama, McConnell feels the confidence to be even more aggressive and out front in his opposition.''
For two days, Mr. McConnell has spoken of bipartisanship as his ''friends on the other side'' embracing his party's ideas.
''They can change course,'' Mr. McConnell said of Democrats in his Thursday speech, ''or they can double down on a vision of government that the American people have roundly rejected. If they choose the former, they'll find a partner in Republicans. If they don't, we'll have disagreements ahead.''
Mr. Obama invited Congressional leaders of both parties to the White House on Nov. 18, the first week of Congress's lame-duck session.

HEADLINE: Rick Perry, Master Of the Friendly Attack

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the managing editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column.
Rick Perry's third successful campaign for governor proved this much: He's got the frenemies thing down pat.
More than in any past campaign, Mr. Perry showed himself to be adept at what you might call the friendly attack: striking on one level, while making nice on another. He did it to the news media, and he did it to the federal government.
His security guards didn't handcuff any bloggers the way those of Joe Miller, the Alaska Senate candidate, did. He didn't threaten to take out any of his least-favorite reporters like Carl P. Paladino, the candidate for New York governor, did. But he has probably got some empathy for those guys, even if his disdain for the news media is more nuanced. 
All year, Mr. Perry froze out most members of the news media, while he strategically kept the conversation going with the people who were writing about him. He even got reporters to write openly, and with full access to him, about his war with their employers and colleagues. Voters learned from the news media about the governor's railing against the news media.
The National Conference of Editorial Writers met in Dallas in late September and got a collective case of heartburn when Mr. Perry addressed them without sticking around for the customary question-and-answer session. Instead, he went through the room shaking hands, did some interviews with local reporters and left. The editorial writers were peeved and griped about it.
''This is an affront to any notion of civil discourse, such as the kind you have called for on other occasions,'' Tom Waseleski, the group's president, wrote afterward to Mr. Perry. ''We believe you and your staff have been disingenuous in the characterization of your schedule. If you had hoped to make a positive impression on this national press group, I must tell you that you utterly failed.''
That dyspepsia got a lot of coverage. Mr. Perry lapped it up.
You can see the method to his madness. It was materially no different than his attacks last year on the federal government, whose stimulus program bailed out the last two state budgets to the tune of about $17 billion. Mr. Perry got tons of news media attention for making a stand and turning down $556 million in federal unemployment insurance money -- because of the ''strings attached.''
He did it again this year when he balked at the competition for federal Race to the Top money for education, pitching a fit about those same strings. But he accepted the much larger amount without a peep and balanced the state budget without a tax bill.
In this year's Republican primary against Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Mr. Perry didn't get a single newspaper endorsement after refusing to meet with editorial boards. His chief consultant, Dave Carney, said the campaign's internal polling showed that an endorsement from a big metro paper registered as a negative with Republican voters.
In his campaign against Bill White (a classic, old-school politician, at least in terms of how he approached the news media), Mr. Perry kept it up. No editorial boards, and -- this time -- no debates. The news media was left to carp about how all this was bad for democracy. But it was a nonissue for voters.
Indeed, Ms. Hutchison -- who spent nearly $25 million to win 30.3 percent of the vote in March -- had all the big papers on her side and still got whupped. Mr. White, and third parties on his behalf, spent roughly the same amount. He got endorsements from all but two newspapers, and he got whupped, too, polling just 42.3 percent.
Mr. Perry is probably still laughing. What he has realized during his time in office is that hating on the news media doesn't make a difference, and probably helps. Hating on the federal government this year seemed to work pretty well, too. He hasn't lost an election yet.
Now Mr. Perry is preparing to take the kiss-and-kill thing national. With the governor's race in the rear-view mirror, he will travel the country to promote his new book, ''Fed Up!'' which is being taken as a sure sign he's running for president in 2012. (Wait, that's a federal job.)
As part of his tour, he'll be a guest Monday on ''The Daily Show'' with Jon Stewart: It's time to get out and make some new frenemies.

HEADLINE: As Ground Shifts in Washington, a Rumble Is Heard Abroad

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; Reporting was contributed by Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem; Steven Erlanger, Scott Sayare and Maia de la Baume from Paris; Michael Slackman and Stefan Pauly from Berlin; and Michael Schwirtz and Ellen Barry from Moscow.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Just two years ago, the election of President Obama resonated far beyond American shores, inspiring euphoric assessments in Europe in particular that American politics had embarked on new and enduring change after years of the Bush administration. It took the midterm elections this week to finally persuade some among Mr. Obama's global fan club to think otherwise.
The Democrats' loss of control of the House of Representatives and their reduced majority in the Senate have left many outsiders pondering whether the open hand of the newly inaugurated president -- extended to Iran, Russia and the Middle East in 2009 -- will close, replaced by an introspective and distracted White House, prone to protectionism abroad while maneuvering at home with Republicans eyeing their enhanced prospects for the 2012 presidential election. 
''After Obama the candidate and Obama the great orator, it is Obama the politician who should take to the stage,'' said Pierre Rousselin, a columnist in Le Figaro.
Or as George Friedman, an American foreign affairs specialist, put it, ''the substantial change in America's place in the world that Europeans and his supporters entertained has not materialized.'' Indeed, ''the gulf between what Obama said and what has happened is so deep that it shapes global perceptions.''
The shift in foreign attitudes is not simply one of mood music. From the Jewish settlements of the West Bank to the nuclear arsenals of Russia, the changed power relationships in Washington have left many wondering whether cornerstone policies may now have moved beyond Mr. Obama's reach.
And as much as American leaders weakened at home traditionally seek compensatory triumph abroad, analysts in several countries seemed unsure of Mr. Obama's prospects of redeeming promises in Iraq and Afghanistan -- both issues of central importance to America's allies.
''American elections are largely driven by domestic concerns, but their outcomes have global ramifications,'' wrote Bruce Stokes of the German Marshall Fund in Washington. ''Never has this been more evident than in the wake'' of this week's midterm vote.
''Europeans hopeful of cooperation with the United States on Afghanistan, arms control, the global economy and climate change will notice that Washington is about to become an even more frustrating partner,'' he wrote.
Against that, said Seumas Milne in the British newspaper The Guardian, Mr. Obama ''can deliver abroad'' despite constraints at home. ''If the U.S. president really were to end the occupation of Iraq and begin a genuine withdrawal from Afghanistan next year, that would be a change people everywhere could believe in.''
The response to the midterm ballot has been nuanced and uneven, suggesting that many of America's partners would prefer to see themselves confronting not so much a cataclysm as shifting ground rules whose import cannot yet be reliably computed.
Some fear the worst, imperiling progress on two issues in particular: arms control with Russia and an always elusive settlement between Israelis and Palestinians.
A first sign of alarm came when, soon after the midterm results emerged in the United States, the international committee of the State Duma in Russia withdrew its recommendation to ratify a new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Washington. That is because many in Russia fear that Republicans, some of whom have opposed the treaty because they believe it may limit American antimissile defense deployments, now have greater clout to block action in the Senate and deny Mr. Obama what had been seen as a significant foreign policy achievement.
While the committee's gesture seemed largely symbolic, it was nonetheless an important signal of the Kremlin's concerns.
The worries extend beyond Russia. Even while expressing his faith in the continuity of American foreign policy, the German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, urged the newly chosen lawmakers to support nuclear nonproliferation and to oppose what he called ''American unilateralism as it was in the previous administration of President Bush.''
Many forecast an equally profound turn in the Middle East, enabling Israel's right-wing government to continue to resist pressure to freeze the expansion of settlements in the West Bank.
''The huge influx of newly elected representatives and senators to Washington includes dozens of strong friends of Israel who will put the brakes on the consistently dubious, sometimes dangerous policies of President Obama regarding these past two years,'' said Danny Danon, a legislator from the right wing of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud Party.
Like most forecasts of radical change in Washington, that argument had its opponents. ''Any expectation that Obama will be too weak and too scarred to pursue an activist policy vis-a-vis the Israel-Palestinian conflict is likely to be confounded,'' said Mark Heller of the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University.
Indeed, said Yasser Abed Rabbo, a senior Palestinian official, Palestinians ''are not affected by the results of these elections.''
But the proof will be on the ground, quite literally. ''The real game begins now, and the name of the game is Palestine,'' said Ari Shavit, a columnist for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Only the creation of a ''viable'' Palestinian state within a year ''can lift the spirit of Obama's self-defined liberal camp.''
Of course, Washington's relationship with Israel has much wider regional repercussions, particularly in dealing with Iran, where some commentators believe that the impact of a more hawkish Congress will erode the frail trans-Atlantic consensus on diplomacy and sanctions.

HEADLINE: Adjusting Course for a Comeback

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At a time of tumult, the corner office in the West Wing is a center of calm. With the rest of Washington in a frenzy over the ''shellacking'' President Obama's party took in this week's elections, his new chief of staff quietly and methodically plots out a refashioned White House to manage his recovery.
Pete Rouse, who took over as interim White House chief of staff a month ago, began planning a reorganization weeks before the vote, and despite this week's losses, officials expect less of a shakeup than a reformulation. Some people will leave and others will be brought in, but few anticipate the wholesale changes seen in past administrations.
Exactly how Mr. Rouse will reshape the White House remains a mystery even inside the building, and with Mr. Obama leaving for Asia on Friday, no changes will be announced before mid-month, and possibly not until the end of the year. So far, most of the personnel moves that have been made one by one have involved promoting people already inside the administration. 
Underlying the thinking is the conclusion that the electoral thrashing had more to do with larger economic forces and strategic decisions about health care and stimulus than with the particular operations of the White House. In other words, as Mr. Rouse and his colleagues analyze the criticism, what they are hearing is not that the White House did things wrong, but that it did the wrong things.
Mr. Rouse has concrete ideas for how to make the White House work more efficiently, but they may not involve the sort of change that generates a lot of attention outside the building.
''There are a lot of lessons learned in the last two years in terms of how we might improve internal communication, encourage greater accountability without discouraging individual initiative,'' said a White House official familiar with Mr. Rouse's thinking.
Some of the next personnel moves have already been foreshadowed. David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, and Jim Messina, the deputy chief of staff, are widely expected to leave in the spring to run Mr. Obama's re-election campaign, while David Plouffe, who managed the 2008 campaign, would join the White House staff.
Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said Thursday that the president was still weeks away from deciding on a replacement for his departing national economics adviser, Lawrence H. Summers. Many officials have speculated on whether Mr. Gibbs himself might move up or out.
One personnel move that may surprise some would involve Mr. Rouse himself. Though reluctant to take over for Rahm Emanuel when he stepped down as chief of staff, Mr. Rouse appears to be increasingly comfortable in the job. While he was described as ''interim,'' White House officials said they knew of no search for a permanent chief of staff and many predicted Mr. Rouse would stay for months, if not all the way until the 2012 election.
When Valerie Jarrett, the president's senior adviser, was asked recently by Chuck Todd of MSNBC whether Mr. Rouse was chief of staff or interim chief of staff, she equivocated. ''He's chief of staff,'' she said. ''Maybe it's interim, maybe it's not. I know he's doing a terrific job.''
Robert Bauer, the White House counsel, said in an interview that Mr. Rouse is a ''first-rate manager'' with a talent for ''strategic thinking'' and ''building esprit de corps.'' Mr. Bauer added: ''He has a very good handle on the president's expectations and a very good handle on what he's got available to address what he's got to address.''
The House of Rouse is a calmer place, with more memos and less yelling. While Mr. Emanuel was in charge, the West Wing crackled with energy, urgency and stress as it careened from one crisis to another. Under Mr. Rouse, it exudes a sense of order and process even amid perhaps its most fateful political crisis yet.
Mr. Rouse's meetings tend to be quicker and more relaxed, with people feeling freer to make jokes or check their BlackBerry. Where Mr. Emanuel used such meetings to extract intelligence and issue directives, Mr. Rouse uses them to share information and, when an issue is raised, requests a memo or another meeting. Those not in Mr. Emanuel's inner circle now feel free to drop by the chief of staff's office; some say they have been there more in a month than in the previous 20 months combined.
''Rahm's world is 'What can you do for me in the next seven seconds?' and there's great strength in that,'' said John D. Podesta, who was White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton and advises Mr. Obama as head of the Center for American Progress. ''But long-term policy is, 'What's happening in the next Congressional work period?' Pete will be moving forward on a two-year framework.''
As part of that, Mr. Rouse has reached out to those in the administration who often feel overlooked by any White House, seeking their advice for what comes next. ''He's looking for ways to include the cabinet a lot more leading up to decisions being made,'' said Ray LaHood, the transportation secretary.
Mr. Rouse declined to comment. But in a rare interview in September before his selection, he insisted Mr. Obama's first two years would be judged well by history, but lamented that the economic crisis forced a series of actions that fueled the image of a traditional Democrat, even while staving off a depression.
''If we'd had our druthers,'' Mr. Rouse said, ''starting out with a $787 billion spending program that people don't think benefited them, that reinforced the idea of big-spending liberal, isn't the option we would have chosen, but it was what was called for.''
Mr. Rouse, 64, avoids the public stage as much as Mr. Emanuel savored it. Despite his decades on Capitol Hill, where he was called the 101st senator, C-Span producers searching their archives found no interview he has given nor footage of any public event where he spoke. In his office, he displays none of the classic Washington vanity pictures of himself with famous politicians.
He has perpetually vowed to retire and, before his latest appointment, bet Mr. Messina $400 that he would by the end of the year. Even after becoming chief of staff, Mr. Rouse resisted moving into Mr. Emanuel's corner office until Mr. Gibbs and two other White House aides, Dan Pfeiffer and Alyssa Mastromonaco, threatened to move his files.
Mr. Emanuel himself warned him, ''The office has a great fireplace and a great porch and everything in between'' stinks. But Mr. Rouse, who kept a recording of Mr. Emanuel's children as his outgoing voice mail message, seems to be settling in for a while.

HEADLINE: Defeat of Proposition B Cements Labor's Power

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH LESLY STEVENS; Jennifer Gollan contributed reporting.. 
jgollan@baycitizen.org; estevens@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
The scene at Hi Dive, a bar on the Embarcadero tucked under the Bay Bridge, was a merry one late Tuesday night.
As election results rolled in, it became clear that San Francisco unions had trounced Proposition B, a measure that would have required the city's 26,000 employees to contribute more toward their pensions and benefits. Once the tally was complete, 57.5 percent of San Francisco's voters had sided with the unions.
Union leaders appeared surprised by the lopsided victory. Proposition B had been promoted by Jeff Adachi, the city's public defender, and backed by former Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr., Eric Schmidt, Google's chief executive, and Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Adachi had argued that the city's escalating employee costs would eventually force San Francisco to file for bankruptcy, like nearby Vallejo.
''We are surprised at the margin, especially given the political mood elsewhere in the country,'' said Sean Connolly, president of the Municipal Attorney's Association. ''San Francisco is different. Always is, always has been. It always seems to buck trends.'' 
Amid a slow economic recovery, animosity toward unions and resentment over generous public employee compensation packages played a role Tuesday in Republican wins across the nation. But not in the Bay Area, where the unions demonstrated that they continue to wield enough power to influence elections.
In addition to the victory on Proposition B, almost all of the candidates supported by unions fared well in local and statewide races. Jerry Brown, the former mayor of Oakland, was elected governor. Mayor Gavin Newsom of San Francisco was elected lieutenant governor. United States Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat, retained her seat. Even Kamala Harris, the San Francisco district attorney, is leading Steve Cooley, a Republican, in a close race for state attorney general.
Every significant elected post in Sacramento is now in Democratic hands.
''Like it or not, unions are still the most potent political force in California,'' said Nathan Ballard, a Democratic strategist and former Newsom aide who once worked for the California Labor Federation. Meg Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor, ''persistently demonized the unions,'' Mr. Ballard said. ''It was a miscalculation on her part. She greatly underestimated their influence.''
Proposition B opponents retained Mr. Ballard for the final two months of the campaign, part of a blitz by the unions to beat back the pension measure. Mr. Ballard estimated that the unions spent between $1.5 million and $2 million on the campaign. On Election Day, labor leaders deployed hundreds of members to work the phones and make appearances throughout San Francisco.
Mr. Adachi's camp, which raised about $1 million, had just 20 people working on Election Day.
David Crane, an economic adviser to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and a San Francisco resident, donated money to the Proposition B campaign and was disappointed by its defeat.
''Pension reform is going to happen around the country, one way or another,'' said Mr. Crane, who also has advocated for pension changes at the state level. ''Clearly, it is not going to happen in San Francisco first.''
The union members were euphoric.
Mr. Connolly, president of the Municipal Attorney's Association, stood outside the Hi Dive on Tuesday night wearing a San Francisco Giants cap. Mr. Connolly's uncle, pitcher Bill Monbouquette, ended his 11-year professional career with the Giants in 1968.
And yet Mr. Connolly had to think long and hard about which victory was sweeter: the Giants' first World Series championship since moving to San Francisco in 1958, or the unions' triumph over Proposition B.
The measure's failure, he said, ''restores a lot of faith I have in San Francisco voters.''
The union members are upset with Mr. Adachi for using the electoral process instead of collective bargaining to try to bring about pension and benefits reform. They also resent that he pushed for the changes from his position as public defender, which they said had nothing to do with the issue.
Mr. Ballard, the Democratic strategist, said such a resounding loss for Proposition B was a political blow for Mr. Adachi, a popular progressive figure in city politics thought to have aspirations toward higher office.
''This could be the end of the line for him: He bet it all on red, and he lost,'' Mr. Ballard said. Any candidate running for public office in San Francisco ''needs a coalition that includes some labor,'' he said. ''No part of the labor movement will be ready to forgive Jeff Adachi any time soon.''
Mr. Adachi has ''burned a lot of bridges, hurt a lot of feelings,'' said Thomas J. O'Connor, head of the city's firefighters union. ''He went around and vilified working men and women. Very shameful. Locking us up in the public stockade and humiliated us because we have a paycheck.''
Mr. Adachi, who ran unopposed, was re-elected as public defender, and he will not let the defeat of Proposition B thwart his overhaul efforts. At the Lava Lounge in SoMa on Tuesday night, he said he would renew his work to restructure the city's pension and benefits systems if the unions do not make good on their promise to do so themselves.
For union leaders and the long list of San Francisco elected officials who banded together against Proposition B, Mr. Adachi said, ''there comes a responsibility now to address this problem that threatens the future of our city.''
He said San Francisco will face a $500 million budget deficit next year, $70 million to $90 million in additional pension costs and a revised estimate of an unfunded retiree health care liability of nearly $5 billion.
''Public defenders, we don't give up,'' Mr. Adachi said. ''I'm going to stay on this, make sure the problem is dealt with. Because it is not going to go away.''
But if the unions do succeed in damaging Mr. Adachi's political ambitions, that could serve as a warning to anyone thinking of mounting a similar challenge to labor.
Defeating Proposition B ''was a big win, a really big win,'' Mr. Connolly said. ''What that margin does is it says that you have to, at least in San Francisco, take labor seriously. It sends a signal to those elected that they have to sit down with labor'' and figure out a way of including labor to resolve problems.
However, labor experts said, as emboldened as the union members were after the defeat of Proposition B, the national results should also leave them chastened.
With Republicans retaking control of the House and picking up seats in the Senate, the influence of organized labor will be diminished. The power shift will likely hobble legislative initiatives such as imposing tougher sanctions for workplace safety violations and making it easier to form unions.
In California, Mr. Brown's election as governor means that the state will most likely resist that trend. Labor and other social-advocacy organizations spent roughly $26.5 million on his behalf, and provided the bulk of the $32.5 million that he spent directly. Throughout the campaign, Ms. Whitman attacked Mr. Brown for being ''in the pocket of unions.''
Union officials are careful to mention that Mr. Brown is famously prickly and cannot be counted on to do labor's bidding. But still, his is a relatively friendly, familiar face.
''He's always been accessible to us,'' said Gene Gantt, the political director for the California State Firefighters' Association, which represents 24,000 firefighters. ''We worked for him back in the day. He has a good grasp of our issues.''
William B. Gould IV, who served as chairman of the National Labor Relations Board during the Clinton administration, said Mr. Brown's election would breathe new life into pro-union initiatives in California.
Still, Mr. Brown cannot avoid dealing with the state's huge pension liabilities, which mirror the problems of San Francisco and other municipalities.
''There will be no avoiding a stern posture in dealing with the public employee union pensions and related benefits,'' said Mr. Gould, professor emeritus at Stanford Law School.
Bob Muscat, chairman of the public employee committee of the San Francisco Labor Council, said the unions would begin negotiating with the city ''as soon as possible'' to ''resolve the long-term financial problems facing the city.''
''We are well aware of the problems,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Cities as Hubs of Energy and Climate Action

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: New York City's mayor takes the helm of a group aiming to make cities lead the way on climate and energy.

 BODY:
Nov. 7, 8:25 p.m. | Updated A pair of energy and development specialists from the mayors' offices in New York City and Los Angeles are going global.
Jay Carson, a former deputy Los Angeles mayor and aide to both Clintons, and Rohit Aggarwala, the former chief sustainability advisor to New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, are going to work for C40 Cities, a coalition of cities in rich and developing countries working to initiate and share ways to cut emissions of greenhouse gases and boost resilience to impacts of climate change.
The two advisers make the move as Bloomberg prepares to take the chairmanship of the group for the next two years. He's in Hong Kong at a meeting focused on China's cities and is giving a speech laying out new goals for the group.
The group was created in 2005 in London, largely under the direction of that city's mayor at the time, Ken Livingstone. In 2006, it held its second meeting, in New York City, and began working with the Clinton Climate Initiative, a project of former President Bill Clinton's foundation (and one that Carson worked on).
I spoke with Carson and Aggarwala briefly earlier this week: 
"Our goal is to take C40 to the next level," Carson told me. "As it's become clearer that there's not going to be much action at the federal level, the importance of C40 grows. Some might say it's boring, nitty-gritty, nuts and bolts stuff, but it's in the implementation that happens at the city level where we're going to see the most action on climate change in the near future."
Aggarwala noted that cities are natural hubs for initiatives that use energy more sparingly and move people more efficiently through transportation options involving feet, bicycles or mass transit. He said that the philosophy brought to the group by Bloomberg presumes that "economic growth, improving the quality of life and improvements to the environment are all the same thing."
"A city is inherently more transit oriented and walkable than a suburb," Aggarwala said. "You're going with the grain of urbanization."
Postscript: In the meantime, there are few signs of serious action by wealthy countries to carry out the pledges they made last December to help poorer ones withstand climate impacts and adopt less-polluting energy policies and technologies. On Friday, an advisory panel convened by the United Nations to propose ways to generate some $100 billion a year within a decade released a report on ways to start the money flowing. The best it could do was conclude that raising this money was "challenging but feasible." 
Oxfam America and other groups working to limit vulnerability to disasters, including those related to climate extremes, were cautiously upbeat about the analysis. "This should be a clarion call to negotiators that we can crack the climate finance nut with innovative sources of public finance that don't shift the responsibility onto taxpayers," David Waskow, the climate change adviser for Oxfam, said in an e-mailed statement. "It is now up to political leaders to lay out a clear roadmap for making this public funding a reality."

HEADLINE: In Construction, Homes Are the Good News

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris

 BODY:
AFTER a rapid plunge, the pace of residential construction in the United States has stabilized. But any respite for the economy that could have been provided by the end of that decline has been more than offset by a drop in privately financed nonresidential construction.
And now even publicly financed construction has begun to slide on a year-over-year basis, something that has not happened since 1984. 
The rapid decline in nonresidential construction reflects the fact that commercial projects often cannot be stopped immediately, even if the market has soured. Finishing a building is usually preferable to leaving it half built, since there is no possibility of renting out an unfinished shell. That helped to keep such spending up early in the recession, but it has since fallen off rapidly.
Figures for September, released this week, showed that residential construction spending rose a little compared with August, but remained well below year-ago levels. At the same time, figures for almost every category of nonresidential spending showed declines.
Month-to-month figures can be volatile because of weather, even though the Census Bureau applies seasonal adjustments. The accompanying charts are based on total spending over 12-month periods, and compare one period to the same period a year earlier. The figures are in actual dollars, not adjusted for inflation.
Private residential construction spending took off early in this century, rising to a peak in 2006. For the 12 months through June of that year, Americans spent $643 billion on building homes and apartments. That spending was spurred, of course, by easy credit and by a mortgage industry that was lending money to almost anyone. By early this year, the 12-month total was down to $243 billion, a decline of more than 60 percent.
At the peak, residential spending amounted to 55 percent of total construction spending, a level unprecedented since the government began collecting such data in the 1960s. For many years, nonresidential and residential spending were on different cycles, with one drawing in more money when the other faltered. But that pattern ended in the early 1990s, and residential spending was virtually unaffected by the 2001 recession.
Publicly financed construction, largely for things like roads, schools and sewers, has been relatively steady and did not rise as rapidly during the years when the economy was booming. Now it is sliding, but not as rapidly as the other categories. It is now the largest of the three categories.
During the boom, the excesses in the economy both drove up construction costs and left many areas overbuilt, with too many homes, offices, hotels and stores. It will take time to work off those excesses, which is a why a rapid pickup in such spending seems unlikely.
There is a need for public infrastructure projects, and with contractors desperate for business, there is a possibility of getting such work done for less than it would otherwise cost. But there appears to be little prospect that the government will be able to take advantage of that opportunity.
While federal aid often pays for a large part of projects, a vast majority of public construction projects are undertaken and at least partly financed by state and local governments. Many of them are suffering large budget deficits, in part because falling property prices have depressed tax collections, and are hesitant to undertake projects that can be deferred.
This is an area where a federal stimulus program could both pay for needed projects and put to work a sector of the economy that has otherwise dubious prospects, even if the overall economy does continue to improve. Concern over federal budget deficits, however, may make Congressional approval of such a program impossible.

HEADLINE: Shell Presses For Drilling In Arctic

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Eager to win approval for its stalled plan to drill for oil in the Alaskan Arctic, Royal Dutch Shell is beginning a public lobbying campaign, including national advertising, on Monday. As part of the effort, the giant oil company is promising to make unprecedented preparations to prevent the kind of disaster that polluted the Gulf of Mexico earlier this year.
Shell's plan to drill in Alaska's Beaufort and Chukchi seas has been snarled in regulatory delays and lawsuits for four years. The company has already invested $3.5 billion in the projects, and it was close to overcoming the final regulatory hurdles to begin drilling when BP's Macondo well blew out April 20, killing 11 rig workers and spilling millions of barrels of oil into the gulf. 
In response to the gulf accident, the Obama administration suspended most new offshore drilling, including in the environmentally sensitive waters of the Arctic.
But now that the moratorium on gulf drilling has been lifted, Shell is pressing the Interior Department to grant final approval for its Arctic projects by the end of this year so that the company has enough time to move the necessary equipment to drill next summer, when the waters offshore are free of ice.
''Every day we're delayed, we're delaying jobs and energy development,'' Peter Slaiby, Shell's vice president for Alaska, said in an interview.
''It's a crushing irony that the Gulf of Mexico moratorium is lifted and we are not allowed to move forward.''
The gulf disaster raised public and government awareness of the risks of catastrophic spills from offshore wells. The waters off Alaska are considered particularly tricky because of the long periods of daytime darkness, periods of months when ice would block the movement of relief ships and the fragility of ocean habitats for whales, polar bears and other species.
''We are opposed to drilling until we get sufficient science that demonstrates that you can do it truly safely,'' said Chuck Clusen, director of the National Parks and Alaska projects at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Shell said its emergency response plan was far more robust than the one BP had in the gulf.
''We're not a tone-deaf company,'' Mr. Slaiby said. ''We've really got to be compelling in what we are doing.''
Shell's new marketing campaign promotes an ''unprecedented spill response approach'' including a sub-sea containment system, an upgrade of the drilling rig's blowout preventer and an enhanced response plan that include teams and equipment at the ready 24 hours a day.
The containment system would include a dome that could be placed over any leak, and a funnel to take any escaping oil to surface ships. A rig would be at the ready to drill a relief well if needed.
''We've opted out of the fire department type of approach,'' Mr. Slaiby said. ''Our assets can be on site and deployed within one hour.''
Shell has also scaled back its initial drilling plans to just one or two wells in the Beaufort Sea. It is postponing drilling in the more remote Chukchi Sea pending separate legal challenges.
The company has the support of Alaska's state government, which is suing the federal government to overturn the drilling suspension.
Gov. Sean Parnell said the suspension was illegal because the Interior Department did not consult with state officials or consider the local economic consequences.
A federal district court judge in Alaska gave the Interior Department a deadline of Friday to respond to the Alaska suit, with a hearing planned for the end of the month.
The Justice Department responded Friday night with a filing that argued that the state did not have standing to sue in the matter, and that the Interior Department was in the process of considering the application.
''We are taking a cautious approach,'' said Kendra Barkoff, an Interior Department spokeswoman.
''Alaska represents unique environmental challenges. We need additional information about spill risks and spill response capabilities.''
Shell's campaign appears aimed at increasing pressure on the Obama administration to approve the plan. The company is placing ads for the rest of the month in national newspapers, liberal and conservative political magazines and media focused on Congress.
For Shell and others in the oil and gas industry, nothing less than the revival of Alaska's oil history is at stake.
Alaska is the second-biggest oil-producing state after Texas, but it has suffered a steady production decline since 1988, when output peaked at 2.1 million barrels a day.
With its North Slope fields long past their prime, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge off-limits to drilling and offshore wells largely untapped, the state today produces about 680,000 barrels a day and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System is running at one-third of capacity.
To make matters worse, the United States Geological Survey last month cut previous estimates of oil reserves in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve, an area preserved by the federal government in case of national emergency, by about 90 percent, to 896 million barrels, approximately what the country consumes in six weeks.
Industry officials say there are as many as 25 billion barrels of oil reserves in the Alaskan Arctic. At the moment, there has been no offshore drilling in Alaskan federal waters since 2003, although there is some production from older wells.
Companies wanting to drill face heavy drilling costs, local opposition and legal challenges from environmental groups that say a potential blowout could endanger critical feeding and spawning grounds for a variety of Arctic species and warn that rough Arctic seas would complicate any containment and cleanup operations.
Mr. Clusen of the resources council noted that a blowout at Shell's project would cause a slick on barrier islands that are critical birthing areas for polar bears in the winter.
He urged that Shell be obliged to rewrite its exploration documents to include the new response plans and allow the Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement to formally review ''whether that response is adequate or not.''
Shell hopes that Chukchi Sea leases it acquired for $2.1 billion in 2008 could eventually produce as much as 400,000 barrels of oil a day. The holdings in the Beaufort Sea are probably less bountiful, but could eventually produce as much as 100,000 barrels a day.
Shell executives insist that drilling in Arctic waters is safe. They say they will be drilling in 100 to 150 feet of water in the Beaufort Sea, compared with depths of 5,000 feet and more in the gulf, which means that the equipment will be subject to far less pressure.

HEADLINE: Jobs Report Helps a Rally, Lifting Indexes to Highest Levels This Year

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Catherine Rampell and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Friday as a better-than-expected jobs report helped the market extend robust gains of the day before, keeping the major indexes at their highest levels for at least a year.
The rally, though small, extended the momentum generated by the Federal Reserve's decision to add $600 billion to its economic stimulus measures, a move that sent both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index up almost 2 percent on Thursday.
On Friday, the markets had a tepid reaction to the latest snapshot of the nation's jobs market. The Labor Department said the United States economy added 151,000 jobs in October and revised August to reflect a loss of 1,000 jobs instead of 57,000. The September figure was revised to 41,000 job losses instead of 95,000. 
''The pace of job growth is not strong enough to bring the unemployment rate down to prerecession levels anytime soon,'' said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute. At October's rate of job growth, the economy would achieve the prerecession level, which was 5 percent in December 2007, in about 20 years, she said in a statement after the release.
The Dow rose 9.24 points, or 0.08 percent, to 11,444.08, its highest level since the autumn of 2008.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 4.79 points, or 0.39 percent, to 1,225.85, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.64 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,578.98.
The Dow and the Nasdaq ended the week almost 3 percent higher, while the S.& P. closed up 3.5 percent for the week.
Shares were led by the financial sector, with Wells Fargo rising 6.4 percent to $29.22, Bank of America up nearly 2 percent at $12.36, JPMorgan Chase up 2.86 percent at $40.94 and Citigroup up 3.7 percent at $4.49.
Corporate earnings reports for the third quarter have also been generally upbeat, although Kraft Foods reported revenue on Thursday that fell below analysts' forecasts, weighing down the consumer shares sector and the Dow. Its shares fell 71 cents, or 2 percent, on Friday to $31.08 each.
Interest rates rose slightly. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 12/32, to 100 25/32, and the yield rose to 2.53 percent, from 2.49 percent, late Thursday.
Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, said that Treasuries were lower after the jobs report but that the Fed program was still providing some support.
The dollar was slightly higher on its weighted index, with the euro falling to just over $1.40.
Analysts said recent economic statistics, including those in a housing report and Friday's jobs report, were showing signs of stability.
''The market has been moving with what would appear to be conviction to the upside for a large number of weeks,'' said Stephen Wood, the senior portfolio strategist for Russell Investments. ''You are getting a stabilization in the employment market. The forecast and perspectives that a lot of the investors are bringing with them into the fourth quarter are holding pretty stable.''
James W. Paulsen, the chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management, said there were starting to be fundamental supports to the recent rally. ''This rally of the last couple of months is predicated on the elections and QE2,'' said Mr. Paulsen, referring to the midterm elections, in which the Republicans won control of the House of Representatives, and the second round of quantitative easing announced by the Federal Reserve.
There was ''increasing economic momentum against the backdrop of a market that is already up,'' he said.
The Fed decision lifted markets in Asia. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index rallied to close 2.9 percent higher. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index rose 1.4 percent, while stocks in Shanghai were up nearly 1.4 percent as well.
In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, was down about 0.29 percent. The FTSE 100 index in London rose 12.56, or 0.21 percent, to 5,875.35. The CAC 40 in Paris was generally flat at 3,916.73 and the DAX in Frankfurt rose about 19.51 points, or around 0.3 percent, to 6,754.20.

HEADLINE: BMW Inaugurates a Factory for Electric Cars

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
LEIPZIG, Germany -- Bayerische Motoren Werke inaugurated on Friday what will be Germany's first factory to mass-produce battery-powered cars, committing hundreds of millions of euros -- as well as its prestige -- to the as-yet-untested market.
BMW said that it would invest 400 million euros ($561 million) through 2013 in the production, which will be at a complex that already produces variants of the 1 Series model. BMW did not say how many of the small vehicles, named Megacity, it would make in Leipzig when the cars went on sale in 2013. But use of the term ''series production'' implies that the number will be in the tens of thousands. 
After General Motors with its Volt, and Nissan with the battery-powered Leaf, BMW becomes the latest large carmaker to bet heavily that buyers will pay a premium for cars capable of getting most or all of their power from an electrical outlet.
BMW could have an advantage in this relatively new market because its well-heeled customers belong to the group that analysts say they believe will be the first to buy battery-powered cars, often as second cars used for commuting and shorter trips.
As G.M. and Nissan both have done, BMW has begun marketing the Megacity vehicle years before it is ready. The company has not displayed a full prototype of the car and has produced only impressionistic sketches of what it will look like.
Typically, BMW begins talking publicly about a new car only a few months before it appears, to avoid depressing sales of existing models. Adrian van Hooydonk, BMW's head of design, said the company wanted to prepare buyers for a new kind of car while also responding to public curiosity.
''We have never been this open about an ongoing development process. We sense a hunger for information,'' Mr. van Hooydonk said on the sidelines of the event to unveil the car, which was attended by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, as well as Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington State. Carbon fiber for the car's passenger compartment will come from a plant in Moses Lake, Wash.
BMW demonstrated the light weight of the passenger compartment by having two children and a young factory apprentice carry a large section of it on to the stage.
''When you get your drivers' licenses in 10 years you will drive an electric BMW,'' Norbert Reithofer, the chief executive of BMW, promised the children, whose parents work at the factory.
Mr. van Hooydonk said that BMW had settled on the basic design of the car and would soon begin road-testing prototypes. Based on the skeleton of the passenger compartment on display, the car will be a four-seater roughly as big as BMW's basic Mini. It will have a large passenger door on each side and small windows on the rear sides.
BMW is planning for the Megacity vehicle to be a sub-brand. As such, it will have some design characteristics typical of BMWs but also some new elements. Mr. van Hooydonk would not say whether the car would have the kidney-shaped grill and catlike stance typical of existing BMWs.
''People will see that it's a BMW,'' Mr. van Hooydonk said of the car, ''but they will also see that it's a BMW like no other.''
BMW, which will create 800 jobs with the facility, did not receive any special subsidies in return for locating in Leipzig, according to Mr. Reithofer. The company was drawn by the well-qualified work force and the flexibility of the existing factory, which is BMW's newest, Mr. Reithofer said.
BMW said it had also decided to produce a plug-in hybrid sports car known provisionally as Vision Efficient Dynamics. The car, which has been displayed at auto shows as a design study, will accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in less than five seconds, but be more fuel-efficient than most economy cars now on the market, BMW said.
The car has a streamlined, carbon-fiber body and a three-cylinder diesel motor augmented by electric motors next to both the front and rear axles. The car, which will come on the market in 2013 or 2014 and cost more than 100,000 euros ($140,000), will use the electric motors to provide power during acceleration. It will also be capable of running solely on batteries for about 50 kilometers, or 30 miles, of city driving.
Some analysts have expressed doubt that electric cars will be more than a niche product anytime soon, because of their limited range and higher cost. But there was no sign of such doubts during Friday's presentation in the futuristic building at the hub of the BMW factory in Leipzig, which was designed by the prominent architect Zaha Hadid.
We're at the beginning of an auto revolution,'' said Stanislaw Tillich, the prime minister of the state of Saxony.

HEADLINE: Looking for a Superbug Killer

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
Worried about an impending public health crisis, government officials are considering offering financial incentives to the pharmaceutical industry, like tax breaks and patent extensions, to spur the development of vitally needed antibiotics.
While the proposals are still nascent, they have taken on more urgency as bacteria steadily become resistant to virtually all existing drugs at the same time that a considerable number of pharmaceutical giants have abandoned this field in search of more lucrative medicines. The number of new antibiotics in development is ''distressingly low,'' Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said at a news conference last month. The world's weakening arsenal against ''superbugs'' has prompted scientists to warn that everyday infections could again become a major cause of death just as they were before the advent of penicillin around 1940.
''For these infections, we're back to dancing around a bubbling cauldron while rubbing two chicken bones together,'' said Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious disease specialist at Harbor-U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Torrance, Calif. 
For example, scientists have become alarmed by the spread from India of a newly discovered mutation called NDM-1, which renders certain germs like E. coli invulnerable to nearly all modern antibiotics. About 100,000 Americans a year are killed by infections acquired in hospitals, many resistant to multiple antibiotics. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, the best known superbug, now kills more Americans each year than AIDS.
While the notion of directly subsidizing drug companies may be politically unpopular in many quarters, proponents say it is necessary to bridge the gap between the high value that new antibiotics have for society and the low returns they provide to drug companies.
''There is a market failure,'' said Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who said he was considering introducing legislation. ''We need to look at ways to spur development of this market.''
Mr. Waxman will lose his committee chairmanship with the Republicans having won control of the House this week. But the idea of spurring antibiotic development appears to have some bipartisan support. Representative Phil Gingrey, a Georgia Republican and a physician, recently introduced the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now bill, which would provide certain antibiotics with five extra years of protection from generic competition and speed the reviews of new antibiotics by the Food and Drug Administration.
Besides tax breaks and extra protection from competition, other ideas policy makers are considering include additional federal funding of research and guaranteed purchases by the government of new antibiotics. Measures like these are already used to encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases, through the Orphan Drug Act, and for illnesses like malaria that primarily afflict poor countries.
The Obama administration is also taking some steps. The federal agency that oversees development of treatments for bioterrorism agents like anthrax is broadening its scope to encompass more common infections. In August, the agency, known as the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, awarded its first such ''multi-use'' contract, giving an initial $27 million to a company called Achaogen to develop an antibiotic that could be used for plague and tularemia as well as antibiotic-resistant infections.
The Department of Health and Human Services is considering creating an independent fund that would invest in small bio-defense companies. Antibiotic-resistant germs would be one priority, according to a report that the department issued in August.
The European Union is also working on a plan, based on proposals from the London School of Economics. A year ago, the United States and the European Union formed a task force on antibiotic resistance.
Despite the activity, there is no consensus on what would work best and little discussion of how much such measures would cost.
A paper issued last month by the Office of Health Economics, a consulting firm owned by the British pharmaceutical industry's trade group, suggested that incentives exceeding $1 billion per drug would be required.
Some critics say the case for incentives is not yet persuasive. There are signs that the drug industry is picking up its efforts on its own, in response to perceived need. The number of antibiotics in clinical trials has climbed sharply in the last three years, reversing a steady decline that began in the 1980s, according to figures from the F.D.A. The efforts are being led by small companies, which can be satisfied with smaller sales.
Ramanan Laxminarayan, who directs the Extending the Cure project on antibiotic resistance at Resources for the Future, a policy organization, said the government should focus on conserving the effectiveness of existing antibiotics. That could be done by preventing unnecessary use in people and farm animals and requiring better infection control measures in hospitals.
''There's not a recognition yet that we should think about antibiotics as a natural resource and we should conserve them like we do fish,'' Mr. Laxminarayan, an economist, said. Kevin Outterson, an associate professor of law at Boston University, said one way to encourage both new development and conservation would be to pay drug companies to develop new antibiotics but not to aggressively market them. Incentives, he said, ''must be conditioned on the companies' changing their behavior.''
Only five new antibiotics were approved by the F.D.A. from 2003 through 2007, down from 16 in the period from 1983 to 1987. A survey last year by European health authorities found only 15 antibiotics in clinical trials that offered some promise of going beyond what is available today.
Only five of the 13 biggest pharmaceutical companies still try to discover new antibiotics, said Dr. David M. Shlaes, a consultant to the industry and the author of a new book ''Antibiotics: The Perfect Storm.''
One reason is that antibiotics are typically taken for a week or two and usually cure the patient. While that makes them cost-effective for the health system, it also makes them less lucrative to drug companies than medicines for diseases like cancer or diabetes, which might be taken for months, or even for life, because they do not cure the patient.
''There's this perverse disincentive against antibiotics because they work so well,'' said J. Kevin Judice, chief executive of Achaogen.
Another factor is that new antibiotics are likely to be used only sparingly at first, to stave off the emergence of resistance. While that might be medically appropriate, it reduces the ability of a drug company to recoup its investment, said Dr. Barry I. Eisenstein, a senior vice president at the antibiotic maker Cubist Pharmaceuticals. Another factor discouraging investment, some experts say, is that the F.D.A. recently made it harder for new antibacterial drugs to win approval.
Leading the call for incentives has been the Infectious Diseases Society of America, whose members are infectious disease specialists. It is calling for a ''10 by '20'' initiative to develop 10 new antibiotics by 2020. The initiative, which is more an aspiration than a plan, has been endorsed by numerous other medical societies.
But so far there is little consumer support. ''We don't have any patient groups for Acinetobacter,'' said Robert J. Guidos, the society's vice president for public policy and government relations, referring to a drug-resistant bacterium. Patient groups concerned about superbugs tend to focus on reducing the spread of infections in hospitals.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the main trade group for big drug companies, has not taken a position on incentives because not all members are in the antibiotic business, said David R. Brennan, the chief executive of AstraZeneca and former chairman of the trade group.
Mr. Brennan, whose company is still in the antibiotic business, said that at a minimum, new antibiotics should be given longer protection from generic competition to make up for the fact that they are used sparingly when they go on sale. ''Give us more time at the back end,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Putting Nutrition at the Front of the School Lunch Line

BYLINE: By LESLEY ALDERMAN

 BODY:
THE lunch menu at my son's elementary school -- Public School 29 in Brooklyn -- looked very tempting recently: vegetarian chili, sofrito brown rice, confetti corn salad, pico de gallo, salad bar, milk. Making the menu even more appealing was the price: $1.50.
When a school lunch is nutritious and tasty, it's one of the best health bargains around. Lunches provided through the National School Lunch Program, which is subsidized by the federal government, cost parents about $1.25 to $2, typically less than it would cost to make the meal at home. For lower-income families, the bill is less, or even free.
P.S. 29 students are lucky; their school participates in Wellness in the Schools, a nonprofit program that places culinary school graduates in New York City public schools to create appealing meals from wholesome ingredients. Across the country, many other school districts are beginning to make healthy food a priority by starting school gardens, using local produce and involving parents in the meal planning. 
Still, at many schools, lunches are neither tasty nor nutritious. While more than 70 percent of schools serve lunches that meet the guidelines for nutrients like vitamins, minerals and protein, many serve meals that are high in fat, salt and sugar, according to a School Nutrition Dietary Assessment study.
Even cafeterias that serve up healthy choices like whole wheat pizza, salad and bean burritos may also offer nutritionally suspect items like chicken nuggets and fries that children can buy on their own. A study by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2006 found that 23.5 percent of high schools offered fast food from places like Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
School lunches must meet a minimum calorie limit set by the government, but it's up to individual schools to decide how the calories are apportioned. If a meal has not reached the limit, the cook can toss on extra slices of bread to bring up the count.
''School lunches are based on an outdated idea -- that hungry kids only need calories,'' said Margo G. Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a health advocacy group. ''But what hungry kids need is healthy food.''
If the White House has its way, school lunches will become universally healthier. The first lady, Michelle Obama, and the secretary of agriculture, Tom Vilsack, have made child nutrition a priority for the current administration and worked with Congress to make changes to the Child Nutrition Act which was passed by the Senate and awaits approval by the House. The updated bill gives schools more money to spend per meal, and includes provisions to upgrade menus and ban junk food from vending machines and lunch lines.
School lunches may be inexpensive, but it's hardly money well spent if your child learns a lifetime of poor eating habits and has an increased risk of obesity, diabetes and other chronic (not to mention expensive) ailments. If you'd like to make sure your child is getting nutritious, affordable food, consider the suggestions below.
BACK TO SCHOOL Go to your child's school and see for yourself what is being served. Pick a day and eat lunch with your child, or offer to volunteer in the lunchroom.
''One of the first indications of a good lunch program is enthusiasm among the people serving the food,'' said Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University and author of ''What to Eat'' (North Point Press, 2007). Are the people who are making the food and serving it to the children engaged? Do they know the children's names?
''If they take pride in their work, it will show in how they interact with the kids,'' said Ms. Nestle.
Look at the quality of what is being served. Pizza can come from a fast-food distributor, or it can be made on the premises with fresh ingredients. Are there alternatives to the main entree? If a child does not like the vegetarian chili being served, for instance, is a server willing to offer the child a healthy alternative?
If you want to know more details about the school's approach to lunch, ask to see a copy of the wellness policy. Every school district is supposed to have a policy that addresses school food, nutrition education and physical activity, Ms. Wootan said.
''You can also ask for the nutrition content of the entrees the school is serving -- about half of schools track these numbers,'' she added.
COACH YOUR CHILD If the school offers wholesome entrees, encourage your child to try them. Though school lunches are uneven in quality, children who eat them are more likely to drink milk and eat fruit and vegetables than those who bring their own lunch, according to data from the S.N.D.A.
''Be an advocate for your child's food experience,'' said the restaurant owner Henry Rinehart, who serves on the board of the New York Coalition for Healthy School Food and volunteers in the kitchen of his son's Manhattan public school. ''Serve on the food committee, approach local chefs and ask them to help upgrade your school's menu,'' Mr. Rinehart suggested.
START PACKING If school lunches are not a nutritionally viable option where you live (or your child is a very picky eater), then combine good nutrition with economies of scale. Rather than buy prepackaged food items, which are expensive, wasteful and often not that healthy, invest in a lunchbox, a Thermos and plastic containers for sandwiches, leftovers and vegetables.
''Packaged kids meals help children maintain a taste for salt and fat,'' Ms. Nestle pointed out. ''They also make kids think that they should only eat 'kid food.' '' For example, Lunchables, the popular meals-in-a-box for children, contain highly processed ingredients and beverages like Kool-Aid.
Instead, make sandwiches on 100 percent whole wheat bread, which has more fiber, vitamins and minerals than plain wheat bread. (Check the ingredients: whole wheat should be the first one listed.) Fill the sandwiches with cheese and tomatoes or peanut butter and jelly. ''Sandwiches are ideal -- they are portable, have several ingredients and a decent amount of calories,'' said Ms. Nestle.
If you have leftovers from last night's dinner -- pasta, say, or lean meats -- warm them up and place them in an insulated container in your child's lunch. Give your child low-fat milk or juice that is clearly labeled ''100 percent juice.''
Don't forget some fruit and vegetables, too. Make sure the offerings look and taste good so your child won't just dump them in the trash. Put steamed broccoli or baby carrots in one container and a tasty dressing in another for dipping. Cut apple slices and sprinkle them with lemon juice to keep them from getting brown (the excuse my child uses to toss them out).
Find more healthy options for children at tinyurl.com/6nlxft, under the pull-down themes ''Lunchbox Fixes'' and ''Kids Week.''
And if your child still cries for Lunchables or pizza? Keep offering healthy options, suggested Mr. Rinehart, owner of Henry's on the Upper West Side. ''The best way to create a diverse eater is to let kids get a little hungry.''

HEADLINE: War Reconstruction Fraud Draws Big Fines

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN; Nate Schweber contributed reporting from Newark.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A New Jersey-based construction and engineering company has been hit with the largest fines ever imposed on a contractor working in the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan, after a whistle-blower revealed that the company had been overbilling the government. 
The company, the Louis Berger Group, based in Morristown, N.J., will pay $18.7 million in criminal penalties and $50.6 million in civil penalties for overbilling the United States Agency for International Development for work in Afghanistan, Iraq and Sudan. As part of the civil agreement, the company will pay $14.2 million of the civil penalty in the next 30 days and the balance over the next four years.
In addition, two former company officials, Salvatore Pepe, 58, of Tuckahoe, N.Y., the former chief financial officer, and Precy Pellettieri, 54, of Rahway, N.J., the former controller, pleaded guilty on Friday to defrauding the government.
Paul J. Fishman, the United States attorney in New Jersey, said that over about 10 years, the company overcharged the government by $15 million to $20 million. ''This conduct is intolerable,'' Mr. Fishman said at a news conference in Newark.
The agreement with the company will allow the Louis Berger Group to continue working on government contracts; further prosecution will be delayed for two years while an outside monitor reviews the company's compliance. The company has been engaged in a broad range of projects for A.I.D. and other agencies, including the construction of roads, schools and electrical plants in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Harold Salomon, a former senior financial analyst with the company in New Jersey, first went to the government with evidence of the overbilling in late 2005 and early 2006, according to Tim McCormack, his lawyer, who is based in Washington. He will receive part of the proceeds from the fines imposed on the company, although the amount has not yet been determined, Mr. McCormack said.
Mr. Salomon first raised concerns with his supervisors about what he initially believed were mistakes in the company's billing process, but was ''shut down'' by management, Mr. McCormack said. ''Then he realized they weren't making mistakes, they were manipulating'' how the company was charging the government, he said. Mr. Salomon went to the government, and then filed a lawsuit.
Mr. Salomon discovered that the company was manipulating the indirect costs billed to the government, so that it was padding the bills with unrelated items. The company was billing things like the cost of the music system in its Washington office to an overseas contract with A.I.D., Mr. McCormack said.
In a statement, the company said that it had initiated its own investigation of the accounting procedures in 2006, before it realized that the government was already conducting an inquiry. The company said that after it realized what was going on, it began refunding money to the government.
