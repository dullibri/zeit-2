HEADLINE: Big-Spending Conservative

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
We've all heard liberal speeches on the economy. The central concern is inequality. Power and wealth tend to concentrate at the top of society, so government must stand as a countervailing power. It must defend the people against the powerful to ensure fairness and opportunity for all. 
 It is interesting, therefore, that when President Obama summarized his economic policies in a speech at Georgetown last week, he departed from this story line and worldview. Obama's chief concern was not inequality. It was irresponsibility. Obama didn't sound like an economic liberal at Georgetown. He sounded like a cultural conservative. 
 America once had a responsible economic culture, Obama argued. People used to save their pennies to buy their dream houses. Banks used to lend by ''traditional standards.'' Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac used to stick to their ''traditional mandate.'' Companies like A.I.G. used to limit themselves to the ''traditional insurance business.''
 But these traditions broke down, Obama continued. They were swamped by irresponsibility. Businesspeople chased ''short-term profits'' over long-term investments. Smart people spent more time manipulating numbers and symbols than actually making things. Americans consumed too much and saved too little. America became corrupted by ''excessive debt,'' ''reckless speculation'' and ''fleeting profits.'' 
 Obama vowed to end this irresponsibility and the cycle of boom and bust. It's time to get back to basics, he said. He embraced tradition, order and authority. He quoted the New Testament and argued that it is time that the U.S. built its economic house on rock and not sand.
 If Republicans aren't nervous, they should be. Obama is arguing for his activist agenda not on the basis of class-consciousness, which is alien to America, but as a defense of middle-class morality, which is central to it. Obama is positioning the Democrats as the party of order, responsibility and small-town values. If he pulls this mantle away from the Republicans, it would be the greatest train robbery in American politics.
 Obama then went on to describe his remedy in the soothing, understated manner of a country doctor prescribing a few small procedures. The country has been on an irresponsible bender, so his administration will have to ''clear away'' a few toxic assets, ''reassess'' the viability of Chrysler and General Motors, and ''create rules that punish shortcuts'' on Wall Street.
 His view was clear. The market is dynamic and important, but it makes people reckless, parochial and dangerously shortsighted. The market needs adult supervision -- a leadership class made up of people who appreciate the market but who also have committed themselves to public service, and who therefore take the long view and are more conscious of the public good. 
 Obama is building this new leadership class. His administration has become a domestic I.M.F., consisting of teams of experts who can swoop in and provide long-term solutions when systems -- finance, housing, health care, education, autos -- have broken down.
 When the members of this new establishment are confronted with a broken system -- whether it involves hospitals, energy, air pollution or cars -- their approach is the same. They aim to restructure incentives in order to channel the animal drives of the marketplace in responsible directions.
 Obama is taking enormous risks. Even F.D.R. decided to concentrate on the banking crisis in his first year and put other issues off until 1934 and beyond. Obama is doing everything at once. And yet in this speech, and in his heart, his approach seems self-evident, reassuring and almost mundane. As explication, the Georgetown speech was a small masterpiece.
 The first danger for the Obama administration, of course, is that his teams of experts may not be as farsighted as they believe. It may not be so easy to out-think the market. His advisers are like jugglers who have thrown knives in the air. It'll get harder when they start coming down.
 Moreover, for an administration that puts responsibility at the center, it is not itself very responsible. Federal spending is the leverage the administration uses to gain control over sector after sector, and yet this money is all borrowed. 
 Obama imposes hard choices on others, but has postponed his own. He presented an agenda that bleeds red ink a trillion dollars at a time. Now he seems passive as Congress kills his few revenue ideas (cap and trade) and spending cuts (agricultural subsidies). Huge fiscal gaps are opening this decade that can't be closed by distant entitlement reform. They can't be closed by cynical Potemkin cuts, a few million at a time. 
 This is not a matter of economics only, but credibility. Obama understands that this is primarily an authority crisis. A system Americans have trusted -- the market -- has failed in important ways. He has found a theme and bids to reassert authority. But he will seem like an impostor and a manipulator if he imposes responsibility on everybody but himself.

HEADLINE: In China, G.M. Stands as a Powerful Player

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- Ford may be standing taller than General Motors in Detroit these days -- flush with cash while its rival is forced to go repeatedly to Washington, hat in hand, seeking government bailouts. But in China the tables are turned.
G.M. is a powerful presence here with 8 to 10 percent of the market for cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles, making it the second-largest automaker in China for such vehicles, passed only by Volkswagen. One of G.M.'s local joint ventures, Wuling, dominates the sale of bare-bones pickups and vans, hugely popular in rural areas, with nearly half the market. 
And in discussions about a possible bankruptcy to break G.M. into a ''good G.M.'' of viable businesses and a ''bad G.M.'' composed of the rest of the automaker, the company's Chinese operations are consistently mentioned as a candidate for the good G.M.
Unlike the gas guzzlers churned out by G.M.'s North American operation, the company's China division has emphasized fuel-sipping models in the last decade. Two weeks ago, G.M. set a target of roughly doubling sales in China within five years, to two million vehicles a year.
By contrast, Ford languishes in 10th place with 3 percent of the market.
G.M.'s recent fortunes received a lift from the Chinese government's decision last autumn to cut taxes to 1 percent on cars with engines of 1.6 liters or less while raising them to as much as 40 percent for cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles with larger engines.
And after the government introduced a subsidy of $730 last month for vehicle buyers in rural areas, G.M.'s Wuling operation can barely build minivans fast enough.
Only one of the four models Ford sells in China, the Fiesta, has engines small enough to qualify for the recent tax break. Fiesta sales have been strong while sales of other models have been weak.
Ford's joint venture partner for making sedans in China, Changan Automobile Group, is the main rival for G.M.'s joint venture in small minivans -- but Ford set up its relationship with Changan many years ago to exclude such light commercial vehicles, so Changan makes them on its own.
Nick Reilly, the president of G.M.'s Asian and Pacific region, said at the Shanghai auto show this week that G.M.'s Chinese operations generated enough cash to cover their own investment costs.
Beyond the recent tax incentives and subsidies, G.M. is ahead in China for two other reasons. The company bought the assets of bankrupt Daewoo of South Korea in 2002 and turned them into its worldwide center for small-car design, with an emphasis on supplying the Asian market.
Ford has continued to rely on Europe to design its small cars, although John Parker, Ford's executive vice president for Asia, the Pacific and Africa, said Ford would look for ways to do more engineering in China as well.
G.M.'s other advantage is that its Chinese operations were highly independent of the rest of the corporation for many years. Philip F. Murtaugh, the executive who built G.M. China, emphasized fuel economy and affordability as the company's North American operations were betting heavily on S.U.V.'s. In fact, G.M. became so big and successful in China that the company's management stripped the subsidiary of its independence in early 2005 and put vehicle design, parts purchasing and other functions under more supervision from Detroit. (Mr. Murtaugh resigned in protest; he has since worked stints at the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation and Chrysler and has been unemployed and looking for work since December.)
Ford has taken what it has sometimes described as a ''measured'' approach to the Chinese market -- only to be caught by surprise as the Chinese market surpassed the American market in sales during the first quarter.
Mr. Parker said that the manufacturer was reviewing its offerings in the Chinese market in light of government policies aimed at pushing the market toward fuel-efficient models that are also affordable.
But Ford has no intention to enter the market for light commercial vehicles in China, he added. Costing as little as $5,000, these vehicles share few parts with cars.
Ford sold 306,000 vehicles in China last year compared with 1.9 million from its core Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands in the United States. G.M. sold 1.09 million vehicles in China last year, a third of its sales in the United States.
G.M.'s vehicles in China range from bare-bones pickups for less than $5,000 to Cadillacs costing more than $100,000.
The weakest of the Detroit automakers here is Chrysler, which does not even rank among the top 20 automakers in China by sales . When Daimler sold most of Chrysler to Cerberus nearly two years ago, a long argument ensued over the fate of a factory on the outskirts of Beijing that was making both Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler cars.
Daimler ended up keeping the factory, leaving Chrysler dependent on imports, which are subject to a 25 percent tariff.
A small stage was erected as a backdrop for Chrysler's exhibit of existing models, with a row of fake cactus and a toy wind turbine slowly rotating at the top of a 15-foot-high tower.
But Chrysler has no vehicles on the market in China with engines of 1.6 liters or less; the Chrysler vehicle with the smallest engine on display at the show was a Dodge Caliber compact with a 2-liter engine. In front of the fake cactus was a Jeep Commander with a 5.7-liter engine.
Michael Dunne, an auto analyst in Shanghai for J. D. Power & Associates, said that Chinese car buyers were aware of the difficulties of the Detroit automakers in the United States because of heavy media coverage of them in China, but tended to see their operations in China as distinct. Executives at Nissan and at three Chinese automakers -- Geely, Great Wall Motor and New-Power Automobile Technology -- all said that they saw little effect from the American difficulties on the sales here of G.M. and Ford.
Indeed, Detroit's difficulties may have a side benefit of shielding the American market from Chinese competition for a little while longer. Companies like Great Wall are wary of starting to export to the United States at such a politically and financially worrisome time.
''I don't think this year or the next year is a good time to launch a new brand, because the Big Three have headaches and the U.S. government is nervous,'' said Steven Wang, Great Wall's marketing director.

HEADLINE: Do I Hear a Housing Rebound? Not Yet

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: Leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The closest thing to a real estate crystal ball in the last few years has been the house auctions that are regularly held around the country.
In 2006 and early 2007, the official housing statistics were still showing that house prices were holding up. But that was largely because so many sellers were refusing to sell. The auctions, made up mostly of foreclosed homes, showed the truth: house values were starting to plummet in many places.
So a few weeks ago, I decided to go to an auction at a hotel ballroom in Washington -- and to study the results of several others elsewhere -- with an eye to figuring out whether prices may now be close to bottoming out.
That's clearly a huge economic question. Last week, JPMorgan's chief financial officer told Eric Dash of The New York Times that JPMorgan, and presumably other banks, would be under pressure ''until home prices stabilize and unemployment peaks.'' As long as home prices are falling, foreclosures are likely to keep rising and the toxic assets polluting bank balance sheets are likely to stay toxic. 
There are reasons, though, to think that prices may be on the verge of stabilizing. Relative to fundamentals, like household incomes and rents, houses nationwide now appear to be overvalued by only about 5 percent. You can make an argument that the end of the housing crash is near.
But that's not what I found at the auctions.
''This is a perfect storm of opportunity,'' Bob Michaelis, goateed with a shaved head, told the 300 or so people who had come to downtown Washington for the auction.
Mr. Michaelis, the auction manager, spoke from a lectern on stage, and his goal seemed to be to persuade people that they might never see a buyers' market as good as this one. Prices have plunged, and interest rates, he said, are at ''generational lows.'' (The National Association of Realtors has been running a radio commercial this spring making a similar case.)
''Look around to your left and your right, and you'll see someone who sees an opportunity just like you do,'' Mr. Michaelis said. ''We're approaching the bottom of the market, I think. We're approaching the bottom of the market, if we're not there already.''
He then told the audience that, in the last 100 years, house prices have recovered from every downturn and gone on to reach record highs. Oh, and Wells Fargo and Countrywide were standing by, ready to offer financing to qualified auction buyers.
If nothing else, this sales pitch certainly had chutzpah. It combined the old bubble-era notion that house prices always rise over time (ignoring the fact that incomes, stock values and the price of bread do, too) with the new postcrash idea that houses must be a bargain because they're a lot cheaper than they used to be. Even Countrywide, which was taken over by Bank of America after so many of its subprime mortgages went bad, is still part of the housing pitch.
Yet as soon as the auction began, it was clear that the pitch wasn't working.
The winning bid on the first home auctioned off, a two-bedroom townhouse in Virginia Beach, was $115,000. Just last July, it sold for $182,000, according to property records. A four-bedroom brick house with a two-car garage in Upper Marlboro, Md., went for $375,000. Last year, it sold for $563,000.
Throughout the evening, such low-ball prices continued to win the bidding. At one point, the auctioneer, Wayne Wheat, interrupted his sing-song auction call to cheerfully ask, ''Where are my investors?''
The tables that had been set up around the edges of the ballroom, reserved for people planning to buy multiple houses, were mostly empty. Many audience members, like the man in a camouflage baseball cap just in front of me, were attending their first auction.
On Sunday, my colleague Carmen Gentile went to a larger auction, in Miami, to see if my experience had been unusual. It wasn't. The homes there also sold for just a fraction of what they would have even a year ago. The rate of decline in Miami hasn't even slowed noticeably in recent months, according to data kept by Real Estate Disposition Corporation, known as R.E.D.C., which runs the auctions.
A recently transplanted New Yorker named Michael Houtkin won the bidding on a one-bedroom condominium on the outskirts of Boca Raton, a few blocks from three golf courses, for the incredible price of $30,000. ''Things were almost being given away,'' he said later.
As is often the case at these auctions, the seller of the condo -- Fannie Mae -- retained the right to refuse the winning bid and keep the property. But Mr. Houtkin told me he was optimistic his bid would be accepted. An R.E.D.C. employee suggested to him that $30,000 wasn't much below the minimum price that Fannie Mae had hoped to receive.
How could that be? Because Fannie Mae, like many banks, is inundated with foreclosed properties. In recent weeks, banks have begun accelerating foreclosures again, after having held off while waiting to find out which homeowners would be eligible for the Obama administration's assistance program.
The glut of foreclosed homes creates a self-reinforcing cycle. Falling prices lead to more foreclosures. Foreclosures lead to an excess supply of homes for sale. The excess supply then leads to further price declines. Jan Hatzius, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs, says that the ''massive amount of excess supply'' means that home prices nationwide will probably fall an additional 15 percent.
This estimate hides a lot of variation, too. In Miami, Goldman forecasts, prices could drop an additional 33 percent, which is pretty amazing since they've already fallen 50 percent from their 2006 peak.
Nor is excess supply the only reason prices still have a way to fall. Nationwide, homes may not be overvalued by much. But in some cities, including New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago and Miami, they remain very expensive. So while Mr. Hatzius and his Goldman colleagues are somewhat more pessimistic than most forecasters, the difference isn't enormous.
I'll confess that this bearish picture isn't exactly what I had hoped to find. A year ago, as part of a move from New York to Washington, my wife and I bought our first house. We did so fully expecting prices to continue falling (though perhaps not as much as they ultimately will, given the severity of the financial crisis). But we decided they had fallen enough for us to take the plunge. We preferred buying before the bottom of the market instead of renting and having to move again in a year or two.
Still, when I wrote about that decision last spring, I argued that anyone who didn't have to move probably should not buy yet. Prices still had a way to fall.
They don't have as far to fall today, but the great real estate crash is not over, either. So if you are part of the 30 percent of American households who rent and you're trying to decide when to buy, relax.
The market is still coming your way.

HEADLINE: Not Daffy or Donald, but Still a Star

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
DURING the Depression, a comedian named Joe Penner slayed audiences with a routine he called ''Wanna buy a duck?'' Decades later, as tough times return, a marketer is playing up a duck whose pitch is ''Wanna buy some insurance?''
 The duck is the spokescreature for Aflac, formally the American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. A decade after the duck's advertising debut, the character is taking on a more prominent role in a campaign scheduled to start on Wednesday. 
 The duck will become a teacher of sorts, urging consumers and businesses to ''Get the Aflacts'' about how Aflac insurance works. The campaign, created by the Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, includes television and radio commercials, print and online ads, promotions, posters, brochures and presences on Facebook and Twitter.
 The duck is also lending a body part to a new theme for Aflac, which will be brought out with the new campaign. Rather than ending with the prosaic phrase ''Ask about it at work,'' the ads will now conclude with this emotional promise: ''We've got you under our wing.''
 (Somewhere, Cole Porter is ducking.)
 The campaign is emblematic of efforts by many marketers to keep large-scale ad plans on track despite the recession. In some instances, the economy is actually emboldening them to try capitalizing on changing consumer needs and attitudes.
 ''This thing will ultimately be over,'' said Jeff Charney, senior vice president and chief marketing officer at Aflac in Columbus, Ga., referring to the recession, ''and we want to be in a better position when it's over.''
 ''Now more than ever, people need to hear from the duck,'' Mr. Charney said, because ''if people really understood our products they would buy our products.''
 Aflac's supplemental insurance coverage, which pays a cash benefit to the insured, ''is more relevant in today's world'' of financial uncertainty, he added.
 The duck, introduced in 1999, has been tremendously successful in creating awareness of Aflac's brand, said Mr. Charney, who joined the company in November from QVC, where he was also chief marketing officer.
 The next step is to use the character to help potential customers learn the Aflacts, er, facts about policies and other products.
 ''We want to make sure our icon is relevant to what's going on in people's lives right now,'' Mr. Charney said, when ''they want facts, not fluff.''
 ''They're untrustful today, for a lot of reasons,'' he added. ''If you tell them the facts, they'll feel better about the brand.''
 That approach seems appropriate to Robert K. Passikoff, president at Brand Keys in New York, a research company that studies brand and customer loyalty.
 The device of featuring a duck that cries ''Aflac!'' rather than quacking helped produce ''high awareness'' for Aflac, Mr. Passikoff said, which originally ''needed to call attention to itself.''
 Now, as Aflac needs to address ''a certain lack of clarity about precisely what it does,'' he added, the goals of the ads ought to become ''engagement and understanding.''
 As for building up the role of the duck, which is derided by critics as a gimmick, Mr. Passikoff said he believed ''it makes a lot of sense.''
 ''Mickey Mouse, he's not,'' Mr. Passikoff said, ''but he has become part of the popular culture.''
 That is underlined in an Aflac sponsorship promotion for ''Up,'' a film that the Pixar Animation Studios division of the Walt Disney Company plans to open on May 29. Ads depict the duck, a balloon in his teeth, floating in the sky with the movie's main characters.
 ''He's got a lot of feathers in his cap,'' said Linda Kaplan Thaler, chief executive at the agency named after her, which created the duck.
 As for the criticism of the character as juvenile and the mnemonic device of ''Aflac!'' as tiresome, Ms. Kaplan Thaler replied: ''You do advertising for the public at large. We don't do our advertising for the advertising industry.''
 ''We're introducing the duck in his professorial role, explaining what Aflac is and why you need it,'' she said. ''It's a very 'ownable' way to get across information you want people to remember.''
 The duck is taking on a new role as adman in the print part of the campaign, which shows him writing the text of magazine ads and posters with a special kind of pen -- a feather, dipped in ink.
 Although in the commercials ''he is a duck of one word,'' Ms. Kaplan Thaler said, in print ''he's finally getting it all out on paper.''
 Asked if he may begin uttering more than ''Aflac!'' in the commercials, she replied: ''That's going to be up to him. Right now, the Aflacts speak for themselves.''
 Aflac joins a long list of insurance companies that have stepped up marketing during the recession. Others include Geico, which introduced a character named Kash that symbolizes saving money, and Nationwide, which adapted its longtime theme, ''Nationwide is on your side,'' for a new campaign called ''On your side.''
 Aflac spent almost $78.7 million to advertise in major media last year, according to TNS Media Intelligence, a unit of WPP. That was a decline of 8 percent from the $85.5 million spent in 2007, TNS reported, but an increase of 2.4 percent from the $76.8 million spent in 2006.

HEADLINE: Regulators Grant Con Edison a $523.4 Million Increase in Delivery Rates

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
State regulators on Tuesday approved a $523.4 million one-year increase in Consolidated Edison's rates for delivering electric service. Typical residential customers will see an increase in their monthly bill of about $6 in New York and about $8 in Westchester County. 
 Critics of the utility decried the decision, saying it would harm economically vulnerable customers as the region struggles through a recession. Con Edison said it was disappointed by the decision, saying there was not enough money for essential infrastructure maintenance.
 The State Public Service Commission also authorized raising $198 million through a temporary surcharge on bills to pay for state-mandated assessments, for a total increase of $721.4 million. The overall increase on electricity bills will be 6.1 percent across the Con Edison system. 
 The $523.4 million increase was substantially less than the $819 million the utility requested in September, a figure that did not include the state-mandated assessments. It comes just over a year after Con Edison won a $425 million increase from the commission. That increase, last March, resulted in an extra $4.25 in the monthly bill for a typical residential customer in New York and $5.60 in Westchester. 
 ''We are always concerned about the impacts on ratepayers of any rate increase, but today's decision is particularly difficult,'' said Garry A. Brown, the commission's chairman. ''In this economy, the idea of raising rates is very distasteful. Unemployment has risen and consumers are having difficulty paying their bills. Nevertheless, there are certain increases in Con Edison's costs that have to be recognized.'' 
 The commission also ordered Con Edison to take some cost-cutting measures, including the preparation of an ''austerity budget.'' The commission said it hoped that lower commodity prices would help offset the increase in delivery rates. Finally, the commission urged Con Edison to consider applying for multiyear rate increases, suggesting the one-year rate increases were insufficient to ''address the many challenges'' Con Edison faced on operations and costs. 
 Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, a Queens Democrat who has been a persistent critic of Con Edison, criticized the rate increase. ''As long as the Public Service Commission aids and abets Con Edison's game of perpetual rate hikes, the people of New York will continue to suffer from sky-high rates and substandard service,'' he said. 
 For its part, Con Edison also expressed dissatisfaction.
 ''Since most of a customer's bill is used to pay supply costs and government taxes, it is troubling that the only costs being slashed in today's P.S.C. decision are the funds used to maintain the system and provide reliable service,'' it said in a statement.

HEADLINE: STOCKS & BONDS Strong Rally After Assurances on Banks

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Stock markets closed solidly higher on Tuesday, a day after Wall Street posted its biggest losses since early March and financial stocks plunged more than 10 percent. 
 Bank stocks rebounded, bolstered by reassurances from the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, that most banks were well capitalized. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 127.83 points higher, or 1.6 percent, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 17.7 points, or 2.1 percent. The Nasdaq was up 2.2 percent, at 1,643.85. 
 In written testimony to a Congressional oversight panel, Mr. Geithner said a ''vast majority'' of banks had more capital than they needed right now. Analysts said Mr. Geithner's comments helped smooth over resurgent concerns about the capital levels among major banks.
 ''That's what got it going,'' said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at Wachovia Securities, referring to the bump in share prices. ''That came into a market that has everybody shook up.'' 
 Members of the panel, which oversees the government's $700 billion financial bailout, prodded Mr. Geithner on several issues, including how the administration would deal with institutions that wanted to repay bailout funds. Banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase have said they want to pay back the billions in aid from the government.
 Mr. Geithner said regulators would look at the health of each bank and the broader financial system to make that decision.
 ''Ultimately, though, we have to look at two things,'' Mr. Geithner said. ''One is, do the institutions themselves have enough capital to be able to lend? And does the system as a whole, is it working for the American people for recovery?''
 Mr. Geithner also assessed the state of credit markets as mixed. Some rates have improved recently under government programs to ease lending among banks, for home mortgages and commercial loans and for small businesses, he said. But he acknowledged that the programs had not cured all the problems.
 On Tuesday, a gauge of banks' willingness to lend money, known as the Ted spread, showed signs of improvement, dropping to 0.96 points, while the London interbank offered rate was unchanged at 1.1 percent. 
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 16/32, to 98 4/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 2.9 percent, from 2.84 percent late Monday. 
 Investors also absorbed a mixed menu of corporate earnings that included falling profit at Bank of New York Mellon, a first-quarter loss at the heavy equipment maker Caterpillar and better-than-expected results from some technology companies. Those results did little to assuage larger concerns about company profits in the midst of a deep recession, but they offered investors some room for hope.
 Investors also weighed concerns about the global finance system, as the International Monetary Fund said total losses from the credit crisis could surpass $4 trillion. In a report released Tuesday, the fund estimated that institutions would have to write down $2.7 trillion in loans and securities originating in the United States from 2007 to 2010.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: When the City Held Pirates In High Regard

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Give or take, it is 5,000 miles from the Indian Ocean off Somalia to the federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan. That is a vast distance, but few places on earth can match New York for its history of hospitality to pirates.
 On Tuesday, the accused Somalian pirate man -- or gullible boy, if you believe his parents, or possible victim of kidnappers, as his lawyer speculates -- arrived in shackles and jumpsuit for arraignment on charges that he committed piracy on the high seas. Even worse, he is said to have totally bungled the job. 
 It has been many decades since a good pirate case has landed here, and for now, the laws and penalties are stacked to the skies against the defendant, Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse; gangster capitalism has its limits. 
 The authorities say that Mr. Muse, using a portable ladder and carrying a gun, was the first pirate to board the Maersk Alabama, 280 miles off the coast of Somalia. He quickly botched things. 
 After forcing the captain to open the safe, which held $30,000 in cash, Mr. Muse demanded that members of the Alabama crew, hiding in a safe room, come to the ship's bridge, according to a complaint filed by an F.B.I. agent.
 Mr. Muse was persuaded that they would be afraid to surrender while he was holding a weapon, so he put his gun down and canvassed the ship -- by then, sitting in darkness because the power had been turned off. He was promptly tackled by a crew member and was soon tied up.
 Eventually, though, the balance of power shifted: the other pirates, who were holding the Alabama's captain, demanded that Mr. Muse be delivered back to them. The pirates and captain got into a lifeboat. Before long, an American naval ship had arrived, and, the complaint says, Mr. Muse tried to swap the captain's release for the safe passage of the pirates. He also needed medical attention for his hand, and so went aboard the Navy ship. Thus his relocation to New York.
 History shows that the city has long held pirates in high regard. Successful ones, that is. Under Col. Benjamin Fletcher, who became the British governor of New York in 1692, piracy was a leading economic development tool in the city's competition with the ports of Boston and Philadelphia. 
 At the time, Britain and France were at war, a nearly chronic condition, and each country commissioned private vessels to attack the other side's ships. These privateers carried ''letters of marque'' that granted them authority to seize enemy cargo, which they were supposed to bring to a court for proper disposition. 
 It turned out that it was far more profitable to simply skip the legal requirements and board any vulnerable ship, no matter whether it was flying the flag of friend or foe. The big challenge was to find a port where pirated goods -- rather than those seized under the privateering laws -- could be sold. 
 In Governor Fletcher, the pirates found a most willing host, who could be bought for 100 Spanish dollars, according to Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace in ''Gotham'' (Oxford University Press 1998). Pirate money pulsed through New York. ''This boodling was worth a hundred thousand pounds a year to the city,'' they wrote. ''Tavern keepers, whores, retailers and others flourished as buccaneers swaggered through the streets with purses full of hard money -- Arabian dinars, Hindustani mohurs, Greek byzants, French louis d'or, Spanish doubloons.''
 AMONG the most successful privateers of the era was Captain William Kidd, who was hanged in England after being convicted of piracy. Kidd used some of his wealth to build a fine home and helped establish the first Trinity Church, which to this day remains one of the city's most important landowners. Other financiers of piracy, whose names endure in various forms around New York, were Frederick Philipse, Stephanus Van Cortlandt, Peter Schuyler and Thomas Willet. 
 During the Revolutionary War, privateering became a vital element in the rebellion against England. One merchant, John Broome, moved to Connecticut to set up a privateering operation that worked Long Island Sound. 
 It was not only tactically useful, but a lucrative business as well, with thousands of American seamen involved in one way or another, said Mr. Burrows.
 But New York's long entanglement with pirates is not necessarily good news for Mr. Muse. ''I don't think he has deep pockets,'' Mr. Burrows said. ''They brought him to the right town at the wrong time. The place was only hospitable if you had money to show.''

HEADLINE: Large Urban-Suburban Gap Seen in Graduation Rates

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
It is no surprise that more students drop out of high school in big cities than elsewhere. Now, however, a nationwide study shows the magnitude of the gap: the average high school graduation rate in the nation's 50 largest cities was 53 percent, compared with 71 percent in the suburbs.
 But that urban-suburban gap, which in part is due to hundreds of failing city schools that some researchers call dropout factories, was far wider in some areas. 
 In Cleveland, for instance, where the gap was largest, only 38 percent of high school freshmen graduated within four years, compared with 80 percent in the Cleveland suburbs, the report said. In Baltimore, which has the nation's second-largest gap, 41 percent of students graduate from city schools, compared with 81 percent in the suburbs. 
 New York also had a large gap, with 54 percent of freshmen graduating within four years from schools in the city, compared with 83 percent from suburban high schools.
 The report, titled Closing the Graduation Gap, was commissioned by the America's Promise Alliance, a nonprofit group that works to reduce the nation's dropout rate. The alliance is headed by Alma Powell and her husband, Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state.
 The graduation rates cited in the report were for the class of 2005, the most recent year for which Department of Education data were available, said Christopher B. Swanson, director of the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center, the Maryland-based group that produced the study. The report builds on research begun in a previous study released a year ago. 
 Some big city school districts that have worked to improve their graduation rates have made significant progress since the middle of the last decade, Dr. Swanson said. Philadelphia public schools, for instance, raised the graduation rate to 62 percent in 2005 from 39 percent in 1995, the report said.
 As a whole, the nation's graduation rate improved by a few percentage points over the same decade, to 71 percent from 66 percent, the study said.
 But Marguerite Kondracke, the executive director of the alliance, said the pace of progress remained disappointing.
 ''We don't have time as a nation for incremental change,'' Ms. Kondracke said. ''Just over half the students in our big cities are graduating from high school, and that's unacceptable.''
 For decades, high school graduation rates were routinely overstated in official statistics, with the Department of Education putting the nation's rate above 80 percent and some states reporting rates above 90 percent. Behind the false data were a host of faulty reporting methods, including labeling dropouts who obtained G.E.D. certificates as graduates.
 The No Child Left Behind law signed in 2002 did little to improve the problem, allowing states to use dozens of different reporting methods. New Mexico, for example, was allowed to define its rate as the percentage of enrolled 12th graders who received a diploma, a method that grossly undercounted dropouts by ignoring all students who left school before 12th grade. 
 In 2005, the Department of Education joined a trend toward standardization by publishing an official federal estimate of state graduation rates, and governors agreed to adopt a uniform calculation method. In one of her last official acts last year, Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings ordered states to calculate their graduation rates using the formula the governors had agreed upon by 2013.
 Several provisions of the economic stimulus law signed in February may help improve graduation rates, including one that requires states to ensure that all schools, city or suburban, rich or poor, have equal access to qualified teachers, Ms. Kondracke said.
 ''This urban-suburban graduation gap has developed partly because teacher quality is not the same from classroom to classroom,'' she said. ''So improving teacher quality is crucial to raising graduation rates in these inner-city schools.''
 The study found that the Indianapolis public schools had the lowest graduation rate of any large American city in 2005, with only 30 percent of freshmen graduating on time. Several large Western cities, in contrast, had graduation rates that exceeded the national average. The Mesa Unified District in Arizona had the highest graduation rate of any large city, with 77 out of every 100 freshmen there graduating four years later, the study found.

HEADLINE: Family Dies, Apparently in Murder-Suicide

BYLINE: By THEO EMERY; Angela Macropoulos contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: TOWSON, Md. 

 BODY:
The bodies of a New York lawyer, his wife and their two daughters were found in a hotel room in this Baltimore suburb, the authorities said Tuesday, apparently the victims of a murder-suicide. 
 Employees of the Sheraton Baltimore North Hotel found the bodies of William Parente, 59; his wife, Betty Parente, 58; and their children, Stephanie, 19, a sophomore at nearby Loyola College, and Catherine, 11, on Monday afternoon inside their locked room on the 10th floor, said Cpl. Michael Hill of the Baltimore County police. The employees went to the room after the Parentes did not check out on time Monday, Corporal Hill said. 
 The couple and their younger daughter had traveled to Towson from their home in Garden City, on Long Island, to visit Stephanie, a speech and language pathology major at Loyola who had been accepted to a program of study next year in Newcastle, England. 
 Corporal Hill would not say how the victims died or whether a suicide note was left. He said that he thought one of the parents was responsible but that the authorities were still searching for a motive.
 ''Was it economic reasons?'' Corporal Hill said. ''Was it family reasons? We just don't know.''
 Mr. Parente, a 1974 graduate of Brooklyn Law School, specialized in estate planning and had his own practice in Manhattan. No one returned calls to his office on Tuesday.
 The deaths shocked people on Long Island who knew the family.
 Betty Parente was on the board of the Tri Town Auxiliary of United Cerebral Palsy of Nassau and volunteered with the Girl Scouts and the American Cancer Society, friends said. A neighbor, Robert Krener, who said he sold the Parentes their house 12 years ago, called the deaths ''an anomaly on a scale I can't begin to fathom.''
 ''He was a hard-working guy; not once did I ever see the slightest friction between the two of them,'' Mr. Krener said. ''I knew of no financial problems, and they didn't seem to skimp on anything.''
 ''It sounds so trite,'' he said, ''but they were the most wonderful couple. Something must have been terribly wrong. The community just loved them and embraced them.'' 
 Corporal Hill said that the Parentes had breakfast together on Sunday morning, and that a hotel employee saw them together on Sunday afternoon, the last time they were seen alive.

HEADLINE: A.M.D. Posts Wider Quarterly Loss

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Advanced Micro Devices, the chip maker, said on Tuesday that its losses widened as it grappled with the slow economy and its own restructuring. 
 The company, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., fared better in the first quarter than Wall Street had expected. Yet investors were clearly disappointed that A.M.D. executives did not echo the optimism expressed by Intel. Paul S. Otellini, Intel's chief executive, said last week that the personal computer industry had bottomed out in the first quarter and that the ''worst is now behind us.''
 Instead, A.M.D. executives said they expected sales to decline further in the second quarter, and demand remained soft. ''The outlook is murky at best,'' said Derrick R. Meyer, the chief executive, in a conference call with analysts. But he said A.M.D. had made substantial progress in cutting costs and strengthening its product lineup.
 Shares of A.M.D. fell more than 6 percent in after-hours trading after release of the earnings report. In regular trading, A.M.D.'s shares rose 5 cents to close at $3.36.
 A.M.D.'s loss for the quarter was $416 million, or 66 cents a share, compared with $364 million, or 60 cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
 Sales declined 21 percent, to $1.2 billion, from $1.5 billion a year ago. Excluding one-time charges, the company lost 62 cents a share.
 Cody Acree, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, said the quarter was ''as good as can be expected in this environment.''

HEADLINE: As One City Accelerates Its Loss, Another Relishes a Rare Boom

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich. 

 BODY:
Dozens of proposals have been floated over the years to slow this city's endless decline. Now another idea is gaining support: speed it up. 
 Instead of waiting for houses to become abandoned and then pulling them down, local leaders are talking about demolishing entire blocks and even whole neighborhoods.
 The population would be condensed into a few viable areas. So would stores and services. A city built to manufacture cars would be returned in large measure to the forest primeval. 
 ''Decline in Flint is like gravity, a fact of life,'' said Dan Kildee, the Genesee County treasurer and chief spokesman for the movement to shrink Flint. ''We need to control it instead of letting it control us.''
 The recession in Flint, as in many old-line manufacturing cities, is quickly making a bad situation worse. Firefighters and police officers are being laid off as the city struggles with a $15 million budget deficit. Many public schools are likely to be closed.
 ''A lot of people remember the past, when we were a successful city that others looked to as a model, and they hope. But you can't base government policy on hope,'' said Jim Ananich, president of the Flint City Council. ''We have to do something drastic.'' 
 In searching for a way out, Flint is becoming a model for a different era. 
 Planned shrinkage became a workable concept in Michigan a few years ago, when the state changed its laws regarding properties foreclosed for delinquent taxes. Before, these buildings and land tended to become mired in legal limbo, contributing to blight. Now they quickly become the domain of county land banks, giving communities a powerful tool for change. 
 Indianapolis and Little Rock, Ark., have recently set up land banks, and other cities are in the process of doing so. ''Shrinkage is moving from an idea to a fact,'' said Karina Pallagst, director of the Shrinking Cities in a Global Perspective Program at the University of California, Berkeley. ''There's finally the insight that some cities just don't have a choice.''
 While the shrinkage debate has been simmering in Flint for several years, it suddenly gained prominence last month with a blunt comment by the acting mayor, Michael K. Brown, who talked at a Rotary Club lunch about ''shutting down quadrants of the city.''
 Nothing will happen immediately, but Flint has begun updating its master plan, a complicated task last done in 1965. Then it was a prosperous city of 200,000 looking to grow to 350,000. It now has 110,000 people, about a third of whom live in poverty.
 Flint has about 75 neighborhoods spread out over 34 square miles. It will be a delicate process to decide which to favor, Mr. Kildee acknowledged from the driver's seat of his Grand Cherokee.
 He will play a crucial role in those decisions. In addition to being the treasurer of Genesee County, whose largest city by far is Flint, Mr. Kildee is chief executive of the local land bank. In the last year, the county has acquired through tax foreclosure about 900 houses in the city, some of them in healthy neighborhoods. 
 A block adjacent to downtown has the potential for renewal; it would make sense to fill in the vacant lots there, since it is a few steps from a University of Michigan campus.
 A short distance away, the scene is more problematic. Only a few houses remain on the street; the sidewalk is so tattered it barely exists. ''When was the last time someone walked on that?'' Mr. Kildee said. ''Most rural communities don't have sidewalks.''
 But what about the people who do live here and might want their sidewalk fixed rather than removed?
 ''Not everyone's going to win,'' he said. ''But now, everyone's losing.''
 On many streets, the weekly garbage pickup finds only one bag of trash. If those stops could be eliminated, Mr. Kildee said, the city could save $100,000 a year -- one of many savings that shrinkage could bring. 
 Mr. Kildee was born in Flint in 1958. The house he lived in as a child has just been foreclosed on by the county, so he stopped to look. It is a little blue house with white trim, sad and derelict. So are two houses across the street.
 ''If it's going to look abandoned, let it be clean and green,'' he said. ''Create the new Flint forest -- something people will choose to live near, rather than something that symbolizes failure.''
 Watching suspiciously from next door is Charlotte Kelly. Her house breaks the pattern: it is immaculate, all polished wood and fresh paint. When Ms. Kelly, a city worker, moved to the street in 2002, all the houses were occupied and the neighborhood seemed viable. 
 These days, crime is brazen: two men recently stripped the siding off Mr. Kildee's old house, ''laughing like they were going to a picnic,'' Ms. Kelly said. Down the street are many more abandoned houses, as well as a huge hand-painted sign that proclaims, ''No prostitution zone.''
 ''It saddens my heart,'' she said. ''I was born in Flint in 1955. I've seen it in the glory days, and every year it gets worse.''
 Mr. Kildee makes his pitch. Would she be interested in moving if the city offered her an equivalent or better house in a more stable and safer neighborhood?
 Despite her pride in her home, the calculation takes Ms. Kelly about a second. ''Yes,'' she said, ''I would be willing.''

HEADLINE: Shakeout Nears for Real Estate Firms

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
Though it came as no surprise to investors, the collapse of General Growth Properties, the nation's second-largest mall owner, has stirred new fears about a coming debacle in commercial real estate. The company, which owns 200 shopping centers encompassing 200 million square feet and 24,000 tenants, filed for bankruptcy protection last week.
 With the credit markets virtually shut down, General Growth said it was unable to refinance the $3.3 billion in debt that had already matured or would be due this year. These included loans totaling $900 million on two malls in Las Vegas -- Fashion Show and the Shoppes at the Palazzo -- that were due to be repaid in November. An additional $6.4 billion in debt matures next year.
 The global credit crisis, weakening retail demand and rising unemployment have taken a toll on commercial property around the world. At least $153 billion worth of property is already in distress, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York research company. Of this, $87.1 billion represents defaulted mortgages, while the rest is outstanding debt from about 40 commercial-property and investment companies that have failed, most of them outside the United States. 
 In Japan, Australia and Spain, more companies than properties have faltered, said Robert M. White Jr., the president of Real Capital. ''Here in the U.S., the majority of the issues are more at the property level than the company level right now,'' he said. 
 General Growth has a good reputation as an operator of shopping malls, but it has been widely criticized for relying heavily on short-term mortgage debt, a practice that most public real estate companies frown on. Analysts said General Growth's failure does not mean that other large real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are likely to follow it into bankruptcy court.
 On the contrary, the REIT industry is trying to reinvigorate itself. In recent months, 10 of the strongest REITs have issued $4.7 billion in equity, giving them capital for near-term debt maturities, said Keven S. Lindemann, the director of real estate for SNL Financial, a research company in Charlottesville, Va. 
 These companies include the Simon Property Group, the nation's largest mall owner; the Kimco Realty Corporation, an operator of strip malls; and the AMB Property Corporation and Pro- Logis, which specialize in distribution centers. On Tuesday, Vornado Realty Trust, which owns office buildings and shopping centers, joined the list.
 Other REITs are expected to follow suit, said Barry Vinocur, the editor of the trade publisher REIT Zone Publications. The infusion of new capital ''removes the risk and the uncertainty,'' Mr. Vinocur said, ''and at some point in time, there are going to be opportunities, and these companies will be better positioned to take advantage of them.''
 Mike Kirby, a principal at Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif., said he expected as many as 20 of the weaker REITs to ''either vanish, get acquired or become inactive.''
 Like General Growth, many highly leveraged private companies are finding it difficult, if not impossible, to refinance mortgages that were issued to them as real estate values were soaring. In the United States, about $537 billion in mortgages will mature before the end of next year, said Sam Chandan, the president of Real Estate Economics, a New York company that monitors the real estate debt markets. ''There is growing evidence that even good-quality borrowers do not have access to refinancing,'' Mr. Chandan said.
 In recent years, General Growth financed much of its rapid expansion with bonds made up of pooled commercial mortgages, which are then sliced into various categories of risk. Delinquencies of so-called commercial mortgage-backed securities represent only 1.4 percent of all outstanding loans, but they are increasing at an alarming rate. In February, the delinquent unpaid balance for these loans amounted to $11.99 billion, up from $3.48 billion in February 2008, according to Realpoint, a credit ratings agency in Horsham, Pa. 
 Two-thirds of the delinquency, in dollar volume, comes from loans issued in 2005 to 2007, a period when competition among lenders led to overly optimistic projections about rent growth. Delinquencies are expected to rise as borrowers exhaust reserve funds they established to cover their debt service while they waited for rents to go up.
 General Growth's problems have highlighted the difficulties for borrowers in modifying loans that have been securitized. In a filing with the bankruptcy court, Adam S. Metz, the chief executive of General Growth since John Bucksbaum, a member of the company's founding family, stepped down in October, said the company faced ''steep logistical challenges'' in trying to negotiate extensions. 
 Restrictions stemming from tax considerations make it extremely difficult to change the terms of a securitized loan, said Thomas A. Humphreys, a partner in New York at the law firm Morrison & Foerster. 
 Another obstacle for borrowers is that investors in commercial mortgage-backed securities have divergent interests, depending on their level of risk. Investors with the highest-grade bonds may want to cash out through a sale of the mortgaged property, while investors in junk bonds who face an immediate loss may want to hold a property in case values rise. Mr. Kirby said property values had declined as much as 40 percent.
 The securitization system ''didn't contemplate that there would be such a rapid change in valuation, and that this would happen during a time when there wouldn't be a functioning financial market,'' said D. Michael Van Konynenburg, the president of Eastdil Secured, a national brokerage firm, and the head of its loan sale team. 
 With so few properties changing hands, values are hard to determine. One benchmark is the recent sale, reportedly for $355 million, of the office portion of the 40-story Bertelsmann Building at 1540 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets in Midtown Manhattan, that had commanded $525 million when it was sold to Equity Office Properties in 2006. The next year, the developer Harry Macklowebought it as part of a portfolio that he acquired for $7 billion. Last year, Mr. Macklowe surrendered the portfolio to his lender after he was unable to make his debt payments.
 In another transaction that received widespread attention, the 60-story John Hancock Tower in Boston was auctioned off this month in a foreclosure sale for $660.6 million, half of what the previous owner paid for it in 2006.
 The decline may seem steep, but Mr. Kirby said values are reverting to where they were before the commercial real estate bubble began in middecade.
 Mr. Kirby said he could not say how much the value of shopping malls has slipped because there have been no sizable transactions in more than a year. General Growth has said that even as its problems worsened, its malls were more than 90 percent occupied, and its net operating income last year of $2.59 billion was an increase of 4.5 percent over 2007. The company has said it plans to keep its portfolio intact during the bankruptcy proceeding. 
 But Jim Sullivan, an analyst at Green Street Advisors, said occupancy and rents were going to suffer, even in the strongest malls. ''This retail downturn is different from the ones we've seen in the past,'' he said. ''Even the successful retailers are suffering sales erosion. It impedes their ability to pay higher rent, and it makes them cautious about opening new stores and new concepts.''

HEADLINE: Auto Plant Breathes New Life Into Mill Town That Was Fading Away

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: WEST POINT, Ga. 

 BODY:
Alfred Hall, a jack-of-all-trades handyman here, landed a job recently hauling pallets from the sprawling construction site on the northern side of town.
 Malcolm Malone, who runs M&M Car Washing Detail from a lean-to on the side of the road, has seen his business swell 70 percent in the last year.
 And Debbie Williams, co-owner of Roger's Bar-B-Que, a popular gathering spot, upgraded to a new hardwood floor, thanks to the steady train of new customers. 
 ''It's hard all over the place,'' said Ms. Williams. ''But in this little bitty town, we're so fortunate.''
 While much of the rest of the country remains mired in the depressing gray of recession, this rural town of fewer than 3,500 people on the Georgia-Alabama border, about 80 miles southwest of Atlanta, has somehow managed to draw the winning ticket in the nation's economic lottery.
 A new Kia Motors Corporation automobile manufacturing plant is opening here this year, an event that many residents of this former mill town, where life had slowly been ebbing away, can only describe as heaven-sent.
 Foreign automakers have flocked to the South, drawn by huge incentives offered by state officials, cheaper labor costs and the nonunion environment. (In the case of Kia, which is based in South Korea, state and local officials doled out some $400 million in tax breaks and other incentives.) But this year, Kia's is the only car factory scheduled to open in the country, drawing workers to one of the few regions now with concrete hopes of quickly escaping the economic downturn.
 Kia has hired only 500 people at this point, but is working its way through more than 43,000 applications it accepted online last year. Supply companies that will feed the plant are increasing their hiring in the area, too.
 ''We're the only place in the nation that is fixing to put between 7 and 10,000 manufacturing jobs online,'' said Mayor Drew Ferguson IV, a 42-year-old dentist who is charged with managing the town's growth. ''We are the place that has the light at the end of the tunnel.''
 The wave of jobs is arriving just in time for a community that had reached a nadir after the textile mills that once anchored it began shuttering in earnest in the 1990s. When the Kia deal was sealed three years ago, Darren Kelley, a City Council member, rushed over to the First United Methodist Church to ring its bell. Annie Davidson, 65, a lifelong resident, erected a sign on her front lawn, now visible to all driving down the community's main drag: ''Thank You Jesus For Bringing Kia to Our Town.''
 Although the plant is not scheduled to open until the end of the year, the signs of revival are already unmistakable. There is the bustling new Irish Bred Pub in the previously moribund downtown; the earth now being leveled for the town's first new subdivision in 25 years; the new Korean restaurants, with their smells so strange to Southern noses, crowded with Korean workers and the occasional enterprising resident, gingerly sampling the kimchi jigae. 
 ''It feels like on the map we're this little dot of hope,'' said Dana Pope, the owner of the Twisted Daisy, a gift shop that is among several new businesses to open downtown.
 When Tom Oswalt, the owner of West Point Shoe Outlet, first opened his store downtown more than a decade ago, the textile industry had already begun its slide. 
 ''There were 18 vacant buildings downtown, 4 collapsing ones, including this one,'' he said.
 Mr. Oswalt has stocked 15 brands of work boots, seeking business from the construction workers flooding the area and recording his biggest sales figures ever last year.
 Unemployment remains high -- in Troup County, where the plant will be, it was 12.7 percent in February, and the rate is higher across the river in Alabama.
 But 2,500 people will eventually work at the Kia factory. A potpourri of supplier companies will employ 7,500 more workers. Thousands of additional jobs are expected to be generated by the new restaurants, hotels and other businesses springing up.
 Employment in the automobile and parts industry has fallen by half since 2000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but foreign expansion has helped to offset at least some of the deep layoffs by American manufacturers. 
 Kia's plant, which will make the company's Sorento sport utility vehicle, is its first in North America. The company's market share has climbed in recent years and it is faring better than others in this recession as consumers look to economize, said Jesse Toprak, a senior analyst for Edmunds.com. 
 Hourly jobs, which are not unionized, in contrast with those at the Ford and General Motors plants that recently closed in the Atlanta area, are still expected to pay about $15 to $27 an hour. 
 Some laid-off workers in the area, however, are fretting about how they can compete for jobs with former employees of closed domestic auto plants who have been frequenting job fairs, along with others coming from out of state..
 Randy Jackson, the director of human resources for the plant, said that some former auto workers had come from Michigan and elsewhere seeking work, but that 95 percent of applicants were from Georgia and Alabama, and most had no automotive background.
 William DeLee, 50, a mechanic at the West Point Tire Company, recently got a call from Kia for an interview. Despite the odds, Mr. DeLee said while changing a flat tire, he was hopeful for a better life. 
 ''I was just excited,'' he said, ''because I got my foot in the door.''

HEADLINE: Some of the Bright Lights of New York's Businesses Are Powered by Wind

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
The use of wind power by owners of commercial real estate in New York City is rising rapidly, but from a very low base, according to energy service companies, which supply the power to businesses. 
 Wind power is expected to be a critical component of President Obama's plan to expand the production of renewal domestic energy, and there are signs that this is starting to happen in New York. ConEdison Solutions, one energy supplier, said its sales of wind power to commercial customers rose 25 percent in 2007 and again in 2008.
 Still, only about 250 businesses buy some measure of wind power from ConEdison Solutions. This number represents slightly over 1 percent of its commercial and industrial customers; of these, some 200 get all of their power from wind farms. 
 Jorge J. Lopez, chief executive of ConEdison Solutions, said that these buyers were ''green pioneers'' and that in honor of Earth Day, a ceremony this week involving the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, would honor about a dozen customers. 
 Commercial purchasers of wind power in New York vary widely in size. They include, for instance, John Masters Organics, a 2,000-square-foot hair salon and hair and skin care company in SoHo, and Chelsea Piers, the one-million-square-foot sports and entertainment complex on the Hudson River. 
 With few exceptions, commercial users of wind power in New York do not generate this power on site, but rather buy it from companies like ConEdison Solutions and its competitors, including Accent Energy and Energetix.
 In 1998, ConEdison Solutions, a unit of Consolidated Edison, began giving its residential customers the option of purchasing a combination of wind and hydro power; in 2002, it expanded this program to include commercial customers.
 Today, commercial customers can choose to use 100 percent wind power, a combination of wind and standard power, or standard power. If they purchase wind, they can specify whether they want wind produced regionally (in New York and Pennsylvania) or nationally. 
 Nationally produced wind power is cheaper than power produced regionally. Wind power can cost as much as 2.5 cents more a kilowatt hour than electricity generated by other means, which costs 13 or 14 cents a kilowatt hour. 
 Once ConEdison Solutions buys power from wind farms, the farms deliver it to the electricity grid. That purchase of wind power is verified by an independently audited system.
 Chelsea Piers converted to 100 percent wind power last October. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, that makes it the largest commercial user of 100 percent of wind power in New York City, though it uses only about a sixth of the power used by New York University, the largest 100 percent user of wind power in the state, according to the E.P.A. 
 David A. Tewksbury, executive vice president of Chelsea Piers Management, which runs the complex, said its annual power bill of $3.8 million was projected to rise only $100,000 annually as a result of the conversion.
 Chelsea Piers is a huge building, with parts reaching out onto Pier 59 through Pier 62, west of the West Side Highway, from West 17th to West 22nd Streets. 
 Its major components are a golf facility, which has a 15,000-square-foot clubhouse and 200-yard driving range with four tiers of 52 heated stalls; two event spaces totaling 50,000 square feet; a 130,000-square-foot health club; an 80,000-square-foot skating rink; and an 80,000-square-foot gymnastics and sports club. The complex also has 260,000 square feet for fashion photography and film and TV production.
 Chelsea Piers consumes some 22 million kilowatt hours of power a year. By comparison, the Empire State Building and its tenants use 60 million.
 Still, ConEdison Solutions said Chelsea Piers' annual purchase of wind offsets 13,344 metric tons of electricity-related greenhouse gas emissions, the equivalent of taking 2,856 cars off the road, or planting 12,300 acres of trees. 
 ''We run a healthy business, are socially aware of the planet and understand what our customers are like,'' Mr. Tewksbury said. ''When oil was going for $150 a barrel, it just became painfully obvious to us we couldn't be a fully oil-dependent company.''
 John Masters, founder of John Masters Organics, has been a 100 percent wind power customer of ConEdison Solutions since 2007, and publicizes this through a sign in his salon.
 Barcade, a bar on Union Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that specializes in craft beers and vintage video games, has been a 100 percent wind power customer of ConEdison Solutions since 2004. Paul Kermizian, a co-owner, said he and his partners had gone in this direction because ''we have a big electricity footprint with the video games, and felt we needed to be a little more responsible with our energy use.''
 Commercial customers of ConEdison Solutions that purchase a combination of wind and other types of power include Brooklyn Industries, a company that designs clothing for men and women and has nine stores in Manhattan and Brooklyn; O'Melveny & Myers, a multinational law firm that occupies nine floors of 7 Times Square; and the Durst Organization, a real estate developer. One-tenth of all power in Durst's 10 commercial buildings, covering 8.5 million square feet, is from wind.
 Constantine E. Kontokosta, a professor at the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University with expertise in green building, called Chelsea Piers' wind power initiative ''an important positive indication of the growing concern among commercial real estate companies of the environmental impact of the built environment.'' He noted, however, that wind power's higher cost could make it less attractive in the current economic climate.
 Besides ConEdison Solutions' ''green power'' program, other wind initiatives under way or in the planning stages in New York City include lighting provided by rooftop wind turbines and wind and solar-powered streetlights, both unveiled this month at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a 300-acre campus that is home of 240 small manufacturers. 
 On Monday, the Long Island Power Authority and Con Ed said they would be collaborating with state and New York City organizations on a possible off-shore wind farm off the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens, which could be the country's largest wind farm. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 30, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Square Feet pages on April 22 about the use of wind power by commercial buildings in New York City referred imprecisely to the cost of electricity at several points.
 The supply charge for electricity from nonwind sources ranges from approximately 10 to 15 cents per kilowatt hour -- not simply ''13 or 14 cents,'' which is the average. The imputed cost of electricity for Chelsea Piers, about 17 cents per kilowatt hour, included the delivery charge, not just the supply charge. And although electricity produced by wind can indeed cost as much as 2.5 cents more per kilowatt hour than other sources of electricity, that it not always the case. Sometimes electricity from wind costs as little as half a cent more per kilowatt hour than it does from other sources.

HEADLINE: New Group Is Formed To Sponsor Native Arts

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Even as arts groups around the country are cutting back because of declining endowments and donations, a new foundation to support the work of American Indian, Native Hawaiian and Alaska Native artists is being established with an initial $10 million from the Ford Foundation.
 Called the Native Arts and Cultures Foundation, the organization, formally opened on Tuesday, says it will be the first permanently endowed national foundation of its kind. 
 ''We needed our own endowment for native arts and culture in this country in the coming century,'' said Elizabeth Theobald Richards, the program officer at Ford who has overseen the project and is a Cherokee. ''The indigenous peoples of this country have an incredible wealth of cultural heritage and cultural expression that very few people know about. And it's also incredibly underfunded.''
 The foundation has been in the works since 2007, when it obtained incorporation papers and established charity status. Only now has the organization hired a president and staff and begun the grant-making process. 
 The new foundation will provide direct grants to artists and arts organizations, support native arts leadership and team up with other native-led efforts to increase financial support for indigenous arts and cultures. 
 ''Arts and culture and traditional languages and religions have been the glue that held Native Americans together -- often in the face of great adversity,'' said Walter Echo-Hawk, chairman and creator of the foundation, in a telephone interview. 
 ''For many years the government policy was to assimilate native people into mainstream society and essentially stamp out attributes of native culture,'' he added. ''It's a testament to the tenacity of our people that we have any native cultures or religions left in the United States. We are seeing a remarkable cultural renaissance in the tribal communities. But the support of the arts has been almost nil. It's been very difficult for Indian tribes to also support their own arts and cultures.''
 The organization is to be based in Portland, Ore., and recently selected Tara Lulani Arquette, a Native Hawaiian, as its president and chief executive. With 20 years of experience leading organizations and advocating on behalf of native groups, Ms. Arquette has served for the last four years as chief executive and executive director of the Native Hawaiian Hospitality Association, a private, nonprofit organization that works with the tourism industry. 
 ''In a sense, it's part of our quest for self-determination and restoring our sovereignty,'' Ms. Arquette said in an telephone interview. 
 She acknowledged the challenge of starting a new foundation in the current economic downturn. ''The mission of the foundation can't be accomplished in one year or even five years,'' Ms. Arquette said. ''But there is a sense of urgency. Our elders -- our wisdom keepers -- are passing away in large numbers.''
 The foundation, which will start with an annual operating budget of $500,000 and a staff of four, hopes to provide about $4 million in grants and program services over the next five years.
 In establishing the new organization, the Ford Foundation reached out across the Native American world. 
 A leadership circle was made up of four advisers from different tribes -- Mr. Echo-Hawk (Pawnee), Joy Harjo (Creek Muskogee), Jayne Fawcett (Mohegan) and Elizabeth Woody (Navajo/Warm Springs/Wasco/Yakama). All five members of the foundation's board of directors are Native Americans. 
 The Ford Foundation made an initial $5 million contribution to endow the new foundation permanently, with an additional $5 million promised if new partners brought $3 million more to the table. The Rumsey Band of Wintun Indians, based near Sacramento, then made a grant of $1.5 million, while announcing a challenge to other tribal nations to match its gift. Once the challenge is met, Rumsey has promised an additional $1.5 million, which would bring the tribes' contribution to $4.5 million. 
 The Ford Foundation has supported similar efforts to bolster native arts and culture in the past. ''The community has the need,'' Ms. Richards said. ''But I really feel the country has the need.''
 W. Richard West Jr., the founding director emeritus of the Smithsonian's American Indian Museum and a Ford trustee, said: ''There need to be agencies and institutions that support native contemporary art and artists. For the most part, those agencies and institutions don't exist.'' 
 ''We never separate art and life,'' added Mr. West, a member of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma. ''Art is part of our everyday life.''
 The foundation hopes to begin making grants at the end of this year or early next year, Mr. Echo-Hawk said. 
 The foundation's goal is to establish a permanent endowment of about $20 million over the next five years or so, he said, and to increase that figure over time. 
 ''Culture, even though it is central to our identity, is the last to be nurtured,'' Mr. Echo-Hawk said. ''There is a need to inject resources into the perpetuation of these profound and beautiful art forms.''

This season premiere of ''Secrets of the Dead'' follows marine archaeologists as they analyze the remains of Blackbeard's flagship, Queen Anne's Revenge, which sank off the North Carolina coast in 1718 with the treasure of at least 18 other vessels. Was the sinking an accident, or had Blackbeard plotted to cheat his men of their share of the plunder?

HEADLINE: Is This Seat Taken? In Front Rows of New Ballparks, Not Yet

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Richard Sandomir contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Odd patterns have been forming inside New York's two shiny new baseball stadiums, ones not seen in years. Clumps of empty blue and green seats are painfully obvious because many of them are in the best sections or right behind home plate, while fans are concentrated in the more remote parts of Yankee Stadium and Citi Field.
 After spending $2.3 billion on new stadiums packed with suites, restaurants and the latest technology, the Mets and the Yankees expected fans to embrace their new homes and pay top dollar for the privilege. Almost every team that has built a new stadium in the recent past has seen an immediate surge in attendance. 
 Instead, the Mets and the Yankees face a public relations nightmare and possibly millions of dollars in lost revenue after failing to sell about 5,000 tickets -- including some of the priciest seats -- to each of their first few games after last week's openers. 
 The empty seats are a fresh sign that the teams might have miscalculated how much fans and corporations were willing to spend, particularly during a deep recession. Whatever the reason, the teams are scrambling to comb over their $295- to $2,625-a-seat bald spots.
 ''I'm sure they're thinking, 'It's just April,' '' Jon Greenberg, executive editor of the Team Marketing Report, said of the lack of sellouts. ''But it's lost revenue they anticipated getting. This is the worst possible time to debut a stadium.''
 The teams are loath to cut prices for fear of alienating existing ticket-holders. Letting fans from other sections move to the premium seats behind home plate and above the dugouts could backfire in the same way. 
 The price of an average premium ticket is $510 for the Yankees and $150 for the Mets. The prices of nonpremium tickets rose 76 percent this year at Yankee Stadium, which goes a long way toward offsetting losses from unsold premium seats.
 ''But it doesn't look good,'' said Maury Brown, president of the Business of Sports Network, a research Web site. ''It's the Yankees, not the Nationals. On television, it stands out like a big sore thumb.'' 
 Hal Steinbrenner, the Yankees' general managing partner, said recently that ''small amounts of our tickets might be overpriced.''
 Still, the teams are trying to drum up sales. The Yankees have hired Douglas Elliman Worldwide Consulting, which promotes and markets real estate projects for developers, to sell premium seats to high-end residential customers. The team has also extensively advertised the availability of the high-priced seats, and invited potential buyers to visit the Stadium at a Select-a-Seat weekend last month.
 Unable to sell season-ticket plans for about 100 of their best seats, the Mets have been auctioning them off one game at a time. At least one fan took the bait, paying $7,500 for two seats behind home plate on opening night.
 The Mets have suffered the indignity of watching a court-appointed trustee sell the two season tickets bought by Bernard L. Madoff, the financier who admitted to running a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme that counted the team's principal owner, Fred Wilpon, as one of its victims.
 An auction for the seats concluded on eBay Tuesday night, with the winning bid coming in at $38,100, considerably below their face value. 
 Neither team seemed worried that some of the premium seats -- any seat that comes with an amenity, like waiter service or access to a dining club -- were unfilled. Some of them could have owners who simply did not show up, which hurts food, parking and merchandise sales. Other seats may be part of partial season ticket plans that did not include games played last week.
 ''If someone's not there at the moment, that doesn't mean it's unsold,'' said Dave Howard, the vice president for operations for the Mets. So far, he said, fans are spending about 60 percent more on food, beverages and merchandise than they did at Shea Stadium. ''There's a lot of circulation in the ballpark.''
 Many fans with tickets are trying to recoup what they can by selling some of them online well below face value. More than 10,000 tickets (about 20 percent of the ballpark) for the Yankees' game against the Oakland Athletics on Wednesday were available, a handful for as little as $5, according to FanSnap.com, which scans the Web sites of five dozen ticket resellers.
 ''More season-ticket holders than ever before are selling into the market,'' said Michael Janes, FanSnap's chief executive. ''Some people need to generate cash to pay the rent.''
 The teams' sluggish starts on the field -- including the Yankees' 22-4 loss Saturday to the Cleveland Indians -- have not helped generate extra buzz. Attendance across the major leagues has dipped this season, and plenty of premium seats are empty in other ballparks. Many basketball and hockey teams have also had attendance declines.
 But the slow start in New York is striking considering how much the teams here spent to build and promote their parks. Like airlines that break even on economy tickets and rely on first-class travelers to turn a profit, the teams need to sell their most exclusive seats to help repay the hundreds of millions of dollars of tax-free bonds they issued to finance their new parks.
 The unfilled seats in New York are even more glaring compared with how robust sales have been for previous stadium openings. The Baltimore Orioles sold out 67 of their 80 home dates in 1992, when Camden Yards opened. The Cleveland Indians sold out 36 games in the strike-shortened season in 1994, and were filled to capacity 455 consecutive games from 1995 to 2001.
 After moving to their new park in 2001, the Houston Astros drew 3.1 million fans, 300,000 more than they ever attracted at the far larger Astrodome. The Pittsburgh Pirates, a perennial second-division team, sold 2.4 million tickets in 2001 when PNC Park opened, 700,000 more than they ever sold at Three Rivers Stadium.
 Mets officials say they are encouraged that they have already sold the equivalent of 25,000 full season tickets, 7 percent more than in 2008. Most of the team's 15-game plans are sold out, and single-game ticket sales for April and May are 87 percent higher than in the same period last year.
 Randy Levine, the Yankees' president, said last week that attendance at the second home game was proportionately ahead of last year's pace. Levine also said that 80 to 85 percent of the Stadium's 4,000 premium seats had been sold for the full season.
 For next season, the Yankees plan to raise premium ticket prices 4 percent.

HEADLINE: Foreigners Filling Jobs That Iraqis Often Shun

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and TAREQ MAHER; Muhammed al-Obaidi and Suadad N. al-Salhy contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
They say they could have opted for Dubai, Saudi Arabia or even Europe. But Baghdad is the destination of choice for a rising number of foreign workers, a jarring sight in a city where, not long ago, they were unlikely to keep their freedom or lives long enough to collect a paycheck. 
 ''Sometimes I hear loud booms, but I don't care,'' said Zahandwir Aloui, a 25-year-old waiter with a wife and two children at home in Bangladesh. ''I like working here.'' 
 Recently he was clearing dishes at the upscale restaurant where he works, one of scores of better restaurants, homes and hotels where the waiters, cooks, clerks, housekeepers and attendants are increasingly likely to be from India, Uganda, Bangladesh, Nepal and Ethiopia. 
 These are not contract workers recruited by American firms like KBR or Halliburton to work at American military cafeterias or to pull guard duty on the perimeter of American bases, but men and women who have come to work for Iraqi businesses that would otherwise hire Iraqis. And even if the number of foreigners working for Iraqis is still small, it seems one more sign that the capital may be on the cusp of a return to normalcy. 
 Despite an unemployment rate in Iraq estimated to be as high as 40 percent, the problem here is the same as that at many places: Even though Iraqis are paid more than foreigners, business owners say it is nearly impossible to keep Iraqi staff members in low-level positions for longer than a few weeks.
 ''There are some jobs Iraqis won't do -- even if they don't have jobs,'' said Basil Radhi, 54, an Iraqi whose family owns a nearby restaurant.
 Since the 2003 invasion by United States-led forces, few foreigners have strayed outside the heavily secured Green Zone, with the exception of well-armed American soldiers, because foreigners had been targets of Sunni and Shiite militias, which carried out kidnappings and executions. 
 Even though Baghdad is safer now than it was in the first few years following the invasion, most of the recently arrived workers say they do not go far from their workplaces.
 Mr. Aloui, the waiter, who earns double what he would at home, lives in a room at a hotel next door to the restaurant (where diners are searched for suicide belts before eating). He says he knows almost nothing about Baghdad aside from the dozen or so steps between the restaurant and the hotel. He has been told not to walk the street alone.
 And while he works as many as 15 hours a day, six days a week, for his $250 monthly salary, not including a $50 monthly bonus, the restaurant's Iraqi-born waiters earn more than double that -- even when they work far fewer hours. 
 The arrangement was defended by the restaurant's owner, Hussein Qaduri, 28, whose previous restaurant was blown up by a suicide car bomb in 2004. Of his 45 employees, 5 are from Bangladesh.
 ''I pay for their hotel, for their barber, for their medical treatment,'' he said about his Bangladeshi waiters. ''Everything comes directly from me.''
 In the five months since the relative lull in violence allowed him to open his restaurant, Mr. Radhi said he had employed hundreds of Iraqi waiters, dishwashers, cleanup crews and cooks. He said he had had enough of what he called Iraqis' suspect work ethic and was in the process of looking for more foreign workers.
 But on Tuesday, Abdullah al-Lami, a spokesman for Iraq's Ministry of Labor and Social Work, said that while hiring foreign workers might have become commonplace in recent months, it was not lawful. 
 Employment companies obtain tourist visas for foreign workers, he said, and the visas do not permit the foreigners to hold jobs.
 ''The employment offices that do this work are illegal,'' Mr. Lami said. ''The people who employ these workers are trying to take advantage of paying them low wages.''
 But Bilal Hadi, co-owner of the Watania Company, one of a handful of employment agencies hiring foreign workers, said that he had, in fact, received the approval of the government and that he was not exploiting workers.
 The workers his company recruits to Iraq through its offices in Bangladesh and Dubai are contacted at least every other month to ensure they are being treated well. 
 ''Abuse might happen,'' he said, ''but it is not my fault.'' 
 Companies seeking foreign workers typically hire ''two or three for a taste to see if it works,'' before asking for more, he said. 
 In the month that the company has been open in Baghdad, Mr. Hadi said he had brought in 400 foreign workers, all of them currently employed.
 Next, he said, he would like to hire European workers -- Russians, Ukrainians and Georgians in particular -- who would be in high demand as waitresses and housekeepers. He would hire them out for $350 a month, he said.
 Among the city's more recent arrivals are a group of six bakers who have come from the city of Rajshahi, Bangladesh. They live together in a rooftop concrete bunker accessible by a flimsy 12-foot ladder perched above the bakery. The bathroom is down the ladder.
 Despite the crowded conditions, Mohammed Ayub Hussein, 37, who has a wife and two children back home, said he would like to stay for a while.
 ''I want to be here maybe four or five years to make some money,'' he said. When asked what he does aside from his all-night shift at the bakery, he shrugged. ''I came here to work.''

 BODY:
Is the Crisis Over?
 It All Depends 
 Is ''the worst'' over? Investors seem to think it is. Confidence that the crisis is winding down has been mounting. But the right answer depends on what the question applies to, and the appropriate answer could be: probably; yes, but so what?; not yet; probably not; or let's hope so. 
 The worst of the credit squeeze is probably over. Even though loan losses are still increasing, the government aid is huge: minimal interest rates, ample liquidity supplies, capital injections and implicit loan guarantees. 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner conceded on Tuesday that the impact of government action had been mixed. But the aid does appear to have helped push dollar interbank borrowing rates down in the last six weeks. The cost of insuring against corporate failure in the credit-default swap market has also fallen by 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points, to about 1.9 percent annually for the United States investment-grade credit-default swap indexes and 1.6 percent for European ones. Improving bank credit has contributed to this trend. Better credit all around means more loans will be refinanced, so fewer companies will go under. 
 The big liquidity push also gives investors more cash to put into the markets. The additional buying power may account for some of the sharp increase in oil and equity prices. There have also been tentative signs of revival in the junk bond and initial public offering markets. To some extent, the mood is following the money. 
 Another worst that has probably passed is in the pace of decline in the economy. The huge and sudden drop in activity after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September has already become something of a business legend. If the decline had continued at that pace, world economies would be back to the Stone Age in a few decades. 
 It's not going to be that bad. Globally, exports are down 30 percent since last July, according to Lombard Street Research. But the pace of decline is moderating. 
 Similarly, housing starts in the United States, which have declined by 75 percent since the 2006 peak, may have reached their low, based on the latest indexes that track such activity. 
 The balance of indicators still suggests gross domestic product is falling in most developed economies, but at a much slower rate than a few months ago. When the economy is declining at only a moderate pace, some measures typically suggest that growth is returning -- the much talked-about ''green shoots'' -- but more show further decline. That seems to be the case now. 
 Inventories complicate the picture. A sharp decline in global demand led to an even sharper reduction of inventories as retailers and manufacturers cut back. As the inventories are rebuilt, production will most likely pick up faster than consumption. 
 All in all, the economy isn't shrinking as rapidly as it was. But so what? It's still shrinking. On that yardstick, therefore, the worst isn't yet over. 
 Now look at another measure: unemployment. Even when growth does return, recovery is likely to be anemic. It will take time to absorb the excesses built up during the credit boom, from too many houses in America to too many Chinese factories making cheap goods. 
 What's more, it's not as if all that debt accumulated by the private sector has gone away. The rise in savings rates isn't going to be a one-quarter wonder. This means that the peak in unemployment could easily be two years away. 
 And will that then be the end of the pain? Probably not. The crisis will leave government balance sheets shot to pieces. The best possible outcome is that authorities manage to wring out all the fiscal and monetary stimulus they can once economic growth has bottomed out; the consequences of that would merely be high taxes and slow growth.
 But there is a risk that this move proves too unpopular and that the authorities instead take the current fad for ''quantitative easing'' to the extreme by printing money to finance their deficits. The outcome would then be inflation. 
 An inflationary outburst might even lead to another sort of financial crisis -- a loss of confidence in major currencies. That could be worse than anything seen until now. 
 Can such a dire outcome be avoided? Let's hope so. EDWARD HADAS

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Puts Bank Losses From Global Financial Crisis at $4.1 Trillion

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As finance ministers gather here this weekend for meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, they will focus on two eye-popping numbers: $4.1 trillion, the fund's latest projected losses from the global economic crisis, and $1.1 trillion to help fix it.
 The huge numbers illustrate the depth of the worldwide economic upheaval and the challenge facing those institutions, which are increasingly at the heart of efforts to contain the damage. 
 In a report released Tuesday, the I.M.F. estimated that banks and other financial institutions faced aggregate losses of $4.05 trillion in the value of their holdings as a result of the crisis.
 Of that amount, $2.7 trillion is from loans and assets originating in the United States, the fund said. That estimate is up from $2.2 trillion in the fund's interim report in January, and $1.4 trillion last October.
 The fund said that it spotted the first glimmers of stabilization in the global financial system, but that ''continued decisive and effective action'' by governments, banks and institutions like the I.M.F. would be needed to prevent the system from going into a downward spiral.
 At a meeting of industrial and developing countries in London this month, President Obama and other leaders pledged $1.1 trillion more for the fund and, to a lesser extent, the World Bank.
 Now, the I.M.F. must figure out how to turn those pledges into hard cash -- no easy task, insiders and outside experts say -- and how to marshal the money to steady teetering economies including those of Iceland and Pakistan.
 ''We'd be deluding ourselves if we think it is going to solve the crisis,'' said Desmond Lachman, an expert on the fund at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. He was speaking at a conference organized by the institute titled ''Can the I.M.F. Really Save the World?''
 The answer, most participants agreed, was no, but its vastly increased resources have turned the fund into a crucial player.
 ''Anytime you raise expectations, it's important that you deliver,'' said Robert B. Zoellick, the president of the World Bank. ''Part of this week's meetings will be about how you deliver.''
 Analysts said the $1.1 trillion sum assumed huge contributions by the United States, China and other countries, which may or may not come through. It also counts some contributions more than once, and it counts some in the form of a synthetic I.M.F. currency that is not hard cash.
 Using funds on hand, the World Bank said it would triple its investments in social safety-net programs to $12 billion over the next two years. The goal, Mr. Zoellick said, is to protect the most vulnerable people in developing countries from facing poverty, hunger or disease because of the crisis. ''It's vital that we make this more than a discussion of high finance,'' he told reporters on Tuesday.
 The reality is that the Washington meetings will be dominated by talk about the escalating losses weighing on the world's leading banks, insurance companies and pension funds. The fund's report said the recession was magnifying the impact of the credit squeeze on them.
 ''Shrinking economic activity has put further pressure on banks' balance sheets as asset values continue to degrade, threatening their capital adequacy and further discouraging fresh lending,'' the fund said in its report, released twice a year, which has become a barometer of the severity of the crisis.
 As banks struggle to cleanse their balance sheets, the fund said, capital flows to emerging-market economies have plummeted, throwing Eastern Europe into crisis. That threatens to spill over to Western Europe, because its banks are major lenders to Hungary, Estonia and other countries.
 Among European countries, the fund has already agreed to more than $55 billion in loans to Hungary, Serbia, Romania, Iceland, Ukraine, Belarus and Latvia. More may yet need to be bailed out.
 On Tuesday, Colombia became the second Latin American country to seek aid, requesting $10.4 billion. Last Friday, the fund approved a $47 billion line of credit for Mexico, making it the first country to qualify for a loan from a program that extends credit to emerging economies that are considered well managed. Poland also said this week that it would seek a $20.5 billion credit line under that program.
 With so many loans flowing out the door, experts said, the fund would run out of money without the infusion.
 ''They really need to nail down this financing, especially from emerging markets,'' said Eswar S. Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and a former head of the China division at the I.M.F.
 In a twist that leaves some experts shaking their heads, the fund needs money from cash-rich developing countries, like China and India, to help more developed but strapped countries, like those in Eastern Europe. 
 Western Europe looms as the next front in the crisis, according to the fund's report. It estimates that financial institutions will have to write down $1.19 trillion in loans and securities originating there. And they have gotten off to a much slower start than their American counterparts.
 In the United States banks reported $510 billion in write-downs by the end of 2008, and they face an additional $550 billion in 2009 and 2010, the fund said. In the countries of the euro zone, banks reported just $154 billion in write-downs by the end of last year and still face $750 billion in projected write-downs, the fund said.

Lauren Conrad, the honey-blond star of MTV's hit reality series ''The Hills,'' has attended the exclusive Crillon Ball in Paris, walked a runway at L.A. Fashion Week and been on the cover of Rolling Stone. 
 But she is about to brave a new frontier: Kohl's, the discount department store chain. 
 Kohl's is expected to announce Wednesday that in October, Ms. Conrad, 23, will introduce a casual California-inspired clothing line for young women in 300 Kohl's stores and on Kohls.com. Later, Kohl's plans to sell the exclusive brand, LC Lauren Conrad, in all of its more than 1,000 stores. 
 The retailer has become a favorite of analysts in part for a strategy of acquiring well-known brands (or brands by well-known people) and selling them at low prices. It is particularly effective in this economy where shopping is no longer a national pastime. 
 ''To be important to the consumer today, you need to differentiate yourself,'' Don Brennan, senior executive vice president of Kohl's, said Monday in a telephone interview. ''You need to give the customer a reason to come in and shop with you. And we feel like these exclusive brands do just that.'' 
 It is a model that its higher scale competitor Target has used to its advantage and that Wal-Mart has struggled to master. Last year, exclusive and private brands at Kohl's -- like Simply Vera by Vera Wang; Elle, which is named for the women's fashion magazine; and Food Network -- accounted for more than 40 percent of the company's sales. In March, when sales at most of the nation's department stores open at least a year fell by double digits, sales at comparable Kohl's stores fell a modest 4.3 percent. 
 Kohl's executives are banking on Ms. Conrad's celebrity -- and on young women's desire to emulate her feminine yet relaxed way of dressing, which has been chronicled for years on two MTV reality shows. Ms. Conrad has grown up on television -- first as the good girl in the hit series ''Laguna Beach,'' about the rivalries and heartaches of privileged California teenagers, and then on ''The Hills,'' a spinoff that is MTV's top-rated show. 
 ''The Hills'' picks up where ''Laguna Beach'' left off, following Ms. Conrad's life as a student at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, an intern at Teen Vogue, a single woman and a voice of reason among petty friends. Ms. Conrad's rift with her former best friend, Heidi Montag, is one of the most talked-about pop culture rivalries since Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. 
 The collaboration between Kohl's and Ms. Conrad has been in the works for more than a year, before the economy took a nose dive. Kohl's, however, is in a category of stores -- discount and low-price chains -- uniquely positioned to weather a recession. Prices in Ms. Conrad's clothing line are $20 to $60. That may work in her favor. 
 ''Now that the economy's not doing so well, I think it's everybody that's looking for bargains,'' Ms. Conrad said. ''I think that it's actually great timing.'' 
 This is not Ms. Conrad's first attempt at designing a clothing line -- but the low prices are new. In 2007, MTV and Tangerine promotions helped finance a line by Ms. Conrad called Lauren Conrad Collection. Casual dresses sold for more than $100 -- and fans and some fashion writers complained. Ms. Conrad acknowledged in a telephone interview that the clothing line ''wasn't as accessible and affordable as I wanted it to be.'' 
 Her new line will be exclusive to Kohl's and will have wardrobe basics like jeans and knits. Kohl's will manufacture, produce, distribute and market the collection. And Ms. Conrad and Kohl's will collaborate on the designs. 
 Her original clothing line, Lauren Conrad Collection, is being overhauled, she said. She plans to take it overseas in 2010. ''I wanted to give it a whole new feel,'' she said, ''but that requires us to take a few seasons off.'' 
 Ms. Conrad's label for Kohl's represents a new chapter for her: she has said this will be her last season on ''The Hills.'' Little did fans know that while she was darting in and out of nightclubs with a camera crew, she was spending her days with Kohl's. 
 ''I'm very excited that I'm allowed to talk about it now,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar's Quarterly Loss Was Its First in 17 Years

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Caterpillar reported its first quarterly loss in 17 years on Tuesday, hurt by plunging sales and the cost of laying off thousands of workers. It also said the Obama administration should have allocated more money for roads, bridges and other public works under its stimulus plans. 
 The $112 million loss highlighted the depth and breadth of the global downturn, as Caterpillar recorded double-digit sales declines in most of its businesses. Its vast geographic reach and array of products, including bulldozers, engines for cargo ships and mining trucks that haul materials like iron ore, make it a bellwether of the global economy.
 The company, which is based in Peoria, Ill., also said the global slowdown was worse than it had predicted, despite government stimulus plans and better-than-expected commodity prices. With lending still tight and the United States recession tougher than expected in the first quarter, Caterpillar cut its outlook for the year.
 Revenue at Caterpillar, dropped 22 percent, to $9.22 billion, from $11.8 billion in the first quarter a year ago.
 The company posted a loss of $112 million, or 19 cents a share, compared with a net income of $922 million, or $1.45 a share, a year earlier. The 2009 results included charges of 58 cents a share for layoffs. Without those charges, Caterpillar would have earned 39 cents, beating Wall Street expectations of 4 cents on revenue of $8.54 billion.
 This year Caterpillar will have ''the most significant percentage decline in our sales since the early '30s,'' James W. Owens, the company's chief executive, said in a conference call. ''We modeled a worldwide recession, but not one quite as severe as we're currently seeing.''
 Caterpillar also called the infrastructure spending in President Obama's stimulus package ''disappointing'' compared with that of other countries, like China, which allocated more than three times as much for public works.

HEADLINE: Little Room to Maneuver on Budget for Britain

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Ahead of his budget announcement Wednesday, the chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, recorded a 90-second video that shows him studying documents at his desk and confidently predicting an economic recovery.
 With Britain's public finances in the deepest recession since World War II, the clip on YouTube might be all the flash he can afford.
 Less than a year after the government said it would spend its way out of the recession, Mr. Darling might be forced to curb spending and increase taxes to keep the country from spiraling further into debt. But with a general election looming next year, the timing could not be worse for raising taxes. In addition, as unemployment continues to rise, the government risks cutting spending too early and delaying an economic recovery. 
 Mr. Darling might be inclined to favor a larger stimulus program, as in the United States, ''if it wasn't for how poor finances are now,'' said Simon Hayes, an economist at Barclays Capital in London. But, he added, ''in cash terms they are really very constrained.''
 On Wednesday, Mr. Darling is widely expected to admit that the state of Britain's public finances and economy is more dismal than he previously predicted. Just five months ago, Mr. Darling said gross domestic product would contract 1.25 percent or less this year. The International Monetary Fund said Britain's economy is more likely to shrink 3 to 4 percent this year, and Ernst & Young's ITEM Club agrees, estimating a 3.5 percent contraction.
 The chancellor will also probably have to face up to a rapidly growing budget deficit. Barclays economists say that net borrowing in the public sector is likely to reach 10.3 percent of G.D.P. this year, which would be among the highest of any leading industrialized nations, rather than the 8 percent Mr. Darling predicted in November. A deteriorating economy and rapidly increasing public debt is an unpleasant combination for any Exchequer chief eager to steer Britain out of a recession and his political party toward a general election.
 ''He doesn't have much room for maneuver,'' said Sam Hill, a fixed-income fund manager at Threadneedle in London. ''On the one hand he wants to loosen fiscal policy, but on the other hand he's already in a massive hole, and if he does anything to make that worse the market will react very negatively.''
 The pound has dropped sharply in recent days against the dollar because of concerns about Britain's economic outlook.
 Britain entered the recession with a relatively high debt level, and that led the government to put the brakes on fiscal stimulus earlier than other countries.
 Now, Mr. Darling is being pulled in opposite directions by Britain's business community, which asked him to focus on reducing debt, and trade unions, which want to preserve jobs.
 Richard Lambert, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, warned Mr. Darling not to write any checks his government could not cover, saying Britain's finances were ''now on an unsustainable path.''
 George Osborne, the opposition Conservative Party's candidate for Mr. Darling's role, told the BBC that Britain's finances were in ''an enormous hole'' and that Mr. Darling should focus on reducing government debt rather than ''short-term political pressures'' ahead of an election.
 In contrast, Britain's trade unions asked the government to step up spending and avoid increasing taxes. The Trades Union Congress asked the government for $:25 billion, or $37 billion, to build homes, renew the rail network and invest in clean energy projects.
 ''It would be a catastrophic mistake to rein in investment,'' the country's largest trade union, Unite, wrote on its Web site.
 There are early signs that the government's investments, including tax cuts, the partial nationalization of major banks and the sale of government bonds, are having an effect. House prices in Britain rose in March for the first time since 2007 as banks offered better mortgage deals, according to the Nationwide Building Society.
 But unemployment is expected to continue to increase this year. London's financial services industry is expected to shed about 29,000 jobs this year, 1,000 more than last year, according to the Center for Economics and Business Research.
 Mr. Darling's problem is exacerbated by a dismal outlook for tax revenue.
 A shrinking economy will only further curb it, putting additional strain on public finances. Some economists fear that the government might never again be able to rely on the financial services sector for 14 percent of tax revenue, as it did in 2007, and say that it needs to look for alternative ways to raise cash.
 ''Extra fiscal tightening will be needed to repay the extra borrowing,'' said Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at Deloitte in London. ''However, this is clearly a political issue as well as an economic issue.''

HEADLINE: Swimming Without A Suit

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Speaking of financial crises and how they can expose weak companies and weak countries, Warren Buffett once famously quipped that ''only when the tide goes out do you find out who is not wearing a bathing suit.'' So true. But what's really unnerving is that America appears to be one of those countries that has been swimming buck naked -- in more ways than one.
 Credit bubbles are like the tide. They can cover up a lot of rot. In our case, the excess consumer demand and jobs created by our credit and housing bubbles have masked not only our weaknesses in manufacturing and other economic fundamentals, but something worse: how far we have fallen behind in K-12 education and how much it is now costing us. That is the conclusion I drew from a new study by the consulting firm McKinsey, entitled ''The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap in America's Schools.'' 
 Just a quick review: In the 1950s and 1960s, the U.S. dominated the world in K-12 education. We also dominated economically. In the 1970s and 1980s, we still had a lead, albeit smaller, in educating our population through secondary school, and America continued to lead the world economically, albeit with other big economies, like China, closing in. Today, we have fallen behind in both per capita high school graduates and their quality. Consequences to follow.
 For instance, in the 2006 Program for International Student Assessment that measured the applied learning and problem-solving skills of 15-year-olds in 30 industrialized countries, the U.S. ranked 25th out of the 30 in math and 24th in science. That put our average youth on par with those from Portugal and the Slovak Republic, ''rather than with students in countries that are more relevant competitors for service-sector and high-value jobs, like Canada, the Netherlands, Korea, and Australia,'' McKinsey noted. 
 Actually, our fourth-graders compare well on such global tests with, say, Singapore. But our high school kids really lag, which means that ''the longer American children are in school, the worse they perform compared to their international peers,'' said McKinsey. 
 There are millions of kids who are in modern suburban schools ''who don't realize how far behind they are,'' said Matt Miller, one of the authors. ''They are being prepared for $12-an-hour jobs -- not $40 to $50 an hour.''
 It is not that we are failing across the board. There are huge numbers of exciting education innovations in America today -- from new modes of teacher compensation to charter schools to school districts scattered around the country that are showing real improvements based on better methods, better principals and higher standards. The problem is that they are too scattered -- leaving all kinds of achievement gaps between whites, African-Americans, Latinos and different income levels.
 Using an economic model created for this study, McKinsey showed how much those gaps are costing us. Suppose, it noted, ''that in the 15 years after the 1983 report 'A Nation at Risk' sounded the alarm about the 'rising tide of mediocrity' in American education,'' the U.S. had lifted lagging student achievement to higher benchmarks of performance? What would have happened?
 The answer, says McKinsey: If America had closed the international achievement gap between 1983 and 1998 and had raised its performance to the level of such nations as Finland and South Korea, United States G.D.P. in 2008 would have been between $1.3 trillion and $2.3 trillion higher. If we had closed the racial achievement gap and black and Latino student performance had caught up with that of white students by 1998, G.D.P. in 2008 would have been between $310 billion and $525 billion higher. If the gap between low-income students and the rest had been narrowed, G.D.P. in 2008 would have been $400 billion to $670 billion higher. 
 There are some hopeful signs. President Obama recognizes that we urgently need to invest the money and energy to take those schools and best practices that are working from islands of excellence to a new national norm. But we need to do it with the sense of urgency and follow-through that the economic and moral stakes demand.
 With Wall Street's decline, though, many more educated and idealistic youth want to try teaching. Wendy Kopp, the founder of Teach for America, called the other day with these statistics about college graduates signing up to join her organization to teach in some of our neediest schools next year: ''Our total applications are up 40 percent. Eleven percent of all Ivy League seniors applied, 16 percent of Yale's senior class, 15 percent of Princeton's, 25 percent of Spellman's and 35 percent of the African-American seniors at Harvard. In 130 colleges, between 5 and 15 percent of the senior class applied.'' 
 Part of it, said Kopp, is a lack of jobs elsewhere. But part of it is ''students responding to the call that this is a problem our generation can solve.'' May it be so, because today, educationally, we are not a nation at risk. We are a nation in decline, and our nakedness is really showing.

HEADLINE: Banks Sway Bills to Aid Consumers

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON and ERIC DASH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
They may be held in low esteem around the nation, but the country's largest banks still wield considerable influence in Washington.
 The banks have made it difficult for Congressional Democrats and the White House to give stretched homeowners a stronger hand in negotiating lower monthly payments on mortgages and to prevent credit card companies from imposing higher fees and interest rates.
 Having won some early skirmishes by teaming with Republican allies, the banks now appear to have the upper hand and may wind up killing -- or at least substantially diluting -- both pro-consumer measures. 
 To turn the tide, Democrats are calling in their big gun -- President Obama -- to pressure the executives at the largest credit card lenders. In coming weeks, officials say, the administration intends to make a major push on consumer finance issues, possibly including tough new lending standards for homeowners seeking mortgages.
 Mr. Obama is set to meet at the White House on Thursday with executives from American Express, Bank of America, Capital One Financial, Citigroup, Discover Financial Services, JPMorgan Chase and others to discuss what officials say are abusive credit card fees and practices. 
 During the presidential campaign, Mr. Obama made an issue of what he considered excessive credit card fees, but he has been largely silent on the matter since his arrival in Washington. As a candidate, he also favored legislation to make it easier for troubled homeowners to use bankruptcy court to ease the terms of their mortgages, a proposal he again endorsed last month.
 Despite the president's support and strong Democratic majorities in Congress, both proposals are in jeopardy because of lobbying by banks and their trade groups, particularly in the Senate.
 On Wednesday, the House Financial Services Committee is expected to approve credit card legislation proposed by senior Democrats that would reduce many of the fees and limit the ability of the companies to charge penalties. The legislation puts into law most of the credit card restrictions adopted last year by the Federal Reserve, although the industry strongly opposes the bill because it says it believes a law would be harder to overturn than a regulation.
 But the bill, sponsored by Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Financial Services Committee, and Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a New York Democrat, faces an uncertain future in the Senate. A tougher counterpart to the House bill was adopted on a narrow, party-line vote in the Senate banking committee three weeks ago. It has yet to find any Republican support, which would be necessary for it to survive.
 The banking industry has also succeeded in working closely with Republicans to water down and then block a measure that would give bankruptcy judges greater authority to modify mortgages, including reducing principal payments. Senate Republican leaders say they have the support of all 41 of their members -- enough to kill the provision by making it impossible to get the 60 votes necessary to cut off debate.
 Senate Democrats, hoping to resolve the impasse, have opened negotiations in recent days, but not with their Republican counterparts. Instead, in an effort to divide the industry, the Democrats, led by Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Charles E. Schumer of New York and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, have been in talks with Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, along with a group of credit unions. The lawmakers' hope is that those institutions would exert pressure on Republican lawmakers and reluctant Democratic moderates. 
 Even if those negotiations are successful, the Democratic lawmakers are still likely to water down the bankruptcy bill further in the industry's favor.
 Before the negotiations, Citigroup had been the only major bank to support the bankruptcy measure, often referred to as ''cram-down'' legislation because it would give judges the authority to dictate terms to lenders and investors who own mortgages bundled into securities. 
 ''The cram-down provision, if it became law, would raise the costs of all mortgages for everyone,'' said Edward L. Yingling, president and chief executive of the American Bankers Association. ''It's a fact that if you undermine the value of the collateral by allowing cram-downs, you make the loans riskier and banks will price that risk accordingly by rates going up.''
 Supporters of the bankruptcy measure had been planning to tie it to another banking bill that the industry favors. 
 That legislation would make permanent the temporary increase in deposits guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to $250,000 from $100,000. It would also increase the F.D.I.C.'s credit line with the federal government to $100 billion, from $30 billion, thus enabling regulators to reduce a proposed special premium the banks will owe the F.D.I.C. later this year by more than 50 percent -- a $7.7 billion savings. 
 But as the opposition to the cram-down provision has firmed in recent days, senators say there is a growing recognition that the bankruptcy measure might have to be detached and voted on separately. Democratic lawmakers have already agreed to the industry's demand that the bankruptcy provision be unavailable to homeowners if a lender offers to modify a mortgage through the Treasury Department's new foreclosure mitigation program. And over the objections of Ms. Maloney, a House subcommittee handed the industry a significant victory when it delayed the effective date by a year. Ms. Maloney said that she expected the measure to move swiftly though the House, but that it faced an uncertain future in the Senate unless it got some Republican votes.
 ''We need bipartisan support in the Senate,'' she said. ''We got 84 Republicans in the House on the same bill last year.''
 Republican supporters of the industry have been helped in part by the decision by some Democratic campaign committees, fearful of voter reaction, to reject contributions from banks that have received bailout money. 
 Some prominent Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, also are refusing donations from bank political action committees. Mr. Frank will not take money from employees of banks that received bailout funds. 
 Republicans ''are never going to beat the Democrats in the fund-raising game in D.C. as long as they are the minority,'' said Sam Geduldig, a lobbyist for several banking trade associations at Clark Lytle & Geduldig. ''To the extent the Republicans can show they can impact policy, it causes professional donors and lobbyists to look at them in a different light, as opposed to when they just got bludgeoned'' in the last election.

HEADLINE: The Makeover Moment

BYLINE: By JULIE SCELFO; Karen Breslau contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LAST year, after Michael Perkocha and Tina Stott asked several contractors for bids to remodel a dilapidated bungalow they had just bought for $630,000 in the Glenview district of Oakland, Calif., they decided to wait before going ahead with the project.
Although the couple, both 49, had renovated several houses before and felt sure they would eventually be able to rent this one out at a profit (he's an architect, she's an urban planner, and restoring old homes is a hobby and source of extra income), the contactors' estimates for the renovations were all in the range of $250,000, far more than the couple could afford.
But when Mr. Perkocha sought bids again in January, ''it was a really different story,'' he said.
Three new bids for their planned renovations, which included major jobs like reinforcing the foundation, replacing the plumbing and upgrading the electrical system, came in between $102,000 and $170,000 -- with the middle one, $129,000, coming from the contractor Mr. Perkocha deemed the most qualified. 
Deciding to move forward right away, they signed a contract, and a 10-person crew began work within the week. Now, three months into a project that Mr. Perkocha figured would take six months, the workers are installing new floors and the couple find themselves in a nearly unheard-of position: under budget and ahead of schedule. ''In all the renovations we've done, it's never been so quick and so easy -- I'm totally amazed,'' said Mr. Perkocha, who now expects the work to be finished in the next few weeks.
''For what we've done, the value is remarkable,'' Ms. Stott said.
Across the country, even as many people are being more cautious than ever about spending, some homeowners with a little extra cash on hand are deciding that it's a good time to renovate. Prices are down for both labor and materials, and contractors are readily available and able to lavish more attention on individual jobs.
Alexander Stoltz, an architect in Brooklyn, says experienced contractors who used to have waiting lists are now willing to take on any job they can find. ''We're getting cold calls from contractors who have been in the business 20, 40 years asking us for leads,'' Mr. Stoltz said. ''Before, they would take a month to get back to you and would have turned down small jobs. Now, they'll take anything and start right away.''
According to the National Association of Home Builders, annual spending on renovations has dropped by nearly a quarter since its peak of $161 billion in 2005. Housing starts, meanwhile, have dropped 80 percent from their high of 1.82 million in January 2006, which has forced a huge number of builders to seek out other work -- and many of them are looking to the renovation market, in spite of its contraction. And in the last six months, prices of nearly every raw material used in building and remodeling, including lumber, steel and copper, have come down, according to a National Association of Home Builders analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Materials typically account for about a third of a renovation's final cost.)
David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders, said the current climate is unlike any he's seen in his 30-year career. ''Consumers are the ones in the driver's seat now,'' he said. ''It's the worst of times for the builders and remodelers, who are very anxious, but it's the best of times for consumers.''
Stephen Curley and Elizabeth Curley O'Malley, homeowners in the Kenton neighborhood of North Portland, Ore., recently hired a contractor to install a second bathroom in their basement, something they had previously seen as far outside their ''range of possibility,'' said Ms. O'Malley, 41. Frances, the younger of their two daughters, stopped needing diapers just after they moved into their one-story, 1,100-square-foot Cape Cod-style house three years ago, significantly increasing traffic in the lone bathroom. ''Four people instead of three pushed us over the edge,'' Ms. O'Malley said.
Because Ms. O'Malley works in the nonprofit world and her husband, 40, is a special education teacher at a local polytechnic high school -- and because nearly every dollar of their income goes to pay bills -- the couple considered an extra bathroom the stuff of fantasy. But when they mentioned the idea offhandedly to Kirk Linder, a contractor who stopped by to evaluate a roof problem in February, he jumped at the chance to provide an estimate, and offered to install the plumbing and fixtures for $6,000 -- a third less than what he would normally charge.
Coming up with the money was still a challenge for the couple, but they scraped together a bit of savings, a tax refund and a gift from family. Now that it's almost finished, ''we're thrilled, I can't even tell you,'' Ms. O'Malley said. ''I was very surprised that we were able to pull this off.''
Mr. Linder, who works as a project manager for Mac-Bo contractors, said the job is one of a few that are keeping the company busy. ''A year ago I would charge probably $9,000 for what we're doing,'' he said, and ''obviously their one bathroom isn't supporting our company.'' Even after cutting staff down to 4 people from a high of 12 in 2007, he added, ''we need to have maybe five of those small jobs to meet our monthly nut here. That's what we're trying to do -- maintain as many of these smaller jobs as possible, and hopefully that will keep us going.''
Mr. Linder said new competition from builders has factored in to how he prices his services. ''I've seen advertisements for home builders who are now selling themselves as remodelers,'' he said. ''I guess I would do the same thing if I was put in their position, but it certainly is an added stress to the remodeling industry.''
To be sure, with layoffs and cutbacks continuing in many sectors of the economy, many homeowners feel it is too risky a time to make improvements when they can get by with what they have. But Shane Monday, a national sales manager at Contractors.com, an online referral service, tries to appeal to hearts as well as heads in arguing for taking that risk. ''I don't want to sound corny, but I think it's a little patriotic for homeowners to say 'Hey, we appreciate the situation that we're in, and we want to spend money and stimulate the economy and help create jobs.' '' Discounts on standard fees on the order of 10 to 15 percent, Mr. Monday said, are reasonable to expect.
A recent survey by Angie's List, another online directory, found 75 percent of its contractors were willing to cut prices by 10 percent to keep busy, with some willing to go ''much higher than that,'' said Cheryl Reed, an Angie's List spokeswoman.
Many people are also discovering that lower bids by contractors are just the beginning. After years of research, Juliette Reynolds, who works for a publisher of travel guides, and her husband, Billy Hasson, a shop foreman at a sheet metal company, decided to build a prefab guest cottage in their backyard in Sarasota, Fla., last June. Contractors' prices were already falling precipitously in the area, where the foreclosure rate was exploding -- it was among the highest in the nation last year -- and new construction had ground to a halt. The couple's contractor dropped his bid from $125,000 in June to $95,000 in August, when they tried him a second time. And their savings have continued to accrue as the costs of materials and services decline.
''Everything's coming in under what the contractor estimated, like electrical, gas, plumbing,'' said Ms. Reynolds, 42. ''Plumbing was supposed to be $6,000, but it's only costing about $4,500.'' The couple is hoping that the project, now 75 percent complete, will come in as much as $5,000 under budget.
The lower prices are making home improvement look like a smart investment to many, even in a dire real estate market like southwest Florida's. In January, Jack Schocker, a radiation oncologist near Altoona, Pa., started getting estimates on replacing two cabinets in the kitchen of his 2,400-square-foot vacation condo, also in Sarasota, which had been damaged by a leak in the apartment next door. But when he and his wife realized, after talking to a contractor, that they could completely redo the kitchen -- and upgrade two bathrooms -- for less than $30,000, they decided to think bigger. ''I said to my wife that in two or three years I wanted to redo everything anyway,'' said Dr. Schocker, 57. ''I usually plan for something like this, but the more I looked, I said this is a good time, I'm going to do it.''
It was still a significant outlay of cash, but Dr. Schocker stands behind the renovation as an investment, particularly given the unpredictable behavior of the financial markets these days. ''Even in this economy, the value of our unit has still risen considerably from when I bought it 12 years ago,'' he said. And in renovating, at least, ''you're spending money on something you love.''
Some homeowners are still holding off on planned renovations in hopes that costs will go down further. Mr. Stoltz, the architect in Brooklyn, has a client in Southampton who has gotten bids to install a pool for about $100,000, but is waiting, convinced the price will go down in the near future. ''It's not a case where he doesn't have the money,'' Mr. Stoltz said. ''It's just that he thinks in this economy it should cost more like $75,000. And he's happy to wait.''
Andy Bernheimer, another Brooklyn architect who does residential work, has a client who contacted him last summer about combining three apartments in a Dumbo high-rise, but then decided to hold off. ''He works in international construction and saw everything was dropping,'' Mr. Bernheimer said, ''and he wanted to wait until everything was more stable.''
Finally this month, the client, whom Mr. Bernheimer declined to identify, contacted him to say he thought the summer of 2009 might be the right time. ''This guy knows the industry, and when he moves forward, it's because he knows that he's going to get good value for what he's spending as opposed to before, when he might have felt it was an inflated market,'' Mr. Bernheimer said. ''There's a phrase in the construction industry that people are 'icing the cake,' which means if something costs X, they're charging you X-times-whatever to do the work because they know the market is really good. I think the time has come where contractors can't ice the cake anymore.''
For Mr. Perkocha and Ms. Stott, the couple in Oakland, declining prices and demand for labor have allowed them to do more than just save money and time. They have added elements like crown moldings and more expensive, energy-efficient windows to the project, and whereas ''originally I planned on doing Formica countertops and laminate floors,'' Mr. Perkocha said, ''now I'm getting oak floors and granite countertops for very little additional cost.'' The house is unexpectedly turning into something even better than what they imagined.
''We got to do a lot of things,'' Mr. Perkocha said, ''at a lot higher level of quality than I thought was possible.''

BUYER'S MARKET: After delaying their bungalow's renovation last year because they couldn't afford the $250,000 bids, Michael Perkocha and Tina Stott were surprised to find that the job could be done this year for about half the price. So they went ahead, adding elements like more expensive, energy-efficient windows, above left, and wood wainscoting in the powder room, above right.

HEADLINE: California: Creamery Looks For Buyer

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The troubled Humboldt Creamery is looking for a buyer after officials filed to reorganize under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The cooperative that was the showpiece of a struggling rural economy fell into trouble in February when its longtime chief executive, Rich Ghilarducci, resigned and warned of serious financial problems. Company officials immediately halted the co-op's first sale of securities and 50 family dairies agreed to defer $5.7 million in money owed to them. Officials said then that receivables had been overstated. Mr. Ghilarducci is under investigation. Company officials say secured lenders have provided $3 million to pay expenses that will arise after the filing Tuesday in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Santa Rosa.

HEADLINE: Reported Suicide of Executive Is Latest Shock at Freddie Mac

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG and JACK HEALY; Stephen Labaton contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The pressures were already immense when David B. Kellermann was promoted to the top financial position at the mortgage giant Freddie Mac last September. Then they got even worse.
 Mr. Kellermann's boss and other top executives were ousted when the Treasury secretary seized Freddie Mac and its sibling company, Fannie Mae; others left on their own and were not replaced. Soon President Obama told the companies they were responsible for carrying out some of his programs to revive the economy, in addition to keeping the housing market afloat by buying and selling hundreds of thousands of mortgages a month. 
 Mr. Kellermann, 41, began working nonstop, sometimes returning home only to change clothes, colleagues say. He was losing weight and telling friends that it seemed impossible to appease everyone -- regulators, lawmakers, investors and other executives -- given their competing demands. Someone was always angry with him, he told one friend. And no matter how many hours everyone worked, it seemed as if the economy and homeowners were still slipping farther into the abyss. 
 Then early this month, Mr. Kellermann and other executives at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae became the focus of intense scrutiny when lawmakers learned they would receive bonuses totaling $210 million. Mr. Kellermann was set to receive $850,000 over 16 months. Reporters and camera crews showed up at his home in Vienna, an affluent Virginia suburb of Washington. Fearing that someone might attack his house, his wife or their 5-year-old daughter, he asked the company for a security detail.
 Early on Wednesday, Mr. Kellermann went to the basement of his brick home and hanged himself, according to people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to speak. His body was removed five hours later, through a throng of neighbors, television crews and others. 
 His colleagues, some of whom learned of his death on the radio commuting to work, bought and sold about 8,500 mortgages that day, their frantic pace interrupted only by an 11 a.m. meeting for employees who wanted to share memories of a deceased friend.
 ''David was such an honest and humble person,'' said Tim Bitsberger, Freddie Mac's treasurer until he left in December. ''He had an incredible commitment to this company and trying to get the economy back on track.'' 
 ''It just doesn't make sense,'' Mr. Bitsberger said. 
 The roots and causes of suicide are often unclear. It is not known if Mr. Kellermann succumbed to the pressures of his job. But in the aftermath of his death, it is plain that at Freddie Mac, as at many of the companies in the center of this economic storm, there are forces so strong they can overwhelm almost anyone. 
 At General Motors, executives are fighting to save a company that has cut their salaries and suspended their vacations. On Wall Street, professionals are demonized and then asked to work overtime to repair the damage colleagues have wrought. These professionals may not deserve tears, particularly compared to the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs and their homes. But Mr. Kellermann's death is a reminder that those suffering in this crisis reside in every neighborhood, from the squalid to the opulent.
 ''The pressure right now is relentless,'' said a Freddie Mac executive who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak. ''Everyone in the financial sector, regardless of where you work, is constantly told both that this is our fault, and that we have to work as hard as possible, otherwise the nation will fall apart.''
 Mr. Kellermann, who spent more than 16 years at Freddie Mac and saw his stock and options decline precipitously last year, was at the intersection of some of the most difficult issues facing the company. Last month the company's chief executive, David M. Moffett, resigned in part, he said, because federal regulators were using Freddie Mac to carry out economic policy at the expense of nursing the publicly held company back to financial health. The company has not had a president since 2007.
 Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which together own or back more than half of the home mortgages in the country, have been hobbled by skyrocketing loan defaults and have received a total of $60 billion in federal aid since they were taken over last fall.
 Mr. Kellermann was also working in a poisonous political atmosphere. In addition to taking criticism over the bonuses, he was recently involved in tense conversations with the company's federal regulator over its routine financial disclosures, according to people close to those discussions who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Freddie Mac executives wanted to emphasize to investors that they believed the company was being run to benefit the government, rather than shareholders. The company's regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Authority, had pushed to play down that language. Freddie Mac reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission that changes it had made in practices to help the government ''have increased our expenses or caused us to forgo revenue opportunities.''
 Mr. Kellermann was also required to certify Freddie Mac's filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company disclosed in March that there was a continuing federal investigation of its accounting, disclosure and corporate governance practices. That investigation is currently being overseen by the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which declined to comment. A spokesman, David Palombi, said Freddie Mac knew of no link between the death and the legal inquiries.
 A spokeswoman for the Fairfax County Police Department in Virginia said there were no signs of foul play in Mr. Kellermann's death. The police would not comment on whether a note had been found, but a spokesman said that nothing except the body had been removed from the house.

HEADLINE: A Little Help From My Fashionistas

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
FASHION houses are not yet in quite the same pickle as banks, though you might not know it for all the bailout plans in the works from American designers.
 This week, signs went up in the windows of a vacant storefront in the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Eighth Avenue imploring passers-by to ''Save Fashion.'' It's a teaser for a pop-up shop, supported by several city agencies and organized by Refinery29, the fashion Web site. It will open May 1 and, for one month, offer a rotating assortment of fashion at prices at least 50 percent off. 
 Philippe von Borries, the founder of Refinery29, said the idea was to create a stylish environment where struggling designers could sell overstock and be seen by a wider audience. (The store will include items from Catherine Holstein, Rachel Comey and Sue Stemp, among others.)
 You could see this as an up-with-American-fashion moment, or perhaps a plea for a little jingoism. 
 On Tuesday, a group of designers, including Philip Crangi, Justin Giunta and Malia Mills, met with the Council of Fashion Designers of America to propose a ''declaration of designers.'' Stung by steep markdowns imposed by retailers, they are creating a white paper of sorts for dealing with the economic climate and a strength in numbers response to the stores. 
 Then, on Wednesday, another group flew to Washington to reintroduce an anti-piracy bill to stop mass merchants from knocking off their ideas. That the group included Narciso Rodriguez, Maria Cornejo, Jason Wu and Thakoon Panichgul -- all favorites of Michelle Obama -- was no coincidence. 
 ''These designers are celebrities in Washington,'' said Steven Kolb, the council's executive director. ''People are going to be lining up with their digital cameras to photograph them.''
 Cynthia Rowley beat them to town. Last month, she proposed to Desiree Rogers, the White House social secretary, the fashion equivalent of an organic garden on the lawn. Ms. Rowley, who recently moved some of her designs to domestic factories, wants to see apparel production return to the United States. Her idea is to teach the craft of fashion -- how a T-shirt came to be from a cotton plant, for example -- as part of home-economics courses. 
 ''People out there could be starting little factories, or fabric mills,'' she said. ''The more that we can introduce people to all the different possibilities, the more opportunities we are creating to build a really diverse foundation in fashion. You can't have the top of the pyramid without the base.''

HEADLINE: Reimagining Radio As a Spectator Sport

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSEN

 BODY:
On Tuesday WNYC radio's Jerome L. Greene Performance Space will open its doors on Charlton and Varick Streets in Lower Manhattan, with ambitions to be more than just another of the electronic-news-ticker-wrapped, street-level broadcast studios that have popped up across the city since NBC's ''Today'' show pioneered the trend. Passers-by will be able to peer in on public radio in the making; talk shows hosted by Brian Lehrer and Leonard Lopate, as well as the programs ''Evening Music'' and ''Soundcheck,'' will begin monthly broadcasts before audiences there. But the space, envisioned as a laboratory in which to rethink public radio as an interactive medium, will also host concerts, audio theater and political debates, many streamed live on thegreenespace.org.
 ''It's not just about going back to performance; it's also about adding a 21st-century multiplatform aspect,'' said Laura Walker, the president and chief executive of WNYC (93.9 FM and 820 AM). The space's namesake was a philanthropist and real estate executive who died in 1999; his foundation donated $6 million to WNYC. 
 Indira Etwaroo, the executive producer of the Greene Space, said, ''We're trying to reimagine what radio means to a 21st-century audience.''
 Wired for television as well as radio and video streaming, the Greene Space has a Fazioli piano freshly delivered from Sicily; projection screens that drop down over an undulating blond wood wall; a reconfigurable wood stage and seating for about 125; programmable LED lighting; and robotic cameras that travel up and down strategically placed posts. Planners have helpfully included screens to cover the windows, in case a performance artist uses nudity to augment an audio production. 
 The space is the culmination of a strategy that was put in motion in 1996, when WNYC became independent from New York City, which had owned the station, and began planning to leave its offices in the city's Municipal Building. To finance the move, WNYC recently concluded a capital campaign, which raised $62.9 million, 9 percent more than the $57.5 million it had hoped for. It was a rare bit of good news in an otherwise gloomy environment for nonprofits.
 WNYC's new main studios are in the office building above the Greene Space. But the street-level studio will be an opportunity to connect with listeners, who average nearly one million per week, on a physical, up-close level. ''We're so used to, as radio people, sitting in studios by ourselves, talking to some kind of idea of what people are,'' Ms. Walker said in an interview.
 Mr. Lehrer, the morning host, calls his coming shows from the space ''Democracy's Living Room.'' At a recent rehearsal producers and technicians plotted out how Mr. Lehrer and his guests would appear to the video cameras, whether he would sit at the desk or wander the stage.
 Mr. Lehrer said he wanted the programs to ''blur the line between audience and guest.'' His first show, on May 5, the Mexican holiday of Cinco de Mayo, will delve into issues affecting the city's Mexican residents. With 10 guests, he said, the program can showcase ''the richness of diversity within a community,'' and the bright new space ''helps root us in the life of the New York community, very broadly defined. We can have company now.''
 The opening-night invitation-only event on Tuesday will stream live to the Web site but not be heard on radio. It will include the world premiere of a composition from Osvaldo Golijov that incorporates sounds from the WNYC archives. There will be poetry from Sonia Sanchez, solo violin from Daniel Bernard Roumain, New York-centric story readings, and a duet from the tap dancer Ayodele Casel and the electro-jazz cellist Dana Leong. The next night, as part of a new emphasis on the art of radio drama, the Greene Space will have a premiere of an adaptation of H. G. Wells's ''Invisible Man,'' from the writer and director Arthur Yorinks. On May 5 Cornel West will help lead the first ''Next New York Conversation Series'' discussion, about race and the Obama presidency. On May 7 Rosie Perez will moderate a conversation about architectural preservation, complemented by video and photography from city neighborhoods. 
 The project is ambitious at a time when money is tight. WNYC will sell tickets for some events, with prices as high as $50. (Other events will be free.) Ms. Walker said the first year would be a chance to experiment and see what audiences will support. 
 The expansion at WNYC is in stark contrast to the recession-driven cutbacks at many other cultural nonprofits. In addition to the robust capital campaign, WNYC's February pledge drive exceeded its goal of $1.8 million (albeit by just $3,234). 
 WNYC has not been immune from all economic pressures. Corporate underwriting revenues are about 25 percent below what was budgeted for the year. Management froze some hiring, cut expenses and is ''looking at next year's budget very hard,'' Ms. Walker said. Surpluses from past years could be tapped in the fiscal year beginning July 1, she said, but small-scale layoffs are also a possibility. 
 But compared to, say, the 14 percent of employees laid off in January at WNET.org -- parent of the public television stations WNET and WLIW -- WNYC has fared well. ''There's a little bit of a feeling like there was post-9/11,'' Ms. Walker said. ''People are yearning for community,'' and seeking it at WNYC, she said. And, she said, it has only been 13 years since WNYC separated from city ownership. ''We've grown hugely, but we're still pretty fleet-footed and entrepreneurial,'' she said. ''We're used to being a little bit scrappy.''

HEADLINE: Losing Its Cool at the Mall

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
AT the entrance to almost every shopping mall in the country, you will find a directory that, if you are spatially coordinated, will give you an approximate lay of the land. You can gauge the distance from Abercrombie & Fitch to its younger-skewing cousin, Hollister, or its older cousin, Ruehl, and find the way to their closest competitors in the teenager and young adult category, Aeropostale and American Eagle Outfitters.
 But you will be no closer to discerning what drives the modern youth from one store to the next; what differentiates one's frayed cargo shorts from another's; or why one of them, Abercrombie, is facing a consumer revolt, while others are paradoxically upbeat. A clue: It has to do with price.
 This spring, spending by teenagers, a closely studied but rarely understood segment of the population, is off by 14 percent, a direct reflection of the economy, according to a report this month by the investment bank Piper Jaffray. And that is having a profound effect on an already unraveling mall culture, where deep discounters and stores known for heavy promotions are suddenly the popular destinations and aspirational brands are struggling to fit in. 
 Teenagers are noticing. ''Labels are becoming less and less of a priority for people throughout my school,'' said Chelsea Orcutt, 17, a senior at the Mount Saint Mary Academy near Buffalo, where the Walden Galleria shopping center includes all of the above-mentioned stores, plus many more options for teenagers who favor a sunny West Coast surfer style or those who prefer a goth ensemble to highlight their black nail polish and lipstick. Ms. Orcutt, a bit less casual in her personal style, favors Macy's, Old Navy and American Eagle, which, she pointed out, keep teen budgets in mind. 
 ''Labels and designer purses -- I'm not seeing them as frequently,'' said Ms. Orcutt, who had participated in a survey on teen spending for the Hearst Magazines network of Web sites and was approached to speak about the subject for this article. When asked why that might be, she replied, without hesitation, ''because of the crisis.''
 During years of rampant consumerism, where teenagers shopped was often more closely tied to what was happening in the pages of US Weekly or InStyle than their families' financial circumstances. Empires like Abercrombie & Fitch were built on the premise that their products, even $80 jeans and $30 T-shirts with provocative graphics, would be perceived as luxury items if they were sold in the right way. But as teenagers' priorities rapidly shift away from brands they now perceive as too expensive, the pecking order of mall stores has changed.
 At Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J., on a Friday afternoon, Abercrombie & Fitch was nearly empty. As two young men walked out of the dimly lighted store, past a photograph of a shirtless man with his hand submerged beneath the waistband of his jeans, one of them, trailing the eye-watering scent of the store's perfume, said, ''This stuff is too expensive.'' 
 At Ruehl, which is Abercrombie's more upscale store for slightly older consumers (and even darker inside), there were no customers at all. But at Hollister, where the prices average 12 to 15 percent lower, the line at the register was seven deep. 
 To maintain its prestigious image, Abercrombie has stood alone among mall retailers in not blaring its sales -- a strategy that Wall Street analysts have blamed for its current decline. The company reported a 34 percent drop in sales for March at stores open at least a year, the worst performance of mall retailers that month. Abercrombie executives did not respond to written questions about whether the brand -- as some business columnists suggest -- has lost its cool. In the past, the chain has said it doesn't want to tarnish its image with big discounts, but the risk is that consumers may retain the habit of thriftiness even after the recession ends.
 ''I'm not sure customers are going to ever go back to shopping the way they once did,'' said Betsy McLaughlin, the chief executive of Hot Topic, a competitor for the teen market, which posted a gain of 7.1 percent in March, largely on the strength of licensed products tied to the ''Twilight'' vampire series. ''There's just so much retail out there. I think the people who will win are the ones who provide something different. It's not just a price war.''
 The styles at Abercrombie & Fitch, which have changed little in the last decade, are similar to those at the company's Hollister or Ruehl stores, except for the prices and logos. In the same mall, there are plenty of retailers that specialize in Abercrombie-esque casual-collegiate-cum-surfer-dude styles for even less. A new store, WHO.A.U., sells frayed cargo shorts and appliqued T-shirts that are displayed next to black-and-white portraits of hunky shirtless models, ahem. And behind the register at the Aeropostale store in Paramus is a poster showing a frolicking group of teenagers, like a tamer version of Abercrombie.
 Even the clearance items at Abercrombie do not exude the promotional fervor that can be found at American Eagle, which has a sign up front noting its shorts are under $25; or Aeropostale, where banners announce two-for-one bargains. Aeropostale also reported a sales increase last month, up 3 percent, a success that Mindy Meads, the company's president, attributed to the right combination of product and value. 
 ''We get the right looks,'' she said. ''At the same time, we're very mom-friendly when it comes to the wallet.''
 So you may see a $30 T-shirt from Abercrombie & Fitch with its logo printed up the side and a nearly identical style from Aeropostale for $19.50. And, given the companies' recent performances, you may wonder if one is now cooler than the other and, for that matter, whether tomorrow's teenagers will even recognize the difference.
 ''I'm interested in kids who are growing up now and who are going to come into their years of spending during the recession,'' Ms. McLaughlin of Hot Topic said. ''What does that mean for how they will spend when they become teenagers? That's the question.''
 It is fairly clear that Hot Topic, which sells an assortment of studded black vests, Hello Kitty hoodies and body jewelry and colored hair extensions, does not compete for the same customer as Abercrombie & Fitch. Its most popular items right now are tutus and swimsuits. But Buckle, another mall store, has been doing even better with teenagers, gaining ground with a broad assortment of labels and styles, including Lucky Brand, Betsey Johnson, Diesel and Roxy. Its sales were up 14.7 percent last month.
 Buckle, based in Kearney, Neb., has largely distinguished itself with customer service and styles that change significantly each season. Its salesclerks are trained to assist customers in putting together a complete outfit by showing which pair of jeans would look best with a top or work best with a particular style of shoes. The hot styles this spring? Gladiator sandals and light knit tops for women, and flip-flops and patterned shorts for men. 
 ''Even if something sells very well for us, we are apt not to go back to that,'' said Pat Whistler, the vice president for women's merchandising. ''The brands are important, but the fashion part is equally important.''
 Speaking about their attitudes toward shopping last week, several high school students said they liked to shop at Abercrombie & Fitch and thought the brand was still cool, despite the comparatively high prices, while others thought it was too expensive and didn't like the hyper-sexualized atmosphere of the stores. But almost all said they were spending less on clothes.
 Ms. Orcutt recently spent $160 on a hot pink prom dress -- the most expensive dress she had ever bought. 
 ''I'm definitely feeling a little guilty,'' she said.
 Several other students contacted through Hearst are saving money for college expenses, choosing to buy their books or laptops instead of clothing or asking their parents for money. They said they might be more likely to shop for cute, inexpensive things at stores like Forever 21 than to buy designer jeans, as did Stefani Graf, 17, from Annapolis, Md., and Abby Toraason, 18, from Peru, Ind., who said she has to travel an hour or more to a decent mall. 
 ''It's not very expensive, and yet the clothes are still cute,'' Ms. Toraason said. 
 Good news for retailers is that about the only area where the teenagers said they were unlikely to economize was their prom dress. Anecdotally, though, things don't look so promising for limousine rentals.

HEADLINE: Parents Unable to Halt Cuts at Private School

 BODY:
Parents of students at the Conserve School, a private high school in Wisconsin, were handed a setback Wednesday in their attempt to prevent the school from cutting its program to one semester from four years. 
 The setback was delivered by Judge Neal A. Nielsen III of Vilas County Circuit Court, who ruled that the parents had no standing in the case because they were not beneficiaries of the trust that was set up to operate the school.
 Conserve, in Land O' Lakes, was established by James R. Lowenstine, a former chief executive of the Central Steel and Wire Company, a Chicago steel company, to provide an education focused on nature.
 To finance the school, Mr. Lowenstine, who died in 1996, set up a trust that is the majority holder of stock in Central Steel. The trustees argued that because of the economic downturn, the money in the trust was inadequate for operating the school.
 In their lawsuit, the parents asserted that the trustees had a conflict of interest because of the trust's majority holding in the steel company.

HEADLINE: A Label of Pride That Pays

BYLINE: By TRACEY TAYLOR

 BODY:
In a timeworn factory in Sausalito, Calif., 67 workers turn out Heath ceramics, doing everything from mixing the clay to applying the finishing glazes. Twenty miles away, a Japanese robot called Ziggy works day and night in a converted brass foundry in Berkeley, making precision-cut office furniture.
 What the two neighboring factories demonstrate is that it is still possible to manufacture high-quality products in one of the most expensive locations in the United States -- even in the grip of an economic recession.
 And while both are being forced to adapt to the tough times, the two businesses have been helped by the fact that their products are made in America. 
 ''In hard economic times, a slogan built around 'Buy American' is going to resonate a little more,'' said Steven J. Davis, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ''People read stories about unemployed Americans and they want to feel good when they make consumption decisions.'' 
 Professor Davis said manufacturing was generally moving outside wealthier countries like the United States. ''Only an outbreak of protectionist policies or a sharp rise in international shipping costs could slow or temporarily reverse manufacturing's declining share of employment in the United States,'' he said. 
 Still, there still seems to be an appetite for products from high-end, craft-based manufacturers in America. That proved to be the major reason that Robin Petravic and his wife, Catherine Bailey, bought Heath Ceramics six years ago even though competition from abroad had forced most artisanal potteries across the country to shut down. 
 They said that when they first walked into Heath's factory in one of Sausalito's former shipyards, they decided that Heath's idiosyncratic way of doing things and its geographical roots could prove to be its salvation. They said they were struck by the fact that every part of the manufacturing process was under one roof. ''Many of the employees had worked there for decades and knew everything, including how to fix the machines if they broke down,'' Ms. Bailey said. 
 The company was founded in the mid-1940s by Edith Heath, a ceramicist and creative spirit, and her husband, Brian, an inventor. The company quickly earned a reputation for durable, finely crafted tableware and tile whose clean, modernist lines signaled a break from the more fussy designs of the past. 
 It would seem at first glance that little has changed at Heath's dusty, 30,000-square-foot factory in the time since -- the tableware and tile are made in the same sustainable, labor-intensive way they have always been. Some lines, like the Coupe pattern, have been in constant production since 1948. 
 But change has come with the need to make the manufacturing more efficient, cater to the current design aesthetic and respond with agility to the economic downturn. New production systems have been introduced, and dusty pink has been removed from the palette in favor of more contemporary glazing hues like persimmon and cocoa. 
 In January, Heath introduced a line of less expensive tile. While previously all of Heath's tile was made to order, the Modern Basics line can be bought off the shelf in a limited selection of colors and shapes. It is about 40 percent cheaper than the custom tile.
 Heath's mix of sales channels has also been adjusted, with wholesale taking a backseat to more direct routes, like the company's Web site, its factory store and a new retail outlet, which opened in December in Los Angeles. ''That's where we can be most effective and react most quickly,'' said Mr. Petravic, a former product designer who developed the business plan. 
 The factory store, he said, helps them learn which new designs work and which ones do not. It has also reinforced the couple's commitment to manufacturing in the United States. ''We can test the market and avoid suffering from our mistakes,'' he said. ''If we try something that turns out not to be popular, maybe we have made 100.''
 In 2008, Heath's sales increased fivefold and its profit margin was about 8 percent. The company increased its employee roster to 67 from 25. This year the goal, Mr. Petravic said, is simply to stay flat. 
 Reinier Evers, founder of Trendwatching.com, which tracks consumer habits, agreed that Heath seemed to be benefiting from consumers' renewed interest in homegrown products. How products are made is on consumers' radar, he said. ''There's a story that consumers can tell themselves, or better, the 'status story' they can tell their peers to gain recognition.''
 Michael Goldin, an architect and industrial designer, has also tied his company's fate to that trend. For the last 14 years, Mr. Goldin has been contributing to the rejuvenation of a light-industrial district in Berkeley. He transformed an abandoned model airplane motor factory into his office and has designed and outfitted streamlined, open-plan office spaces for lawyers, architects and dotcom start-ups in Berkeley and neighboring Emeryville. 
 Mr. Goldin's company, Swerve, has also been making furniture, seeking out the technology required to produce precision-cut aluminum taper joints and machine-tooled, eco-friendly work surfaces for the desks, workstations and shelving systems. 
 For Mr. Goldin, outsourcing was never an option. ''Ever since I was at grad school I have felt very strongly about having my hands in what I am making -- actually feeling materials and how they work,'' he said. ''It all started with my desire to make things and to have a shop where I could do that.'' 
 Outsourcing, he said, would also make it difficult to ensure high design and craftsmanship standards. ''How do you keep track?'' he asked. ''How do you make sure your product comes to you as you specified it? Overseeing the process would require constant traveling back and forth.'' 
 In any case, having Swerve's pieces made overseas would compromise the company's just-in-time manufacturing model. ''We always make our products to order. We can't afford to keep items in stock,'' Mr. Goldin said. ''If we went overseas we would have to order huge inventory ahead of time. And we're not ready for that.''
 The company's labor costs are kept low because of its reliance on computerized cutting machines, including a new canary yellow robot from Japan, nicknamed Ziggy by the employees, which works 24 hours a day. Of Swerve's 15 employees, only four work on the shop floor. 
 In the last few months, Mr. Goldin has had to make some hard choices to ensure that Swerve rides out the economic crisis. A recent order for 500 aluminum-framed chairs will be completed at cost. 
 He and his administrative staff have vacated the factory's sleek offices and some income-generating tenants have moved in. And his employees have all agreed to salary cuts. But he believes more strongly than ever that outsourcing would be the wrong choice. ''Of all times, we need to do what we can to keep jobs here,'' he said.
 Both Mr. Goldin and the owners of Heath say they hope what they have achieved will stand as a model for other small- and medium-size businesses facing the critical question of whether to locate production locally or in low-cost offshore sites. As Ms. Bailey put it, ''The craft of manufacturing has to a great extent been lost as a value in American culture, and we are striving to retain it.''

HEADLINE: Mainers Air Their Views On Same-Sex Marriage

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
Maine became the latest New England state to take up the issue of same-sex marriage Wednesday, when thousands of Mainers emotionally told lawmakers why the state should or should not allow it. 
 About 4,000 people packed into the Augusta Civic Center, snarling traffic throughout the capital city, for a daylong public hearing on a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage in the state. 
 ''The bill is fair; this bill's time has come,'' said Senator Dennis S. Damon, a Democrat who is the bill's sponsor. ''It recognizes the worth and dignity of every man and every woman among us.'' 
 Bishop Richard Malone of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland, who also testified, said that the diocese supported civil rights for gay men and lesbians and Maine's current domestic partnership legislation but that the state should not redefine marriage. 
 ''Marriage is not simply an economic compact,'' Bishop Malone said. ''In nearly every culture, it's a social institution with the primary purpose of ensuring that the next generation grows up in a secure, loving, balanced environment guided by both male and female parents.'' 
 The future of the bill, which has more than 60 sponsors, is uncertain. Gov. John Baldacci, a Democrat, had opposed same-sex marriage, but now says he is keeping his options open. The Legislature, where Democrats control both houses, can pass or reject the measure, or send it to the voters for a referendum. If the Legislature passes the bill, citizens can collect enough signatures to place a people's veto of the legislation on the November ballot. 
 The current legislation would redefine marriage in Maine, which in 1997 enacted a law stating that marriage is an institution between a man and a woman. Voters added gay men and lesbians to the state's anti-discrimination law in 2005, after rejecting a similar amendment by a people's veto in 1998 and 2000. 
 The group Equality Maine has 10 field organizers canvassing the state to drum up support for the bill. 
 Last week, New Hampshire legislators heard testimony on a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage, and Iowa and Vermont legalized same-sex marriage two weeks ago.

HEADLINE: Global Economy Called Worst Since 1945

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The global economy will most likely contract this year for the first time since World War II, and the recovery will take longer than expected, the International Monetary Fund said Wednesday. 
 The I.M.F. projected a 1.3 percent decline in global economic activity for 2009, down sharply even from the modest 0.5 percent growth it had projected in January. In the United States, still the ''epicenter'' of the crisis, according to the fund, economic contraction would be even greater, at 2.8 percent this year, with zero growth for 2010. 
 Separately, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, cautioned against expecting a quick recovery, underscoring the complications of the world's increasingly interwoven economies and financial systems. 
 ''Never before in modern times has so much of the world been simultaneously hit by a confluence of economic and financial turmoil such as we are now living through,'' he said in a speech before the Economic Club of Washington.
 The international fund said that it expected global growth to resume in 2010, but only at a 1.9 percent rate, notably sluggish compared with past recoveries. In normal times, growth would be closer to 4 percent. 
 ''The recovery may actually be slower than usual, leading to a slow decrease in unemployment,'' said Olivier Blanchard, director of the I.M.F.'s research department, at a news conference at the fund's headquarters in Washington. ''Our forecasts imply that unemployment will crest only at the end of 2010.'' 
 Mr. Blanchard, in unveiling the World Economic Outlook, said that the United States unemployment rate was likely to peak around 10 percent. It is currently 8.5 percent, after months of relentless job losses. The International Labor Organization has estimated that world unemployment could rise to 7 percent this year, up from about 6 percent in 2008.
 ''The current outlook is exceptionally uncertain,'' said the executive summary of the I.M.F. report, ''with risks still weighing to the downside.''
 The report was issued as finance ministers and central bankers from around the world were beginning to gather in Washington for the spring meetings of the I.M.F. and the World Bank. On the sidelines of those meetings, officials of the Group of 7 industrialized nations and the Group of 20, an expanded group that also includes the major emerging economies, will meet for continued discussions on the economic crisis.
 Even among the details of a largely cautionary report, I.M.F. officials saw some signs of hope, largely because of the forceful fiscal steps and other measures taken by the United States, some European governments, and also by China.
 Mr. Blanchard said that the fiscal responses of several major countries had made ''a gigantic difference.'' 
 ''If there had been no fiscal stimulus across the world, world growth in 2009 would be 1.5 to 2 percent less,'' he said. ''We would be in the middle of something very close to a depression.''
 While saying that ''there is light at the end of this long tunnel,'' he cautioned against seeing, in mixed economic data, reason for complacency. ''The need for strong policies on both the macro and especially the financial fronts is as acute as ever,'' he said.
 Mr. Geithner said that only 17 of the 182 economies followed by the I.M.F. are expected to grow at faster rates this year than last, and 30 of the 34 advanced economies are expected to shrink, amid a collapse in world trade that ''will likely be the worst since the end of World War II.'' 
 Even as globalization speeds the flow of economic benefits in good times, he said, ''now we are learning that in times of contraction, globalization transmits trouble with enormous speed and force, affecting economies around the world -- the relatively strong as well as the more vulnerable.''

Wakefield Pitching Like a Workhorse
 The 42-year-old knuckleballer Tim Wakefield pitched a five-hitter for his second consecutive complete game and Boston's sixth straight win -- this one a seven-inning, 10-1 victory over the Minnesota Twins as rain shortened the opener of a scheduled day-night doubleheader at Fenway Park.
 ''Kind of fell into that one by accident,'' Wakefield said. ''I'll take it.'' 
 Wakefield (2-1) struck out four and walked one for his 32nd career complete game. He became the oldest pitcher in Red Sox history to pitch a complete game -- breaking the record he set in his previous start, when he rescued a beleaguered bullpen by taking a no-hitter into the eighth against Oakland.
 Wakefield is the oldest pitcher to throw back-to-back complete games since his fellow knuckleballer Charlie Hough, who was 44 when he did it in 1992 for the Chicago White Sox.
 In the second game, the Twins' Francisco Liriano was removed after giving up seven runs in four innings. (AP) 
 Three-Game Chill Settles Over Florida
 The Florida Marlins went from being very hot to very cold during only three days in Pittsburgh.
 Adam LaRoche had four hits and little brother Andy drove in a pair of runs, leading the Pirates to a 7-4 victory over Florida on Wednesday and a three-game sweep of what was the majors' hottest team.
 Florida began the series with an 11-1 record, a seven-game winning streak and a 6-0 road record, only to be outscored by 18-6 while being swept in a three-game series by Pittsburgh for the first time since May 30-June 1, 2005.
 Adam LaRoche went 4 for 5 with three doubles to raise his average to .304, which is .125 higher than his .179 career average in April coming into this season -- the third-lowest in National League history. (AP)
 Red Sox Rocks at Stadium
 Fans streaming through the massive gates of the new $1.5 billion Yankee Stadium walk right by Deer Isle, Me., granite, quarried by die-hard Red Sox fans.
 The Working Waterfront, a publication of the Island Institute, said New England Stone LLC provided 8 million pounds of Deer Isle granite for the new stadium, which opened April 16. Foreman Danny Hypes and his three-man crew are all Red Sox fans, and they didn't realize the destination of the batch that went to Yankee Stadium. (AP)
 Yankees and Mets Are Worth More
 One-third of Major League Baseball teams declined in value over the past year while the Yankees' worth increased 15 percent to $1.5 billion, according to the annual estimates by Forbes magazine. The Washington Nationals took the biggest hit during the recession, down 12 percent to $406 million. The Atlanta Braves dropped 10 percent and the Detroit Tigers and Seattle Mariners each were off 9 percent, the magazine said Wednesday.
 Bolstered by their new $1.5 billion stadium, the Yankees showed the top increase and remained the most valuable franchise in the majors. The Mets, also boosted by a new ballpark, were second in value ($912 million), an increase of 11 percent. Boston ($833 million), the Los Angeles Dodgers ($722 million) and the Chicago Cubs ($700 million) followed at the top. (AP)

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Resist the World's Recession Trend

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
In recent months, oil prices plunged as consumers curtailed fuel use around the world, with some analysts predicting that the dire economic situation would cause oil to fall to $20 a barrel or less.
 But in a twist, oil prices have stabilized at close to $50 a barrel. While prices may have fallen by two-thirds since their peak last summer, oil remains expensive by historical standards.
 The resilience shown by the oil markets is not because of any improvement in the global economy or rise in oil consumption. Global demand remains on course for its steepest drop since the early 1980s, and oil inventories are at their highest levels in 19 years. 
 Instead, analysts said, oil is once again being sought by investors as a refuge against a slumping dollar and rising inflation. Stabilization of the oil price is also a victory for the OPEC cartel, which has succeeded in cutting output sharply to match lower demand. 
 After helping to drive prices to record levels last summer, investors had deserted oil markets in the wake of the financial crisis, in a frantic flight to cash. Oil, which peaked above $140 a barrel in July, tumbled to $33 a barrel in December. 
 But oil futures in New York have since rebounded and have been fluctuating between $40 and $50 a barrel. Oil settled at $48.85 a barrel on Wednesday, up $2.34. This week, despite a broad swoon in the markets, oil never fell below $45 a barrel. 
 As a result, American drivers should expect to see higher prices at the pump this summer, when driving is at its peak. Gasoline prices could rise to an average of $2.23 a gallon this summer, according to government estimates. Prices had fallen as low as $1.60 a gallon in December but have been holding above $2 a gallon for several weeks. 
 Serious questions loom over the global economy that would suggest lower, not higher, prices. Unemployment is rising sharply in the United States, the Chinese economy is sputtering and its exports are falling, Europe is stagnant and Japan is contracting. The World Bank forecasts that the global economy will shrink by 1.3 percent this year, the first decline in global output since World War II.
 ''At some point, you'd think that reality has to set in,'' said Tom Bentz, a senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas in New York. ''All the news is pretty negative, and certainly demand continues to take a hit. And yet prices are still hanging on.'' 
 The action of oil producers has been critical in providing a floor for prices. Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have shown uncharacteristically strong discipline in recent months in sticking with their pledges to reduce output. 
 Saudi Arabia and other producers have slashed their overall production by about 3.5 million barrels a day since September, according to estimates by the Middle East Economic Survey and others, amounting to 75 percent of their commitments to reduce production. 
 OPEC's success has provided an opening for investors to renew their bets on oil prices. The perception remains well ingrained in the market that oil supplies, while plentiful today, may prove insufficient once demand picks up again. 
 Unrest in Nigeria, where crude oil exports have again been interrupted, is also lending support to the market.
 ''Investors have come back, yes, but not in a huge way,'' said Roger Diwan, a managing director at PFC Energy, a consulting firm. ''One of the main reasons that oil is at $50 is that you had a sharp curtailing of supply.''
 Investor enthusiasm for oil could prove to be ill-timed. In the United States, the world's biggest consumer of oil, demand is down sharply, pushing up commercial oil stocks, which have now reached their highest level since 1990. 
 China is faring only marginally better. Because of a $585 billion stimulus plan, the Chinese economy is projected to grow 5 to 7 percent this year, according to various estimates. But that is less than half the country's recent growth rate, and not enough to lift the rest of the Asian economies, according to a report from PFC Energy this month. 
 ''This is a measure of just how abruptly the world economy has fallen in recent months, and how dire and uncertain its future prospects have become,'' PFC said in a recent report. ''De-globalization may already have begun.''
 Oil demand is expected to tumble this year. In its latest forecast, the International Energy Agency, an adviser to industrialized nations, expects oil consumption to fall 2.4 million barrels a day this year, or 2.8 percent, to 83.4 million barrels a day, the steepest decline since the early 1980s. 
 Prices could yet fall if the economy weakens further or if the stimulus measures adopted by the United States and other nations fail to take hold. 
 ''The market is trying to work out whether the economy is improving,'' said Costanza Jacazio, an energy analyst at Barclays Capital.
 Some experts also fear that even at today's prices, oil companies will slash their investments in new production. Once the economy picks up, say in 2010 or 2011, these analysts predict that another price spike is likely.
 ''It makes you wonder how much longer we can hang on before another downdraft,'' said Mr. Bentz of BNP.

HEADLINE: Let the Buyer (Still) Beware

BYLINE: By JULIE SCELFO

 BODY:
AT a time when ''consumers are the ones in the driver's seat,'' in the words of David Crowe, a longtime economist for the National Association of Home Builders, they have the luxury of being more careful and discriminating in hiring a contractor than they might have been when demand exceeded supply. In fact, now that it's the other way around, it may be more important than ever to follow some common-sense guidelines. 
 RESEARCH With many builders who used to specialize in new construction turning to contracting work, there is a glut of contractors out there. Before even thinking about estimates, look for contractors who are not only licensed and bonded, but have experience in the specific kinds of work you need done. And even if your contractor will be buying the supplies, look for deals yourself in stores and online.
 COMPARISON SHOP Get at least three estimates, asking contractors to include cost breakdowns and details of how the project will be carried out in their bids. Compare the bids not only for price but for what exactly they include: Will the contractor handle cleanup? What about hauling away debris? Will you still be able to use the bathroom or the kitchen? Are there any penalties if the work isn't completed on time?
 CHECK REFERRALS If a company doesn't offer a client it is currently working with, that's a ''big red flag,'' said Bob Peterson, a contractor in Fort Collins, Colo. ''All of us have less clients than we've had in the past because of the economy, but if they don't have any current clients, there's a reason.''
 NEGOTIATE Having a few estimates in hand should give you a sense of what the work will cost, but don't feel as if you have to settle, said Cheryl Reed of Angie's List, an online consumer rating service. ''There are contractors who are looking for work, and willing to negotiate.''
 BE FLEXIBLE On the other hand, don't expect something for nothing. Now that many highly qualified contractors are more open to small projects than they once were, it may make sense for you to be as well. If you can't afford the new bathroom of your dreams -- or just don't want to spend what it would cost -- ask what can be done with what you're able or willing to spend. Perhaps you can agree on a multiphase plan: plumbing and fixtures now, say, and imported tile and glass shower doors, provisionally, in a few years' time.
 DISCUSS Before signing the contract, review it one more time to make sure a detailed plan is in place for how exactly the project will unfold. Planning, pricing and scheduling are as important as actual construction, Mr. Peterson said, and failing to plan properly makes everything take longer -- and cost more. Consider questions like: What time will the workers arrive? Where will supplies be stored? And, of course, When will it be done?

HEADLINE: Dire Economic Impact Of Poor Schools Is Cited

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The lagging performance of American schoolchildren, particularly among poor and minority students, has had a negative economic impact on the country that exceeds that of the current recession, according to a report released on Wednesday.
 The study, conducted by the management consulting firm McKinsey & Company, pointed to bleak disparities in test scores on four fronts: between black and Hispanic children and white children; between poor and wealthy students; between Americans and students abroad; and between students of similar backgrounds educated in different parts of the country. 
 The report concluded that if those achievement gaps were closed, the yearly gross domestic product of the United States would be trillions of dollars higher, or $3 billion to $5 billion more per day. 
 This was the second report on education issues by the firm's social sector office, which said it was not commissioned by any government, business or other institution. Starting in fall 2008, the researchers reviewed federal and international tests and interviewed education researchers and economists.
 In New York City, an analysis of 2007 federal test scores for fourth graders showed strikingly stratified achievement levels: While 6 percent of white students in city schools scored below a base achievement level on math, 31 percent of black students and 26 percent of Hispanic students did. In reading, 48 percent of black students and 49 percent of Hispanic students failed to reach that base level, but 19 percent of white students did.
 The New York City schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, who introduced the findings at the National Press Club in Washington, said the study vindicated the idea that the root cause of test-score disparities was not poverty or family circumstances, but subpar teachers and principals. He pointed to an analysis in the report showing low-income black fourth graders from the city outperformed students in all other major urban districts on reading (they came in second in math).
 ''Schools can be the game changer,'' he said. ''We are able to get very, very different results with the same children.''
 On Tuesday, Mr. Klein was in Albany attempting to persuade legislators to leave control of the city's schools in the hands of the mayor, a governance model adopted by the state in 2002 that is due to expire in June. A crucial measurement of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's seven years at the helm will be Mr. Klein's progress in narrowing the achievement gap in a city where 32 percent of students are black and 40 percent are Hispanic.
 While state test scores have shown improvement since Mr. Klein took office, eighth-grade scores on federal math and reading tests, known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, have not shown significant increases since 2002.
 In an interview after the speech here, Mr. Klein said he would be the first to acknowledge that the city was not where it needed to be in closing the gap, particularly in middle schools. But, he added, there have been signs of progress among younger students, and he believed the city's four-year graduation rates -- 69 percent for white students, 47 percent for black students and 43 percent for Hispanic students -- could reach state averages within five or six years. 
 He said it would require a focus on finding ways to recruit high-quality teachers.
 Nationally, the gap in test performance between white and Hispanic students grows by 41 percent from Grade 4 through 12, and between white and black students it grows 22 percent, the report said. Students educated in different regions also showed marked variation in test performance, despite having similar demographic backgrounds. In Texas, for instance, schools are given about $1,000 less per student than California schools, but Texas children are on average one to two years of learning ahead of their counterparts in California.
 The Rev. Al Sharpton, Mr. Klein's partner in leading an alliance that is attempting to electrify the cause of making radical changes in education, criticized those who opposed their efforts. 
 ''There are no sacred cows in this,'' Mr. Sharpton said to the audience of 200 education leaders at the press club. 
 Arne Duncan, the federal secretary of education, told the audience that the report showed the need for robust data systems to track student and teacher performance; for alignment of American standards with those in other countries; and for incentives to keep good teachers and principals. 
 ''In many situations, our schools are perpetuating poverty and are perpetuating social failure,'' he said, adding that the federal education bureaucracy had often hindered past efforts. 
 He expressed support for the idea of radically restructuring the bottom 1 percent of schools in the country, possibly by closing and reconstituting them. 
 The writers of the study pointed to signs of optimism amid the dreary numbers. Byron G. Auguste, the director of the social sector office at McKinsey, which produced the study, said there was evidence that two dozen countries over the past two decades had significantly overhauled their educational systems and closed achievement gaps. He also pointed to high-performing systems in the United States, like those in Massachusetts and Texas. The trick, he said, would be to share effective strategies.

HEADLINE: Making Money by Helping Companies Save It

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT

 BODY:
Dave Colgan, direct sales manager for Utz Quality Foods, a snack food manufacturer in Hanover, Pa., was entrenched behind his desk, arms crossed on his chest, chin down, listening reluctantly to a man who promised -- at no charge -- to overhaul the company's shipping arrangements to save money while getting better service. ''It really did seem too good to be true,'' Mr. Colgan said.
 In fact, Mr. Colgan had agreed to the meeting only at the insistence of a friend. Which Richard Palarea, the man with the ridiculous proposition, knew full well.
Yet in less than a half hour, with the fragrance of chocolate-dipped potato chips wafting in from the 1930s factory, Mr. Colgan had relaxed his posture and his attitude. Before an hour had passed, Mr. Palarea had a handshake deal to renegotiate the Utz shipping contracts. 
 Later Mr. Palarea would estimate the savings at 30 percent, about $244,000 a year. Mr. Palarea gets paid by keeping a portion of those savings.
 In all, not a very challenging day for Mr. Palarea, a logistics consultant, whose company, PA & Associates, inhabits a very small corner of $162 billion industry of third-party logistics. Third-party logistics firms don't own warehouses or trucks, but arrange for transportation of freight. ''We are like travel agents for freight,'' explained Robert Voltmann, president and chief executive of the Transportation Intermediaries Association, a trade group.
 What Mr. Palarea's company does is rare in the industry. It combs through a company's shipping records and figures out how to cut costs. On average, he said, he finds clients 42 percent savings without sacrificing service.
 For many years after founding the business in 1993, Mr. Palarea and his wife, Juliette, ran PA & Associates almost as a hobby, even in years when he said it produced $2.5 million in revenue.
 But it is now a full-time endeavor for both of them, and they face a challenge more formidable than the most intractable shipping manager: popularity.
 The economic meltdown has corporations open to untraditional sources of savings. The result is that Mr. Palarea says he got 10 contracts in first month of 2009, a normal year's worth of work. 
 Now Mr. Palarea faces difficult decisions on how to expand the business. He does not want to turn away customers, but he doesn't want to take on a staff and become a manager. He wants to offer more services nationwide, like finding savings in phone contracts, but doesn't want to build a sprawling organization.
 Mr. Palarea never intended to be in the logistics business. It was an outlet for his wife, Juliette, a former sales representative for MCI. ''I had had enough of corporate America,'' said Ms. Palarea, who wanted a business under her control so that she could work at her own pace. ''If I was motivated enough,'' she said, ''I could make as much as I wanted to make.''
 In the early days Ms. Palarea handled sales, and after work Mr. Palarea did the analysis, hand-entering numbers from paper bills into an rudimentary computer spread sheet. ''Juliette would sit in one seat, I'd sit in another, and she would read me the numbers.''
 The pitch was simple. They offer, at no risk to a company, to review its shipping bills and negotiate a savings. Then, if the client took the deal they negotiated, the Palareas would keep half of the company's shipping savings for three years. If the company didn't take the new contract, it owned nothing. No cost ever went on the company's books, just savings.
 Mr. Palarea argues that it is also good for shipping companies like Federal Express and United Parcel Service, which get a long-term customer out of the deal, one who won't come back to renegotiate year after year. 
 A U.P.S. spokeswoman, Karen Cole, seemingly unpersuaded, said, ''We value our relationship with our customers, when you use a third-party negotiator, you are a step away from that.'' Federal Express declined to comment.
 For many years, PA & Associates was a nice sideline income, but not what Mr. Palarea saw as a full-time job. ''Shipping just didn't excite me,'' he said. He worked in a dot-com and preferred the corporate world of information services. 
 But Ms. Palarea kept making sales. And Mr. Palarea's interest in technology helped them automate, first adding an optical reader so they didn't have to do the data entry for spreadsheets.
 Mr. Palarea pursued a corporate career until 2003. While vice president for technology at AIIM, an information management trade association in Silver Spring, Md., he had to lay off staff members. ''I had a junior help desk person who sat in my office and cried,'' he said. ''It broke my heart.'' That and the hour commute each way soured him on the job. ''I looked at what my wife was doing and compared to me, she was making twice the money and doing half the work.''
 That year Mr. Palarea decided to concentrate on PA & Associates. To ramp up he drew on the lessons of 15 years of dabbling.
 First, he acknowledged he had a tough sell. In a sense, his product was too good. Offering something for nothing got PA & Associates dismissed out of hand. He needed to establish credibility before trying to make a pitch.
 To do that, they worked exclusively by referral as they did in the meeting with Utz. To induce friends and clients to make introductions, PA shared fees, giving 15 percent of their take to the person who made the referral. He says he wrote a six-figure check to one good networker.
 PA also sought to work for established brands, which in turn helped open other doors. The client list includes Legg Mason, Volcom, Lionel Trains, Danskin, and VeriFone. ''People are like 'Oh, you did something for Legg Mason?' '' Mr. Palarea said.
 Still, the biggest challenge is often to win over clients who think they have already cut a shrewd deal.
 Part of the problem is that clients can only see their savings after they've engaged PA & Associates, as Mr. Colgan did. ''We can certainly negotiate our own contracts, but we would have left a lot on the table,'' Mr. Colgan said. ''Things Rich got us, we never would have thought of,'' like fuel discounts for shipping to particular areas. 
 The trick there, Mr. Palarea learned, was not to deal with a shipping manger, who might see PA as encroaching on his turf. Instead, go to the chief financial officer, and talk money, not shipping.
 That was a particularly difficult lesson for Mr. Palarea, who wanted to stress the quality of the service they would negotiate, not the price. ''We didn't want to cheapen the message, which was, 'Come to us if you want world-class shipping and we save you money,' '' he said. It was only the recent downturn in the market that convinced him leading with savings didn't imply shoddy service. 
 The strategies are working, said Mr. Palarea, which has him on a precipice. Does he keep the operation small, take a boutique approach and accept only the largest clients? Or does he automate more and handle smaller clients with better margins? ''I don't know that we have to choose,'' he said.
 He thinks he has found a way to automate more of the process, freeing up some time. He may create a do-it-yourself software kit that would help small companies negotiate shipping more effectively, he said. But that may require PA & Associates to take on debt, which Ms. Palarea said makes her nervous. 
 ''This can be the demise of a company,'' she said. ''We are at a crossroads. It's that crossroads where people make a bad decision and they are gone.''
 PA & Associates has made some concessions to growth. Mr. Palarea has brought in a partner, Chris Steer, a former Johns Hopkins lacrosse player and lawyer with deep community ties. And Mr. Palarea concedes he might add two analysts so he can concentrate on meeting potential clients.
 But ultimately, if the opportunities keep popping up, the growth question is one that won't go away. There are a lot of potential clients, but only so many Palareas.

HEADLINE: Contracts For iPhone Ease Decline At AT&T

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
AT&T, the largest telecommunications company in the United States, reported on Wednesday that its first-quarter profit dipped 9.7 percent from a year ago, but cost-cutting and new customers lured by the iPhone helped beat Wall Street's expectation of a bigger drop.
 The company, based in Dallas, reported its net income for the quarter was $3.1 billion, or 53 cents a share, compared with $3.5 billion, or 57 cents a share, in the period a year ago. AT&T said revenue was $30.6 billion, slightly down from $30.7 billion in the quarter a year ago. Analysts had expected revenue of $31.1 billion. 
 Revenue for the company fell because of the crumbling economy, but also because of longer-term trends as consumers and businesses moved away from landlines and toward wireless products and services. 
 ''It comes as no surprise to anyone the economy has put pressure on volume of wireline voice and access line losses,'' said Rick Linder, the chief financial officer of AT&T, in a conference call with analysts. Earnings were cut by 5 cents a share because pension and retiree expenses rose. Excluding those items, earnings were 58 cents a share, exceeding analysts' expectations of 48 cents a share.
 An industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Craig Moffett, said cost-cutting and growth from AT&T's wireless business helped the company beat Wall Street's predictions. The wireless growth came largely from new subscribers lured to AT&T by Apple's iPhone, which uses AT&T exclusively in the United States.
 AT&T reported 1.6 million iPhone activations in the quarter, a 16 percent decrease from 1.9 million activations during the holiday season last quarter. More than 40 percent of the activations in the first quarter were for customers new to the company. 
 ''The iPhone has quieted any skeptics who thought this was a one-time event and for only the Apple enthusiasts,'' Mr. Moffett said. ''It could well be that we are witnesses to the birth of yet another Apple ecosystem, where the iPhone App Store is creating a self-sustaining competitive advantage for Apple that is helping the iPhone pull away from the rest of the pack.''
 AT&T's overall wireless-data revenue rose 38.6 percent, to $3.2 billion, propelled by Web browsing, e-mail use, text messaging and Internet applications. The average revenue per user was up 2 percent, to $59.21, bolstered by data use on the company's handsets, Mr. Moffett said. 
 AT&T hopes the iPhone will help it retain and build its subscriber base, a feat that is increasingly difficult as competition for new wireless accounts heats up. Telecommunications companies are increasingly introducing cheaper cellphone plans to attract customers away from their current mobile carriers. Companies like MetroPCS and Leap offer prepaid, or pay-as-you-go, cellphone plans and are attracting customers who want to avoid lengthy contracts. 
 ''The wireless sector is running at a slower growth rate than we've seen in the past. Companies are fighting for share rather than growth,'' Mr. Moffett said. ''It's a shrinking pie.'' He added that in terms of subscribers in North America who already have cellphones, ''we are very close to saturation in the U.S.''
 Despite a contracting market, AT&T added 1.2 million net new subscribers in its first quarter. Of those new subscribers, 875,000 of them signed more expensive contracts, a 24.1 percent increase from the same period a year ago. 
 The real surprise was AT&T's success in cutting costs in its wireless business, Mr. Moffett said. The company shrank its work force by 15,000 employees in the last year and reduced capital spending by 24 percent. 
 Still, AT&T reported significant declines in its traditional wireline business. Revenue from voice lines dropped 12.2 percent, but an uptick in subscribers to AT&T U-verse television service helped offset that. The company said it gained 284,000 subscribers, nearly double the number a year ago. In addition, the company added a net increase of 359,000 broadband connections.
 Investors reacted favorably to the news. In early trading, AT&T's shares rose nearly 4 percent, to about $26.21, but gave up most of the gain to close at $25.40. ''The quarter showed that telecom services is more resilient than a lot of other industries,'' said Thomas Seitz, an analyst with Barclays Capital, ''although clearly not immune to the economic backdrop.''

HEADLINE: Taking Hair Color Into Their Own Hands

BYLINE: By TERRY TRUCCO

 BODY:
BEN STEWART, color director for Cutler salons in Manhattan and South Beach, is a sought-after colorist whose clients pay more than $250 for a tint. But in recent months, Mr. Stewart has found himself visiting the drugstore to choose do-it-yourself color for a few clients who want to do home touch-ups to stretch the time between appointments.
 ''You want them to continue coming to you, but you understand their needs,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''Better to have them do the right thing rather than totally mess up their hair.''
 Not every woman is ready to slip on a pair of latex gloves and take hair coloring into her own hands. But like Spam and instant potatoes, home hair color appears to be that rare product that is getting a lift from the recession. 
 Asked how the economy had changed their spending habits, 15 percent of 1,000 American women who have their hair colored professionally said they now color it at home, according to a recent survey by Mintel, a market research firm. Another company, Information Resources, said dollar sales of a popular Clairol product, Root Touch-up, shot up 20 percent over the last year.
 An indication of home color's rising profile can be seen in the latest products, which are created by name-brand salon owners, a new twist in an industry long dominated by mass market manufacturers like Clairol and L'Oreal. 
 This year Frederic Fekkai, the Manhattan stylist and hair care manufacturer, began selling what he calls the first home color product to offer salon results. Besides a pre-treatment cream to prevent dry or damaged hair from absorbing too much color, the $30 kit, sold at department stores but not at Fekkai salons, features a mixing bowl and brush and a stylish package. (Each color is named for a woman, like Rita for copper blonde.) 
 In June, Umberto Savone, owner of the Umberto Beverly Hills salon and hair care line, plans to unveil U Color. His $12 color, a collagen product created by an Italian chemist, is packaged in sachets like ketchup; squeeze out a couple of drops, rub them into the hair and repeat, a system that makes home coloring ''foolproof,'' Mr. Savone said. 
 Yet home hair color is still a product that strikes fear in the hearts of many people precisely because most believe it is not foolproof. Consider the look-alike boxes, the confusing colors and the bad memories of blondes gone brassy, browns that didn't cover grays and reds that receded after the second shampoo. 
 Mary Nash, a Manhattan resident, swears by salon color after two disasters with home products over the years. ''I have horrible memories of home coloring,'' she said. But these days she stretches her salon visits an extra week or two, and uses a color touch-up wand to spruce up grays. 
 Colorists say many home products are in fact quite good, if used correctly. ''Except for the fragrance, many home and salon products are identical,'' said Beth Minardi, owner and color director of the Minardi Salon in Manhattan. ''The difference is a good colorist will use several formulas, with one on the part and another on the hairline.'' 
 Most professionals caution against trying anything too ambitious at home. Covering gray is the best -- and perhaps only -- time to use a home hair product, they say. Make a mistake with do-it-yourself highlights and you get polka-dot leopard spots, said Lisa Evans, senior colorist at Salon Mario Russo in Boston. ''Highlights are the biggest thing people mess up,'' she said. ''They're not as easy to do as it looks on the box.'' And orchestrating a drastic color change at home can produce an unwanted shade; orange can be a result when home colorists go from brown to blonde. 
 While the price can't be beat (a box of mass market hair color costs as little as $7), choosing the right one can be daunting. The basic rule is to select a color that's close to your own -- within a shade or two of your natural range, said Kathy Galotti, color director for Louis Licari salons in Manhattan and Beverly Hills. A close match in tone and warmth is one way to make home color last longer. Home colorists also get the best results when hair isn't permed, relaxed or highlighted, she said.
 Applying color can be the biggest pitfall. One reason salon color often lasts longer is that it is evenly applied so grays are covered, new color doesn't overlap existing color and telltale spots aren't missed. ''Even someone who's a full-time hairdresser has trouble doing her own color,'' said Marie Robinson, a senior colorist at Sally Hershberger salon in Manhattan. She suggests having a friend or spouse help get the color onto your hair and double-check to see the grays are covered. 
 If you don't have a helper, don't forget the back of the head. Mr. Savone suggests lifting the back hair and rubbing in the color or brushing it on. 
 In some instances, the applicator itself is the problem. Many home products go onto the hair from a bottle. But colorists prefer the control they get using a tint brush and bowl, which do-it-yourselfers can buy at a beauty supply store. Not all home applicators are alike, however. Ms. Robinson likes the comb-tipped bottle that comes with Perfect 10. ''You've got to experiment to see what works for you,'' she said.
 Learning to apply color properly can prevent color buildup, which causes hair to look dark and flat, like shoe polish. ''You don't want the same color on ends that have already been colored as on the roots,'' Ms. Minardi said
 Dryness is a hazard once hair is colored. Blondes are especially vulnerable since products that lighten have high alkaline levels that can dry out hair. To prevent dryness, Ms. Minardi suggests a cream instead of a liquid and recommends using shampoos and conditioners made specifically for color treated hair. ''Your days of $4 shampoos are over,'' she said.
 Is there a point of no return when it becomes impossible to color gray hair yourself? Colorists say no but agree that covering large amounts of gray is tricky.
 Gray hair is not gray at all but hair that has lost its pigment. Coloring occurs when the product goes under the hair cuticle and deposits the pigment on the cortex, which is the bulk of the hair, said Philip Kingsley, owner of Philip Kingsley Trichological Clinics in New York and London. ''Even if gray hair is resistant, it will eventually take the color,'' he said. ''Instead of taking half an hour to penetrate the cuticle, it may take 40 minutes.'' But assessing how long to leave color on is often difficult for a do-it-yourselfer, he added. ''And color left on too long can get too dark.''
 Generally, women with less than 25 percent gray can use a semipermanent product that fades after multiple washings. Women with more gray should use permanent color. 
 For pregnant women or those concerned about artificial chemicals, many health food stores carry permanent hair color free of ammonia, alcohol and hard chemicals, like Herbatint, an Italian brand. ''This kind of color isn't perfect, but it has a good purpose and does the job,'' Ms. Galotti said. 
 And with luck, those grays will retrench, at least for a few weeks.

HEADLINE: Time and Tide Gnaw at a Downtown Enclave

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
It's a tough time for India House, the luncheon club near Wall Street, midday lair for mandarins, which these days seems as musty as your last pair of socks.
 ''We, ah, took quite a hit financially last September,'' said Bruce Godfrey, the manager, who was nibbling at a burger and some French fries. ''What we want to do, you know, is attract more members. Get it occupied again.''
 He was sitting in the dining room near four old men, skeletons who muttered about their doctors' bills. The men wore sagging suits and somber faces; one of them wore a Band-Aid on his nose. The hush was such that one could hear their forks clank on the antique china plates. The chandelier above them had a pair of burnt-out light bulbs; a mirror above the oak buffet reflected the empty chairs. 
 Mr. Godfrey, a Londoner with tired-looking eyes, was coming to the end of an impassioned speech about the vanished institution known as lunch. 
 ''It may be dying,'' he suggested, with a morbid dab of napkin at his lips, ''but the odd part is, there's actually a shortage of places downtown for a serious business lunch. Places where the noise isn't awful and where you're not rushed in and out.''
 Once there was the Broad Street Club and the Stock Exchange Club, private haunts for the financiers of Wall Street, killed off by the blights of merger and recession and by the money crusades of Eliot Spitzer, the former governor and attorney general of New York. India House, a stately Renaissance palazzo, is among the few survivors in the neighborhood that still provides a decent turkey club and the kick of a crisp martini for its aging clientele.
 Established in 1914 by 38 guests at a special dinner at the Metropolitan Club, India House has long been a refuge for mercantile masters, a sanctuary near the stock exchange where men from J. P. Morgan or General Electric could gather, in the words of a founder, Walter Clark, to foster ''relations between the bankers and the promoters of foreign trade.'' 
 Its name is a nod to the West Indies; its decor is mildewed maritime. A 100-year-old globe of the earth looms beside the hostess's desk. The dining room is hung with smoky paintings: ''A View of Canton Harbor.'' ''The Steam Yacht Aguan.'' ''The Capt. Anthony Kelley, Jr. Passing Flushing, 1859.''
 But much like the ship chandlers and maritime lawyers who dined there years ago, the captains of finance are gradually disappearing, leaving little more inside the dining room than the sunlight spilling in from Hanover Square. Membership is down, Mr. Godfrey said. The club has relaxed its dress code. It is considering staying open in the evenings. There are now such forced frivolities as Scotch and Barolo tastings at the bar.
 It's enough to get one thinking of the course of New York City history, a force so cruel and monolithic that the mightiest are left to froth like sea spume in its wake. The merchant bankers who hung those paintings on the wall and ogled them while chewing on their beefsteak in the '20s surely had no clue that in another half-century their pre-eminence would be gone. Could the same be true of the asset traders and default swappers of today?
 Mr. Godfrey mulled the question. The four men hobbled from the room.
 ''A.I.G.,'' he said, ''was a significant presence here.''

HEADLINE: Slump Creates Lack of Mobility For Americans

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS; Steve Freiss contributed reporting from Las Vegas; Rebecca Cathcart from Los Angeles; and Lori Rotenberk from Chicago.

 BODY:
Stranded by the nationwide slump in housing and jobs, fewer Americans are moving, the Census Bureau said Wednesday. 
 The bureau found that the number of people who changed residences declined to 35.2 million from March 2007 to March 2008, the lowest number since 1962, when the nation had 120 million fewer people.
 Experts said the lack of mobility was of concern on two fronts. It suggests that Americans were unable or unwilling to follow any job opportunities that may have existed around the country, as they have in the past. And the lack of movement itself, they said, could have an impact on the economy, reducing the economic activity generated by moves. 
 Joseph S. Tracy, research director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said the lack of mobility meant less income for movers and the people they employ and less spending on renovation and on durable goods like appliances. But, Dr. Tracy said, the most troubling prospect is that people were no longer able to relocate for work. 
 ''The thing that would be of deeper concern is if job-related moves are getting suppressed and workers are not getting re-sorted to the jobs that best use their skills,'' he said. ''As the labor market started to improve, if mobility stays low, you can worry about the allocation of workers.'' 
 How long will the downturn in mobility last? Michael J. Hicks, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Indiana, said, ''I think it will be well into next year before we see any growth in migration, and that still may be optimistic.'' 
 ''If the stock market rebounds before the housing market, we might see a scramble for retirement housing,'' Professor Hicks added.
 The American Moving and Storage Association said the number of people changing residences had been dropping for four years and fell 17.7 percent from 2007 to 2008. The first quarter of 2009 is likely to be even worse, the trade group said. 
 ''We saw a standstill in new home construction, so there was no domino effect from people moving,'' John Bisney, a spokesman, said. ''People are a little nervous about getting a mortgage. And the recession is so broad-based it's not as if you can pull up stakes and move to a part of the country that's growing.'' 
 Jed Smith, a research director for the National Association of Realtors, said that on average it took a homeowner 10.5 months to sell a house in 2008 compared with 8.9 months in 2007.
 ''Generally speaking, people move based on the economy,'' Dr. Smith said, ''and obviously the economy in 2008 was mediocre to bad. That would tend to have a negative impact on people's desire, ability or need to move.''
 In its report Wednesday, the Census Bureau said that Americans' mobility rate, which has been declining for decades, fell to 11.9 percent in 2008, down from 13.2 percent the year before and setting a post-World War II record low. Moves between states dropped the most, to half the rate recorded at the beginning of this decade.
 In addition, immigration from overseas was the lowest in more than a decade, which experts attributed to the lack of jobs. Over all, movers were more likely than nonmovers to be unemployed, renters, poor and black. 
 For decades, several trends have driven a decline in American wanderlust. 
 Home ownership rates have risen, and owners are typically less likely to move than renters. Two-earner families have become more common, and finding employment for both spouses in a new location can be challenging. Americans' median age has been climbing, and it is younger people who usually move most often.
 ''It does show that the U.S. population, often thought of as the most mobile in the developed world, seems to have been stopped dead in its tracks due a confluence of constraints posed by a tough economic spell,'' said William H. Frey, a demographer with the Brookings Institution.
 Dr. Frey predicted that the foreclosure crisis might spur more local mobility, within or between counties, as families shift to rented quarters or move in with relatives.
 Robin Camacho, a Las Vegas real estate agent, expressed surprise at the census mobility figures, given the high foreclosure rates in his city. ''If people are losing their homes and tenants are being forced to vacate,'' Ms. Camacho said, ''then this just doesn't jibe with what I intuitively think. I see people moving constantly because they have no choice.''
 Patrick Bonnema, sales manager for Anderson Brothers Moving and Storage in Chicago, said local residential moves were ''down drastically over the last six months.'' 
 ''I'm not surprised this has happened,'' Mr. Bonnema said. ''Look at the economy, look at the banking industry, look at the credit industry. People can't move, what are they going to do? Their homes are now worth less than what they originally paid, and they don't want to take a loss.''
 Those surveyed by the census said they moved for housing, family and job reasons, in that order.
 Suburbs gained 2.2 million movers while major cities lost 2 million. Immigrants, though, appeared less likely to settle in the suburbs in 2008, compared with recent years. 
 ''The housing crunch and its impact on employment in construction, plus the demise of sub-prime lending, gave immigrants fewer opportunities for living and working in the suburbs than in the immediately preceding years,'' Dr. Frey said.
 The influx of 1.1 million overseas foreigners was the lowest since the 780,000 in 1995. 
 Among movers, the South recorded the largest net gain, but the gain was the smallest in five years.

HEADLINE: Past the Bouncers: What a Feeling

BYLINE: By CINTRA WILSON

 BODY:
IT has been everywhere: Ads on subway walls, made to look as if spontaneously painted by vandals. Ads on plywood walls, like posters for rock concerts. On the front page of my newspaper. News of the Topshop opening has been as unavoidable as an untimely death in Hollywood: you don't seek this information, it finds you. 
 I tried to go last weekend, but the disco line outside, maintained by bouncer-esque security heavies and parade fencing, was reportedly 45 minutes long -- and it was raining. 
 When I went back midweek, the line was barely shorter, and it was still raining. Your Critical Shopper whispered in the bouncer's ear, shamefully pulled rank and swanned in past the paying customers, feeling like a cruel and dirty Bianca Jagger. Alas, despite Topshop's egalitarian -- even Third Way social democracy ethos (high-concept design, made widely affordable!) -- caste inequities are already entrenched; I left many a fuming leg warmer and flat slouch-boot in my wake. 
 Topshop is new only to the United States. It has been lurking in England since 1964, periodically reinventing itself. It was so unfashionable in the 1990s as to be a punch line on par with the Cosby sweater. Now, of course, it is the biggest revelation to hit the fashion world since the yo-yo.
 Behold: the ''shopping as disco multiplex'' experience. The decor is all high-ceiling flash-trash glitz and Anglocentrism. Fake flowers hang down from the ceiling; a voyeuristic mezzanine area is visible from the first floor; exhibitionists can emerge from their dressing rooms and test-preen new items before all. 
 I found it ironic that the thumping soundtrack, when I walked in, was ''Natural's Not in It,'' by Gang of Four: 
 The problem of leisure/What to do for pleasure/Ideal love a new purchase
 A market of the senses/Dream of the perfect life/Economic circumstances? 
 The body is good business/Sell out, maintain the interest 
 This set the tone: At Topshop, it is 1983 all over again, with all the shiny spandex leggings, big cheap bangles and Day-Glo Wayfarers this implies.
 T-shirts are oversize and knotted into ''Flashdance'' shapes. One offered ersatz experience: NYC BACK STAGE 1992, in faded lettering (made in Turkey, $32). Another claimed, in a scrawled-by-teen-werewolf font, to be OUT OF CONTROL ($28).
 Price tags fluctuate from lowish to highish on the three floors devoted to women's wear, but it's basically the '80s on every floor. The looks seem gleaned from ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' or ''Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo,'' apart from selections so imprinted by early Madonna videos (white lace leggings, $44) that I diagnosed them with ''Borderline'' personality disorder. Everything looks so sarcastic and right-this-second trendy as to be planning for a near-immediate obsolescence. Despite my willingness to wait in the endless fitting-room line, I was unable to find one thing I really wanted to try on; I happen to know from experience that 1983 is unlikely to last forever. 
 But I was an anomaly. A young woman who had just tried six garments said she loved them all: ''Everything fits amazingly true to size!'' she gushed. Topshop has believers. 
 There are hideous floral prints that need only to be covered with cat hair to be the bedspread of your maiden aunt on Martha's Vineyard. I'm not talking about the Liberty prints, which have a frowzy potato-sack charm that even the daemon Kate Moss can't corrupt (Liberty smock-top, made in China, $50). We're talking tea-cozy floral: big, dopey, mauve-rose upholstery prints, lousy with the wrong kinds of butterfat and estrogen -- evoking for me, when applied to a grubby little urchin of a blouson dress, a visceral horror that could be equaled only by a Jersey cow print. 
 But girls who revere Topshop probably have no scarring life experiences that prejudice them against such florals. They must learn for themselves. 
 The problem with fashion going Back to the Future of 1983 is that for some reason, the recrudescence of trends from any year tends to embrace the unhip and the clownish. It's not what the cool people wore in 1983, but the Urkels, the Screeches, the Tiffanys, the hapless wannabes. These are cuts, prints and colors that I never liked on anyone, ever, for the simple reason that they look goofy, infantile and unflattering. 
 Acid-washed jeans with pleats? Only the most risible feebs wore those in 1983.
 ''Did you feel like Kate Moss was having a laugh at your expense?'' I later asked Cornell Bar, the receptionist at my hair salon. 
 ''Totally,'' said he. 
 Mr. Bar did, however, like Topman, the men's section, which I found to be unisexual almost unto cross-dressing. It was all very Wham! UK: Day-Glo rosaries and wrist cuffs, little Keds-style canvas shoes, a la Doris Day. A double-breasted jacket in fuchsia buffalo-plaid ($160) would not be worn by any of the men in my life, even at gunpoint. Indeed, a Pepto-Bismol pink Jackie O. duster jacket was something I could imagine only Justin Bond or Quentin Crisp wearing with any real success. 
 Topshop does unequivocally triumph in one area: villainous women's shoe designs. One cannot accuse it of not stealing from the best: strappy, ankle-busting platforms in all manner of beast prints were seized in spirit right from the runways of YSL and Louis Vuitton -- but costing, for waifs of slender means who must have the look, around $1,000 less. 
 While inarguably fetching, I did not think the shoes trustworthy. The one advantage to overpaying for shoes, I find, is that the good ones don't make your feet look like Mel Gibson crucified them. 
 Topshop is sure to become a browsing destination for at least one item it has in abundance: adorable, coltish young girls in skinny jeans and ankle boots. Lotharios can already be found loitering on the third floor, asking silly questions. If I were a feckless tween, by golly, I would shop my tiny brains out at Topshop. 
 But for severe little me, Gang of Four nailed it best: 
 This heaven gives me migraine/This heaven gives me migraine/This heaven gives me migraine
 TOPSHOP
 478 Broadway (near Broome Street); (212) 966-9455.
 HODGEPODGE The megabrand Topshop aims to pull the rug out from under the luxury market by making Leger-like bandage skirts, bowler hats, pretarnished sequin gowns and other Bananarama-era hits available to a wider margin of wallets. 
 HOBNOB Retro-clubby, polysexual, barely legal and as spazzy as a three-day Skittles binge, the clientele is a veritable lookbook of such deathless new combos as the ''frohawk and Goyard man-purse'' look. 
 POTSHOT Those who lived through the hair-metal years the first time around will despair to see fringed pleather handbags, leggings printed to resemble acid-washed denim, and sarcastic, slut-muppet lingerie. Paris may still be burning, but Los Angeles was never no lady. Sunset Stripper apparel should go back to England where it belongs. Retirement was good enough for Whitesnake.

HEADLINE: Profit Dropped 74% in Quarter for Volkswagen

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY; Victoria Burnett contributed reporting from Madrid.

 BODY:
Volkswagen, the largest European automaker, said on Wednesday that its first quarter profit fell 74 percent, even as it gained market share in the worst environment for car sales in decades. 
 In an unexpected announcement a day before its annual shareholders meeting in Hamburg, the company said profit fell to 243 million euros ($314 million) from 929 million euros a year earlier.
Its earnings were supported by a gain of 600 million euros on the sale of its commercial vehicles business in Brazil.
 Revenue slid 11 percent, to 24 billion euros, despite tax incentives in Germany and other European countries to encourage drivers to trade up to more environmentally sound models, as the global automobile market shrank by nearly 21 percent from a year earlier. Sales rose in Brazil, China, Germany, Poland and Russia.
 The company also said it would spend about 300 million euros to produce the new Audi Q3 S.U.V.'s at its Seat plant in Martorell, Spain, where the recession has left a significant amount of idle capacity. Production is to start in 2011, with annual production capacity of up to 80,000 units.
 Having decided to build the Q3 in Spain, Audi said its decision about production in the United States had been postponed. Volkswagen said last year that it would produce a midsize sedan under its own brand in Chattanooga, Tenn. 
 ''We will systematically explore our options in the context of the current market crisis,'' said Rupert Stadler, chairman of Audi's board of management. ''Audi is in a good position. There is currently no urgent need to select additional sites.''
 The automobile group, which includes the Audi, Seat and Skoda brands as well as the flagship Volkswagen brand, said last week that it had raised its global market share to 11 percent, from 9.7 percent in the quarter a year ago. Its Volkswagen brand increased its share of the global market to 7.4 percent, from 6.3 percent.
 Volkswagen, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, warned that ''the high volatility of the market does not permit any reliable forecasts to be made'' for the rest of the year, but that it expected its earnings to decline.

HEADLINE: Editor Is Leaving The Observer, New York's Scorecard

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
Peter W. Kaplan, the editor of The New York Observer, announced his resignation on Wednesday and said he would be leaving the weekly in June. For the past 15 years Mr. Kaplan has used tart headlines and talented young writers to create a kind of contemporary municipal history of New York high and sometimes low. The newspaper let those in the know know what else they should know about.
 Mr. Kaplan met with his staff at 2 p.m. to inform them of his departure, saying that after almost 800 issues it was time for someone else to perform what some of those who work at the small paper have called a kind of a weekly miracle. ''I have been here 15 years,'' he said in an interview, pointing out that his third five-year contract is up in June. ''I'm 55, interested in a third act, and I've had my turn here. I want to take what I have learned and see if there is a way I can help figure out what is next for our business.''
 Jared Kushner, 28, the newspaper's owner and publisher, said, ''It's sad that Peter is leaving the paper. He's done some wonderful things here at The Observer.'' 
 Although each of the men said nice things about each other, a number of staffers at The Observer, who did not speak for attribution because they didn't want to be openly critical of the paper's owner, said in interviews that a push for shorter articles and a desire for cuts in an already small newsroom budget helped Mr. Kaplan decide it was time to go.
 He will leave a New York media world that is very different from the one he began covering in The Observer in 1994 -- one that is challenged by faltering bottom lines and atomized into dozens of blogs and Web sites. Just last week The Observer broke a story about a Brooklyn con woman, the so-called hipster-grifter, in an article that provided just the kind of New York intrigue and context that had been a hallmark of the newspaper. But Gawker, the Manhattan gossip blog, immediately took custody of the story, annotating it with attitude and reader-submitted sightings of the protagonist that all but obscured where the story came from in the first place.
 ''We are a newspaper in a time that is fundamentally uncongenial to newspapers, and we are about the reporting at a time when the economics of reporting are very difficult to justify,'' Mr. Kaplan said. ''There may be some similarities in tone, but we are the diametric opposite of Gawker. We don't borrow information, we create it.''
 Known for his soaring soliloquies about the city he loved but did not live in -- he resides in Westchester -- Mr. Kaplan is a modern version of the fedora-wearing newsman, a man who saw his paper as a weekly libretto rendered in glamour and noir. During his tenure the longest for an editor in the newspaper's 22-year history, The Observer played large for its size, catching Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., when he was a presidential candidate, taking the measure of Barack Obama by saying he was ''articulate and bright and clean''; getting an interview with Jayson Blair at a time when his reporting for The New York Times was coming apart; and all but creating a television and movie franchise with its ''Sex and the City'' column. 
 Mr. Kaplan's skepticism and manifest enthusiasm have left a footprint on the vocabulary of contemporary journalism. Long before there were tatty, snarky blogs, the voice of amazed, gimlet-eyed hilarity was baked into Mr. Kaplan's version of the weekly. And dozens of the people annealed in his weekly oven of big ambitions and tiny budgets have graduated onto the Web and into mainstream newsgathering, a diaspora that both widened and diluted its strength as a paper. 
 The Observer relies heavily on real estate advertising and circulates mostly in Manhattan to about 50,000 readers. It has undergone significant changes since it was sold by the avuncular Manhattan businessman Arthur Carter in 2006, and purchased by Mr. Kushner, the Manhattan real-estate scion. At the tender age of 25 he plunked down almost $10 million for the weekly. The penchant for money losing remained a part of The Observer's identity, but in 2007 it left behind its broadsheet format and became a tabloid and turned significant attention to its Web site, observer.com. Mr. Kaplan said at the time that part of the gesture was to come up with a paper that its new owner could relate to. 
 (In some ways Mr. Kushner would appear to be more of an ideal subject than owner of the weekly. On Tuesday night he and his girlfriend Ivanka Trump walked the stairs leading up to the Vanity Fair party celebrating the opening of the Tribeca Film Festival. The photographers went bonkers.)
 Observer staffers said the pairing of an editor preoccupied by New York demimondes and the young real estate baron was an odd alliance that was bound to dissolve at some point, but Mr. Kaplan, as is often the case in public partings, had only kind words to offer.
 ''Jared saved the paper,'' he said in the interview. ''It would have gone bye-bye in 2006. He is fundamentally a capitalist in a business that needs capitalists, and he is 28 years old in a business that needs 28-year-olds.''
 Mr. Kaplan, a former reporter for The New York Times and once the executive producer of ''The Charlie Rose Show,'' came to The Observer as an editor in the tradition of Clay Felker, the founding editor of New York magazine. He promoted and executed a tough-minded brand of civic hyperbole, a belief that there was and is no other place in the world like New York City. His job, which has previously belonged to Graydon Carter, now the editor of Vanity Fair, and Susan Morrison, now an editor at The New Yorker, involved the creation of a real-time taxonomy of New York power -- not just who was up and down, but who mattered in the first place. Finding oneself depicted in a large-headed caricature in the paper was a totem of arrival in some parts of Manhattan, a sign that one had become worthy of incarceration in the social pantheon defined by its pages.
 But The New York Observer has always worked on a less than thin margin. Mr. Kushner may have a small interest in publishing, but his main business is New York real estate, which has been a rugged nexus of the economic downturn.
 Despite rumors of disagreements over financing, Mr. Kaplan said Mr. Kushner will continue to support the paper.
 ''It's true that he and I are very different creatures, but he is very ambitious, which is The New York Observer's stock in trade,'' he said. ''He clearly wants to see this thing through.'' Mr. Kaplan, who called the paper his ''life's work'' when he was shopping it after Mr. Carter tired of putting tens of millions of dollars into it, said that it will continue in some form, just not with the topspin he put on it every week.
 ''I bring my own weird cultural framing to this, but I am not immune to the Oedipal triumph of what comes next here from the people at this paper who will take it over,'' he said. ''It will be a battle on all fronts, but the paper will be freer and faster, moving into the future in ways that I can't foresee.''
 Mr. Kushner said that he and Mr. Kaplan had come to an agreement a month ago that he would be leaving, and that Mr. Kaplan would be assisting him in a search for a new editor. 
 Former staffers said regardless of who is chosen, Mr. Kaplan's departure would leave a gap in New York's media landscape.
 Jim Windolf, a former Observer reporter who is now a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, said, ''I think it seems depressing that we are living at a time when someone like Peter Kaplan is not running a major publication in New York. That just seems weird to me.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 24, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Thursday about the resignation of Peter W. Kaplan as editor of The New York Observer referred incorrectly to the paper's owner, Jared Kushner, in some editions. In addition to being the owner, he is the publisher, not the editor.

HEADLINE: Our Hawaiian Holiday Without, Well, Hawaii

BYLINE: By MICHELLE SLATALLA

 BODY:
OURS is not a family that vacations lightly.
 The way we prepare for a trip more closely resembles advance planning for the military invasion of a small country than for a week of family time in a relaxing setting.
 First, we pack: books, sunblock, cotton balls, blow-dryers, laptop computers, cellphones, tweezers, postage stamps (for postcards), Advil, sunglasses, more books, wide-brimmed hats and the new issue of People magazine (so we won't miss any developments in the Kirstie Alley weight-loss story).
 It's no wonder that, more times than not, we return from a vacation in need of a vacation. It's exhausting, to tell the truth, especially when you throw in air travel, the stress of getting around unfamiliar places and the constant hemorrhaging of our hard-earned cash. Is there anything more infuriating than spending $4 on a Coca-Cola just because you happen to be sitting next to a hotel pool when you order it?
 This year we decided to try something different during spring break. Our oldest daughter wanted to come home from college for her five-day break. Our middle daughter wanted to spend the week working, to build up cash for college next fall. And my husband is always willing to try anything that doesn't involve air travel. 
 So last week we joined the ranks of Americans who are staying home and calling it a vacation. 
 To be sure, taking a staycation remains a niche trend, at least according to the U.S. Travel Association, which estimates that in recent months only 9 percent of leisure travelers gave up out-of-town trips in favor of them, despite the uncertain economic times.
 The problem with a staycation, according to the travel association, is that by definition you're not going anywhere, which is a letdown, whereas looking forward to travel increases your positive feelings about your life. Of course, the travel association is in the business of promoting travel and to that end has also collected statistics that suggest that travelers who take a real vacation report they sleep more deeply and for longer periods and that they rate their overall health more highly while on vacation.
 But in our case, I decided to risk staying home because it made perfect sense.
 Except for one glitch.
 Our youngest daughter, age 11, was having none of it.
 ''When we stay home, you and Dad end up 'working' all the time and then everybody gets stressed,'' Clem said, sounding suspiciously like an undercover agent for the travel association. 
 ''Stressed?'' I asked nervously. ''Not likely. It'll be fun.''
 And why shouldn't it? We live in the San Francisco Bay area, after all, a popular destination for travelers from around the world. I drew up a schedule that included the beach, a hike and picnic, the pool and a visit to the science museum, with most activities carefully framed by meals at our favorite restaurants.
 On Day 1, I went into Clem's bedroom at 8 a.m. ''Rise and shine,'' I said. ''It's time to start staycation!''
 ''Then why are you waking me up so early?'' she mumbled.
 ''We're going to the beach,'' I said. 
 I decided to wait for her downstairs, where I took a quick call from an editor, read a little e-mail, scheduled a conference call for later in the week and finished revising the last chapter of a book manuscript.
 Then I glanced at the clock and saw -- 
 Noon! Already?
 ''Mom?'' It was Clem. ''Are we going to the beach?''
 ''Load the sandwiches!'' I called, regrouping speedily. Forty minutes later, we were unfurling blankets at Stinson Beach.
 ''It's just like Hawaii!'' I said enthusiastically. ''If Hawaii were free!''
 ''And if Hawaii were really cold and windy,'' my husband said, huddling beneath a hooded sweatshirt.
 ''And had threatening seagulls,'' Clem added, pointing to a scruffy bird that had landed on the next blanket over and was dragging away in its beak a bagged loaf of bread.
 Just then, the wind picked up, whipping sand into my turkey sandwich. The bird, catching a whiff of cold cuts, turned and started to march toward me. 
 ''The great thing about staycation is we can leave the beach and go to the pool whenever we want,'' I said, kicking sand at a seagull and then running to the car before it could retaliate. 
 That turned out to be only one of the great things about staycation. For the rest of the week, we got to do what we wanted, when we wanted. We saw movies, took naps, drank white wine at lunch and ate out just about every meal. And I never blanched at the bill. It was much cheaper than it would have been in Maui, after all.
 The one thing I did feel bad about, however, was working. I did it every day. Some days I did it for hours.
 On one hand, this had the curious effect of relaxing me rather than making me stressed, because I felt in control, keeping up with things. But I also felt guilty. After all, people are not supposed to work on staycation. 
 Are they?
 ''I shouldn't even be phoning you to ask the question, because I'm supposed to be on staycation,'' I said to Jim Bird, a consultant in Atlanta who advises corporate clients on the benefits of improving employees' work-life balance.
 ''I wouldn't worry about it, it won't ruin it,'' Mr. Bird said.
 For people who work at home, it's virtually impossible to totally separate unless you leave home, he said. The trick to making staycation pleasant is to make peace with that reality and to divide the days accordingly, into blocks of ''work'' and ''play'' time.
 ''When you are doing something that's 'play,' like going to the beach, make an effort to not think about work,'' he said. ''Be lighthearted.''
 None of the other dire risks of staycation ever came to pass. I slept like a baby. I had a lot of positive feelings about myself (and my tennis game). And far from feeling let down, I was very excited to pick up Zoe at the airport.
 ''Almost like traveling!'' I pointed out to Clem the next day.
 ''Better,'' she called over her shoulder, as she headed to the pool with her friend Camille.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Policy Blamed for Homelessness

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration's four-year-old policy of denying federal housing vouchers to the homeless has helped push the number of families in New York City shelters to record levels, an advocacy group for the homeless said in a report released on Wednesday. 
 The group, the Coalition for the Homeless, which is frequently at odds with the Bloomberg administration, predicted that the city's policy, coupled with the economic recession, would worsen homelessness significantly in the coming months. 
 ''We felt that it was a mistake in policy four years ago when they did it, and it's even more mistaken now, given the recession and the rising numbers of homeless families,'' said Patrick Markee, a senior policy analyst with the coalition.
 According to data analyzed by the coalition, the economic downturn helped drive nearly 110,000 people into city shelters in 2008.
 In October 2004, the Bloomberg administration ended the longstanding practice of homeless families' receiving priority for federal housing vouchers, which enable recipients to pay their landlords no more than 30 percent of their income in rent, with the federal government paying the rest. (Several other groups, including victims of domestic violence and former foster children, still receive priority.) 
 At the time, city officials said that the supply of vouchers had run short, that they believed that some families purposely entered shelters as a shortcut to receive housing vouchers, and that once the practice was stopped, the number of families applying for emergency shelter would decrease. 
 But advocates for the homeless have long criticized the policy, arguing that the small number of families who entered shelters just to receive housing vouchers was offset by the much larger group of homeless families who legitimately deserved vouchers.
 Over time, predictions by city officials were proven wrong: The number of families in shelters has increased since 2004. In 2005, an average of 840 new families sought shelter each month, on average; that number steadily increased to 1,196 in 2008. More new families entered the shelter system in 2008 than in any year since the 1980s, according to the coalition's report.
 More than 9,400 families are now in shelters, or more than 28,000 people. 
 Heather Janik, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Homeless Services, said that in 2008, the department helped place 8,269 families in permanent housing, an increase of more than 30 percent from 2007. 
 ''While the coalition sits on the sidelines screaming 'Fire' and proposing failed solutions, we are working aggressively with a wide range of homeless providers to place more and more families into homes of their own,'' she said. 
 The Homeless Services Department has created new programs that were meant to replace federal vouchers. The first program, Housing Stability Plus, provided time-limited rent subsidies that declined in value by 20 percent each year. 
 It was widely considered a failure, and in 2007, the administration introduced a new program, Work Advantage, that provided a two-year rental subsidy and that matched savings that recipients accrued from their jobs.
 Some advocates for the homeless said those programs did not come close to compensating for federal housing vouchers. 
 Studies by the nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice and the National Alliance to End Homelessness, among others, have found that housing vouchers are effective in helping homeless families leave shelters and keep permanent housing. 
 The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonprofit research organization in Washington, issued a policy paper last week arguing that more federal housing vouchers are needed to stem the increase in homelessness caused by the recession.

OWL VS. PARAKEETS
 In Queens, Take 2
 When last we saw Hootie, the battery-powered owl, he was freshly installed atop a high-voltage electrical device on 11th Avenue in Whitestone, Queens, to scare off a group of wild monk parakeets intent on nesting there. 
 Well, Hootie proved no match for the parakeets, who promptly built a nest on the device, which helps prevent blackouts.
 But despite reports that the fake owl has been fired, Con Edison technicians are giving him another chance, turning to something else known to deter parakeets: the color orange.
 ''We put an orange cape on Hootie, and now he's Super Hootie,'' said Sam Maratto, a Con Ed technician who is leading the ongoing battle against the wild parakeets colonizing overhead electrical equipment and causing damage and power failures in Whitestone.
 An article in The New York Times on Saturday described how the parakeets kept building their nests on that 11th Avenue device, causing the devices to short-circuit and break. One after another, Con Edison workers replaced the $20,000 piece of equipment, and last year they finally bought the plastic owl to serve as a scarecrow. It worked for a stretch, but after its batteries died, the parakeets were back. 
 Con Edison replaced the device again this month and installed a new owl on it. But by Monday, the parakeets had returned and built a nest on the device, apparently hip to this fake owl's limited skills: Its head swivels slowly, and it emits a manufactured hoot, activated by a motion detector.
 On Monday, the nest caused another short-circuit, destroying the new equipment and knocking out power to roughly 1,500 homes for about 30 minutes, Mr. Maratto said.
 ''The neighbors told us the parrots came back and were up there going wild, building their nest,'' Mr. Maratto said. ''We put Hootie up on one side, so they came back and built their nest on the other side.''
 Still, Mr. Maratto was undaunted in his resolve to scare off the parakeets.
 ''They may have won the battle, but we're going to win this war,'' he said, noting that many bird experts have called Con Ed with suggestions. Some suggested using the color orange to deter the birds.
 ''We put orange flags up,'' Mr. Maratto said, ''and that seems to be working,'' 
 ''We're getting all kinds of suggestions,'' he added. ''One guy said to use shiny stuff, reflective strips to scare them off. We even had a firm from Argentina that claims to have a foolproof method, but they're not telling us. They want to be flown in to discuss it.'' COREY KILGANNON

 Antipoverty Efforts Cut Back: Three years after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg created a city office to combat poverty, he said on Tuesday that while 11 of the office's pilot programs held great promise, 6 of them would be shut down.
 It was the first time that Mr. Bloomberg had cut any programs in the office, called the Center for Economic Opportunity, a public-private partnership that began with a $100 million budget to finance experimental programs intended to lift people out of poverty.

HEADLINE: State Director Of Budget Resigns Post

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
The state's top budget official resigned on Wednesday to accept a job leading New York's major trade association for private colleges and universities.
 The official, Laura L. Anglin, is a veteran public servant and economist who previously served as the state's deputy comptroller and as deputy budget director under former Gov. Eliot Spitzer. Mr. Spitzer elevated her to run the state budget division before resigning last year, and she remained in that position under Gov. David A. Paterson. 
 Ms. Anglin, among the last remaining Spitzer holdovers, was widely considered one of Mr. Paterson's most capable aides. No successor has yet been announced. 
 In July, Ms. Anglin is to become president of the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities, which represents more than 100 private schools around the state. 
 She is to succeed Abraham M. Lackman, a former Republican aide in the State Senate who is close to Mr. Paterson and who has led the commission since 2002.
 Officials said that Ms. Anglin had planned to leave the administration earlier this year but agreed to stay on through the spring and the thick of budget negotiations, which proved to be difficult and controversial. 
 Though Ms. Anglin was widely viewed in the Capitol as a force for spending restraint, the budget that Mr. Paterson and the Legislature ultimately negotiated has been criticized as not cutting state spending enough.
 Her departure leaves the governor without a budget director during a recession that has devastated the state's finances. 
 If tax revenue continues to plummet this year, Mr. Paterson may have to push for additional cuts. 
 In a statement, Mr. Paterson said that Ms. Anglin had ''played a major role in stabilizing New York's finances and enacting critical reforms that will eliminate waste and inefficiency in government.''

HEADLINE: Administration Stops Short Of Endorsing Climate Bill

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Obama administration officials said Wednesday that an ambitious energy and climate-change proposal sponsored by House Democrats could help create jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but they stopped short of endorsing it.
 Steven Chu, the secretary of energy, and Lisa P. Jackson, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, told a House committee considering the measure that they believed it could help accomplish President Obama's goals of moderating climate change, spurring clean-energy technology and reducing dependence on foreign oil.
 Yet both said they were still studying the details of the 648-page draft, unveiled late last month by two Democratic lawmakers, Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts. In fact, Dr. Chu and Ms. Jackson said that they had not read the entire draft and that the administration had not given its blessings to the bill. They said they would work closely with Congress to help fashion acceptable legislation. 
 The House measure, the most far-reaching piece of energy and environmental legislation to come before Congress in years, would require large changes in the way the United States generates electricity, manufactures products, heats and lights its homes and offices, and moves people and goods.
 One central provision would establish a cap-and-trade program to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Obama has repeatedly pushed the idea of a cap-and-trade plan as part of any eventual measure -- he did so again Wednesday at an Earth Day observance in Iowa -- but he and his senior aides have left the details to Congress.
 Mr. Waxman, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where Dr. Chu and Ms. Jackson testified Wednesday along with Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, has begun a month of intensive work on the legislation with the announced goal of moving it through the committee by late May. The panel will hear from 67 witnesses this week and will begin subcommittee work next week.
 Mr. Waxman faces vocal skepticism from most Republicans on his committee, several of whom complained at Wednesday's hearing that the bill would drastically raise energy costs and lead to large job losses. They also said Mr. Waxman was moving too quickly on a measure with such profound consequences.
 Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, called the legislation a ''cap and tax'' proposal that would ''kick working families when they're down.''
 But Mr. Waxman and other Democrats cited an E.P.A. study issued on Tuesday that said the bill would have a negligible effect on the American economy and consumers' pocketbooks.
 Ms. Jackson said the Waxman-Markey measure would impose ''modest costs compared to the benefits.''
 While the committee will be exposed to hour upon hour of such argument from lawmakers, government officials, industry executives, academics and environmental advocates over the next days and weeks, the real action on the bill is going on behind the scenes.
 Under any sort of cap-and-trade scheme, government sets an overall limit on emissions while allowing companies to trade permits, known as allowances, to pollute. But the House draft does not address two central issues. First, it does not say how many of the allowances the government will give away, if any, and how many it will auction. Democrats from states dependent on coal and manufacturing are asking that a sizable portion of the allowances be granted free, to mitigate the costs of the carbon cap.
 Second, the legislation does not say what will be done with the proceeds of any auction of permits, estimated in Mr. Obama's budget proposal to be worth at least $65 billion a year.
 Negotiations are under way to resolve those questions, and the answers will determine how many Democrats ultimately support the bill and whether any Republicans do.
 Those financial issues will also be crucial to winning support in the Senate, where on Wednesday two unlikely bedfellows announced legislation requiring the E.P.A. to conduct a study on the environmental effects of so-called black carbon, the soot that lands on Arctic ice and other reflective surfaces and contributes to global warming.
 Senators John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who are usually about as far apart on environmental issues as it is possible to be, are among the sponsors of the bill. They called black carbon a ''dangerous pollutant'' emitted by old, dirty diesel engines and the burning of wood, peat and dung. They said it was thought to be the second-largest cause of global climate change, after carbon dioxide.

HEADLINE: Obama Hails Wind Energy On Earth Day Visit to Iowa

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: NEWTON, Iowa 

 BODY:
''This was a Maytag town,'' said Rick Tiedje, a 63-year-old corn and soybean farmer and Jasper County supervisor here. ''We have a Maytag Dairy, a Maytag Park, a Maytag Bowl. It was a one-horse town. Maytag ran the town, but they were good to the town.''
 Now Maytag is gone, its old factory replaced by a wind energy plant, which is why President Obama came to Newton, population 16,000, on Wednesday to mark Earth Day. He declared ''a new era of energy exploration in America'' and pitched his energy plan as a win-win for the economy and the environment. 
 ''The choice we face is not between saving our environment and saving our economy,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The choice we face is between prosperity and decline. We can remain the world's leading importer of oil, or we can become the world's leading exporter of clean energy.''
 With his energy secretary, his transportation secretary and the head of the Environmental Protection Agency all on Capitol Hill testifying on the energy bill moving through the House, Mr. Obama toured Trinity Structural Towers, which builds massive towers for wind turbines in the old Maytag plant, which closed two years ago. In a 35-minute speech, he laid out his vision for an energy-efficient future.
 He renewed his call for Congress to close the ''carbon loophole'' by adopting a cap-and-trade system for reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. And he promoted wind and other renewable forms of power, saying that for the first time the Interior Department would begin leasing federal waters for offshore production of electricity from the movement of wind, waves and tides.
 According to the American Wind Energy Association, a trade group, the United States market for wind power is growing rapidly, and nearly doubled in 2008. The American wind power industry directly employs about 85,000 people today, a 70 percent increase from a year ago, the group reported. But the economic downturn has slowed demand.
 Alternative sources of energy currently account for less than 3 percent of the energy consumed in the United States, but Mr. Obama said that by 2030, that figure for wind power alone could jump to 20 percent. 
 ''Now, in comparison, Denmark produces almost 20 percent of their electricity through wind power,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We pioneered solar technology, but we've fallen behind countries like Germany and Japan in generating it, even though we've got more sun than either country. I don't accept this is the way it has to be.''
 But in heralding Newton as a leader in ''the next energy revolution,'' Mr. Obama also ran into a stark economic reality here, and conceded that it would take more than clean-energy jobs to bring this town fully back to life. Of the roughly 1,800 Maytag jobs lost, fewer than one-third have been replaced. Trinity Structural Towers employs 91 people, while a new factory that makes wind turbine blades employs about 300, including Mr. Tiedje's son, Nick.
 ''You talk to your neighbors and your friends,'' the president said. ''I know the community hasn't fully recovered.''
 Still, the trip to Newton, Mr. Obama's first to Iowa as president, was a happy homecoming of sorts; it was Iowa, after all, that put then-Senator Obama on the map as a presidential candidate when he upset Hillary Rodham Clinton in the caucuses here in January 2008. 
 As president, he received a warm welcome from some familiar faces, including Mr. Tiedje, who prides himself on being the first elected official in Jasper County to support Mr. Obama's candidacy. It is planting season here, but Mr. Tiedje, dressed in a blue shirt and khaki pants, said he left his 500-acre farm behind on Wednesday afternoon to hear the president speak.
 ''I should be planting corn today,'' he said, ''but this is more important.''

HEADLINE: China's Other Minority, Seen by One of Its Own

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

 BODY:
DRAGON FIGHTER 
 One Woman's Epic Struggle for Peace With China 
 By Rebiya Kadeer with Alexandra Cavelius 
 Illustrated. 423 pages. Kales Press. $28.95. 
 It is the awkward fate of China, more than any other country, to be arriving late to any number of parties where most other revelers are either long gone or leaving, having declared the celebrations declasse. Such is the case with China's booming smokestack economy and with its ardent new fling with the automobile, with its desire for a deep-water navy built around aircraft carriers, and with its ambition for a space program that will land on the Moon. 
 China is also just beginning to grapple with the creation of what most in the developed world would recognize as a modern legal system and acceptable standards for human rights, and it is in much the same position with its cobbling efforts to reinvent the welfare state. 
 Most anachronistic of all, though, is the country's treatment of its two largest minorities, the Tibetans and Uighurs, both old, non-Han indigenous civilizations that claim meaningful autonomy in China's vast, resource-rich and sparsely populated west. Our Western legacy of land expropriation and slaughter of native peoples by European settlers and imperial armies may give us little to cluck about, but in today's world the rights and interests of native peoples have rightly won greater recognition.
 In this memoir, ''Dragon Fighter,'' part defiant political tell-all, part engrossing personal saga, Rebiya Kadeer paints a vivid picture of her life as a mother of 11 and a businesswoman who spent nearly six years in prison on her way to becoming the Uighur people's most prominent dissident. 
 Since its Communist revolution of 1949 China has employed a brimming catalog of tactics to bring its western region to heel. These include invasion; disappearing of political leaders; gerrymandering to disperse minorities across new, eccentrically redrawn provinces, flooding the cities with subsidized Han immigration; limits on worship, government control of clergy, desecration of temples and harsh repression.
 Even Westerners who pay relatively little attention to China will be at least vaguely familiar with the plight of Tibetans, whose religious leader, the Dalai Lama, has been lionized by the Nobel committee and received at the White House.
 Such is not the case with the Uighur, a central Asian people who are distant relatives of the Turks and native to what China calls the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, or the New Frontier, an area three and half times as large as California, whose indigenous people look all but set to join the ranks of history's great, overrun losers.
 One thing the Uighur, spelled Uyghur in this book, have never had is a leader with great recognition outside China, like the Dalai Lama, who has contributed a brief introduction for this memoir of Ms. Kadeer. She writes: ''Politicians and human rights organizations from all over the world were active on behalf of Tibet. The conditions in the Uyghur nation were much the same. But interest from abroad in the two, though literally we were next-door neighbors sharing a common border and both under Chinese occupation, could not have been more dissimilar.''
 Nor, she might have added, scarcely could the plight of these two neighboring peoples, both of which have long maintained cultural and often political autonomy on the periphery of imperial China, be more fundamentally similar. That the Uighur have never enjoyed anything like the global sympathy extended to Tibetans stands out as a historical oddity that may have something to do with their predominantly Muslim culture, which evokes little of the warm feeling engendered by Tibet's red-robed, incense-burning, sutra-chanting Buddhists.
 In the end, though, even this may not matter. Ms. Kadeer writes perceptively about the many humiliations imposed by Beijing on the Uighurs, including routine business harassment and forced abortions, massacres and barriers to trade and contact with other central Asian neighbors. Beijing makes it hard for the Uighurs to believe in anything but ultimate submission to the grand, centrally conceived plans of a powerful China.
 On one level Ms. Kadeer's book is a routine account of recent Chinese history. Much more interesting is its core autobiographical story: the remarkable rise from modest roots to a life as, the author claims, the wealthiest woman in China and a politically prominent member of the National People's Congress.
 Here, though, the book is marred by language that betrays limited modesty and perhaps even limited self-knowledge. We are constantly reminded of the author's qualities: she is chaste, smart, beautiful, clever, strong, indomitable, selfless, moral, wise and fearless -- especially fearless.
 By the end of the book, however, the last of these claims will leave few readers in doubt. Through sheer force of personality Ms. Kadeer overcomes a bad marriage to an abusive husband, then seeks out and marries a former political prisoner and poet, telling him flatly that ''after our wedding, our first task will be to liberate the land.''
 Years, several children and many arduous commercial voyages across China later, having built a fortune (and a big reputation) in department stores and real estate, while she and her second husband dreamed of liberating the land, Ms. Kadeer begins to attract the wooing calls of the party. Her big moment comes in a speech before the Congress in Beijing, in which she boldly switches the approved text to ask: ''Is it our fault that the Chinese have occupied our land? That we live under such horrible conditions?''
 If not the first time she had spoken truth to power, it was certainly the beginning of the end. Soon afterward Ms. Kadeer was arrested on her way to a meeting with a member of the United States Congress. She was tried, imprisoned for nearly six years and exiled to the United States.
 This remarkable life is now added to the saga of the Uighur people, a people without leaders.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 6, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The Books of The Times review on April 23, about ''Dragon Fighter: One Woman's Epic Struggle for Peace With China,'' by Rebiya Kadeer with Alexandra Cavelius, misstated the size of the Uighur and Tibetan ethnic minorities in China. (Ms. Kadeer is a Uighur.) According to the Chinese census taken in 2000, the two largest minority groups are the Zhuang and the Manchu, not the Uighur and Tibetan.

HEADLINE: Apple Profit Rises 15%, Driven by iPhone Sales

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM and BRAD STONE

 BODY:
Apple's second-quarter profit, driven by strong sales of iPhones and iPods, beat Wall Street's expectations despite the gloomy economy. 
 The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., said on Wednesday that continued demand for its portable devices kept sales from dipping substantially during the typically slow months after the holiday shopping season. 
 Despite a 3 percent slump in sales of the company's Mac computers, Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's chief financial officer, called the quarter ''the best nonholiday earnings in the company's history.''Apple reportedthat its net profit jumped 15 percent, to $1.21 billion, or $1.33 a share, from $1.05 billion, or $1.16 a share, in the same quarter a year ago. 
 Quarterly revenue rose to $8.16 billion, from $7.51 billion last year. Analysts had expected Apple to announce revenue of $7.9 billion and a profit of $1.09 a share, according to a survey conducted by Thomson Reuters. 
 Analysts, including A. M. Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said the most impressive figure was the company's 36.4 percent gross margin, which Apple said was helped by the falling cost of some components and strong software sales. 
 Mr. Sacconaghi also remarked on the high spirits of Mr. Oppenheimer and the company's chief operating officer, Timothy D. Cook, during a conference call with analysts and shareholders.
 ''Their enthusiasm about their product portfolio is something investors care deeply about,'' Mr. Sacconaghi said. ''Even though they weren't specific, that level of excitement potentially foreshadows exciting products to come. It is something investors care deeply about and get excited over.''
 Apple watchers anticipate that the company will unveil new iPhones at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June and perhaps a tablet device later in the year. Discussing rumors that the company would develop a so-called netbook -- a small, low-cost laptop with limited features -- Mr. Cook expressed little interest. 
 ''When I look at what is being sold in the netbook space today, I see cramped keyboards, terrible software, junky hardware, very small screens,'' he said. ''And just not a consumer experience, and not something that we would put the Mac brand on, quite frankly.'' 
 Mr. Cook also said that the iPod Touch or iPhone were worthy alternatives to ''small computers that do browsing and e-mail.''
 When pressed about the condition of Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, who is on a leave of absence to deal with health matters, Mr. Oppenheimer was upbeat. ''We look forward to Steve returning to Apple at the end of June,'' he said.
 The earnings news sent Apple's stock up 3.5 percent in after-hours trading. The earnings report offered more proof that Apple's strategy of selling must-have digital accoutrements at a premium price to people who can afford them is a smart, if counterintuitive, strategy for navigating the recession. 
 ''For a consumer company to be growing 9 percent in this economic environment is a testament that the products are strong and the company is in touch with its customers,'' Mr. Sacconaghi said. 
 Apple said it sold 2.22 million Macs in the quarter ended March 28, down from 2.3 million last year. But it sold 3.79 million iPhones, up from 1.7 million a year ago, in part because of expanding sales of the device around the globe. 
 Mr. Cook said that the App Store for the iPhone, which offers software from third-party developers, was within hours of approaching its one billionth download. 
 The planned summer update to the iPhone's operating system, which will include features like the ability to make payments within applications and multimedia messaging, ''unleashes a whole new level of innovation that keeps Apple years ahead of everyone else,'' he said. 
 As usual, the company was cautious in the guidance it offered Wall Street. The company projected that it would have revenue of $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion and earnings of about $1 a share in the current quarter. 
 Analysts applauded the company's earnings report but cautioned against taking Apple's gains as a sign of the wider industry's improving. 
 ''Apple is a big company, but they are really addressing only the upper ends of their target markets, and those are arguably the parts of the market that are most resistant to the economic downturn,'' said Shaw Wu, a senior research analyst at Kaufman Brothers.

HEADLINE: New Riverside Pastor's Compensation Splits Congregation

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
Longstanding tensions among parishioners at the renowned Riverside Church erupted again this week as a group of congregants went to court to stop the installation of a new senior pastor whose compensation package, they say, exceeds $600,000 a year.
 In a motion filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the group said that the new pastor, the Rev. Dr. Brad R. Braxton, and the church board that selected him last September after a yearlong search, had dismissed their calls for transparency in financial matters. They also complained that Dr. Braxton was moving Riverside away from its tradition of interracial progressivism and toward a conservative style of religious practice. 
 On Tuesday, a Supreme Court judge, Lewis Bart Stone, effectively denied the motion by adjourning the case to the end of May, a month after Dr. Braxton's installation, which is scheduled for Sunday. The judge urged both sides to reach an accommodation in the case, which was reported on Wednesday by The Daily News. 
 The church, a Gothic cathedral built in 1930 by John D. Rockefeller at 120th Street and Riverside Drive in Manhattan, stood for many decades at the most heavily trafficked juncture of religious faith and social activism in the United States. Its pastors were early civil rights advocates who marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and invited him to speak in the pulpit. Its best-known leader was the fervent civil rights and anti-Vietnam War activist, the Rev. Dr. William Sloane Coffin Jr. 
 By the dissidents' account, Dr. Braxton's compensation package includes an annual base salary of $250,000; a monthly housing allowance of $11,500; pension and life insurance benefits; entertainment, travel and ''professional development'' expenses; an equity allowance for the future purchase of a home; money for a full-time maid; and private school tuition for his 3-year-old daughter. 
 Rick Stone, a longtime parishioner who served as pro bono lawyer for the petitioners, said Dr. Braxton's package was roughly twice what his predecessor received.
 ''This is a huge amount of money to be paying at a time of such economic crisis,'' said Diana Solomon-Glover, a 30-year parishioner, a member of the choir, and one of the plaintiffs. ''But equally of concern is Dr. Braxton's style of governance, which is highly secretive, and the direction he has been taking the church, toward a more fundamentalist brand of religion.''
 Through a spokesman, Dr. Braxton declined to be interviewed. 
 Dr. Billy E. Jones, chairman of the Riverside Church Council, the executive board of congregants, said in a statement that the new pastor's compensation was ''in line with other religious leaders in Manhattan who minister to congregations of a similar size and scope.'' Dr. Jones said the board had disclosed details of the pay package to the full congregation, but the dissidents dispute that. 
 Dr. Jones also said that Dr. Braxton was not given money for a full-time maid, and that the ''private school tuition'' amounted to the pastor's daughter attending the church's day school tuition free. 
 Experts on American churches said in interviews that Dr. Braxton's compensation was well above average among pastors nationwide, but was within the range of packages for senior pastors of megachurches and what are known as mainline ''tall steeple'' churches in major cities.
 Scott L. Thumma, a sociology of religion professor at the Hartford Institute for Religion Research who has studied pastor compensation, said the average salary of 105 megachurch pastors surveyed in 2008 was about $150,000, with the highest-paid receiving about $300,000. 
 ''With 2,700 congregants, I would call Riverside a megachurch, and measure its pastor in that pool,'' Mr. Thumma said.
 Discord about Riverside's direction and priorities long preceded the arrival of Dr. Braxton. The tension between social activism and a more traditional church practice has paralleled a demographic shift in the congregation. For many years the church was predominantly white, a reflection of the Upper West Side population, but the church's black membership grew to become a majority under Dr. Braxton's predecessor, the Rev. Dr. James A. Forbes Jr., the church's first black senior pastor, who served from 1989 to 2007.
 Among those who were dissatisfied by the shift, the selection of Dr. Braxton, a Southern Baptist minister and former Rhodes scholar who described himself as ''progressive evangelical,'' was viewed as a confirmation of the conservative trend. 
 In the months since his appointment, tensions have been high. ''I came here looking for a church for spiritual reasons,'' said Glenn Allen, a new member of the choir who was not party to the suit, ''but it has really not been a very spiritual experience.''

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about a conflict among parishioners of the Riverside Church over the compensation package for its senior pastor, the Rev. Dr. Brad R. Braxton, misidentified the Baptist group with which he is affiliated. He was ordained by the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A. -- not the Southern Baptist Convention.

HEADLINE: Ex-Leader of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Seeks Presidency, Splintering Conservatives

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
A hard-line politician and former head of the Revolutionary Guards, Mohsen Rezai, announced Wednesday that he would enter the presidential race, indicating additional splintering among the country's conservatives. 
 Mr. Rezai, who oversaw the Revolutionary Guards from 1981 to 1997, had been seeking to unite conservative politicians behind another candidate to compete against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But he decided instead to become a candidate himself in the presidential election, to be held June 12, Iranian news media reported. 
 Mr. Rezai, who has accused Mr. Ahmadinejad of mismanaging the economy, will run as an independent candidate, the ISNA news agency reported.
 His candidacy underscores the political fragmenting of a conservative faction known as the Principlists, which threw its support behind Mr. Ahmadinejad when he ran for president in 2004. Some leading figures who supported Mr. Ahmadinejad then have not publicly backed him this time.
 Mr. Rezai is not necessarily considered a strong candidate, but because of his association with the Revolutionary Guards, he will probably attract conservative voters who might otherwise vote for Mr. Ahmadinejad. The president is expected to have strong support from the poor and the Revolutionary Guards, among others.
 Mr. Rezai was a candidate in the 2004 presidential race, but he withdrew before the election.
 Politicians who favor more political and social openness, along with closer ties to the West, have also been unable to coalesce around a single candidate. They are divided between a former prime minister, Mir Hossein Mousavi, and a former speaker of Parliament, Mehdi Karroubi.
 ''Mr. Mousavi had thought that he could easily raise huge support by announcing his candidacy,'' said Saeed Leylaz, a political analyst in Tehran, referring to Mr. Mousavi's unexpected announcement last month that he would run for president.
 ''The situation can dramatically change in his favor if he clarifies his position with reformers,'' Mr. Leylaz said. 
 Opponents have accused Mr. Ahmadinejad of economic mismanagement and of using government money to attract support for a second term. His government has come under attack in the past month for distributing about 400,000 tons of potatoes around the country and giving bonuses, including gold coins, to civil servants, Iranian newspapers have reported.
 The commerce minister, Massoud Mir-Kazemi, defended the giveaway of potatoes by saying that they represented surplus that the government had bought from farmers and distributed before they rotted.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad has been trying to reach out to many different constituencies. He tried to position himself as a defender of human rights on Sunday by urging a fair review of the appeal by the Iranian-American journalist Roxana Saberi. She was accused of spying and sentenced last week to eight years in prison. He appealed to conservatives on Monday, when he lashed out at Israel at a United Nations conference on combating racism, prompting Western diplomats to walk out.
 In another development, Iran announced Wednesday that it welcomed nuclear talks and said it was ready to offer a proposal to resolve the dispute over its uranium enrichment activities, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. Mr. Ahmadinejad said last week that Iran would take part in talks, and Wednesday's statement appeared to be an official response to an April 8 invitation by six major powers for a meeting.

HEADLINE: British Plan to Raise Taxes and Debt Sets Off Political Sparring

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government laid out plans on Wednesday for more than $1 trillion in deficit spending over the next five years, a scale of public debt that critics say is without precedent in Britain, and ordered a 5-percentage-point increase, to 50 percent, in the top marginal rate of income tax for the country's highest earners.
 The government's annual budget statement in the House of Commons offered a new measure of the scale of the financial crisis gripping Britain, which many economists have described as the most severe in any major industrialized country. New figures provided by Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the Exchequer, forecast that the economy would shrink by 3.5 percent this year, the sharpest drop since 1945 and nearly three times the 1.25 percent drop he predicted in November. 
 Mr. Darling forecast a return to modest growth of 1.25 percent next year, an outlook not shared by the International Monetary Fund, whose gloomy estimates on the British economy have included a continuing recession in 2010. But the British finance minister acknowledged that the government was not expecting the years of deficit spending to end before 2018. 
 For this year and next year alone, the government expects a deficit of more than $500 billion at current exchange rates, with overall government debt expanding from 59 percent of gross domestic product this year to 68 percent in 2010 and 79 percent in 2013-14. 
 This would not be exceptionally high by global standards, however. Total federal debt in the United States is projected to rise to around 70 percent of G.D.P. by 2011, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, and Japan's is threatening to exceed 200 percent. 
 Nevertheless, some have warned that if the recession is longer and deeper than the Brown government is predicting, the level of debt could lead to Britain's facing a run on the pound and the possibility of having to turn to the monetary fund for emergency loans, a contingency last resorted to by a Labor government in the 1970s.
 The growing public debt was highlighted in Parliament by David Cameron, leader of the opposition Conservatives, who said the government's borrowing for 2009 and 2010 would exceed all of the borrowing by British governments since the Bank of England was founded in the late 17th century. He said the scale of the debt being taken on would burden British taxpayers for decades. 
 The political sparring over the budget appeared to prefigure the battle lines in a general election that must be held before June 2010. Mr. Cameron, whose Conservatives are far ahead of Labor in opinion polls, described the Brown cabinet as ''a government of the living dead,'' and said it was ''running out of money, moral authority and time.''
 He said that every Labor government since the 1930s had created chaos in the public finances. While Mr. Brown often claimed to have ended the cycle of ''boom and bust'' in Britain's economy while he was chancellor of the Exchequer under Tony Blair, Mr. Cameron said that Mr. Brown had earned his own chapter in British history, one that would be written in red ink. 
 ''As of today, any claim they have ever made to economic competence is dead, over, finished,'' he said of Labor.
 Mr. Darling, presenting the budget, said that Britain was the victim of a worldwide recession and that the government, building ''on the strengths of the British economy and its people,'' would lead the country out of the slump with its deficit spending. He offered a hint of Labor's plans for fighting the election with his announcement of a 50 percent top income tax rate beginning in 2010, up from the current top rate of 40 percent. In last year's budget, Mr. Darling announced an increase to 45 percent that was to have begun in 2011, but the new plan supersedes that. 
 By government calculations, the 50 percent rate, for all those who earn more than $:150,000 a year, about $216,750, will raise about $2.6 billion in additional revenues, a relatively small amount compared with the size of the deficits. To many critics, the new top rate, and other tax increases for high earners, suggested that Labor planned to emphasize its populist traditions and move away from the posture of the Blair years, when ''New Labor'' said it had turned away from its old hostility toward the wealthy.
 When Labor came to power in 1997, it vowed to keep income tax rates at the relatively low rates set during the 18 years of Conservative rule that began with Margaret Thatcher's first election in 1979. Mr. Brown renewed that pledge in the last election in 2005, and those pledges repudiated the pattern of Labor's previous stint in power in the 1970s. Then, a top income tax rate of more than 90 percent contributed to high emigration levels among British professionals. 
 The 50 percent rate would be among the highest in any developed nation, and attracted harsh criticism in London's financial district. Many critics saw the move as a further blow to London's claim in recent years to be a rival to New York as the world's leading financial center.
 The new income tax rate marked ''the final return of old Labor policies attempting to soak the rich,'' said Howard Wheeldon, a senior strategist at BGC Partners in London. 
 The British Chambers of Commerce said the new rate would be a disincentive for financial professionals considering basing themselves in London. 
 ''If the government was serious about the U.K. remaining a global player, they would not be throwing away such an important advantage for a relatively small return,'' said David Frost, the organization's director general.

HEADLINE: Senate Advances Inquiry of Crises

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate signaled a willingness late Wednesday to create a select committee to investigate causes of the nation's financial crises. 
 In an amendment accompanying other legislation on financial fraud, senators agreed in a voice vote to consider creation of a special commission that would delve into the roots of the collapse. 
 The amendment had bipartisan support from Senators Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, and Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, as well as Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and John Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota. In a statement, Senator Dorgan's office said the select committee would have full subpoena power and would not only hear testimony, but make recommendations for reforms to try to prevent future downturns of this type. 
 He and Mr. McCain proposed a select committee more than a month ago in the hope of generating support among colleagues for a broad investigation into the factors on Wall Street that culminated in the financial crises.

HEADLINE: Hope and Caution on Chinese Economy

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Two senior Chinese officials on Wednesday offered differing interpretations on the state of China's economy, one expressing optimism that the country was on the road to recovery, the other warning that it could be bumpy and slow. 
 The comments by a top official of China's central bank and the chief economist of a leading research organization illustrated how hard it is for economists anywhere to reach a consensus on whether China and other leading economies have now put the worst behind them. 
 A string of recent data has made most observers reasonably confident that the pace of decline has at least slowed in the United States and that China's economy is likely to pick up again. China is one of the world's few large economies to avoid outright recession this year, although growth will be well below the double-digit rates before the global financial crisis began. 
 Yi Gang, a vice governor of the People's Bank of China, said in Beijing that a two-year stimulus package of 4 trillion yuan, or $585 billion that was announced in November had helped restore confidence and support a growth rate close to the official target of 8 percent this year. 
 But cautioning that China's recovery was unlikely to be steady and quick, Fan Jianping, chief economist with the State Information Center, cited the impact of the global financial crisis and structural problems in China's domestic economy, Reuters reported. 
 Also on Wednesday, economists at Goldman Sachs raised their forecast for growth this year to 8.3 percent, from 6 percent, the latest in a series of such upgrades. ''In the next three quarters, we expect domestic demand growth to further strengthen, bolstered by loose financial conditions and continued policy stimulus,'' the economists said in the note announcing their revision. 
 The banks' Hong Kong experts now expect the city's economy to shrink 4 percent in 2009, rather than the 6 percent they had forecast. 
 By contrast, Standard Chartered Bank's economists on Wednesday maintained their forecast of 6.8 percent growth for China this year, saying that although major infrastructure spending had helped China's economy to bounce back in March, ''we wonder about the sustainability of this rebound.'' 
 Chinese media reported on Wednesday that China's registered urban jobless rate, the only official measure of unemployment in China, rose to 4.3 percent at the end of the first quarter from 4.2 percent three months earlier. 
 There is also growing caution about the huge rally seen on China's stock market this year. The key Shanghai Composite index has soared 37 percent since the start of 2009, far outpacing other major markets. A report by China Asset Management, the country's largest fund manager, cautioned this week that valuations had ''overshot corporate fundamentals,'' and that ''speculative trading is now driving the market,'' Bloomberg News reported.

HEADLINE: Any Indictment of Interrogation Policy Makers Would Face Several Hurdles

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The release of four Bush administration memorandums approving the use of waterboarding and other harsh interrogation techniques has increased momentum for an investigation into the architects of the program, but the prospect of indicting any of them remains unlikely.
 Steep legal and political hurdles remain to criminal prosecutions of the high-level policy makers, and even lesser punishments -- like disbarment of the lawyers who signed off on the program -- are supported by few precedents, legal specialists say.
 ''Those who want heads to roll are likely to be dissatisfied,'' said Daniel C. Richman, a professor of criminal law at Columbia University. 
 Still, human-rights advocates said they believed the ground had shifted in the last week toward holding a searching look at the interrogation policy. ''A criminal investigation of torture crimes now seems very likely,'' said Christopher E. Anders, senior legislative counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union.
 Whether an investigation would result in criminal trials, however, is another matter. Mr. Richman said prosecutors could easily bring a case against individual interrogators who went beyond the limits of the authorized program or who may have committed a related crime, such as improperly destroying interrogation tapes. 
 But the criminal process is full of choke points that would make it hard for a prosecutor to build a strong case against officials involved in the approved program, he said. 
 For example, were the Justice Department to prosecute the C.I.A. interrogators who carried out the policies -- which President Obama and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. have repeatedly said will not happen -- the interrogators could say that they relied on the Justice Department's advice that the program was legal.
 Efforts to prosecute the high-level Bush administration officials who created and authorized the interrogation program in 2002 -- like Vice President Dick Cheney; the C.I.A. director, George J. Tenet; the defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld; and Alberto R. Gonzales, who was then White House counsel -- also ''would be extremely difficult,'' said Eric Posner, a University of Chicago law professor. 
 It could create a partisan firestorm that Mr. Obama, who has said he wants to concentrate on fixing the economy and on other parts of his agenda, would prefer to avoid for political reasons. And, like the interrogators, the policy makers could argue that government lawyers assured them the program was legal.
 ''The political officials would say they believed what they were doing was lawful, and a jury could very easily believe that,'' Mr. Posner said.
 The shield against prosecution provided by the Bush legal team's assurances has led some critics to focus on the role played by the lawyers themselves, like Mr. Cheney's counsel, David S. Addington; Mr. Rumsfeld's counsel, William J. Haynes II; and the authors of the Justice Department memorandums: John C. Yoo, Jay S. Bybee and Steven G. Bradbury.
 Legal specialists from across the ideological spectrum have criticized those memorandums, especially a set written in 2002 by Mr. Yoo and Mr. Bybee, who is now a federal judge. Some have accused the lawyers of deliberately writing down a false reading of the law to enable policy makers to violate it with impunity.
 But there is little precedent for prosecuting government lawyers who provided arguably bad legal opinions. Moreover, Mr. Yoo, the memorandums' principal author, had espoused idiosyncratic views about presidential power before joining the Justice Department, so it would be difficult to prove that he did not believe what he was writing.
 On Wednesday, three senators -- Republicans John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, along with Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut -- sent a letter to Mr. Obama strongly urging him not to prosecute such lawyers, even though their legal advice was ''deeply flawed,'' the senators said.
 ''Moving in such a direction would have a deeply chilling effect on the ability of lawyers in any administration to provide their client -- the U.S. government -- with their best legal advice,'' they wrote.
 One thing could change that dynamic, however. The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility has been investigating the work of lawyers who signed off on the interrogation policy, and is believed to have obtained archived e-mail messages from the time when the memorandums were being drafted.
 If it turned out that the lawyers initially concluded that aspects of the proposed program would be illegal, then reversed that conclusion at the request of policy makers, then prosecutors could make a case that the officials knowingly broke the law.
 On Wednesday, Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, wrote a letter to Mr. Obama urging him ''not to rule out prosecutions of those who implemented the program'' until the Justice Department's findings -- along with a report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence -- are available.
 Mr. Feingold also reiterated his support for creating a ''truth commission'' with subpoena power to investigate the detention and interrogation program, as did the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California.
 But in their statement, Senators McCain, Graham and Lieberman argued that such a commission would be a distraction from wartime efforts and a mistake.
 Bradford A. Berenson, a White House lawyer in the Bush administration, said he has seen a surge in ''anxiety and anger'' in the last week among his former colleagues. He opposed subjecting them to an investigation, saying that they shaped the program to protect the country in a time of crisis.
 Mr. Obama has said any decision on criminal investigations will be up to Mr. Holder, who told reporters on Wednesday that the department will ''follow the evidence wherever it takes us.'' 
 ''No one is above the law,'' Mr. Holder said. ''So we'll see what happens.''

HEADLINE: In Atlanta, Indications of a Hidden Leonardo

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
IN ATLANTA, INDICATIONS OF A HIDDEN LEONARDO
When the going gets tough, artists hire assistants. They do now, and they did in Renaissance Italy, when the sculptor Andrea del Verrocchio was creating his panel ''Beheading of the Baptist,'' for the silver altar in the Florence Baptistery, now in the Cathedral Museum in Florence. Some assistants, however, turn out to be more famous than others. And in the case of Verrocchio, one of them is thought to have been his student Leonardo da Vinci.
So argues Gary M. Radke, a professor of the humanities at Syracuse University. After carefully studying the panel, which was completed in 1480, Mr. Radke -- who is the guest curator for ''Leonardo da Vinci: Hand of the Genius,'' which opens at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta on Oct. 3 -- asserts that Leonardo created two of the seven figures in the panel.
''In December 2007 I went to the British Museum, where I saw a Leonardo drawing of a warrior,'' Mr. Radke said in a telephone interview. He was reminded of that work when he was in Florence studying the altarpiece, which was being cleaned at a laboratory. The style in which Leonardo drew every detail of the warrior resembled two of the figures in the altarpiece. 
Since all the figures were made separately and inserted into the altarpiece with pins, Mr. Radke was able to examine each individually. Two of them, he discovered, were made in a style distinct from the rest.
''When you turned them over you could see that the artist had followed the same forms on both sides,'' he said. Mr. Radke then ran his theory by some scholars. ''No one has disputed that these two figures are different,'' he explained. ''It's really how to interpret them.''
The contrast between the work of the two artists was striking to Mr. Radke. ''Verrocchio had a talent for observing nature, and these observations were more generalized in his work,'' he said. ''Leonardo, however, wasn't content until every bone and every vein is seen on every figure.'' What Mr. Radke saw when he examined two of the figures -- a youth with a salver (or round plate) and a turbaned officer carrying a baton -- was a different level of detail, making them look far more three-dimensional than the rest.
''They were produced just at the time Leonardo was becoming an independent artist,'' he said.
The panel will be on view in the Atlanta exhibition, and detailed photographs and illustrations will show the differences between the figures. The discovery gives scholars several new historical details. ''It tells us that Leonardo's claim in 1482 that he was proficient as a sculptor as well as a painter is accurate,'' Mr. Radke said. ''It also shows that he kept his association with Verrocchio later than most of us thought.''
HAPPENINGS ON FILM
For so many in the art world Claes Oldenburg's Happenings -- quirky performance pieces that took place around the country in the early 1960s, including in New York, Dallas, Los Angeles and Chicago, in old storefronts, a shack, a university hall or outdoors -- are fairly mythic occurrences, known primarily through scripts, photographs and legends.
''They've been these iconic things, but few people know exactly what they were,'' said Chrissie Iles, a senior curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art. She is one of the curators organizing a show of Mr. Oldenburg's early work. (The exhibition includes ''The Music Room,'' a group of sculptures of musical instruments and related drawings that Mr. Oldenburg created with his collaborator and wife, Coosje van Bruggen, who died in January.)
So when Ms. Iles began working on the show, which opens May 7, she went to meet with the 80-year-old artist in his SoHo studio specifically to discuss films shot at some of the Happenings, an aspect of his early work. ''As we were talking, he suddenly said, 'I have more,' '' Ms. Iles recalled. ''And with that he produced several additional films.''
Using muslin and burlap sets, furniture, costumes, large colored sculptural forms and painted words, they were generally accompanied either by soundtracks or live music, and always performed with artists and friends. ''Injun,'' for example, begins with Mr. Oldenburg, draped in cloth, staggering around a stage to the sound of tom-toms as a young man with a megaphone falls over while a girl pours sawdust on him. And that's just the start.
Ms. Iles has been able to incorporate all of the films into the exhibition. Now, a total of 17, most of which have not been seen since the 1960s, will be shown in the museum's Film and Video Gallery. They will be projected in loops around the walls to create the effect of the museum's own Happening.
''This is a real find because now for the first time scholars will be able to accurately write about them,'' Ms. Iles said. The timing is fortuitous too. ''Performance is the big thing right now, especially with younger artists,'' she added. ''It's the perfect good moment, because they seem so fresh today.''
HEADING TO KOREA
Massimiliano Gioni, 35, the Italian-born director of special exhibitions at the New Museum in New York, has been appointed artistic director of the eighth Gwangju Biennale, which is set for September 2010. One of the first biennials in Asia (it was founded in 1995) and an influential event in itself, it is held in Gwangju, the industrial South Korean city. In the past several biennials have drawn close to a million visitors during their nearly three-month runs.
While he is working on the biennial, Mr. Gioni intends to keep his position at the New Museum, where he is one of the three curators who organized the current Triennial there, ''Younger Than Jesus.'' He also intends to continue his work as artistic director of the Nicola Trussardi Foundation, a nomadic museum in Milan that stages exhibitions in abandoned buildings, public spaces and forgotten monuments around the city.
This won't be Mr. Gioni's first biennial. In 2006 he was a curator of the Berlin Biennial for Contemporary Art along with Maurizio Cattelan and Ali Subotnick. In the case of the Korean event he will be the youngest curator and its first European.
His predecessors in the job include Okwui Enwezor, who organized the 2008 biennial and was also artistic director of several important shows like Documenta XI in 2002, the giant contemporary art exhibition that takes place every five years in Kassel, Germany.
SOTHEBY'S UKRAINIAN ART
With wealthy Russian buyers no longer dropping millions of dollars on art since the economy soured in the fall, Sotheby's is hoping to entice Ukrainian collectors who are willing to shop at a more modest level.
For the first time the auction house will be adding examples of contemporary Ukrainian art to its contemporary Russian art auctionom,&London on June 9. Estimates for the works range from around $3,000 to about $36,000. To promote the sale it will be showing 19 highlights at the Ukrainian House in Kiev on May 20 and 21.
''Some famous artists of the early 20th century came from the Ukraine,'' said Jo Vickery, senior director of Sotheby's Russian department in London. The works, which are mostly figurative canvases, are by artists -- Arsen Savadov, Vassily Tsagolov -- who are well known to this audience. By selling them in London, Sotheby's is hoping to introduce their work to a larger group of collectors.

HEADLINE: On the Gowanus Canal, Fear of Superfund Stigma

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
On a warm Saturday morning, Jose Ilarraza stood by the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn watching two yellow cranes on the other side digging into mountains of scrap metal and dumping it onto a barge.
While Mr. Ilarraza, a 40-year-old school custodian, said he likes to spend time by the canal, fishing for striped bass near its mouth in Gowanus Bay and enjoying ''the nice breeze,'' he never eats his catch.
''There's a lot of garbage,'' said Mr. Ilarraza, a longtime Brooklyn resident. ''You don't need to be a rocket scientist to know that.'' The ''garbage'' in and along the mile-and-a-half-long canal includes pesticides, heavy metals and carcinogens like PCBs from more than a century's worth of industrial activity. This month, the Environmental Protection Agency said that the contamination posed a public health hazard and proposed to add the Gowanus to the National Priorities List of its Superfund program, an effort to investigate and clean up the country's most hazardous waste sites.
Yet the proposal for a comprehensive cleanup, on which the agency is seeking public comment until June 6, is pitting federal and state officials against the Bloomberg administration and neighbor against neighbor. 
City officials and many residents fear that the Superfund label, reserved for the worst contamination in the country and evoking health emergencies like the Love Canal debacle of the 1970s, could deter new development in Gowanus, Carroll Gardens and Red Hook.
City officials said that the listing could jeopardize more than $500 million committed to the waterfront for two private projects involving more than 1,200 housing units.
Experts on contaminated sites said that a Superfund listing typically stirs contradictory emotions. On one hand, some people who live nearby may feel demoralized or frightened by the finding of serious contamination and worry about its impact on real estate values; on the other, some are often relieved to get a firm commitment to clean up the toxic substances in their midst.
''It's very common to have the division between those who see it as terrible and those who see it as an opportunity,'' said Kris Wernstedt, an associate professor of urban affairs and planning at Virginia Tech's Alexandria campus who specializes in Superfund and brownfield issues.
Studies have shown that property values decline after a Superfund listing but rebound after the cleanup, sometimes to far higher levels, he said.
The proposed designation has put Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has championed a greener New York, in the odd position of opposing the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, which requested the Superfund listing for the canal.
City environmental officials say they would welcome a cleanup, but not the stigma of a Superfund designation, which authorizes federal officials to pursue parties responsible for the pollution, and have them pay for the removal of hazards. They object to that process because it can extend the cleanup period into decades.
They also argued that the Superfund designation would give the Environmental Protection Agency veto power over the city's own Gowanus plans, including rezoning 25 blocks of industrial land to allow for residential and commercial development and spending $175 million to diminish odors and prevent sewage discharges that have contributed to the canal's pollution.
''Everything would have to be looked at fresh,'' Daniel Walsh, director of the mayor's Office of Environmental Remediation, said of a Superfund designation. ''There's no way to predict what would happen.''
The mayor has linked economic development and environmentalism in his vision for the city, as he did with his plan to clean up moderately contaminated parcels known as brownfields. (The City Council voted on Wednesday to authorize the brownfields program, which is not linked to the Gowanus dispute.)
But some officials and neighbors who favor the Superfund designation accused Mr. Bloomberg of putting development ahead of the environment in a mayoral election year.
''It'd be nice to point at the housing units the developers would build'' in a mayoral campaign, said Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, a Democrat whose district includes the area and who held a meeting about the Superfund program for local residents last week. ''But with the type of contamination that exists and the offer from the federal government, to say they oppose it and to go with a piecemeal approach is beyond me.''
The city countered that it was seeking faster solutions from the Environmental Protection Agency than the Superfund would provide, like voluntary cleanups by polluters.
''We don't think about development in any capacity without thinking about environmental impact,'' Robert C. Lieber, the deputy mayor for economic development, said in a statement. ''Our chief concern with a Superfund designation is that it would delay a comprehensive cleanup.''
But Environmental Protection Agency officials said that a voluntary approach could allow polluters to evade their obligations. Walter Mugdan, director of the Superfund Division for the New York region, also said that while it was too early to say how long the federal cleanup would take or how much it would cost, he did not expect it to interfere with the city's current plans.
Pete Grannis, the commissioner of the State Department of Environmental Conservation, said his agency had asked for the Superfund listing because the state lacked the resources to clean up the canal.
''Everybody agrees on the need for this cleanup, and the stars are aligned with the E.P.A.'s interest in getting involved,'' he said. ''The faster this is cleaned up, the better it is for any development plans.''
But at least one housing developer, Toll Brothers, has threatened to scrap its building plans if the Superfund designation goes through. Like other real estate companies, it already faces the challenge of a depressed housing market. Ethan Geto, a Toll Brothers spokesman, said a Superfund listing could torpedo its plan for a complex of 460 housing units on three acres by the canal.
''To market residential units at a Superfund site is virtually impossible,'' he said.
The mixed emotions about the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal were evident at the meeting organized by Ms. Velazquez last week. Many residents sided with the city and expressed concern about a drop in property values and the loss of jobs if the planned projects were scuttled.
The main concern for many other residents who were at the hearing, though, is getting rid of the contamination, not what the cleanup is called or the development it could delay.
''If there's any kind of flooding, these contaminants will be in people's backyards and homes,'' said Steven Miller, 47, a filmmaker who lives about 100 yards from the canal, in Carroll Gardens.
''Simply saying there's millions of dollars of private money really is a separate issue than any cleanup of the canal. I'd love to see low-income housing and expensive housing for rich people, but I don't see how that works without a thorough cleanup.''

HEADLINE: Struggle and Rescue, A Duet in Sharps and Minors

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
Some of the lost souls in ''The Soloist,'' a big studio movie about a one-man rescue mission, look as thin as the crack pipes clamped between their lips. These are a few of the ghosts who haunt Los Angeles, that Mecca of Fabulousness where you can go for weeks (and invariably by car) without smelling the reek of other people's desperation. That helps explain why Hollywood types tend not to set their camera sights on homeless men, women and children, unless they're good for a little uplift (as in the Will Smith vehicle ''The Pursuit of Happyness''). Homeless people are generally, pardon the pun, bummers --they also can't afford tickets. 
 Based on a book by the Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez, ''The Soloist'' recounts what happened when one of the city's more privileged denizens (Robert Downey Jr. as the newsman) met one of its least fortunate (Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers). A Juilliard dropout, Mr. Ayers ended up on the streets, where he pushed a shopping cart filled with trash and bedded down next to rats. This isn't a milieu in which you might expect to find the British director Joe Wright, last seen exploring class and other catastrophes in ''Atonement.'' Yet he fits fine with ''The Soloist,'' perhaps because he brings an outsider's perspective to the material or is just accustomed to navigating the divide between the haves and have-nots. 
 Polished to a high gleam by Mr. Wright and written by Susannah Grant (whose credits include ''In Her Shoes''), the film is imperfect, periodically if unsurprisingly sentimental, overly tidy and often very moving. It works hard to make you feel good, as is to be expected, even as it maintains a strong sense of moral indignation that comes close to an assertion of real politics. Outrage would be too much for a mainstream entertainment like this one to manage. Like its muckraking journalist guide, it exploits its subjects for its own purposes. But its commitment to the material feels honest, nowhere more so than in Mr. Downey's darkly shaded, nuanced performance, one that deepens this film with its insistence on the fundamental mysteries of human character.
 It's no surprise when Lopez, taking a break from the newsroom roar, stops to listen to a disheveled man playing a two-stringed violin. In journalistic fashion, wonderment morphs into curiosity and then dogged pursuit as he quickly grasps that he's discovered the makings of a great story. Although Lopez cooks up a column soon after they meet, the full account of how Ayers went from a happy childhood in Cleveland to bright promise in New York and then to his Los Angeles hell emerges through seamlessly interspersed, economical flashbacks. Lightly tinted, as is often customary in movies that return to the past (it's as if happy childhoods were bathed in honey), the flashbacks are pieces of a puzzle that Lopez becomes increasingly hesitant to solve. 
 It is, he discovers, difficult to deal with people in pain. Although they meet cute in the shadow of a looming statue of Beethoven (dedicated to the founder of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra), the journalist and his story don't settle into predictability, largely because Ayers is intrinsically volatile. Given to verbose bursts and abrupt silences, he doesn't so much talk to Lopez (he doesn't always make eye contact either) as just talk and talk, the words pouring out like water until something (rage? fear? chemistry?) stops the flow. Mr. Foxx often seems uncomfortable in his role, wavering between pathos and something harder and truer, but his scatlike delivery of some of Ayers's twisting ropes of words can be mesmerizing. 
 In Los Angeles homeless people are more likely to get sunburns than die freezing in the streets. Because of the city's sprawl and dependence on automobiles, they also tend to be less visible than they are in more geographically compressed urban areas like Manhattan. In 2005, the year Mr. Lopez wrote his first column about Mr. Ayers, an estimated 8,000 to 11,000 were living in a 50-block skid row downtown, not far from the Los Angeles Times building, City Hall and the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Frank Gehry-designed music center that sits on a hill like an enormous silvery flower far from the reach of the Nathaniel Ayerses of this world.
 Over the course of ''The Soloist,'' Lopez helps Ayers reconnect with his music and, in tentative fashion, a more dignified way of living in the world. There are triumphs and setbacks, but these arrive fairly quietly, with none of the 101 weeping strings that often come with stories as emotionally fraught as this one (though Beethoven does shake the speakers). Helping someone off the streets is no small thing, but the story of one man is just that: the story of a single individual, a point that Mr. Wright underscores repeatedly. Again and again the film plunges into the streets, diving into a brackish humanity only to then drift amid the lost and forgotten. In the restrained voice-over that wends through the film, Lopez gives witness to what he has seen.
 ''The Soloist'' wouldn't work half as well without Mr. Downey's astringent, bristly take on a man whose best intentions eventually collide with difficult truths. The actor is a wonder, but he has solid support from Catherine Keener as Lopez's former wife and editor and Nelsan Ellis as a counselor working in the skid row trenches. Both characters exist mostly to push back at Lopez: they wag an occasional finger and dole out tough love and advice. Mr. Wright might be tempted to indulge in lofty symbolism (there are some unfortunately high-flying pigeons), but these three actors, along with the homeless people who worked as extras, help keep him tethered closer to the ground. It's amazing what you can see when you get out of your car and walk: other people, for starters. 
 ''The Soloist'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There's nothing here that a 13-year-old hasn't heard.

HEADLINE: California Sues Wells Fargo Over Securities

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Joining a roster of state lawmen pursuing civil actions against banks, California's attorney general, Jerry Brown, sued three subsidiaries of Wells Fargo on Thursday, claiming the bank had lost some $1.5 billion for investors in the state who bought auction-rate securities. 
 The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco, claims that three Wells Fargo units gave ''false and deceptive advice'' when they marketed the securities to small investors by claiming that they were as safe and liquid as cash. Instead, investors lost money when the market for auction-rate securities collapsed in February 2008. 
 ''More than 2,000 Californian investors who thought they could get their money back when they needed it now can't,'' Mr. Brown said at a news conference. ''What we're seeing today is another example of these complicated financial transactions, so-called financial products that have been part of this massive financial bubble that's burst.''
 In a statement, Charles W. Daggs, the chief executive of Wells Fargo Investments, disputed Mr. Brown's claims, but expressed regret for ''the effects this prolonged liquidity crisis has had on our clients.'' He added that auction-rate securities clients had been given access to loans covering up to 90 percent of their investment. 
 The Securities and Exchange Commission and state regulators have been pursuing banks that sold auction-rate securities, whose rates fluctuated in auctions overseen by the banks, since the market froze last year. In August, for example, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank agreed to buy back some $12.5 billion in auction-rate securities in a deal with the New York attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, who also reached a $7.3 billion settlement with Citigroup.

HEADLINE: A Hotel Deal Gone, Patrons Want a Library Reopened

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
A group of library users and residents of Midtown Manhattan are fuming over what they are calling the inept and heartless handling of the Donnell Library, which was known for its rich holdings of movies, music, foreign language materials and children's books until it closed last year.
 The New York Public Library shut the Donnell branch, which opened in October 1955, last August, as part of a deal announced in November 2007 to sell the building to Orient-Express Hotels Ltd. for $59 million. The five-story building, at 20 West 53rd Street, was to be razed to make way for an 11-story hotel, but a new library branch would occupy space on the first floor and in the basement. The deal fell apart in March, however, with the hotel company backing out, citing the financial and credit crises. 
 Now, there is neither the library nor the money that was supposed to come from the hotel deal. Outraged library patrons have called on the City Council to compel the New York Public Library, a nonprofit organization that gets much of its financing from the city, to reopen Donnell.
 ''This is a tragedy being ignored,'' RitaSue Siegel, who had been using the library since the 1970s and is an organizer of the campaign to reopen Donnell, said in an interview. ''The N.Y.P.L. board must be hammered with tales of their irresponsibility.''
 Another Midtown resident, David J. Schneiderman, a married father of two who regularly used Donnell, said in remarks to a meeting of Community Board 5 on April 16: ''It is a disgrace to eliminate a public library from a neighborhood and, as a result, deprive our youngsters of the benefits associated with a concerned staff that knows and cares for its young patrons. In this age of impersonal communication, we should not allow a bona fide community library to disappear.''
 The City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who attended the meeting, called the closing of Donnell ''a huge blow'' and vowed to investigate what could be done, according to several residents who were present. And Councilman Vincent J. Gentile, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the committee that oversees the city's libraries, also vowed to look into the matter.
 Officials at the New York Public Library have stood their ground, saying the 1955 library was crumbling and in dire need of repairs that the library system could not afford.
 ''Our goal was and is to create a new, state-of-the-art library on the Donnell site, replacing an aging, out-of-date building,'' said Heidi Singer, a spokeswoman for the library system. ''We're now evaluating various alternatives.'' She said the library system hoped that Orient-Express Hotels ''honors its commitment to the library,'' but would not specify whether the library system planned to sue the hotel chain.
 Ms. Singer added in a statement: ''We understand the disappointment of Donnell users at the closure of their library and continue to keep them informed, through Community Board 5, as developments move forward. In the meantime, all of the materials and services offered at Donnell are or will shortly be available at other Midtown locations.''
 Ms. Singer cited a March 31 meeting at which George D. Mihaltses, the library's vice president for government and community affairs, and Teresa Myrhol, a librarian, sought to assuage public concerns. But Ms. Siegel and others who attended that meeting said the library representatives were noncommittal and would not offer specifics.
 Next Wednesday, the New York Public Library plans to formally open a 12,000-square-foot Grand Central branch at 135 East 46th Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues. Ms. Singer called the new branch ''open, inviting and full of light,'' with ''double-high front windows and beautiful, sustainable bamboo cabinetry,'' along with wireless Internet access for laptops and a sizable holding of popular fiction, documentary videos and audio materials.
 She said that Donnell's renowned children's holdings had been moved to the main branch of the library system, now known as the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building, while its musical holdings were transferred to the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.
 But Ms. Siegel said the new branch was hardly a substitute for the 88,000-square-foot Donnell. She and other residents plan to picket the opening of the new branch.

 Museums
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GUSTAVE CAILLEBOTTE: IMPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS FROM PARIS TO THE SEA,' through July 5. Thirty-some years ago, the museum had a big success with a Caillebotte retrospective that more or less introduced American audiences to an artist who was an Impressionist by association rather than by style or temperament. His three best-known pictures, ''The Floor Scrapers,'' ''The Pont de l'Europe'' and ''Paris Street, Rainy Day,'' all grand urban scenes from the late 1870s, are absent from this show, which is a more modest enterprise than a survey, with emphasis falling on less-focused late work. But Caillebotte was a painter as interesting for his weaknesses as for his strengths, and any exposure is valuable. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20090423 
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'HERNAN BAS: WORKS FROM THE RUBELL FAMILY COLLECTION,' through May 24. With a loose, deft touch, this young Miamian paints and draws storytelling images of winsome young men in homoerotically charged situations. He also creates video installations, the best of which involve old films of women in mermaid costumes performing underwater. This disproportionately big and splashy 10-year retrospective was organized by, and first appeared at (in 2007), the Rubell Family Collection, a private museum in Miami where the art collectors Don and Mera Rubell exhibit their holdings. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20090423
 FRICK COLLECTION: 'MASTERPIECES OF EUROPEAN PAINTING FROM THE NORTON SIMON MUSEUM,' through May 10. In a rare exchange that inaugurates a reciprocal loan agreement, five paintings from the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif., have been temporarily installed in the Frick's Oval Room. The Simon paintings, which date from the 16th and 17th centuries, bring a whiff of fresh air into the Frick. None of the artists -- two Spaniards, two Italians and one Flemish master -- are currently represented in its collection. Of special note are Francisco de Zurbaran's ''Still Life With Lemons, Oranges and a Rose'' (1633), which has been freshly cleaned for the occasion, and Guercino's commanding portrait of an Italian count's pet mastiff, ''Aldrovandi Dog'' (1625). 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20090423
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 2009 YEAR OF FASHION, through May 3. Four synergistic shows inaugurate the museum's yearlong focus on fashion photography. Leading off is the snapping, crackling survey ''Weird Beauty: Fashion Photography Now'': a floor-to-ceiling, push-pull installation that clocks the genre as a fast-moving collective expression that is as esoteric as abstract art, and as startling as a sleek, hissing serpent in the drab garden of everyday reality. Stylists, in particular, shine. ''This Is Not a Fashion Photograph'' reveals faces, bodies, garments, poses and style in a century's worth of nonfashion photographs by everyone from Jacob Riis to Malick Sidibe. ''Edward Steichen: In High Fashion, the Conde Nast Years, 1923-1937'' affirms fashion photography's short history by examining in detail how this pioneer more or less invented both fashion photography and celebrity portraiture while working for Vogue and Vanity Fair. ''Munkacsi's Lost Archive'' is less an exhibition than a prelude to one, but it elucidates post-Steichen developments by highlighting Martin Munkacsi, a photographer who set fashion models in motion, further blurring the line between fashion and nonfashion photography. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, www.icp.org. (Roberta Smith)20090423
 JAPAN SOCIETY: 'KRAZY! THE DELIRIOUS WORLD OF ANIME + MANGA + VIDEO GAMES,' through June 14. This show addresses a vibrant chapter in the history of visual storytelling: a specifically Japanese set of approaches that has gained a worldwide following over the past two decades. It will not live up to its promise for devoted followers of Japanese pop culture, but as a multimedia sampler including comics, graphic novels, video games, action figures, animated cartoons and more, it might entice the uninitiated to explore the field more deeply. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)20090423
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'RECLAIMED: PAINTINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JACQUES GOUDSTIKKER,' through Aug. 2. This show of paintings returned to the family of Goudstikker, a prominent Dutch gallery owner who died while fleeing the Nazis, is many exhibitions in one. It's a portrait of an enormously successful art dealer who shaped tastes and markets between the wars. It's a marriage of Northern Baroque and Southern Renaissance painting. Most of all, it's an extraordinary, continuing tale of looting and restitution. At the center of all these stories is a small black notebook, used by Goudstikker to catalog his inventory of some 1,400 works and now on display, in actual and digitized form, at the Jewish Museum. Other highlights include a landscape by Salomon von Jacobsz Ruysdael and a portrait by Rembrandt's pupil Ferdinand Bol. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090423
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART OF THE KOREAN RENAISSANCE, 1400-1600,'through June 21. The Korean gallery at the Met is a trim, tall, well-proportioned box of light. But it's just one room, and a smallish one at that, a reflection of the museum's modest holdings in art from this Asian country. So it's no surprise that the expansive-sounding show is a small thing too, with four dozen objects, most of them -- ceramic jars, lacquered boxes, scroll paintings -- compact enough to be stashed in a closet. But what it lacks in grandeur, it makes up for in fineness, and in rarity.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090423
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'CAST IN BRONZE: FRENCH SCULPTURE FROM RENAISSANCE TO REVOLUTION,'through May 24. Most of the works in this impeccably scholarly exhibition display a cold impersonality, cramped imagination and slavish obeisance to the official culture of their times. But there are compelling exceptions, including small, action-packed sculptures representing episodes in the life of Hercules by Francois Lespingola, and Jean-Antoine Houdon's ''Winter or La Frileuse,'' a heartbreakingly lovely statue of a young woman nude, except for a shawl wrapped around her bowed head and shoulders.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090423
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LIVING LINE: SELECTED INDIAN DRAWINGS FROM THE SUBHASH KAPOOR GIFT,'through Sept. 7. This almost supernaturally beautiful exhibition presents 40 mostly small drawings by Indian miniaturists of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Rendered with amazing skill, the subjects include bearded aristocrats and bejeweled women; hunting scenes; wild animals and mythic beasts fighting; and gods, goddesses and demons ascending and descending. The art of drawing does not get much better than this.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20090423
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,'through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090423
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'WALKER EVANS AND THE PICTURE POSTCARD,'through May 25. This compact exhibition, the first drawn from the museum's extensive Walker Evans archives, unforgettably illuminates Evans's lean, influential documentary style: the picture postcards he collected from age 12 onward, an ultimate collection of 9,000 examples organized by subject. The show includes some 700 arranged in expanses that bring to mind Conceptual Art. Most visually rewarding is a smattering of his photographs, seen beside the postcards he made from them, for an unrealized project with the Museum of Modern Art. He was fearless about cropping, and often made outstanding images even better.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20090423
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'ON THE MONEY: CARTOONS FOR THE NEW YORKER,' through May 24. Go to this exhibition and you will see not only how money is like a cartoon, but also how cartoons shed light on money. In more than 80 drawings, the complexities of economic theory dissolve into the far more pungent currency of social relations, of status and snobbery, pretense and pride, distilling finance to its human essence. Money becomes a chit in the social game, a medium of exchange in a world careering between boom and bust. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Edward Rothstein)20090423
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'THE THAW COLLECTION OF MASTER DRAWINGS: ACQUISITIONS SINCE 2002,' through May 3. The Thaw Collection of Master Drawings, promised to the Morgan Library & Museum, has been introduced to the public in a series of exhibitions since 1975, each reflecting the latest additions by the former art dealer Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare. This installment of 80 recently acquired drawings from the past five centuries is a bit smaller than the last one in 2002-3, though it includes sure-to-please works by Ingres, Gauguin and others. Many selections reflect the Thaws' passion for 19th-century German Romantic art, which may not be for all tastes. The curators make the most of this historically unbalanced group, however, sketching out a pragmatically loose chronology. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. 20090423
 (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'INTO THE SUNSET: PHOTOGRAPHY'S IMAGE OF THE AMERICAN WEST,'through June 8. Almost every one of this resonant exhibition's approximately 150 pictures dating from 1850 to 2008 evokes tension between the myth and the reality of the great American West. Its overall perspective is predictably bleak, but it is loaded with arresting images, from the 19th-century group portrait of the outlaw gang the Wild Bunch in suits and bowler hats, to Irving Penn's glamorizing studio shot of five Hells Angels and their two girlfriends.(212) 708-9400, moma.org.20090423
 (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: THE PROBLEM PERSPECTIVE,'through May 11. The career of the German artist Martin Kippenberger, who died in 1997 at 44, was a brief, bold, foot-to-the-floor episode of driving under the influence. What was he high on? Alcohol, ambition, disobedience, motion, compulsive sociability, history and art in its many forms. But art in its many forms was exactly what he made -- specifically paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, prints, posters, books -- all in madly prolific quantities. In every sense, he took up a lot of space, and he continues to in this first American retrospective, which spills out of top-floor galleries and down into the atrium. Not everything has equal punch. If messy and bad aren't your thing, and pristine objects are, he's not the artist for you. Yet in each work, the model he set for what an artist can be and do shines through.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20090423
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PERFORMANCE 1: TEHCHING HSIEH,'through May 18. This small, gripping exhibition -- the first in a series dedicated to performance art -- centers on the documentation of ''Cage Piece'' (1978-79), the first of five ''One Year Performances'' by the deprivation-prone Taiwanese artist Tehching Hsieh. The piece entailed spending one year doing absolutely nothing in nearly solitary confinement in a cell-like cage, built in the artist's studio. The show includes the cell, as well as daily photographs of the artist that measure the year in the growth of his hair. Few performance pieces communicate the demands of this particular genre in such a basic, resonant way, or its ability to expand our understanding of time and space with such simple force.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090423
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'TANGLED ALPHABETS: LEON FERRARI AND MIRA SCHENDEL,'through June 15. This overly full show mixes together partial accounts of the work of two important South American artists instead of focusing on one. Leon Ferrari (Argentine, born 1920) and Mira Schendel (Brazilian, born in Switzerland, 1919-1988) shared an interest in abstraction contaminated by language, line and modest materials, especially paper and wire. But Ferrari is, at heart, a sardonic, sometimes grandiose Conceptualist whose best works elaborate a maniacal, nonsense calligraphy. Schendel was a purist with a Zen slant, adept at transferring random marks and letters to rice paper, from which she also made ephemeral sculptures. While the show opens a window on a complex history that ran parallel to, not behind, postwar art in the United States, the double survey suggests a failure to commit. Our loss.(212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20090423
 NEUE GALERIE: 'BRUCKE: THE BIRTH OF EXPRESSIONISM IN DRESDEN AND BERLIN, 1905-1913,' through June 29. The original bad boys of 20th-century German art are featured in this visually aggressive show, specifically Erich Heckel, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Max Pechstein and their driven, putative leader, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. Together they revived a rawness of feeling, form and execution that had been largely absent from European art since the Middle Ages, but they also unleashed a palpable Dada swagger before Dada. As their dreams had not yet been trammeled by World War I, theirs was still a fairly cheerful barbarism, based on the belief that they could retrieve what was good and natural in the world if they just took off their clothes, danced around a bit and made art. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Smith)20090423
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'THE GENERATIONAL: YOUNGER THAN JESUS,' through July 5. The latest local survey to challenge the pre-eminence of the Whitney Biennial is big, international in scope and age-specific. As the title implies, only artists 33 or younger were considered for inclusion. The result is a serious, carefully considered show, but one that with a few magnetic entries aside -- a video by Cyprien Galliard; an animation by Wojciech Bakowski; a madcap Ryan Trecartin installation -- feels sedate for a youthfest. Despite the global reach, it's oddly familiar, like a more-substantial-than-average weekend gallery hop in Chelsea and the Lower East Side, right down to token African and Asian imports. Still, there are many intriguing artists to look (and listen) for, among them the filmmakers Keren Cytter and Luke Fowler; the painter Tala Madani; the collagist Haris Epaminonda; the digital whiz-kid Mark Essen; the photographer Elad Lassry; and the multitaskers Ruth Ewan, Ziad Antar, Dineo Seshee Bopape, Liu Chuang, Ahmet Ogut, Guthrie Lonergan, Ciprian Muresan and Icaro Zorbar. There is also, as it happens, a much livelier survey to be found in an accompanying book called ''Younger Than Jesus: Artist Directory,'' which features nearly 500 artists who didn't make the final exhibition cut. A panel discussion led by Brian Sholis with three now older-than-Jesus artists of earlier generations -- Carroll Dunham, Joan Jonas and Mira Schor -- on Saturday at 3 p.m. should be worth hearing. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090423
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through Oct. 5. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20090423
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'JONATHAN HOROWITZ: AND/OR,' through Sept. 14. Andy Warhol's grandchildren, numerous beyond count, have cashed in on his rich and radical legacy to see what further possibilities it might yield. Such is the case with the New York artist Jonathan Horowitz in this smart, crisply edited retrospective. The works evoke the media-saturated art of the 1970s, the neo-Conceptualist consumer art of the 1980s, and the identity art of the 1990s, landing in a Neverneverland era, in which analog is poised to turn to digital, and Doris Day and Paris Hilton have equal currency. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Cotter)20090423
 STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'KALUP LINZY: IF IT DON'T FIT,' through June 28. Kalup Linzy's video work, in which the artist appears in drag and lends his overdubbed voice to almost all the characters, has a complex ancestry. A family tree would have to include the Wayans brothers, RuPaul, John Waters and Eddie Murphy on one branch, and the highbrow canon of dress-up artists, from Cindy Sherman to Yasumasa Morimura, on another. Mr. Linzy's first museum solo includes 22 videos made since 2002, with a total running time of about three hours. It includes his series ''Da Churen,'' his antic reimagining of the popular soap opera ''All My Children''; more recent episodes target the art world and feature Mr. Linzy's newest persona, Katonya the emerging artist. Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20090423
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'JENNY HOLZER: PROTECT PROTECT,'through May 31. After decades of pelting us with unsettling, increasingly relevant portents, Jenny Holzer can say, ''I told you so.'' This 15-year survey proves that her signature LED-sign conflations of poetry, politics, reading and seeing are ever more dazzling; her warnings about the military-commercial-entertainment complex ever more pertinent. In addition, as time has overtaken her, Ms. Holzer has turned from soothsaying to simply reporting the facts. Her latest light works and paintings take their language and motifs entirely from declassified and redacted government documents concerning the war in Iraq. This is a beautiful show, but not a pretty sight.(212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)20090423
 Galleries: Uptown
 FRANZ WEST: 'WORKS FROM THE 1990S'; through May 2. A selection of Mr. West's first plastered paper-pulp sculptures that used color asserts a wonderful formal beauty and inchoate rawness. The pulp is crude -- quasi-digested papier mache you might say -- giving the rich colors an underlying sense of decay. Often mounted on ingeniously improvised pedestals, the shapes evoke recently excavated fragments of some sort. Mr. West emerges here as an heir to Giacometti (both early and late) and Claes Oldenburg's plaster pieces. He borrowed something from each and took it further. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677, zwirnerandwirth.com. (Smith)20090423
 Galleries: Chelsea
 ANDRE ETHIER: 'HEADING SOUTH,' through May 16. Funny, faux-naive paintings by this Toronto artist resemble the works of a semi-talented high school stoner steeped in heavy metal music, fantasy novels and French Symbolism. Mr. Ethier paints on easel-size panels in oleaginous glazes, creating an oozy, fingerpainting-like luminosity. He makes cartoonish portraits of gnomes, cyclops, old hippies and other characters who seem to belong to some ramshackle place like a derelict neighborhood in ''The Hobbit.'' Derek Eller Gallery, 615 West 27th Street, (212) 206-6411, derekeller.com. (Johnson)20090423
 ALFREDO JAAR: 'THE SOUND OF SILENCE,' through May 2. Using human tragedy as an artistic readymade has definite pros and cons, as this carefully orchestrated film installation proves. It centers on an incendiary Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph of a starving Sudanese child, and can leave you feeling moved yet irked, raw yet manipulated. Its immediate subject is the ungovernable life of the photograph, a nanosecond in an arc leading up to and then away from its own creation, a tipping point between its cause and effect. Its larger subject is the inexorable way human suffering causes further suffering. Galerie Lelong, 528 West 26th Street, (212) 315-0470, galerielelong.com. (Smith)20090423
 'PICASSO: MOSQUETEROS,' through June 6. The take-away from this staggering exhibition of around 100 late paintings and prints: in the main, Picasso only got better. Canvases depicting musketeers, entangled lovers and thick-limbed nudes abound. All look fabulous in the naturally lighted, unencumbered spaces -- free of lobbies, text panels and admission charges -- that contribute to the once-in-a-lifetime intensity. The combined effect contradicts generations of received opinion, proving that in his last decade in particular (1962-72) Picasso often achieved an emotional rawness, physical immediacy and joyful pictorial wickedness that was new to his art. His involvement with ceramics and the shorthand speed of glaze paintings undoubtedly contributed, as suggested by two paintings on tiles in the show. Like the 1908 masterpiece ''Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' these works turn painting inside out. If they have not similarly changed the course of art history, give them time. First they deserve their due. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street, (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com. (Smith)20090423
 GAVIN TURK: 'JAZZZ,' through May 2. A nonexpert could mistake the paintings in this show for vintage Jackson Pollocks. Mr. Turk made them by repeatedly dripping his own signature on canvases up to 23 feet wide. They're clever meditations on identity and authorship, as is a film in which the artist imitates a famous 18th-century chess-playing automaton known as ''the Mechanical Turk.'' Sean Kelly Gallery, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, skny.com. (Johnson)20090423
 Galleries: SoHo
 LAURIE ANDERSON: 'FROM THE AIR: TWO INSTALLATIONS,' through May 2. Ms. Anderson, the artist and cross-over pop star, here presents two modest works. An audio piece has a high-tech overhead speaker projecting quiet sounds and poetic fragments of speech in such a way that it seems as if they were inside your head. The other piece is in the form of a miniature video projection in which Ms. Anderson tells a story about vultures menacing her little dog in the mountains of Northern California.

 UNICA ZURN: 'DARK SPRING,' through July 23. A fiction writer and poet, Zurn (1916-1970) suffered a series of mental breakdowns during the last decade of her life, and it was during that time that she produced most of the playfully improvised, sometimes hallucinatory nightmarish drawings in this fascinating show. Wandering, loopy lines enfold intricate patterns of dots, petals and serpentine stripes punctuated by eyes, faces, birds, fish, snakes and flowers. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Johnson)20090423
 Galleries: Other
 'NOBLE TOMBS AT MAWANGDUI: ART AND LIFE IN THE CHANGSHA KINGDOM, THIRD CENTURY B.C.E. TO FIRST CENTURY C.E.,' through June 7. In the early 1970s three tombs were discovered in southeastern China. Because they had never been plundered and because of the unusually well-preserved state of their contents, the discovery caused a worldwide sensation in archaeological circles. This show presents about 70 of more than 3,000 objects that were excavated, including fabric samples, lacquer ware, lamps, grooming tools and wooden figurines. China Institute, 125 East 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-8181, chinainstitute.org. (Johnson)20090423
 Out of Town
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: 'DIRT ON DELIGHT: IMPULSES THAT FORM CLAY,' through June 21. Ignoring the art-craft divide, this bold show examines ceramics in its own right. With George Ohr as Jackson Pollock, it ranges from postwar greats like Peter Voulkos and Ken Price, to younger eminences like Adrian Saxe and Arlene Shechet, to new arrivals like Sterling Ruby, Jessica Jackson Hutchins and Jeffry Mitchell. The clash of approaches to beauty, technique, scale, color and finish is exuberantly edifying. It foments hope that the Minimal-Conceptual-Relational art religion (important as it is) could wither away, and curators of contemporary art could regain full use of their eyes and thus their brains. 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Smith)20090423
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHEPARD FAIREY: SUPPLY AND DEMAND,' through Aug. 16. The surprise of the first museum retrospective for the creator of the Obama Hope poster is that almost everything he does, from abstracted images of Andre the Giant to his album covers for Led Zeppelin and other bands, is visually arresting. But in tracking his 20-year evolution from aesthetic anarchist to savvy, all-purpose designer and illustrator, the exhibition inadvertently casts doubt on his authenticity as a radical street artist. 100 Northern Avenue, Boston, (617) 478-3100, icaboston.org. (Johnson)20090423
 ZOE LEONARD, through Sept. 7. Always an exceptionally moving artist, though only sporadically visible, Zoe Leonard has an exhibition at Dia:Beacon, an hour and a half north of the city. It is different from some of her earlier shows: cooler and less intimate, documentary in form, broadly social in scope. At the same time, it shares a sensibility with what has come before, one attuned to realities of constant change, which as often as not means loss. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diaart.org. (Cotter)20090423
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'PRIDE OF PLACE: DUTCH CITYSCAPES OF THE GOLDEN AGE,' through May 3. There is nothing like a beautiful city, and there are several, lovingly painted, in this quiet, gorgeous exhibition. The display of 48 paintings, 22 maps and assorted atlases and printed books includes works by Jan van Goyen, Gerrit Berckheyde, Jan van der Heyden, Jacob van Ruisdael and other preternaturally skillful painters of intensely realistic yet idyllic images of cities and towns viewed from far and near. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)20090423
 NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN ART, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION: 'MAMI WATA: ARTS FOR WATER SPIRITS IN AFRICA AND ITS DIASPORAS,' through July 26. Mami Wata is Mother Water, Mother of Fish, goddess of oceans, rivers and pools, with sources in West and Central Africa and tributaries throughout the African Americas, from Bahia to Brooklyn. Usually shown as a half-woman, half-fish, she slips with ease between incompatible elements: water and air, tradition and modernity, this life and the next. Provider of riches, she is the natural bailout savior for our time, and this exhibition, organized by the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in Los Angeles, presents her in all her shape-shifting glory. The show's creator, Henry John Drewal, has compressed three decades of Mami watching into vivid visual form; the Washington curator, Christine Mullen Kreamer, has devised a fantastic, subaqueous showcase for a powerhouse spiritual diva. 950 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, (202) 633-4600, africa.si.edu. (Cotter)20090423
 Last Chance
 DAVIDE BALULA: 'AMERICAN WALL NUT'; closes on Friday. Fake Estate, opened by Julia Trotta in 2007, may not be the smallest gallery in town, but it certainly is minute, being confined to a former utility closet in a building that houses other galleries of regulation size. And the young French artist Davide Balula makes good use of these dimensions in a solo show that consists of a single, succinct visual gesture questioning the solidity of architecture, the stability of our sense of space and the absurdity of the concept of real estate. Fake Estate, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 502A, (917) 499-9005, fakeestate.us. (Cotter)20090423
 'CHARLES BURCHFIELD 1920: THE ARCHITECTURE OF PAINTING'; closes on Saturday. The watercolors in this show, organized in conjunction with the Columbus Museum of Art in Ohio and the Burchfield Penney Art Center in Buffalo, were painted after Burchfield returned from military service in the South to his hometown, Salem, Ohio. Executed in a pared-down style and the dourest of palettes, they simplify the lines of Rust Belt townscapes without smoothing over the harshness of life in these areas. More important, they prove that American artists could embrace modernism, that European import, without losing a sense of place. D C Moore Gallery, 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 247-2111, dcmooregallery.com. (Rosenberg)20090423
 JAMES CASTLE: 'DRAWINGS: VISION AND TOUCH'; closes on Saturday. His atmospheric, extravagantly tonal soot drawings make Castle (1899-1977) something like the Vuillard of the American West, as well as one of the greatest outsider artists of the 20th century. These 34 landscapes, farmyards and interiors have never been exhibited. They picture the world of Castle's childhood and reflect an acute visual intelligence and an instinctive grasp of space, both of which were undoubtedly sharpened by the artist's deafness. They are lonely, silent, but immensely tender images. Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com. (Smith)20090423
 JAMES HYDE: 'UNBUILT'; closes on Sunday. After his influential investigations of paintings as objects of some bulk, Mr. Hyde returns to flatness. Now structure is provided by digital photographs -- all taken by the artist and often printed quite large -- of half-built structures, construction sites, clouds, trees, close-ups of the human hand and a single flower. Appended with strips of tape, painted shapes and bits of painted wood or Styrofoam, these works function like drawings. They show how Mr. Hyde thinks and what he looks at, something of his working process, and above all his desire to avoid ruts. Southfirst, 60 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-4884, southfirst.org. (Smith)20090423
 VERA ILIATOVA: 'CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR'; closes on Saturday. Ms. Iliatova's second solo show intrigues without satisfying. She paints a world inhabited only by teenage girls loitering in groups among trees or on the shores of lakes, rivers or the Gowanus Canal, occasionally in buildings or among ruins. These structures can be vintage, industrial or Modernist and also form distant urban backgrounds. The colors and quasi-academic rendering evoke American Social Realism; the show's fanciful news release, written by the artist Kevin Zucker, cites Cezanne, Morandi and Fairfield Porter, which also works, given the soft light, fractured skies and stop-and-start paint-handling. These scenes suffer from visual anemia and brittleness, but they are strange and intentional enough to rouse interest in what comes next. Monya Rowe Gallery, 504 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5065, monyarowegallery.com. (Smith)20090423
 KINKE KOOI: 'LET ME COMFORT YOU'; closes on Saturday. With a meticulously refined and voluptuously sensuous touch and mischievous humor, this Dutch artist draws fantastic, densely patterned, erotically suggestive pictures that resemble collaborations between Hans Bellmer and a painter of classical Indian miniatures. Her works relate to a kind of psychedelic doodling that has been popular in the past decade or so, but they have their own surrealistic vibe. Feature Inc., 276 Bowery, near Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 675-7772, featureinc.com. 20090423
 (Johnson)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'RAPHAEL TO RENOIR: DRAWINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF JEAN BONNA';closes on Sunday. Candy box displays like this show of 120 European drawings are natural crowd pleasers, and for obvious reasons. They're very much about comparison shopping and personal taste. Relax and browse is their operative mode. And if they are confections, their flavor has range and intensities, from soft-center sugary to dense bittersweet. History is here if you want to find it, but if you don't, that's O.K. Enjoy.(212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090423
 QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'QUEENS INTERNATIONAL 4'; closes on Sunday. It says a lot about New York cosmopolitanism that one of its museums can present an International and still restrict its selection to artists living and working in one borough. The fourth edition of this biennial Queens survey includes participants with direct or second-generation roots in China, Czechoslovakia, England, Greece, India, Iran, Israel, Japan and South Korea, as well as in several countries in Central America and the Caribbean. Yet there is little sense of this being an ''identity'' show of the kind we were accustomed to a decade ago. Some works suggest the many options artists are now pursuing: carved marble versions of consumer throwaways by Lars Fisk; Tommy Hartung's video about a fictional explorer; and an installation by Las Hermanas Iglesias -- two sisters, Janelle and Lisa Iglesias -- providing dance instructions for a new music combining merengue and Norwegian polkas. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)20090423
 DANA SCHUTZ: 'MISSING PICTURES'; closes on Saturday. This young painter deserves credit for refusing to repeat herself. She continues to push forward in her ambitious exploration of color, technique and history, both political and painterly. Nonetheless, this is a transitional show. The large paintings in particular seem a bit too crowded with incident and figures; the paint handling, while knowing in its commingling of impasto and wispy Color Fieldy stains, is self-conscious. Ms. Schutz's paintings keep a lot of singular balls in the air at one time. It should not surprise that her juggling isn't perfect. Zach Feuer Gallery, 530 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7700, zachfeuer.com. (Smith) 20090423
 RICHARD TUTTLE: 'WALKING ON AIR'; closes on Saturday. Mr. Tuttle's new fusions of painting and sculpture are a joy to behold. All 12 pieces have the same basic structure: two narrow, horizontal lengths of fabric, one above and slightly overlapping the other, are fitted with grommets by which they hang from projecting finishing nails. Tie-dyed colors and textures nostalgically evoke hippie consciousness, and the marriage of the material and the immaterial is at once austere and seductive. Pace Wildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-7000, pacewildenstein.com. (Johnson)20090423
 HAEJIN YOON/ ELENA WEN; closes on Sunday. New talent crops up in all sorts of places, including venerated but lately somnambulant showcases like A.I.R., probably the first artist-run cooperative for women in the world. Ms. Yoon fills two large rooms in the gallery's new Brooklyn space with high-voltage paintings, drawings, installations and sewn sculptures that riff so effortless on ''naive'' conventions and styles as to seem almost facetious. Equally promising is Elena Wen, whose hand-drawn animation vignettes follow various figures and creatures through space to one symbolic or psychological point or another, not unlike New Yorker cartoons in motion. A.I.R. Gallery, 111 Front Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (212) 255-6651, airgallery.org. (Smith)20090423

HEADLINE: Amazon Posts Profit Gains As Offline Rivals Struggle

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
Amazon.com has joined Apple among the ranks of technology firms that are still growing robustly despite a shrinking economy.
 Amazon, the online retailer based in Seattle, posted stronger-than-expected earnings during the slow winter months, attracting cost-conscious consumers with offers of free shipping and competitive prices for its wide variety of products. 
 Amazon's net profit rose 24 percent, to $177 million, or 41 cents a share, in the quarter ending March 31, up from $143 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. 
 The company's first-quarter revenue climbed 18 percent, to $4.89 billion, slightly surpassing Wall Street's expectations. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average had expected $4.76 billion in revenue.
 Some analysts say Amazon has benefited from the downturn, with struggles at the Borders book chain, the bankruptcy of Circuit City and turbulence at a rival, eBay, all driving traffic to Amazon.com. The company said its electronics and general merchandise sales were up 38 percent, while media sales rose 7 percent.
 ''Brick-and-mortar companies are going bankrupt and going out of business altogether and that is helping Amazon gain market share,'' said Imran Khan, an analyst at JPMorgan.
 Amazon shares rose up to 3 percent in after-hours trading. In the last three months, Amazon's characteristically volatile stock price has jumped more than 40 percent as investors applauded market share gains, the introduction of the second version of the Kindle electronic book reader and new efficiencies in the company's distribution system.
 Wall Street has been looking particularly closely at sales of the new Kindle. Amazon released no new sales numbers, but Mr. Khan estimated that the company could sell more than half a million units this year and generate more than $96 million in revenue from the sale of digital books and other media for the stand-alone device and other mobile devices like the iPhone and iPod Touch. 
 Jeffrey P. Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, said Kindle sales had ''exceeded our most optimistic expectations.'' 
 ISuppli, a research firm, recently estimated that the Kindle cost about $185 to produce, giving the $359 device a high profit margin. In a conference call with journalists, Amazon's chief financial officer, Thomas J. Szkutak, disputed the estimate and said the production cost was significantly higher than that.
 Amazon issued what Wall Street considered conservative guidance for the second quarter. It said that it expected revenue to rise 6 to 17 percent over the same quarter of last year but that operating income could fall as much as 49 percent.

HEADLINE: More States Resort to Furloughs, Even as Need for Services Grows

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Licenses for same-sex marriages were supposed be issued in Iowa starting this Friday. But because of a crimped state budget, court employees will be on mandatory furlough that day and the courts will be closed. Gay couples cannot start filing for their licenses until Monday. 
 As they try to cope with gaping budget deficits, at least 15 states from every region -- like Alabama and Georgia in the South; Arizona, California and Washington in the West; and Massachusetts, New Hampshire and New York in the Northeast -- are in various stages of considering or carrying out furloughs. 
 ''This may very well be the most widespread use, or consideration of use, at least since the emergence of the post-World War II economic boom,'' Robert Bruno, professor of labor relations at the University of Illinois, Chicago, said of furloughs. 
 But furloughs can be a problem for states in a way they may not be for a private company where demand for a product has dropped. Government services remain in even greater demand in a weak economy. Furloughs often mean fewer workers handling a larger load. For instance, there are already signs of disability claims piling up in seven states. 
 ''The word 'furlough' sounds nice and fluffy, like, 'This isn't painful, we aren't doing layoffs,' '' said Hetty Rosenstein, director of the largest state-worker union in New Jersey. There, an appeals court last week upheld a plan to make state workers take two furlough days by June 30, the end of the fiscal year, and 12 more in the next fiscal year. 
 ''But,'' Ms. Rosenstein added, ''furloughs are fundamentally a cut in pay. And furloughs are a cut in service. If you don't have people working, the work isn't going to magically get done.''
 The longest state furloughs so far appear to be 24 days in Alabama, the same number that had been proposed in Minnesota.
 Private companies, too, are increasingly turning to furloughs as they try to ride out the recession. A Watson Wyatt survey released this week found that 17 percent of 141 companies surveyed had imposed furloughs in April, up from 11 percent in February.
 Furloughs of public employees can affect critical services like police and fire protection, prison guard duty and hospital care. Unions in Minnesota say that proposed furloughs there would have cost more than they would have saved, due in part to lost services. 
 For the most part, it is too soon to judge the impact of furloughs on the delivery of public services. But there are early signs of a ripple effect.
 One stark example is at the Social Security Administration, a program paid for by the federal government but administered by state workers. Officials said this month that in seven states, 2,700 of those workers had been furloughed, further delaying the processing of tens of thousands of disability claims, which already take an average of 488 days to resolve.
 Services in several California counties were already curbed because of layoffs before the state instituted furloughs for the first time in its history in February, when it ordered 90 percent of its 238,000 employees to take off two days of unpaid leave per month. 
 Now, for example, at the Orange County Social Services Agency, Herman Martinez, an eligibility specialist and president of the local unit of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said the agency could not keep up with applications for public assistance, which have only grown in the economic downturn. ''It's a whole can of worms for us to try to service the most needy and vulnerable clients,'' Mr. Martinez said. 
 In Iowa, furloughs have delayed the start of same-sex marriages by only one business day but they have also reduced the time that the public has access to the courts. All courts are closed every other Friday through June, which means clerks are falling behind in their caseloads. To help them make up for lost time, their offices are closed to the public early on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
 ''That gives them an opportunity to catch up with paperwork,'' said Steve Davis, a spokesman for the state's Supreme Court, ''but it further limits access of the public to the court.''
 Furloughs allow companies and agencies to keep valued employees, are easier and faster to start than layoffs and are not as demoralizing, analysts say. Workers often accept them because they are presented as the only alternative to layoffs, and in some cases, they have no choice. 
 In New Jersey, the state worker unions are angry that they did not have the chance to negotiate the state's cost-savings package, which was imposed unilaterally, as it was in California. In New York, Gov. David A. Paterson has said that if the state employee unions do not agree to concessions, he will lay off about 9,000 of the state's 200,000 workers.
 ''Conditions have gotten so hard that employees who would have been less inclined to accept furloughs have a sense that there's a permanent economic restructuring going on, something deeper and more lasting, and that means employees have fewer options,'' said Mr. Bruno, the labor relations professor. ''The power has shifted to the employer, and employees are more desperate.'' 
 While employees often worry that furloughs will not actually prevent layoffs, some have been able to negotiate better job security. State union leaders in Connecticut have tentatively agreed to unpaid furloughs as part of a package that would guarantee no layoffs for two years. 
 Utah has found an alternative to furloughs, one already used by many city and county governments. Utah's state workers have been on a mandatory four-day workweek since August in a program started as a way to try to reduce energy costs. Salaries have not been cut because offices are open an hour earlier and close an hour later.
 ''We're just repacking how we do the 40 hours,'' said Jeff Herring, Utah's executive director of human resources. 
 But Mr. Herring said the move had reduced costs in many ways: overtime payments and absenteeism are down, for example, and online services have been expanded, which has cut the waiting time at places like the Division of Motor Vehicles. Employee morale is up, internal surveys say, but the energy savings have not been as great as anticipated.
 President Obama's economic stimulus package could eventually relieve some of the pressure on state budgets. But for now, states are relying more on furloughs, though their long-term value is still being assessed.
 ''Furloughs can save you money and help you avoid layoffs, at least initially,'' said Alan Ehrenhalt, editor of Governing magazine. ''But employees do lose income, services are disrupted, and it turns out you can't really close all the things on Friday you thought you could.
 ''So the savings aren't as great. And you're not solving any long-term problem.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 27, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about states that have considered furloughs or have imposed them on their employees misstated the status of such action in Alabama. Furloughs there have been blocked by a legislative committee; they have not gone into effect.

HEADLINE: Foundation Of The Times Suspends Gift Program

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The New York Times Company Foundation announced on Thursday that it was suspending grant-making and the company's matching gift program. 
 ''The economy and the secular changes in our industry are causing everyone to rigorously manage costs, and unfortunately, this is a difficult but necessary step,'' said Michael Golden, vice chairman of the company and a board member of the foundation. 
 The announcement came two days after the company said it had lost $74.5 million in the first quarter of 2009.
 Together with its subsidiary, the Boston Globe Foundation, the Times Company Foundation made roughly $7 million in grants last year to programs dedicated to journalism, education, culture, the environment and public service. 
 The Times College Scholarship program will continue, though in a smaller format, and all students currently in the program as well as those in the Globe Scholars program will continue as normal. The New York Times Neediest Cases campaign and the Globe Santa program will not be affected by the changes. The Times joins dozens of other corporations that have shrunk or eliminated their giving and matching gift programs over the last year.
 Jack Rosenthal, the foundation's president, will continue through the expiration of his contract at the end of the year. ''It's a shame that we lose the leadership position we have achieved,'' Mr. Rosenthal said. ''On the other hand, it would be pretty inconceivable for The Times to be giving money away when it is cutting costs.''
 The Times Company Foundation used its grants to try to attract much larger public financing for various initiatives. 
 A fund it created with $1 million to pay for medical treatment for needy families raised an additional $5 million from other donors and has provided treatment to date for some 1,200 families, while a pilot program to use art to enhance learning, currently operating in two New York City schools, attracted $937,000 from the federal Department of Education. 
 ''This is really tragic,'' Jeanne B. Mullgrav, commissioner of the New York City Department of Youth and Community Development, wrote in an e-mail message to Mr. Rosenthal. ''You and your organization have been such a great partner to the city, the nonprofit sector and to the communities who need support.''

HEADLINE: Plight of Carmakers Could Upset All Pension Plans

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Decisions that the government will make soon on the future of General Motors and Chrysler could accelerate the decline of traditional pension plans, which have sheltered generations of workers from an impoverished old age. 
 Pension experts predict that a government takeover of the two giant plans would spur other auto companies and all types of manufacturers to abandon such benefits for competitive reasons. 
 For hundreds of thousands of retired auto workers, a federal pension takeover would mean sharply reduced benefits. For the federal agency that insures pensions, it would mean a logistical nightmare in the short term -- and most likely a slow demise eventually as fewer and fewer small plans remain in the system and pay premiums.
 So far, the prospect of a grueling grind through bankruptcy court has been a major deterrent to companies that might want to rid themselves of pension obligations. But retirement and labor specialists are watching closely to see whether the administration's auto task force will give either of the auto companies an easier way to shed their huge pension funds, blazing a simplified trail for others to follow. 
 With or without a bankruptcy filing, the government is quietly making the preparations that would be needed to take over Chrysler's pension plan, with its 255,000 participants, according to government officials. 
 Even if Chrysler manages to strike a deal to sell many of its assets to Fiat, perhaps in conjunction with a bankruptcy filing, experts doubt Fiat will agree to take on its pension plan without extraordinary assistance. One possibility being considered is a cash infusion of $1 billion from Daimler, which previously owned Chrysler and had agreed to backstop a pension failure for several years.
 The future of General Motors' pension plan is also unclear. G.M. has until June 1 to come up with an acceptable business plan. If it declares bankruptcy, it still may try to keep its pension plan afloat. G.M.'s plan for hourly workers, which covers 485,000 people, was in reasonably good shape until last fall's market turmoil, and would not require cash contributions until 2013. 
 If one or both of these plans collapse, the federal agency that insures pension benefits, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, will lose a big source of the premium revenue it collects from companies with pension funds. But more important, the demise of the bellwether auto plans might set a template for other companies seeking to cut costs and stay competitive. 
 ''If one of these companies solves its pension problem by shunting it off to the federal government, then for competitive reasons the others have to do the same thing,'' said Zvi Bodie, a professor of finance at the Boston University School of Management and longtime observer of the government's pension insurance system. ''That is the death spiral.''
 Though the automakers' plans each have a gap between what they have on hand and what they owe their retirees over the years, if they failed, most of that shortfall would be made up by workers in the form of smaller benefits -- not by the companies or the government. 
 The government estimated that Chrysler's plan was $9.3 billion short as of last November -- but said it would be responsible for only about $2 billion of that. Most of the shortfall would be sliced from workers' benefits. At G.M., the estimated shortfall was $20 billion as of last November, but the government would assume $4 billion of obligations and G.M.'s workers would lose the rest. 
 When Daimler sold a majority stake in Chrysler in 2007 to a private equity firm, Cerberus, it promised to pay $1 billion into the government's pension insurance program if the pension plan failed within five years. The Treasury could try to persuade Daimler to put some of that money into the plan to avoid a failure. 
 For years, traditional pensions -- those that shield workers from market risk -- have been in a slow decline, with troubled sectors like aviation and steel shedding their plans in bankruptcy court as new types of individually managed benefits like 401(k) plans have taken hold. 
 But big sectors, particularly manufacturing and financial services, have clung to the old plans. The Pension Rights Center, a consumer group in Washington, estimates that 18 million Americans are still building up such benefits every year, and millions more retirees are receiving guaranteed payments from their former employers.
 ''Those that are fortunate enough to have those plans are sleeping soundly,'' said Karen Ferguson, director of the center.
 The loss of the auto pensions would be devastating partly because Detroit sustains many other businesses and partly because of their history. It was the United Automobile Workers union, more than any other force, that pushed Congress to enact laws forcing companies to put money behind their pension promises and creating the federal guarantor. The failure of a major auto workers plan would be a blow to the whole system. 
 Not only would Ford have reason to opt out of the expense of maintaining a pension plan, but so would Toyota and Honda, which also have pension plans at their American plants, said Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research and former member of the P.B.G.C.'s advisory board.
 Professor Ghilarducci said she believed the Obama White House had selected people for its auto task force who understood these stakes, and would strive to find some middle ground. 
 The pension insurance agency, currently operating with an $11 billion deficit, has long viewed the automakers' plans with anxiety, though its officials declined to discuss the situation. G.M.'s plan alone is bigger than the guarantor. The agency has roughly $67 billion in assets to cover the benefits of nearly 4,000 failed pension plans; G.M. has $84 billion in trust just to cover promises to its own workers.
 In a failure of that size, the agency's immediate challenge would be logistical, not financial. Its insurance covers a simple benefit, not the much richer pensions negotiated over the years by the U.A.W. It would have to process applications from thousands and thousands of workers, most of whom would get the bad news that they were going to get less than promised. 
 The government's maximum benefit is $42,660, but coverage falls off rapidly for workers who are younger when their plan fails. For a 55-year-old, the maximum is only $24,300. 
 Calculating which workers would bear how much of the losses would be fiendishly complex. The government's rules favor older participants and contain tripwires and arbitrary cutoffs that can leave similar workers with sharply different benefits. 
 None of this can be sorted out in advance, because the calculations also depend on the amount of money in a pension fund on the day it terminates -- something the pension benefits corporation does not yet know. 
 Some pension specialists, aware of these difficulties, are hoping the Obama administration's auto task force will spare at least the G.M. pension fund. Not only would that let laid off workers keep receiving full benefits, but it could also break the death spiral among other plans. 
 For traditional pension plans, ''maybe this is their last stand,'' said Jeffrey B. Cohen, a partner with the law firm Ivins, Phillips & Barker in Washington who was chief counsel for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation from 2005 to 2007. If the automakers' plans fail, he added, ''the biggest domino will have fallen for the P.B.G.C.''

CORRECTION-DATE: April 25, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the implications of possible pension plan failures at General Motors and Chrysler misstated the maximum benefit guarantee under the federal government's pension insurance program. The maximum is $54,000, for a person who is 65 or older when a company pension plan fails -- not $42,660, which is the maximum for a person who is 62.

HEADLINE: Yanks In Crisis

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
We're in the middle of the biggest crisis of capitalism in 70 years. We've got a new administration in Washington active on every front. What's all this done to the public mind?
 A poll to be released today by The National Journal and Allstate gives a pretty good view. As you'd expect, there's a lot of economic anxiety in the country, spanning every income category. Sixty-four percent of Americans believe there are more risks that endanger their standards of living today than in their parents' time. On the other hand, there's still some sense of opportunity. Forty-two percent believe there are more opportunities to move up than a generation ago, compared with 29 percent who think there are fewer.
 In short, there's a feeling of greater volatility, both up and down. People don't seem to feel as if they are sliding into a hole, but neither do they feel secure. 
 So whom do they turn to in times like these? Themselves. Americans have always felt that they are masters of their own fate. Decade after decade, Americans stand out from others in their belief that their own individual actions determine how they fare. That conviction has been utterly unshaken by the global crisis. In question after question, large majorities say their own actions will determine how much they will make, how well they will endure the recession, how healthy they will be and so on.
 The crisis has not sent Americans running to government for relief. Nor has it led to a populist surge in anti-business sentiment. In a recent Gallup poll, 55 percent of Americans said that big government is the biggest threat to the country. Only 32 percent said big business. Those answers are near historical norms.
 Americans have always been skeptical of activist government, and that skepticism remains. When Gallup asked specifically about the current crisis, 44 percent of Americans said they disapprove of an expanded role for government during the crisis; 39 percent said they approve of an expanded role but want it reduced when the crisis is over; and only 13 percent want to see a permanently expanded role for government.
 When asked by the National Journal group more specifically where good ideas and financial solutions come from, 40 percent said corporate America and 40 percent said government. When asked what could best enhance income security, half of all Americans said it was a matter of individual responsibility, 19 percent said government regulations like increasing the minimum wage were most effective and 15 percent said government programs.
 The area where the National Journal poll found the most desire for government activism is health care. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that while there is less support for a health care overhaul than there was in 1993, the public still wants reform that at least improves the current system.
 My friend Ron Brownstein of The National Journal looks at the data and concludes that while Americans are still skeptical of government, they are open to rethinking what the social safety net should look like in the 21st century. I look at the data and conclude that the tumult has not significantly changed the way Americans look at government, corporations or the social contract. Americans are open to good ideas from government, as always, but they are still skeptical and fiercely self-sufficient. The economic crisis has produced a desire for change but not a philosophical shift.
 The big lesson for the Obama administration is that the American people will continue to support its agenda as long as they think it is competent. It was not automatic that an administration led by a 47-year-old man with little Washington experience would run a professional, smoothly functioning operation. Yet he has. The administration has unveiled a dazzling array of proposals with a high degree of efficiency and managerial skill. This has inspired confidence in his team, if not in the government as a whole.
 If that aura of nonideological competence fades, however, support for the agenda will crater. There is little philosophical backing for a government as activist as the one Obama is proposing. Middle-class voters are not willing to hand over higher taxes in exchange for more federal services. The public is significantly to Obama's right on economic matters and needs constant evidence that he is not trespassing on personal freedom and individual responsibility. 
 For Republicans, the message is that all is not hopeless. Swing voters have temporarily rejected the party, but not the Weltanschauung. After this crisis is over, they still want a return to normalcy, with balanced budgets and a limited state. Americans still want to see power dispersed among a diversity of institutions, not concentrated in the hands of supertechnocrats in Washington.
 The Great Depression altered the national consciousness. So far, the Great Recession has not.

HEADLINE: U.S. Jobless Claims Rise More Than Expected

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
New jobless claims rose more than expected last week, while the number of workers continuing to file claims for unemployment benefits topped 6.1 million, according to a Labor Department report Thursday. 
 Both figures are fresh evidence that layoffs persist and the job market remains weak.
 The Labor Department says initial claims for unemployment compensation rose to a seasonally adjusted 640,000, up from a revised 613,000 the previous week. That was slightly above analysts' expectations of 635,000.
 Economists are closely watching the unemployment compensation data because they believe a sustained decline in the number of initial claims could signal the end of the recession is nearing. Jobless claims have historically peaked six to 10 weeks before recessions end, according to a report by Goldman Sachs. Initial claims reflect the level of job cuts by employers.
 But the latest report shows job losses remain high. The four-week average of claims, which smoothes out volatility, dropped slightly to 646,750, about 12,000 below the peak in early April. Goldman Sachs economists have said a decline of 30,000 to 40,000 in the four-week average is needed to signal a peak.
 In another sign of labor market weakness, the number of people continuing to claim benefits rose to 6.13 million, setting a record for the 12th straight week.
 As a proportion of the work force, the total jobless benefit rolls are the highest since January 1983. The continuing claims data lag initial claims by a week.
 The high level of continuing claims is a sign that many laid-off workers are having difficulty finding new jobs.
 Employers have cut 5.1 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007 in an effort to slash costs as consumers and businesses have sharply reduced spending. The department said earlier this month that companies cut a net total of 663,000 jobs in March, sending the unemployment rate to 8.5 percent, the highest in 25 years.
 The cuts reflect the depth of the downturn, which has been global in scope. The International Monetary Fund estimated Wednesday that the global economy would shrink 1.3 percent this year, the first drop in more than six decades. The I.M.F. projects that the United States economy will decline 2.8 percent, the worst since 1946.
 ''The world economy is going through the most severe crisis in generations,'' Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Wednesday.
 The Obama administration is counting on its $787 billion stimulus package, enacted in February, to ''save or create'' 3.5 million jobs.
 More job losses were announced this week. Yahoo said it would lay off 700 employees, the third round of layoffs this year. And the oilfield services provider Halliburton said it had cut 2,000 positions in the first three months of the year.
 Among the states, Florida saw the largest increase in claims with 9,303 for the week ending April 11, which it attributed to more layoffs in the construction, service and manufacturing industries. The next largest increases were in Pennsylvania, California, Wisconsin and New York.
 Michigan saw the largest drop in claims with 12,566, which it said was due to fewer layoffs in the automobile industry. The next biggest declines were in North Carolina, Missouri, Kentucky and Oregon.

HEADLINE: Lower Oil Prices Reduce Earnings At ConocoPhillips

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
ConocoPhillips said Thursday its first-quarter profit tumbled 80 percent from a year ago on sharply lower crude and natural gas prices. 
 But the results easily beat Wall Street's expectations and ConocoPhillips shares rose 4.9 percent, or $1.87, to $39.93.
 The company, based in Houston, said net income for the quarter was $840 million, or 56 cents a share, compared with $4.14 billion, or $2.62 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, ConocoPhillips's profit was 52 cents a share.
 Analysts had expected earnings of 42 cents a share.
 Revenue fell 44 percent, to $30.7 billion, from $54.9 billion in the period a year ago.
 ConocoPhillips was the first of the major oil companies to report first-quarter results, which as a whole are expected to be the worst in years as the global economic downturn saps demand for energy. After peaking around $150 in July, the price of crude tumbled hard and fast and today is less than $50 a barrel.
 In January, Conoco announced 1,300 job cuts and, anticipating a difficult 2009, has reduced its capital spending budget by 37 percent this year.
 Across the oil sector, producers large and small are scaling back spending on oil and gas projects as the global recession crushes energy consumption.
 Net income at Conoco's refining and marketing, or downstream, segment fell 61 percent, to $205 million from a year ago primarily because of lower volumes the company pegged in part to increased maintenance in the United States.

HEADLINE: Pill Sales Rise as Financial Anxiety Chases the Sandman Away

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
MORE than one in four Americans say they are literally losing sleep over the economic downturn -- tossing and turning over personal finances, the economy, job security or health care costs.
 Those were the results of a poll released last month by the National Sleep Foundation, a nonprofit group financed by federal and private sources that include health care companies like Merck, Wyeth and Johnson & Johnson and mattress makers like Sealy. 
 It is little surprise, then, that some over-the-counter sleeping pills have been doing a brisk business in recent months. 
 In the four-week period that ended March 22, sales of Advil PM tablets, which combine a sleeping aid with a pain reliever, were up 16 percent compared with the same period a year ago, according to Information Resources Inc., whose totals do not include sales at Wal-Mart. The brand's year-over-year increases for the previous four weeks were even sharper, rising 33 percent, and were up 26 percent the month before that. 
 Sales of Tylenol PM, the leading pain-relieving sleeping pill, were up 6 percent year-over-year for the month that ended March 22, according to Information Resources, a market research company in Chicago. 
 There is plenty of sheep-counting even in the best of financial times. The National Institutes of Health estimates that 30 percent of Americans have trouble sleeping and 10 percent have some form of insomnia; their daytime symptoms include moodiness as well as impaired concentration and memory. 
 But economic factors do weigh heavily. A survey done by the market research firm Experian Simmons in 2008 found that those with household incomes under $25,000 were 48 percent more likely than the general population to have sleep disorders, and those with no employed adults in the household were 45 percent more prone. 
 According to a recent report by the market research firm Packaged Facts, the age group most likely to suffer from insomnia are people 55 to 64 years old, who may suffer from arthritis or other ailments and are 26 percent more likely than the average consumer to buy pain-relieving sleep aids.
 ''Not only does this age group have to deal with the pains of getting old, but they are also most affected by the financial crisis, a huge headache in and of itself,'' the Packaged Facts report said.
 In an Advil PM television ad now running broadly -- by Grey New York, part of the Grey Group division of WPP -- a couple on a camping trip tuck into side-by-side sleeping bags -- hers blue with the Advil PM logo, his red like Tylenol PM packaging.
 Then, a third pajama-clad actor, holding a lantern outside the tent, announces it is the ''middle of the night,'' and the woman is shown sleeping peacefully while the man rubs his lower back and neck, grimacing. 
 ''With Advil PM, she's spending less time lying awake with aches and pains, and more time asleep,'' the actor says. ''He should switch to Advil PM. Maybe you should switch too.'' 
 Sales of Advil PM, which was introduced in 2006, grew 17 percent in 2008, making it the fastest growing product for Wyeth Consumer Healthcare, whose overall sales for the year were ''slightly down,'' according to Doug Petkus, a spokesman for the company. The company has done comparative ads that mention Tylenol PM since Advil PM's introduction, he said.
 Nearly two decades ago, Tylenol PM was the upstart, challenging Excedrin PM, which introduced the first nighttime pain pills in 1969. In 1992, the year after Johnson & Johnson introduced Tylenol PM, a judge dismissed a lawsuit by Excedrin PM claiming that its new competitor's use of ''PM'' and its packaging constituted a trademark violation.
 Representatives from both McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the Johnson & Johnson division that makes Tylenol PM, and Novartis Consumer Health, which makes Excedrin PM, declined requests for interviews.
 Packaged Facts estimates the entire over-the-counter sleep aids market for 2008 at $604 million, and painkilling sleeping pills account for 61 percent of that ($370 million). Leading the nighttime analgesics market is Tylenol PM, with a 50 percent share, followed by Advil PM (23 percent), store brands and other private labels (19 percent) and Excedrin PM (7 percent), according to Packaged Facts. 
 The active ingredients in most over-the-counter sleeping pills are antihistamines, like those in allergy pills. Sominex, Advil PM, Tylenol PM and Excedrin PM all contain diphenhydramine -- the same active ingredient as Benadryl, an allergy medicine. (Benadryl describes diphenhydramine on its label as an ''antihistamine'' while the sleeping pill labels describe it as a ''sleep aid.'')
 Dr. Phyllis Zee, director of the sleep disorders program at Northwestern University, says she has had patients for whom over-the-counter pills have been effective, but she added that the medicines were not risk-free and discouraged using them more than occasionally.
 ''If you take something like Advil PM intermittently when you have pain and can't sleep, that's a reasonable approach,'' Dr. Zee said. ''But I don't think there really have been long-term studies to look at their safety and efficacy when taken on a long-term basis.'' 
 In a 2005 report about insomnia, the National Institutes of Health cited ''significant concerns about risks'' of such antihistamine sleeping pills, including ''residual daytime sedation, diminished cognitive function and delirium, the latter being of particular concern in the elderly.''
 For those lying awake worrying about money, meanwhile, one way out of their financial predicament might be to develop solutions for people lying awake worrying about money. 
 Packaged Facts projects that sleeping aids -- not just medication but a host of products including herbal supplements, travel aids like neck pillows, sound machines and sleep masks -- will continue to grow as much as 10 percent annually through 2013.

HEADLINE: BATS Sales Are Down, But Selig Is Optimistic

BYLINE: By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDT

 BODY:
Commissioner Bud Selig said on Thursday that attendance was down a little less than 5 percent over the first two and half weeks of the season compared with the same period last season, acknowledging that the sluggish economy had affected ticket sales. 
 ''I will draw no conclusions, it's too early, but we are off to a start that given the weather and the economy and everything is better than we thought,'' Selig said.
 Selig said that National League teams were averaging about 31,000 fans per game and American League teams were averaging about 28,000.
 In response to questions about the empty seats in the lower sections of Yankee Stadium and Citi Field, where some tickets are being sold for more than $1,000, Selig said that he had spoken with officials from each team and that it would be up to the teams to decide whether to lower prices.
 ''They understand their market better than I do,'' Selig said. ''I won't tell them what to do.''
 Selig also announced that Frank Robinson, who had worked in the baseball operations division of the commissioner's office, would become a special assistant to him.

HEADLINE: At Age 51, A New Day At the Wheel

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It was about 11:30 a.m. when Momadou Marong, a 51-year-old Gambian immigrant who lives in the Bronx, drove down 72nd Street and found himself facing an avenue on the East Side of Manhattan. He peered out the window to see what the sign said. ''York Avenue,'' he said, then nodded as if he had just recognized a famous New York celebrity. ''Oh yes, York Avenue, there it is!'' 
 Mr. Marong had heard about this York Avenue-- east of First and only 32 blocks long -- in the two-week Taxi School he completed a few weeks before, but until that moment, he had never been there. He steered his yellow cab around the corner and pulled over to pick up a passenger, his fourth ever. 
 ''Good morning,'' he told the ponytailed young woman who got in. ''How are you today?'' 
 Mr. Marong had been unemployed since he lost a job two years ago at DHL, the troubled shipping company, and he wanted to make a good impression. ''Today's my first day,'' he told her, half proud, half apologetic.
 New Yorkers, at least those who can still afford to take taxis, have probably been hearing that a lot lately: the number of people driving cabs reached a record high of 47,000 in mid-April, up from 44,000 in 2005. 
 Although a recent study from the Taxi and Limousine Commission said that cab revenue has stayed steady, many drivers say the recession has meant they have to work more hours to make the same money, with the stretch between passengers yawning longer and longer. A proposed $1 surcharge to help balance the Metropolitan Transportation Authority budget could make it even more of a challenge.
 The ponytailed woman nearly got out of Mr. Marong's cab as he fumbled to clear the fare machine of his last client's bill -- ''I'm in a rush,'' she apologized -- but he reassured her they would be soon on their way. And then they were, lurching towards the West Side, with the woman politely but firmly guiding him: ''Sir, you'll want to get in the right lane -- you want to get in the right lane now. Right lane. Right lane. Stay with that car so we don't miss the light.''
 Where was she off to in such a hurry? Spin class at an Equinox gym. Turns out she had been laid off too, last summer, from a finance job in Midtown. ''But I'm trying to reinvent myself -- like you are,'' she said to Mr. Marong.
 At times, the driver could barely take in the instructions the passenger was giving because he was focusing so hard on the congestion ahead. The air conditioning was broken, so the cab was sweltering. Mr. Marong's seat belt was broken, which meant the seat-belt reminder signal went off loudly -- bongbongbongbongbongbong -- just when he was trying to concentrate most (state law says seat belt use is not compulsory in cabs). 
 He had almost decided to sleep in when the alarm went off at 3:30 a.m. having been told to arrive at the taxi lot no later than 5 a.m. ''But I thought no, I have to try,'' Mr. Marong explained. Since leaving DHL, he had not been able to find a decent job, ''at least not one that matched my qualifications.'' 
 In Gambia, Mr. Momadou was a lawyer and a captain in the military, and then after a coup d'etat, he was imprisoned for two years. After being granted political asylum to the United States, he spent a year studying law at Howard University. He recently took the bar exam and is waiting for results, but in the meantime, he owes back rent on the room he rents at a house in the Morrisania neighborhood.
 LIKE so many others, Mr. Marong is in a waiting game -- waiting out the recession, for his luck to turn. And like so many others, he's finding that these times challenge even his considerable resourcefulness: when every one else's last resorts are the same, those last resorts may pay even less than they would have back when they seemed extreme. 
 By day's end, Mr. Marong had cleared $50. He had had his first taste of the F.D.R. and laid eyes on Lincoln Center (''Lincoln Center! Oh! Yes, Columbus and Amsterdam between 62nd and 65th!''). He'd heard exasperated sighing in the back seat and active encouragement from big tippers. 
 About 2 p.m., Mr. Marong was on Fifth Avenue between 43rd and 42nd Streets, surrounded by a sea of other yellow cabs, all of them with lighted vacant signs. He looked, frankly, as if he might be stuck there forever, along with everyone else idling without a fare. Then, mysteriously, the way cleared, and he surged forward, in search of whatever would come next.

HEADLINE: Subprime: Corporate Version

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
The loans went to borrowers who might never before have been allowed to borrow. When they found repayment difficult, they were permitted to refinance their loans, generating fees for the lenders and postponing the ultimate reckoning. Then the credit markets turned and both the borrowers and lenders were in deep trouble.
 So it went with the subprime mortgage crisis. And so it is now going with corporate loans and bonds. It appears that defaults on leveraged loans and corporate bonds will soon rise to levels not seen since the Great Depression.
 If that does happen, a wave of corporate bankruptcies will deal another blow to the American economy, and present the Obama administration with more painful decisions about possible bailouts -- bailouts that could be made directly or indirectly by persuading bailed-out banks to make loans that might not seem wise to the bankers. 
 One reason for the rise in defaults is that this is a severe recession. But it is not the principal one. 
 Junk, circa 2009, is the worst junk ever. 
 Calculations by Moody's Investors Service show that as of the beginning of April, a record 27 percent of speculative-grade debt issuers had a rating on their senior debt ranging from Caa down to C. These are the lowest rungs of credit quality -- rungs that once rendered a borrower ineligible for a loan.
 The default rate on leveraged loans and speculative grade bonds is rising rapidly. ''We expect the default rate to get to the range of 14 percent by the end of the year,'' said Kenneth Emery, a senior vice president of Moody's. That compares to peak default rates of 10 to 12 percent during the last two recessions, in 1991 and 2001.
 That could turn out to be an optimistic forecast. Edward I. Altman, a finance professor at New York University, says he thinks the rate will probably be in the range of 13 to 15 percent, but could go as high as 19 percent this year. If the recession continues into 2010, he fears that year could see a comparable default rate.
 Martin S. Fridson, a veteran high-yield analyst who now runs his own research firm, FridsonVision, looked back at the 1991 default rates for various quality high-yield bonds. Since there are many more low-quality bonds now, he says equivalent default rates would produce an overall rate of 24 percent -- twice the old peak.
 How did we get into this mess? The story is remarkably similar to the tale of subprime mortgages. Lenders who were making money by putting the loans into pools became more and more eager to make loans, and less and less concerned about their quality.
 The way the loan securitization market developed, the most profitable loans to make were those rated B or even B-minus, levels of debt below the old standard for most junk bonds. There was a market for some Caa paper, even though such loans historically often landed in default.
 Borrowers who ran into problems could refinance their debt, creating new rounds of fees for the banks making the loans and obscuring the problems with credit. And with the economy booming, there were not that many problems anyway.
 The secret to all this was the collateralized loan obligation, or C.L.O. As with mortgage securities, the rating agency models figured that 70 percent of the money that went into financing single-B rated loans could be financed with AAA-rated paper.
 As time went on, the big banks making the leveraged loans became more and more competitive, figuring the secret to profits was in making the loans and securitizing them -- not necessarily getting them paid back. It was financial alchemy, but the AAA-rated paper was popular with buyers like banks and insurance companies, whose capital rules treated such securities as virtually risk-free. They wanted more such paper, and the big banks obliged.
 ''C.L.O.'s bought about two-thirds of corporate loans from 2004 to 2007,'' said David Preston, a structured products analyst at Wachovia Securities. But there are now no new C.L.O.'s being created, and many of the old ones may soon be barred from reinvesting repayments in new loans -- in part because so many existing loans are being downgraded by the rating agencies.
 David M. Rubenstein, the founder of the Carlyle Group, a major private equity firm that was borrowing a lot of the money, now gives speeches recalling how JPMorgan and Citigroup bid against each other for the privilege of lending to him. First they cut the interest rate they were asking. Then they raised the amount they would lend, reducing the equity investment Carlyle needed to make an acquisition.
 But that was not all. At the height of the lending mania in early 2007, the banks were offering ''covenant-lite'' loans, meaning that they would not go into default just because the borrower ran into financial problems that caused it to fail to meet some covenant, perhaps requiring a minimum level of earnings. And the banks offered what was called ''toggle-PIK,'' which gave the borrower the option to pay the interest by increasing the amount owed, rather than by putting up cash.
 If a company can default only by not paying the interest, and it is not required to pay the interest in cash, defaults are unlikely, at least until the PIK period ends or the company is unable to meet some other obligation. 
 The loans were the corporate equivalent of the now-notorious pay-option mortgage loans, where the borrower could choose to pay only a fraction of the interest, adding the rest to the amount he owed.
 It all sounds absurd now. But at the time, any bank that refused to lower standards on mortgage loans or on corporate loans risked plunging profits as all the business went to competitors. That might not have happened if regulators had been willing to step in, as some of them wanted to do.
 But Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve when the credit party grew delirious, was the dominant regulator. He saw no need to interfere with markets. It might have been different if he had understood markets and the flaws that were leading to disaster. Instead, he worshipped markets.
 Defaults are now rising because of the recession, but the news could get even worse. Unlike most mortgages, leveraged loans and junk bonds are not scheduled to be gradually paid off over the life of the loan. Instead, they come due and must be refinanced. Moody's reports that leveraged companies need to refinance $26 billion in loans this year, $44 billion in 2010 and $120 billion in 2011. If credit markets remain tight, we could see lots of defaults even among companies that are doing well enough to make their interest payments.
 ''If they are not around,'' asked Mr. Preston, speaking of the C.L.O.'s, ''where is the demand to buy loans going to come from?''
 When the subprime mortgage crisis burst into public view in 2007, government officials were slow to understand that the problem was much broader than the mortgage market. As it happens, the mortgage problem helped to bring on a recession, which is making the coming crisis in corporate loans -- not to mention in commercial real estate loans -- that much worse.
 The financial engineers seemed very clever at the time. They created a lending boom that appeared to increase economic growth and general prosperity. Few paid much attention to how the clever products could blow up if things went wrong. Now that they are exploding, there are no easy solutions.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 27, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The High and Low Finance column on Friday about the high default rate on leveraged loans and corporate bonds, gave an outdated affiliation for Martin S. Fridson, a veteran high-yield analyst who expects the rate to escalate further. He is the chief executive of Fridson Investment Advisors, a money management firm specializing in corporate credit opportunities; he no longer runs his own research firm, FridsonVision.

HEADLINE: Utility Suspends Nuclear Plant Effort

 BODY:
A utility in Missouri said Thursday that it was suspending its efforts to build a new nuclear reactor, making its proposed plant, Callaway 2, the first of the so-called nuclear renaissance reactors to fall by the wayside. 
 The industry has been looking forward to its first construction start in 30 years. According to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 17 companies have filed applications to build 26 reactors.
 The utility, AmerenUE, planned to build a reactor near Fulton, Mo., but was seeking changes in the state law governing the financing of new power plants. In a letter on Thursday, it asked the sponsors of a law now moving through the state legislature to withdraw the measure.
 AmerenUE wanted to be allowed to charge its customers for financing costs before the plant was finished. 
 In its current form, the law that did not include that provision, which the company said made ''financing a new plant in the current economic environment impossible.''
 Callaway 2 was supposed to be part of a series of plants modeled on one in the early stages of construction in Flamanville, France.

HEADLINE: At the Met, Baby Boomers Leap Onstage

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER. 
''The Pictures Generation, 1974-1984'' remains through Aug. 2 at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.

 BODY:
Apart from a few years in the 1960s when the New York culture czar Henry Geldzahler tossed some stardust around, the Metropolitan Museum was a fusty backwater for contemporary art, and an object of scorn in the art world. New work seemed to arrive only in bland job-lot batches. Exhibitions kept being awarded to angsty British painters who had peaked before World War II. 
 A few years ago things began to sharpen up. Modest but on-the-ball displays of recent photography quietly appeared, and, for the first time, video. Damien Hirst's silly shark arrived. Kara Walker was invited in as a guest curator. And now with ''The Pictures Generation, 1974-1984,'' the museum has finally made a big leap into the present, or near-present. A decades-long snooze may be over. 
 The show is a winner. It tackles a subject -- an innovative and influential body of art produced between two major American economic booms -- that has been begging for museum attention. It does so at a time when the work in question has particular pertinence to what's being made today. And it gives the subject something like classic old master treatment (decent space, big catalog) at probably a fraction of old master cost. 
 As for the art itself -- painting, drawing, sculpture, photography, video, installation, prints and books by 30 artists, most of them still active and caught young here -- it looks terrific. Some of it has become famous. But a lot of it hasn't been seen since it was made in the post-Vietnam 1970s. 
 The word ''generation'' in the title is a bit tricky. The artists included here represent only one aspect of art being made at the time, though they are presented as if they were the whole story. No larger context for their work is suggested, though they shared a set of social and political experiences. 
 They were born in the mid-1940s to early '50s, in a prosperous but paranoia-prone cold war era. They were the first kids to be raised with television, fast food and disposable everything. As teenagers they were soaked in Pop Art, rock and rebel politics. As art students, even in traditionalist programs, they felt the effects of Conceptualism. Ideas replaced objects and images. Painting was pushed to the side. The movement questioned what art was for and redefined what could be art. 
 John Baldessari, who taught at the California Institute of the Arts near Los Angeles, was one of Conceptualism's more unorthodox gurus. Once art had been emptied of visual matter, he wanted to fill it back up with images, specifically with images lifted from the mass media. 
 Where art was once assumed to reflect and even shape culture, the mass media -- television, film, advertising -- was overwhelming and shaping art. For Mr. Baldessari that was a phenomenon worthy of critical investigation, and some of his students -- like Jack Goldstein, Barbara Bloom, Matt Mullican, David Salle and James Welling, all big presences in the Met show -- agreed. 
 Similar ideas were being explored by artists elsewhere: by Charles Clough, Nancy Dwyer, Robert Longo and Cindy Sherman in Buffalo; by Paul McMahon in Boston; and by Barbara Kruger, Sherrie Levine, Louise Lawler, Richard Prince and Laurie Simmons in New York City. 
 They were all making art that combined elements of Pop and Conceptualism with social concerns about consumerism, political power and gender. Their work kept ideas to the fore but rematerialized them as images. Many of those images were photographic, extracted from everyday life, a life that was increasingly a creation of media culture, as Andy Warhol well knew. 
 Reductive accounts of the period pinpoint these trends as coalescing in a 1977 group exhibition called ''Pictures'' at Artist's Space in SoHo, an event that has also come to define a ''generation.'' In reality, this was a smallish affair, mostly of brand-new work, with only five artists -- Mr. Goldstein, Ms. Levine and Mr. Longo, along with Troy Brauntuch and Philip Smith -- with work by Ms. Sherman installed elsewhere in the gallery. The show's real influence probably derived from a related essay written by its curator, Douglas Crimp. 
 A few original ''Pictures'' pieces are in the Met exhibition, which has been organized by Douglas Eklund, an associate curator in the Met's photography department. They give evidence of certain highly individual styles and signature images almost at full development. 
 A small sculptural relief by Mr. Longo of a nattily dressed man bending backward as if struck, was modeled on the figure of a gangster shot to death in a Rainer Fassbinder film. In true mediated fashion Mr. Longo took the image from a newspaper reproduction of a film still, and it anticipates his monumental 1981 drawings of similar figures, three of which are hanging in the Met's Great Hall. 
 Mr. Brauntuch, now well known for working with archival fascist imagery, had a dim, dark photographic image of Hitler stamped onto a one-color ground like a spot of acid eating into a modernist abstraction. 
 And we also see Ms. Sherman, already creating the sort of fictional self-portraits, inspired by movies and girlie magazines, that would lead to her renowned ''Untitled Film Stills.'' Her debt to early feminist art is profound, but her combination of staged self-debasement, cool wit and formal control is her own. 
 Mr. Smith, a painter, dropped out of the generational story early -- he is barely mentioned in the catalog and there is none of his work in this Met show -- but Mr. Goldstein, who was born in 1945 and died, a suicide, in 2003, is one of its most versatile figures. By 1977 he had explored performance and sound art, and made a series of short films illustrating the manipulative mechanics of commercial movies. Some of those are here at the Met as well as one he finished a year later called ''The Jump,'' in which generic figures sparkling with lights dive and float through darkness like moving constellations. The work has the charm of cartoon animation -- a kid would love it -- and the weight of an open metaphor. 
 What's most striking about the Met show, though, is the stylistic diversity of the work, even by artists you think you know. Mr. Salle, familiar as a painter, is seen here as an installation artist. Mr. Mullican, the creator of large-scale prints, is represented by a little collage made up of dead figures cut from action comics. 
 Playing with advertising is common: in Ms. Bloom's ersatz travel posters; in rock band concert posters designed by Michael Zwack; in Mr. Welling's collages of Marlboro ads and Mr. Prince's later ones. 
 There's lots of music, heard and unheard. Artist bands were constantly forming and breaking up in the 1970s and '80s. Mr. Longo's charcoal figures, leaping spasmodically in their chic black suits, could easily be downtown club dancers. 
 The television is always on, of course, with Dara Birnbaum's ''Wonder Woman'' video running on one channel, Ericka Beckman's mordant Super-8 childhood skits on another and Mr. Smith's infantile dramas on a third. Bad news periodically intrudes, as in Thomas Lawson's painting of a battered child or Sarah Charlesworth's blurry photograph of plunge-to-the-street suicide. But even without it, escapist possibilities seem bleak in Ms. Simmons's photographs of claustrophobic Father-Knows-Best dollhouse interiors. 
 The view these artists took of American culture, a mix of cynicism, anxiety and nostalgia, is second nature now. You find it almost everywhere you turn in ''The Generational: Younger Than Jesus'' at the New Museum, an up-to-the-minute, internationalized echo of ''The Pictures Generation.'' Its artists are as young as the ''Pictures'' artists were then. They do with digital images from the Internet what their older colleagues once did with images cut from magazines. The generational parallels are so many as to be worrisome. Has new art come no further than this? Is it still tilling fields all but farmed out in the past? 
 That these two shows are available for comparison is a stroke of luck. And that the Met, so long out of the contemporary loop, produced one of them is particularly good news. The museum should involve itself more fully with new art in the years to come, but involvement doesn't necessarily mean flashing hot new names. It means doing what the Met has always done best with older art: producing exhibitions based on deep, detailed history. 
 ''The Pictures Generation'' can, with some adjustments, stand as the working model. The Met should keep doing exactly what it did here: get a contemporary subject that needs attention (I can think of dozens), get to it first, and get it right.

HEADLINE: PC Sales Off, Profit Falls At Microsoft

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
Fresh off one of the worst quarters in company history, Microsoft offered investors little evidence that a beleaguered personal computer market would recover anytime soon. 
 On Thursday, Microsoft set the wrong kind of record, as it reported the first year-over-year quarterly revenue decline since it first sold stock to the public in 1986. In its third quarter, which ended March 31, Microsoft said its revenue fell 6 percent, to $13.65 billion, from $14.45 billion. It reported net income of $2.98 billion, or 33 cents a share -- a 32 percent drop from the $4.39 billion, or 47 cents a share, reported in the period last year.
 The company's Windows franchise has come under unprecedented pressure during the recession as consumers and businesses have shied away from buying new computers or have purchased cheaper machines. While Intel, the chip maker, said last week that the worst of the PC decline had passed, Microsoft displayed no such confidence. 
 ''I didn't see any improvement at the end of the quarter that gives me encouragement that we are at a bottom and coming out of it,'' Christopher P. Liddell, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said during a conference call to discuss the company's results. ''They stopped getting worse, but that's different from they started getting better.''
 The recession has generated a series of firsts for Microsoft, including its first large layoff and first decline in Windows sales. 
 Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said its earnings included 6 cents of charges related to the layoffs and impairments to investments. 
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected Microsoft to earn 39 cents a share, excluding the one-time charges, on revenue of $14.1 billion. 
 Intel supplies the processors for most PCs, while Microsoft supplies the key operating system software.
 Last week, Intel's chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, declared that ''the worst is now behind us.'' 
 Mr. Liddell of Microsoft maintained a more somber tone. ''While we would all like to think a recovery will be soon and painless, we actually believe it will be slow and painful,'' he said. 
 Still, shares of Microsoft rose in after-hours trading after release of the results as investors apparently took solace from the company's cost-cutting efforts. 
 Microsoft has lowered its forecast of its operating expenses by as much as $1 billion for the year.
 ''Microsoft, like everyone else, has got serious about cost-cutting,'' said Brendan Barnicle, a software analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. ''They never really had to do that before, and investors had been hoping they would cut more.''
 Microsoft's online services business, which competes with Google and Yahoo, continued to disappoint observers as a depressed advertising market pushed sales down to $721 million, from $843 million. 
 ''The online business looked bad, but I still believe they have to be in that space to fulfill the larger vision of where Microsoft is going,'' said Richard Williams, the senior software analyst at Cross Research. ''It may mean that they have to acquire rather than build.''
 Microsoft has been in talks with Yahoo about some kind of partnership in online advertising.
 In the company's core Windows business, sales declined to $3.4 billion in the quarter, down from $4 billion in the period last year. 
 Netbooks, the cheap, small laptops that have surged in popularity, remained the big story. According to Microsoft's research, PC sales fell 7 to 9 percent during the quarter. Excluding netbooks, traditional PC sales fell 15 to 17 percent. 
 Last quarter, netbooks accounted for about 10 percent of PC sales, Microsoft said. Netbooks are a mixed blessing for Microsoft. The company's average selling price for Windows has declined, because it ships a discounted version of the older Windows XP on netbooks. Microsoft's Windows profit fell 19 percent, to $2.5 billion. 
 On a positive note, many customers have bought netbooks as complements to their existing computers, representing fresh revenue for Microsoft and Intel during these lean times. 
 However, ''there are some real challenges in that business behind this shift to the low end,'' said Israel Hernandez, director of software research at Barclays Capital. ''And on the horizon, you have Apple and Google who appear ready to introduce their own takes on netbooks.''
 Microsoft declined to offer specific financial guidance for the coming quarters. 
 Shares of Microsoft ended regular trading Thursday at $18.92, up 14 cents. The company released third-quarter figures after the market closed, and in after-hours trading the shares rose more than 3 percent, to $19.50.

HEADLINE: Groups See Added Risks From Change In Climate

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
The effects of climate change, especially rising seas, threaten trillions of dollars' worth of coastal property, and flood-hazard maps, zoning laws, building codes and insurance rates in the United States do not accurately reflect the risk, an unusual coalition of groups reported Thursday. 
 The coalition -- organized by the Heinz Center, a research organization that focuses on environmental issues, and Ceres, an organization of environmentally conscious investor, insurance and other groups -- said the nation had failed to take ''reasonable steps'' to reduce economic losses and protect residents of the coast.
 In a report, it urged that government flood-hazard maps be updated and that local land-use policies bar people from building or rebuilding in areas at high risk of flooding.
 Property owners should be encouraged to make their buildings more storm-resistant, the coalition added. It cited research by the Wharton School indicating that tougher construction codes could reduce damage from coastal storms by more than 60 percent. 
 Spokesmen for the coalition acknowledged at a telephone conference that the report's recommendations were not new. But Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, said she hoped the coalition's broad range -- a mix of investment, insurance, government and conservation groups -- would bring ''unique leverage'' to the issue. 
 The coalition members, who are supporting one another's initiatives, include insurance companies like Travelers and Fireman's Fund, the Wharton School, the Nature Conservancy, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Calvert Investments and other groups. 
 In an earlier interview, Sharlene Leurig, who manages the insurance program at Ceres, said storms in recent years had caused such immense economic losses along the coasts that many insurance companies had limited or even halted underwriting there.
 Given that half of Americans live in coastal counties, ''that is not a sustainable business plan,'' Ms. Leurig said, adding, ''They are stepping away from a sizable portion of their business.''
 But she and other members of the coalition said federal and state efforts to help people obtain insurance at low rates were not the answer.
 At the news conference, Ms. Leurig acknowledged that if insurance on coastal property were priced according to risk, premiums would rise, resulting in declines in values in some areas. Nonetheless, she said, insurance premiums can be a powerful tool for communicating risk to potential buyers.
 In the telephone conference, the mayor of Charleston, S.C., Joseph P. Riley, pointed with pride to a county and city initiative that would restrict most development of Johns Island, a rural area south of the city, to a small part of its interior. 
 Mr. Riley conceded, however, that island residents were complaining that their property values would decline under the plan and that one developer had sued to block it.

HEADLINE: Global Finance Officials Promise More Help, but Seek It, Too

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Top officials at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund pledged Thursday to increase their lending to poor countries, warning that the global financial crisis was far from over. 
 But as finance ministers from industrialized and large developing countries prepared for meetings here on Friday, monetary fund officials were still struggling to nail down enough commitments to meet the goal set this month to provide $1.1 trillion in extra support to the international lending institutions.
 Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank, announced that the bank would lend up to $45 billion for infrastructure projects over the next three years. 
 Separately, the World Bank teamed up with the Inter-American Development Bank to lend up to $90 billion in Latin America and Caribbean countries over the next two years. 
 ''We have more work to do -- and will need more resources -- to deal with a broader set of problems in developing countries where real economies are being hit by the second and third waves'' of the financial crisis, Mr. Zoellick said.
 But Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, acknowledged that he had not yet lined up the $500 billion that leaders from the Group of 20, which represents industrialized and developing countries as well as the European Union, had pledged this month in London. That money was the biggest single part of the $1.1 trillion commitment. 
 ''We are not there yet, but I am confident we will be there by the end of the year,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn told reporters. 
 The United States is still somewhat at odds with European leaders over how much countries should be stimulating their economies. American officials are pushing for bigger efforts, but European countries like Germany say they have done as much as they can.
 But that debate has been restrained in recent days. Mr. Strauss-Kahn said the total size of the stimulus plans announced so far was roughly in line with what the International Monetary Fund had been recommending, an amount equal to about 2 percent of global economic output.
 Finance ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized nations will meet Friday in Washington, followed by a meeting of ministers from the Group of 20, which includes countries like China, India, Brazil and Russia. 
 The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund will hold their annual spring meetings here this weekend.
 Much of the attention will be on whether finance ministers can get closer to their goal of raising $500 billion for the fund.
 The United States, Japan and European nations have pledged about $300 billion so far, and China has pledged $40 billion. That leaves the specific commitments still more than $100 billion shy of the goal. Fund officials are hoping to round up more commitments this weekend, which they view as an important barometer of international collaboration.
 ''The closer they can get to $500 billion, the better the outcome,'' said Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

HEADLINE: Unemployed, Unapologetic and Unrestrained: It's Cheney Unbound

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
On the mornings he is in town, Dick Cheney wakes up at 6, climbs into his black sport utility vehicle and drives himself to a Starbucks near his McLean, Va., home. He returns with a pair of grande skim lattes -- decaf for him, regular for his wife, Lynne -- and settles into work in the sun-drenched office above his garage, penning his memoir in longhand on yellow legal pads.
 It is the kind of scene that Americans have come to expect from their elder statesmen: a quiet, unassuming return to private life after giving up power. Except, that is, for the quiet and unassuming part. 
 In the three months since leaving office, Mr. Cheney has upended the old Washington script for former presidents and vice presidents, using a series of interviews -- the first just two weeks after leaving office -- to kick off one last campaign, not for elective office, but on behalf of his own legacy. In the process, he has become a vocal leader of the opposition to President Obama, rallying conservatives as they search for leadership and heartening Democrats who see him as the ideal political foil.
 Even before Mr. Obama released secret memorandums on the interrogation techniques approved by the Bush administration, Mr. Cheney, as part of researching his memoir, had asked the National Archives to declassify two other documents he contends would show that harsh interrogations produced useful information, according to his daughter Liz, who is helping him organize and write the memoir. The documents do not reveal specific tactics, Ms. Cheney said.
 When the Obama administration released the memos, Mr. Cheney asked the archives to expedite his request and made a splash this week by announcing it on Fox News in an interview with Sean Hannity. 
 Former President George W. Bush has said that Mr. Obama ''deserves my silence,'' but Mr. Cheney, who told Mr. Hannity he has spoken with Mr. Bush just once since leaving office, does not share that view. 
 ''I think he feels compelled to make clear why, particularly related to national security issues, it is so important that we don't abandon those policies and that we remember the fact that we are at war,'' Ms. Cheney said Thursday. ''When he sees the current administration making decisions that he believes are making the nation less safe, he does not believe there is any obligation under those circumstances to be silent.''
 At a time when his party has no high-profile leaders on Capitol Hill, Mr. Cheney is in effect the ranking Republican speaking out against Mr. Obama. His message has been amplified -- on television, in op-ed pieces and elsewhere -- by an informal band of supporters, including Ms. Cheney.
 Mr. Obama has repeatedly repudiated the Bush administration; in the interviews, Mr. Cheney has hit back. Speaking to Politico in February, he warned of a ''high probability'' of another terrorist attack. On CNN, he suggested that Mr. Obama was using the economic crisis to justify a big expansion of government. On Fox, he agreed when Mr. Hannity asked if Mr. Obama was ''telegraphing weakness.''
 To Democrats, Mr. Cheney is the perfect person to remind the nation of all the reasons Republicans were turned out of office. ''I think the country has rendered a pretty clear verdict last fall on Cheney and Cheneyism,'' said Mr. Obama's senior adviser, David Axelrod.
 Even some Republicans say they wish the former vice president would disappear. Among them is Meghan McCain, the daughter of the Republicans' 2008 presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, who appeared Thursday on the ABC show ''The View.''
 ''You had your eight years,'' Ms. McCain declared. ''Go away.''
 Other former vice presidents have kept a much lower profile, at least this early after leaving office. Al Gore was supportive of Mr. Bush after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but in September 2002 delivered a speech critical of Mr. Bush's plans for the Iraq war. After John F. Kennedy bungled the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961, Richard M. Nixon, the former vice president who lost to Mr. Kennedy, visited the new president at the White House and said the nation should support him.
 But some conservatives, feeling beleaguered these days, are grateful that Mr. Cheney is speaking out. John R. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations and a close ally of his, said that after having to hew publicly to Mr. Bush's views, Mr. Cheney might be feeling liberated. ''It's about time he had a chance to get his voice back,'' Mr. Bolton said. ''There's no cone of silence now.''
 For its part, the Obama White House is trying to figure out just how to handle the lifting of the cone. After the former vice president appeared on CNN last month, the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, was dismissive, declaring, ''I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy, so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal.'' 
 But now Mr. Cheney is gaining some traction with his argument that the Obama White House, which prides itself on transparency, should declassify the memorandums he is seeking. Mr. Gibbs faced a string of questions Thursday about whether Mr. Obama had read them (he said he did not know), and Mr. Axelrod said the White House would consider declassifying them after intelligence and national security agencies had weighed in. 
 As for Mr. Cheney, he does not have any more interviews scheduled, although his daughter said he was flooded with requests. Aside from working on his book, he has been meeting with foreign dignitaries, hosting policy luncheons around his kitchen table (it seats 10) and spending a fair amount of time at his other homes, in Wyoming and on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. He will be making a speech in New York soon, his daughter said, and he has a couple of fishing trips planned for May.

HEADLINE: Reclaiming America's Soul

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''Nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past.'' So declared President Obama, after his commendable decision to release the legal memos that his predecessor used to justify torture. Some people in the political and media establishments have echoed his position. We need to look forward, not backward, they say. No prosecutions, please; no investigations; we're just too busy.
 And there are indeed immense challenges out there: an economic crisis, a health care crisis, an environmental crisis. Isn't revisiting the abuses of the last eight years, no matter how bad they were, a luxury we can't afford? 
 No, it isn't, because America is more than a collection of policies. We are, or at least we used to be, a nation of moral ideals. In the past, our government has sometimes done an imperfect job of upholding those ideals. But never before have our leaders so utterly betrayed everything our nation stands for. ''This government does not torture people,'' declared former President Bush, but it did, and all the world knows it. 
 And the only way we can regain our moral compass, not just for the sake of our position in the world, but for the sake of our own national conscience, is to investigate how that happened, and, if necessary, to prosecute those responsible. 
 What about the argument that investigating the Bush administration's abuses will impede efforts to deal with the crises of today? Even if that were true -- even if truth and justice came at a high price -- that would arguably be a price we must pay: laws aren't supposed to be enforced only when convenient. But is there any real reason to believe that the nation would pay a high price for accountability?
 For example, would investigating the crimes of the Bush era really divert time and energy needed elsewhere? Let's be concrete: whose time and energy are we talking about? 
 Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, wouldn't be called away from his efforts to rescue the economy. Peter Orszag, the budget director, wouldn't be called away from his efforts to reform health care. Steven Chu, the energy secretary, wouldn't be called away from his efforts to limit climate change. Even the president needn't, and indeed shouldn't, be involved. All he would have to do is let the Justice Department do its job -- which he's supposed to do in any case -- and not get in the way of any Congressional investigations.
 I don't know about you, but I think America is capable of uncovering the truth and enforcing the law even while it goes about its other business.
 Still, you might argue -- and many do -- that revisiting the abuses of the Bush years would undermine the political consensus the president needs to pursue his agenda.
 But the answer to that is, what political consensus? There are still, alas, a significant number of people in our political life who stand on the side of the torturers. But these are the same people who have been relentless in their efforts to block President Obama's attempt to deal with our economic crisis and will be equally relentless in their opposition when he endeavors to deal with health care and climate change. The president cannot lose their good will, because they never offered any.
 That said, there are a lot of people in Washington who weren't allied with the torturers but would nonetheless rather not revisit what happened in the Bush years. 
 Some of them probably just don't want an ugly scene; my guess is that the president, who clearly prefers visions of uplift to confrontation, is in that group. But the ugliness is already there, and pretending it isn't won't make it go away.
 Others, I suspect, would rather not revisit those years because they don't want to be reminded of their own sins of omission. 
 For the fact is that officials in the Bush administration instituted torture as a policy, misled the nation into a war they wanted to fight and, probably, tortured people in the attempt to extract ''confessions'' that would justify that war. And during the march to war, most of the political and media establishment looked the other way. 
 It's hard, then, not to be cynical when some of the people who should have spoken out against what was happening, but didn't, now declare that we should forget the whole era -- for the sake of the country, of course. 
 Sorry, but what we really should do for the sake of the country is have investigations both of torture and of the march to war. These investigations should, where appropriate, be followed by prosecutions -- not out of vindictiveness, but because this is a nation of laws. 
 We need to do this for the sake of our future. For this isn't about looking backward, it's about looking forward -- because it's about reclaiming America's soul.

HEADLINE: Horrors! A Handshake!

 BODY:
Republicans have been predicting the decline of American power ever since President Obama was photographed at last week's hemispheric summit shaking the hand of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and -- gasp! -- smiling. Former Vice President Dick Cheney warned that that act of civility would be viewed as a sign of ''weakness.'' Newt Gingrich, who may be honing his attack skills for a presidential run, said Mr. Obama's behavior was bolstering ''enemies of America.'' 
 We have no patience for Mr. Chavez. He was elected as a champion of the poor and has turned himself into a standard-issue autocrat -- playing the anti-America card to divert attention from his failed economic policies and ever more outrageous power grabs. 
 But Venezuela is no strategic threat. And this country has paid far too high a price in both power and influence for former President George W. Bush's bullying. 
 Mr. Obama got elected on a pledge to do things differently. At the summit, years of antagonism gave way to eagerness for new relations with Washington. Mr. Obama undercut Mr. Chavez's bluster with that handshake and his promise of a ''new beginning'' with Cuba. 
 Of course, Mr. Obama has to go further: offering more to, and asking more of, his interlocutors. Even as he reaches out to Cuba by easing (and, we hope, eventually lifting) the counterproductive embargo, he must press Havana on human rights and democratic reforms. He must press Mr. Chavez on the same issues. 
 The logic of his Iran strategy is to give Tehran a chance to come in from the cold with offers of engagement and economic and security incentives. If Tehran does not take him up on the offer -- early signs are not hopeful -- he must build support for tougher international sanctions to constrain Iran's nuclear program. 
 The president will also have to ask more of America's friends. Europe treated him like a rock star on his recent continental tour, but he still did not win enough support for NATO's mission in Afghanistan. 
 None of this will be easy. And Mr. Obama will be held accountable for his record -- not just his rhetoric and photo ops. But starting with a handshake rather than a fist makes sense to us.

HEADLINE: Edgy Banks Start to Get Word Today On U.S. Tests

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Wall Street is stressed out about stress tests.
 After a two-month wait, the nation's 19 largest banks will start learning on Friday how they fared in important federal examinations -- and which among them will need another bailout from the government or private investors.
 While many of the banks reported surprisingly strong first-quarter earnings, they are by no means out of the woods. A number of them are likely to need more capital to weather a prolonged recession, and the losses that might accompany it. 
 The Federal Reserve intends to disclose, in general terms, how it conducted the stress tests on Friday afternoon, but the government will not publicly reveal the results until May 4. In between, Wall Street is bracing for a possible roller-coaster ride in financial stocks as investors scramble to do their own assessment of the financial industry's strongest and the weakest players.
 ''The headlines, not the details, seem to be driving the markets,'' said Frederick Cannon, who is in charge of equity research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a boutique investment bank. 
 Analysts are already betting that the stress tests will show that banks need to raise significant amounts of new capital, as profits made in the first three months of the year give way to more losses, tied to credit card, commercial real estate and corporate loans. An assessment by Mr. Cannon's firm, which calculated its own stress test for the industry, concluded Thursday that United States banks might need as much as an additional $1 trillion in capital.
 As part of their exam, regulators have been poring over bank balance sheets to spot financial problems that may not surface for months. Officials are assessing the financial condition of the banks based on their potential losses and earnings over the next two years. That is why some banks that recently announced blockbuster earnings may still need to raise sizable amounts of fresh money.
 As the dust settles from the shakeout on Wall Street, the 19 banks subject to stress tests are starting to divide into three groups: the strong that can weather the storm; the weak that will need new, perhaps significant, support; and the ones on the verge, whose fate will be decided by regulators.
 ''Banks are starting to distance themselves from the pack,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a longtime banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ''The companies that pull away are going to be the companies that have the least amount of exposure to the riskiest areas, the strongest capital position and the best management teams.''
 Those poised to withstand potential worsening of the recession -- with little or no new capital -- include major banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which already swallowed multibillion-dollar losses on toxic securities and cut dividends to shore up their financial position. Big custodial banks, like Bank of New York Mellon and the State Street Corporation, which provide bookkeeping and securities lending to investment firms, also have probably put the bulk of their troubles behind them. 
 A handful of well-run commercial banks are thought to be members of this group. JPMorgan Chase, for example, set aside several billion dollars from strong first-quarter profits in investment banking to protect against an onslaught of corporate and consumer loan losses. U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis plans to rely on its fat lending margins and fee-generating businesses to weather the recession. 
 At the other end of the spectrum are weaker banks, where ballooning losses threaten to overwhelm profits. Analysts say that some of these banks -- including Bank of America and Citigroup, whose consumer and investment banking businesses have been pummeled -- may need additional capital to shore up their finances. 
 Although Bank of America announced a first-quarter profit that exceeded expectations, analysts say that rising loan losses across its portfolio may threaten its health. If so, the bank may be forced to convert part of the government's investment into common stock, over the objections of its chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis. 
 Likewise, Citigroup's credit card and consumer lending businesses are extremely vulnerable to a global downturn, although the bank still eked out a $1.6 billion first-quarter profit. In late February, it announced plans to convert a big part the government's preferred shares into common stock to bolster its finances before its stress test. Even so, some analysts contend it still needs an additional stock infusion. 
 And a number of regional banks are bracing for huge losses in their commercial loan books, making them strong candidates for needing additional money. Fifth Third Bank Ohio of Cincinnati has struggled to keep up with spiraling losses on corporate loan and real estate, the result of the worsening on its Rust Belt home turf and an ill-timed expansion into Florida. SunTrust Banks of Atlanta and Regions Financial of Alabama have been hard hit by the housing bust that has affected much of the Southeast, and their problems with commercial real estate and corporate loans have severely worsened. But Regions, for example, added a mere $34 million to its reserves for future loan losses, an amount analysts say may not be enough to cover a surge in its nonperforming loans. 
 The rest of the lenders fit into a more uncertain category, where their need for capital depends on what federal officials decide. 
 As unemployment rises, big credit card players like American Express and Capital One Financial are having a spike in the number of customers defaulting on their loans. But by reining in credit limits, and having set aside big pools of money to cushion the blow, they may end up better off than traditional bank lenders. 
 Some large regional banks face a similar issue. BB&T Bank of North Carolina, PNC Financial of Pittsburgh, and Wells Fargo all posted surprisingly good first-quarter numbers, but some analysts have questioned their ability to cover future losses. Regulators are likely to make judgments on their capital needs.

HEADLINE: President Pressures Credit Card Companies on Rates and Fees

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; David Stout contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Seizing on the growing unpopularity of credit card companies, President Obama on Thursday threw his support behind legislation moving swiftly through Congress that would restrict the ability of banks to impose higher fees and interest rates on consumers.
 In a White House meeting with credit card industry executives, Mr. Obama sought to jawbone the companies into accepting changes -- some voluntarily, some through legislation -- that could cut heavily into profits at a financially difficult time. 
 In recent days, the White House, which had been largely disengaged from the issue, has suddenly become more involved. Presidential aides this week submitted proposed changes to legislation that has been moving rapidly on Capitol Hill. 
 The legislation, which will most likely be approved by the House as early as next week and then be debated in the Senate soon after, has faced significant opposition among Senate Republicans who are strong supporters of the credit card issuers. 
 Democratic leaders said they were mindful of polls showing widespread disapproval of credit card companies, particularly as rates and penalties charged to consumers have been climbing steeply, even though the companies' cost of borrowing is at a historic low. That has put pressure on Congress to move swiftly. 
 Following up on pledges he made during the election campaign to curtail the high fees and rates, the president called the top executives from the nation's largest credit card companies to the White House to pressure them to take steps that officials say would reduce abusive practices. 
 Most of the banks have also received government assistance as part of the federal bailout, putting the government in an awkward position. As a shareholder, it profits from the banks' improved earnings. At the same time, the administration is trying to take steps that, while helpful to consumers, could cut into the institutions' profitability.
 Participants described the half-hour meeting in the Roosevelt Room as cordial and not confrontational. They said Mr. Obama told the executives that he recognized the importance of credit cards as a source of liquidity and convenience, but that he had concerns about certain card policies. He said some of those concerns had been addressed in new regulations that the Federal Reserve recently adopted and that will take effect next year, but that he thought the government needed to go further.
 ''I know you feel that anything beyond what the Fed has done would be overkill,'' the president was quoted by one participant as saying. ''I just disagree.'' 
 He called on the companies to produce statements that are clearly written and do not have any confusing terms and conditions. He also proposed that every company issue a ''plain-vanilla, easy-to-understand, simplest-terms possible credit card'' to make it easier for the average consumer. 
 Mr. Obama was told by executives that the industry still faced its own financing problems, as roughly half of the nation's credit card debt is repackaged and sold as securities to investors in what is called the secondary market, which is still largely frozen. The president responded that he was sympathetic and that the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, had been working to thaw the credit markets. 
 In response to one executive who was trying to make the case for less regulation, Mr. Obama told the executives to remember that they were ''talking to a president who still has a very fresh memory of relying on credit cards'' to finance his lifestyle. ''I know them firsthand,'' he reportedly said.
 Mr. Obama's firm tone left some executives resigned. One executive told the president that although her assignment had been to try to persuade the president not to support new restrictions, ''it was pretty clear I won't succeed.'' 
 ''You're probably right,'' the president replied. ''But you should feel free to make your pitch.'' The comment prompted the room to break out in laughter.
 The House measure is likely to sail through next week, lawmakers and lobbyists predicted. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said a similar measure that he and others have been working on would be on the floor of the Senate before the Memorial Day recess. 
 Lawmakers said on Thursday that they had agreed to some amendments that were being sought by senior White House officials. One provision would require the credit card companies to apply consumer payments first to any debt that has the highest interest rate. 
 On Wednesday the House Financial Services committee overwhelmingly approved a bill that would reduce many fees and limit the ability of the credit card companies to charge penalties. The bill, sponsored by Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, was adopted 48 to 19. 
 The bill would enshrine into law most of the Fed's new rules, as well as some additional ones. Hoping to move more quickly on some protections, Senator Schumer and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, asked the Fed on Thursday to impose an immediate emergency freeze on interest rates of existing card balances. The Fed's similar rule is not set to take effect before July 2010.
 ''Credit card providers have been aggressively raising rates on consumers now to avoid the ramifications of this rule when it goes into effect next year,'' the senators wrote. ''Consumers describe situations to our offices in which the interest rates on their accounts have doubled or tripled overnight, without any misconduct on their part.''
 Michelle A. Smith, a Fed spokeswoman, said it was considering the letter and would respond promptly.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Chief Says Obama Will Push Ahead on Pacts

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In his first policy speech, the top United States trade official said Thursday that President Obama would work to revive global trade talks and complete three bilateral accords as part of an aggressive trade agenda. 
 The administration plans ''a new paradigm'' on trade, the trade representative, Ron Kirk, told an audience at Georgetown University. ''We're looking at everything,'' he said. 
 Rejecting fears of a turn to protectionism or a softening of support for free trade, Mr. Kirk said: ''Now is not the time to turn inward. Now is not the time to be timid. Now is the time to revive global trade.'' 
 Mr. Kirk vowed to press ahead on three bilateral trade agreements negotiated by the Bush administration. He said there was strong bipartisan support in Congress for an agreement with Panama -- suggesting that its completion might come first -- but that the administration was also working to advance the somewhat more controversial pacts with Colombia and South Korea. 
 Mr. Obama had criticized Colombia during his presidential campaign because of violence there against labor activists. But his administration has pointed to progress there since then.
 On the accord with Seoul, United States auto manufacturers question whether it would adequately open South Korea's auto market.
 Mr. Kirk also said Thursday that he would consult with fellow World Trade Organization members about ''proactive, positive options'' for reviving the Doha round of global trade negotiations, which broke down in July over differences between advanced and developing countries on agriculture. 
 Frank Vargo, vice president for international affairs of the National Association of Manufacturers, welcomed Mr. Kirk's specificity in saying that fast-developing countries -- like China, Brazil and India, though he did not name them -- needed to show a willingness to work toward a Doha compromise.
 Mr. Kirk, he said, ''makes it plain that the less-developing countries are going to have to step up to the plate and do more.'' Mr. Vargo's group supports that approach. He said he was heartened by the sense that ''the U.S. is going to be exercising strong leadership'' on Doha. 
 Despite deep skepticism about prospects for reviving Doha, Mr. Vargo said that the global economic crisis might change that. Countries like Brazil, India and China should realize, he said, that ''if the world turns protectionist, it'll be against them. They need a successful Doha round.'' 
 But Mr. Kirk promised strong support for trade with the poorer developing countries.
 He also said he would rigorously enforce trade agreements and help protect American workers who lose jobs because of trade.
 His promise to increase export efforts by small- and medium-size American companies represented a first from a United States trade representative, Mr. Vargo said. 
 Mr. Kirk earned a reputation as a free trade advocate in Dallas, where he joined other political leaders in calling in 2000 for permanently normalizing trade relations with China, which Congress voted the following year to do.
 But his specific views on current trade issues are not yet well known. The president is being tugged in competing directions by pro-trade forces in both parties and by labor and environmental advocates, largely on the Democratic side. 
 ''Their dilemma is, no matter what they do they're going to get hit by a fairly significant number of people,'' said William A. Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council. But as a former trade official in the Clinton administration, he suggested the best approach was simply to chart a course and move ahead.
 Some of Mr. Obama's campaign talk has also raised concerns among trade supporters. Tapping into antitrade feelings in critical states during the campaign, he had criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 But American exports have fallen 16 percent during the current economic crisis, as Mr. Kirk noted, and Mr. Obama has joined world leaders in cautioning against protectionism.

HEADLINE: Two Legislative Approaches to Reining In Credit Card Companies

 BODY:
Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights Act of 2009 (H.R. 627)
 SPONSORS Representative Barney Frank (Massachusetts Democrat), Representative Carolyn B. Maloney (New York Democrat) 
 PROVISIONS Requires credit card companies to give cardholders advance notice of an increase in interest rates; bans retroactive interest rate increases on existing balances unless the cardholder is more than 30 days late making a payment; prevents the companies from marketing and issuing cards to borrowers under 18; and lets consumers set credit limits lower than the card company offers. The bill puts into law most of the credit card restrictions adopted last year by the Federal Reserve, but the industry strongly opposes the bill because it says it believes a law would be harder to overturn than a regulation. The bill will go into effect 12 months after becoming law or by July 2010, whichever comes first.
 STATUS The House Financial Services Committee approved the bill 48-19 Wednesday; eight of the committee's 29 Republicans voted with Democrats. An amendment by Ms. Maloney requiring credit card companies to give 45 days' notice of rate increases passed, and will take effect 90 days after the bill is signed. The full House is expected to vote on the bill as early as next week. The bill's prospects in the Senate are uncertain.
 Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act (S. 414)
 SPONSOR Senator Christopher J. Dodd (Connecticut Democrat)
 PROVISIONS A tougher counterpart to the House bill, the Senate bill would prohibit credit card companies from increasing interest rates on cardholders in good standing and from imposing interest charges on any portion of a balance that is paid by the due date. It would also limit the ability of borrowers under 21 to obtain cards. The changes would go into effect nine months after the bill became law.
 STATUS The bill was adopted on a narrow party-line vote in the Senate banking committee on March 31, with Democrat Tim Johnson joining Republicans in voting no. It has yet to find any Republican support, which would be necessary for it to survive.

HEADLINE: Holding Up the Housing Recovery

 BODY:
We welcomed President Obama's plan, unveiled in March, to head off foreclosures and keep more Americans in their homes, but we feared that it wouldn't be enough. We were particularly concerned that without a reform of the bankruptcy code, lenders wouldn't do enough to voluntarily modify troubled loans. 
 Seven weeks later, bankruptcy reform legislation is stalled in the Senate because of Republican opposition. Meanwhile, foreclosure filings -- including notices of default, auctions and repossessions -- rose again in the first three months of this year. 
 Moody's Economy.com is projecting that 3.4 million homeowners will default on their mortgages in 2009 and 2.1 million will lose their homes. Those projections may prove too rosy because they assume that the Obama plan will be largely successful. That's far from assured. 
 The plan establishes industrywide guidelines for modifying troubled loans. And it provides financial incentives to lenders to rework those loans so that they're more affordable, generally by reducing the interest rate. 
 It also calls on Congress to amend the bankruptcy code so that borrowers facing foreclosure can have their mortgages modified under court protection. That is key. 
 Lenders are more likely to voluntarily modify bad loans if the alternative is to lose control of the process to a judge. Bankruptcy also may be a borrower's only hope if a lender will not rework a troubled mortgage or if a borrower cannot afford even modified terms. 
 Without the bankruptcy fix, foreclosures will likely outstrip lenders' efforts to prevent them. The Obama administration projects that its plan will help three million to four million homeowners to avoid foreclosure by lowering monthly payments. The Moody's Economy.com analysis estimates that up to two million mortgages will be voluntarily modified under the Obama plan and that up to 1.25 million will be modified in bankruptcy court. 
 If the reform does not pass, Moody's Economy.com says its estimate of the number of modifications would drop by more than half, with 475,000 fewer voluntary modifications and zero court-approved modifications. 
 The House passed reform legislation more than a month ago. Senate Democratic leaders say that nearly all 58 members of their caucus are on board. Republican leaders say all 41 of their senators will block a vote. If they hold ranks, it would mean that senators from states hardest hit by foreclosures would help to ensure the bill's failure -- including John McCain and Jon Kyl of Arizona and John Ensign of Nevada. 
 Republican opposition appears to have more to do with fund-raising than principle. The American Bankers Association and other lobbies remain opposed to the fix. Sam Geduldig, a lobbyist for several banking trade associations, recently told The Times's Stephen Labaton and Eric Dash that as a minority party, Republicans will get ''professional donors and lobbyists to look at them in a different light,'' if they show they can affect policy. 
 There might be some good news. Several powerhouse banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, have been talking with Democratic leaders in recent days about crafting a bankruptcy fix. Democrats hope the big banks can rope in a few Republicans. The danger is the bill could be watered down.
 The Obama administration, which is propping up the banks, should put more pressure on them to support a robust bankruptcy reform. 
 If that doesn't work, there's always the appeal to reason. 
 Republican senators need to understand that a vote against this reform is a vote against economic recovery. As foreclosures add to the glut of unsold homes, house prices will continue to fall. That will lead to more foreclosures -- declining equity is a risk factor for default -- and more defaults and foreclosures will hamper the banks' recovery and further constrain credit. And so on. 
 The White House needs to argue the case for bankruptcy reform forcefully on Capitol Hill -- and to voters.

HEADLINE: Obama Resisting Push for Interrogation Panel

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The White House and the Democratic leadership in the Senate signaled on Thursday that they would block for now any effort to establish an independent commission to investigate the Bush administration's approval of harsh interrogation techniques.
 In doing so, they sought to reduce pressure for a full inquiry -- from, among others, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi -- that has grown more intense since President Obama suggested on Tuesday that he would be open to such an investigation. While the White House has contended that Mr. Obama never actively supported an inquiry, his firmer opposition to the possibility, communicated to Congressional leaders in meetings on Wednesday night and Thursday, represented a shift in emphasis.
 Meeting with the Democratic leadership on Wednesday night, Mr. Obama said a special inquiry would steal time and energy from his policy agenda, and could mushroom into a wider distraction looking back at the Bush years, people briefed on the discussion said. Mr. Obama, they said, repeated much the same message on Thursday at a bipartisan meeting with Congressional leaders. 
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and other top Senate Democrats endorsed Mr. Obama's view on Thursday, telling reporters at a news conference at the Capitol that they preferred to wait for the results of an investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee expected late this year
 ''I think it would be very unwise, from my perspective, to start having commissions, boards, tribunals, until we find out what the facts are,'' Mr. Reid said. ''And I don't know a better way of getting the facts than through the Intelligence Committee. I think that's a pretty good way to do it.''
 At the White House, Mr. Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, said that it was ''not a time for retribution'' and that ''we're all best suited looking forward.''
 Ms. Pelosi, however, renewed her call for an independent panel to investigate the waterboarding and other harsh techniques approved by the Bush administration, a position shared by many of the more liberal Democrats in the House. 
 ''I have always been for a truth commission, because I think this is very important,'' Ms. Pelosi said.
 She added that her only question was what level of immunity to grant to potential witnesses before such a commission.
 Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, used the White House meeting to push for the release of more memorandums documenting the use of the harsh techniques, suggesting they could show that the interrogation methods were effective, as former Vice President Dick Cheney has claimed. 
 The president did not foreclose the release of more documents, officials briefed on the session said. But Mr. Obama suggested to Mr. Boehner that the additional information would not be definitive on the value of the information obtained from the detainees, they said.
 Although a full-scale independent inquiry now appears unlikely anytime soon, the Bush administration's use of waterboarding and other techniques that critics say crossed the line into torture could still be examined by a variety of Congressional panels in addition to the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
 Mr. Reid, who repeatedly denounced the use of harsh interrogation techniques when George W. Bush was president, suggested that naming a special panel would signal an intent to exact ''retribution,'' and he sought to paper over the disagreement with members of his own caucus, like Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, who have joined human rights groups in demanding a commission. 
 Mr. Reid said it was premature to act without the facts that will be provided by the Intelligence Committee. ''They will make a public report,'' he said. ''I hope that it will come toward the end of this year.'' 
 But it is actually unclear how much of the panel's findings will ever be made public. The chairwoman of the committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, has said it is too early to know how much can be reported publicly about an investigation that is dealing largely with classified information. 
 While the issue is getting less attention, Congress is also showing uncertainty over whether and how to pursue a broad investigation into the causes of the economic crisis. Some lawmakers have argued for a special Congressional committee to handle the inquiry while others want an outside panel with no Congressional ties to take on the job, to avoid any conflicts of interest.
 Such differences when considering extraordinary Congressional investigations are not unusual, and it can sometimes take time for lawmakers and the White House to settle on an approach. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the Bush administration at first strongly resisted any investigation. One was eventually initiated by the two Congressional Intelligence Committees before the independent Sept. 11 commission was established. 
 Mrs. Feinstein said her committee was best-equipped to carry out an inquiry. Its investigation began in early March, and aides said the panel had identified and requested a ''voluminous amount of documents'' related to C.I.A. detention and interrogation policies. 
 Mr. Boehner said the calls for a special tribunal were wrongheaded, adding that Ms. Pelosi and other legislative leaders had been briefed on the interrogation techniques long ago. 
 ''There's nothing here that should surprise her,'' Mr. Boehner said at a news conference.
 Other Republicans have called on the Obama administration to release still-secret documents that detail the information gleaned from suspects using the disputed interrogation methods. On Thursday, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. indicated a willingness to do so.
 ''It is certainly the intention of this administration not to play hide and seek, or not to release certain things,'' Mr. Holder said in testimony before the House Appropriations Committee

HEADLINE: Bloomberg's Spending on Re-election Bid Reaches $7.5 Million

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Six months before the election, Michael R. Bloomberg has already outspent his leading rival in the mayor's race by a seven-to-one ratio, despite a commanding lead in the polls. 
 With a fresh wave of television and radio commercials, the mayor has poured $7.5 million into the campaign so far, according to new records obtained by The New York Times. 
 In the process, he is shattering -- once again -- records for spending in a New York City election and running financial laps around his challengers. 
 William C. Thompson Jr., the city's comptroller and a Democratic candidate for mayor, has put $1.3 million into the race, city records show.
 The mayor's new advertising blitz features a tieless Mr. Bloomberg talking to middle-class New Yorkers about their economic anxieties, assuring them he has a plan to protect their jobs and keep the city affordable.
 The commercials suggest that, despite the mayor's wealth and the power of incumbency, his campaign is uneasy about how the volatile economy could affect voters' views of him.
 Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, has now spent more than the city's campaign finance laws allow Mr. Thompson -- or any other challenger accepting public financing -- to use in the race from now until the September primaries.
 Mr. Bloomberg is not accepting public financing, and therefore faces no spending limit.
 The spending gulf between the mayor and Mr. Thompson is prompting an outcry from several academics and good-government groups. 
 ''It's not anything approaching a fair race that allows each candidate to present their case on equal footing,'' said Chris McNickle, the author of ''To Be Mayor of New York: Ethnic Politics in the City.''
 He called the situation ''absolutely without precedent.''
 Mr. Bloomberg's campaign declined to confirm or deny the new spending figures, saying it would disclose such numbers in the next campaign finance disclosure form, due on May 15.
 But Mr. Bloomberg's campaign advisers say they are simply exploiting a financial advantage that the mayor, who founded the financial data firm Bloomberg L.P., has rightfully earned.
 ''Mayor Bloomberg has never taken a dollar of special interest money, and this November voters will again have an opportunity to support a candidate who is unbought and beholden only to the people of New York,'' said Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for the mayor's campaign.
 The data given to The Times show Mr. Bloomberg has spent $4.4 million on television ads and $121,000 on radio advertising. Of that, the campaign devoted $253,000 to TV ads aimed at Hispanic households and $11,000 on radio ads intended for Hispanic listeners.
 The ads, which have run on major radio and TV networks, including ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN and MSNBC, since the first week of April, began at an unusually early date. Until Mr. Bloomberg entered New York politics, mayoral campaigns did not start TV ads until August -- and the mayor, who has broken nearly every spending record, did not run TV ads until mid-May in 2005.
 So far, the comptroller's political advertising has consisted of a simple YouTube spot in which a campaign employee interviews New Yorkers on the street.
 Mr. Bloomberg has a double-digit lead over Mr. Thompson in the polls, and his spending rate is expected to become a flash point in the election. He has spent a total of nearly $160 million in the last two campaigns. His rivals argue he should limit advertising this time around to level the playing field.
 Mr. Thompson has his own potential advantages: Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by five to one in New York City (Mr. Bloomberg intends to run on the Republican and independent ballot lines).

HEADLINE: In Long Drive to Cure Cancer, Advances Have Been Elusive

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
In 1971, flush with the nation's success in putting a man on the Moon, President Richard M. Nixon announced a new goal. Cancer would be cured by 1976, the bicentennial.
 When 1976 came and went, the date for a cure, or at least substantial progress, kept being put off. It was going to happen by 2000, then by 2015. 
 Now, President Barack Obama, discussing his plans for health care, has vowed to find ''a cure'' for cancer in our time and said that, as part of the economic stimulus package, he would increase federal money for cancer research by a third for the next two years. 
 Cancer has always been an expensive priority. Since the war on cancer began, the National Cancer Institute, the federal government's main cancer research entity, with 4,000 employees, has alone spent $105 billion. And other government agencies, universities, drug companies and philanthropies have chipped in uncounted billions more. 
 Yet the death rate for cancer, adjusted for the size and age of the population, dropped only 5 percent from 1950 to 2005. In contrast, the death rate for heart disease dropped 64 percent in that time, and for flu and pneumonia, it fell 58 percent. 
 Still, the perception, fed by the medical profession and its marketers, and by popular sentiment, is that cancer can almost always be prevented. If that fails, it can usually be treated, even beaten.
 The good news is that many whose cancer has not spread do well, as they have in the past. In some cases, like early breast cancer, drugs introduced in the past decade have made an already good prognosis even better. And a few rare cancers, like chronic myeloid leukemia, can be controlled for years with new drugs. Cancer treatments today tend to be less harsh. Surgery is less disfiguring, chemotherapy less disabling.
 But difficulties arise when cancer spreads, and, often, it has by the time of diagnosis. That is true for the most common cancers as well as rarer ones. 
 With breast cancer, for example, only 20 percent with metastatic disease -- cancer that has spread outside the breast, like to bones, brain, lungs or liver -- live five years or more, barely changed since the war on cancer began. 
 With colorectal cancer, only 10 percent with metastatic disease survive five years. That number, too, has hardly changed over the past four decades. The number has long been about 30 percent for metastatic prostate cancer, and in the single digits for lung cancer.
 As for prevention, progress has been agonizingly slow. Only a very few things -- stopping smoking, for example -- make a difference. And despite marketing claims to the contrary, rigorous studies of prevention methods like high-fiber or low-fat diets, or vitamins or selenium, have failed to find an effect. 
 What has happened? Is cancer just an impossibly hard problem? Or is the United States, the only country to invest so much in cancer research, making fundamental mistakes in the way it fights the cancer war?
 Researchers say the answer is yes on both counts. Cancer is hard -- it is not one disease or, if it is, no one has figured out the weak link in cancer cells that would lead to a cure. Instead, cancer investigators say, the more they study cancer, the more complex it seems. Many are buoyed by recent progress in cancer molecular biology, but confess they have a long way to go.
 There also are unnecessary roadblocks. Research lurches from fad to fad -- cancer viruses, immunology, genomics. Advocacy groups have lobbied and directed research in ways that have not always advanced science. 
 And for all the money poured into cancer research, there has never been enough for innovative studies, the kind that can fundamentally change the way scientists understand cancer or doctors treat it. Such studies are risky, less likely to work than ones that are more incremental. The result is that, with limited money, innovative projects often lose out to more reliably successful projects that aim to tweak treatments, perhaps extending life by only weeks. 
 ''Actually, that is the biggest threat,'' said Dr. Robert C. Young, chancellor of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. ''Every organization says, 'Oh, we want to fund high-risk research.' And I think they mean it. But as a matter of fact, they don't do it.''
 A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found the public divided about progress. Older people, more likely to have friends or relatives who had died of cancer, were more dubious -- just 26 percent said a lot of progress had been made. The figure was 40 percent for middle-aged people, who may be more likely to know people who, with increased screening, had received a cancer diagnosis and seemed fine.
 Yet the grim facts about cancer can be lost among the positive messages from the news media, advocacy groups and medical centers, and even labels on foods and supplements, hinting that they can fight or prevent cancer. The words tend to be carefully couched, but their impression is unmistakable and welcomed: cancer is preventable if you just eat right and exercise. If you are screened regularly, cancers can be caught early and almost certainly will be cured. If by some awful luck, your cancer is potentially deadly, miraculous new treatments and more in the pipeline could cure you or turn your cancer into a manageable disease.
 Unfortunately, as many with cancer have learned, the picture is not always so glowing. 
 Phyllis Kutt, 61, a retired teacher in Cambridge, Mass., believed the advertisements and public service announcements. She thought she would never get cancer -- she is a vegetarian, she exercises, she is not overweight, she does not smoke. And only two people in her extended family ever had cancer. 
 Then, in May 2006, Ms. Kutt's mammogram showed a foggy spot. The radiologist decided it was insignificant, but six months later, her internist found a walnut-sized lump in her right breast close to her armpit. It was the area that had been foggy on the mammogram. 
 ''I was in real shock,'' Ms. Kutt said. ''How could this be happening to me?''
 Still, it looked as if she would be fine. There was no sign of cancer in her lymph nodes, and her surgeon removed the tumor. 
 Ms. Kutt, her husband and her oncologist were worried, though, and decided on aggressive treatment -- four months of chemotherapy followed by 33 rounds of radiation. When it ended, she thought she was finished with cancer.
 ''My doctors never used the word 'cure' and I bless them for that,'' Ms. Kutt said. ''But they do celebrate the end of chemo and they celebrate the end of radiation.'' 
 Last May the cancer came back, as a string of tiny lumps under her arm and a lump on her bicep. CT scans revealed she also had tumors in her lungs. 
 But cancer is curable, she thought. There are amazing new treatments. She found out otherwise.
 It turns out that, with few exceptions, mostly childhood cancers and testicular cancer, there is no cure once a cancer has spread. The best that can be done is to keep it at bay for a while. 
 Last June, Ms. Kutt started a new regimen -- three weeks of chemotherapy, followed by a week off. She is also taking a new drug, Avastin. 
 ''I am still on that and will be forever until the cancer progresses and I change to other drugs or some new drugs are developed, or I die,'' she said. 
 The hardest part is explaining to friends and family.
 ''People will say to me, 'So when is your treatment going to be over?' '' Ms. Kutt said. ''That's the perception. You get treated. You're done. You're cured.''
 ''I think some of my family members still believe that,'' she added. ''Even though I told them, they forget. I get cards from my nieces, 'How are you doing? You'll be done soon, right?' ''
 Dr. Leonard Saltz, a colon cancer specialist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, deals with misperceptions all the time. ''People too often come to us expecting that the newest drugs can cure widespread metastatic cancer,'' Dr. Saltz said. ''They are often shocked to find that the latest technology is not a cure.''
 One reason for the misunderstanding, he said, is the words that cancer researchers and drug companies often use. ''Sometimes by accident, sometimes deliberately, sometimes with the best intentions, sometimes not, we may paint a picture that is overly rosy,'' he said. 
 For example, a study may state that a treatment offers a ''significant survival advantage'' or a ''highly significant survival advantage.'' Too often, Dr. Saltz says, the word ''significant'' is mistaken to mean ''substantial,'' and ''improved survival'' is often interpreted as ''cure.''
 Yet in this context, ''significant'' means ''statistically significant,'' a technical way of saying there is a difference between two groups of patients that is unlikely to have occurred by chance. But the difference could mean simply surviving for a few more weeks or days. 
 Then there is ''progression-free survival,'' which doctors, researchers and companies use to mean the amount of time from the start of treatment until the tumor starts growing again. It does not mean that a patient lives longer, only that the cancer is controlled longer, perhaps for weeks or, at best, months. A better term would be ''progression-free interval,'' Dr. Saltz said. ''You don't need the word 'survival' in there.''
 As a doctor who tries to be honest with patients, Dr. Saltz says he sees the allure of illusions. 
 ''It would be very hard and insensitive to say, 'All I've got is a drug that will cost $10,000 a month and give you an average survival benefit of a month or two,' '' he said. ''The details are very, very tough to deal with.''
 That does not help Ms. Kutt, who chafes at the way breast cancer is presented -- the pink ribbons, the celebration of survivors, the emphasis on early detection, as though that will insure you will never get an incurable cancer.
 She knows she frightens people with her bald head, so obviously a cancer patient. When someone is on crutches with a broken ankle, strangers offer condolences and ask about the injury. But people avert their eyes when they see Ms. Kutt. Only once, she said, did a stranger approach, and that was a woman who also had breast cancer.
 And in her online discussion group of women with metastatic disease, some said they had been asked to leave breast cancer support groups. Members whose cancer had not spread considered themselves survivors, and those whose cancer had spread were too grim a reminder of what could happen.
 ''It's fear,'' Ms. Kutt said. ''You're part of the death group.''

HEADLINE: Mizuho of Japan Warns of $6 Billion Loss for Year

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The Mizuho Financial Group, which rode to Wall Street's rescue last year with a billion-dollar investment in the troubled investment bank Merrill Lynch, warned Thursday that it would have a record loss of 580 billion yen ($5.9 billion) for the year. 
 It is a quick turnabout for Mizuho, Japan's second-largest bank by assets, which in January forecast a profit of 100 billion yen for the year that ended March 31. Last year, it made a profit of 311 billion yen. 
 Japanese banks were at first relatively unscathed by the credit crisis, and several stepped up to recapitalize troubled United States financial institutions last year. They made risky, high-profile bets after years of caution in the wake of Japan's own banking crisis of the 1990s.
 As the financial crisis worsened in September, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan's largest bank, bought a 20 percent stake in the Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley for $9 billion. Japan's top brokerage firm, Nomura Holdings, snapped up the European and Asian operations of the failed Lehman Brothers Holdings.
 Mizuho's recapitalization of Merrill Lynch occurred earlier, in January 2008, when it said it would provide $1.2 billion by purchasing preferred shares. Merrill Lynch was subsequently bought by Bank of America Corporation in a hastily arranged deal in September.
 But the Japanese banks' own businesses soon faltered because of write-downs in the value of their vast shareholdings as stock markets plunged amid the global economic turmoil. Japan's banks have traditionally held stakes in clients to bolster ties, a practice that has left them painfully exposed to swings in the stock market. Japan's Nikkei index has lost about 30 percent of its value since September.
 The stakes in hobbled American financial institutions have also weighed on balance sheets at Japanese banks, forcing them to raise billions of yen in new capital. Analysts have said that Japan's biggest banks may soon need to tap public money.
 Mizuho's forecast annual loss followed a profit warning from another top Japanese banking group, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial.
 Sumitomo Mitsui bank said it faced a loss of 390 billion yen for the 12 months to March because of the worsening economy and its investment in the British bank Barclays last year.
 Nomura will report its annual results on Friday.

HEADLINE: Insurance and the Feds

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Regulate Me, Please,'' by Tom Wilson, the chairman of Allstate (Op-Ed, April 16), missed the mark. 
 Mr. Wilson characterizes the credit default swaps of American International Group's noninsurance subsidiary as insurance. They are not. Parties to the ''swaps'' in question did not have insurable interest in the risk. 
 To participate in such activities, the subsidiary operated under ''optional'' federal oversight with less stringent regulatory requirements, much as Mr. Wilson and proponents of a federal charter wish to do.
 Consumers can be assured that A.I.G.'s state-regulated insurance entities are solvent and continue to pay claims. Unfortunately, federal oversight proponents are exploiting consumers' fears in a self-serving attempt to justify the deregulation of the business of insurance. This is dangerous and threatens consumer confidence in the industry.
 Federal regulatory structures need to be updated to better identify and manage systemic risk. In so doing, however, we believe that consumer access to state-based, local regulatory officials must be maintained. Local, responsive assistance, which exists in the current state-based system of insurance regulation, is the hallmark of consumer protection.
 We have shared our principles of reform with Congress and the administration. We will continue to work together to develop reforms that preserve the successful models of the state-based insurance regulatory system. 
 Therese M. Vaughan Roger Sevigny Washington, April 17, 2009
 The writers are, respectively, chief executive and president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Mr. Sevigny is also New Hampshire's insurance commissioner.
 To the Editor: 
 Tom Wilson, the chief executive of Allstate, argues for the elimination of state oversight of the insurance industry in favor of a federal regulator. But state regulators have done a lot better than the feds, with policyholder money protected and claims being paid despite the economic crisis. 
 In fact, federal banking regulators at the Office of Thrift Supervision were supposed to oversee American International Group's credit default swaps and have acknowledged their failure to Congress.
 What the insurance industry really wants is to escape tough state rules, like those that prohibit excessive profit, overhead and executive salaries in California, or mandate an affordable lifeline auto insurance program for low-income drivers. Our consumer group intervened before the California insurance commissioner to force Allstate to lower its homeowner's and auto insurance rates by $500 million last year because of strong state laws that Mr. Wilson hopes to evade. 
 Federal insurance regulation is the sheep in wolf's clothing -- a surface promise of tough oversight to hide the coming deregulation.

HEADLINE: U.S. Loses a Trade Case Over Japanese Steel Imports

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: GENEVA 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization ruled against the United States on Friday in a trade case, saying that it continued to apply illegal import duties on Japanese steel products and ball bearings. 
 The 65-page verdict said that Washington had failed to change how it sets fees for goods it suspects are being sold in the United States at below-market value, despite previous rulings that the United States was violating international trade rules.
 If there is no appeal, Japan can ask the global trade body to authorize sanctions against American goods to force compliance. 
 It said last year that the fees were costing Japanese industry $248.5 million each year.
 The office of the United States trade representative had no comment.
 The United States has lost similar disputes with the European Union, Canada and others over how it determines antidumping fees for foreign goods.
 Governments investigate dumping when they suspect foreign producers are exporting goods at artificially low prices -- usually as a result of subsidies or in an attempt to corner a market.
 W.T.O. panels have consistently found that the United States overestimates how far below market value imports are, and as a result penalizes them with antidumping duties that are too high.

HEADLINE: A 21st-Century Makeover for a 19th-Century Wonder

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI

 BODY:
The buds have barely appeared on the trees, but for Peter Melewski, the engineer charged with turning the historic Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge into a 21st-century pedestrian walkway, the autumn deadline is fast approaching, with much still to be done.
 When it opened in 1889, the Poughkeepsie-Highland bridge was the first Hudson River rail crossing north of New York City, intended as a more direct route to move freight between New England's industrial center and the Midwest's agriculture. At one time as many as 50 trains a day used the bridge, said Fred Schaeffer, a Poughkeepsie lawyer who heads the bridge renovation committee, Walkway Over the Hudson. 
 ''It was a key factor in the Industrial Revolution,'' Mr. Schaeffer said. In 1974, when the bridge traffic had dropped to just one train a day, a fire damaged a section of the deck, closing it for good.
 In his book ''Bridging the Hudson,'' Carleton Mabee, a professor at the State University of New York at New Paltz, writes that when the bridge was new the iron and steel structure was described as ''built to last forever.'' Its four massive support legs were sunk so deep into the river bed that even now, engineers have found, they have not moved an inch. 
 In its early years it was one of the longest bridges in the world and, at 6,700 feet, is still impressively long, shorter by 2,200 feet than the Golden Gate Bridge and longer by the same amount than the Sydney Harbor Bridge. Its length and dizzying height, 212 feet, contribute to accolades even today. ''It's phenomenal what they were able to achieve during that period,'' said Mr. Melewski, a partner in the engineering firm Bergmann and Associates. ''It's quite a landmark. It had a lot of firsts.''
 That Mr. Melewski and others -- a coterie of steelworkers, crane operators and cement layers -- are even engaged in this $35 million project to reopen the bridge to pedestrians, bicyclists and in-line skaters is notable, considering that earlier attempts to resuscitate it were stymied for years by bickering among preservationists over the best way forward. But once work began, it progressed agreeably and quickly. 
 Local residents were energized by the idea of uniting Dutchess and Ulster Counties with a multipurpose recreational trail. Businesses near the riverfront saw the project as a boon. The region is preparing for an influx of tourists eager to see the bridge, which will become part of the state park system.
 ''You remember the 'I Love Lucy' episode where she's on the candy assembly line, and the belt just keeps on going?'' Mr. Melewski asked during a engineering walk-through of the site. There was no need to continue the analogy: That the project must progress in an assembly-line fashion was evident as the newly installed concrete walkway panels gave way to a decidedly less substantial aluminum catwalk that shimmied in the breeze high over the river. From that point, repairs to the underlying structure must be completed before the deck panels can be installed. 
 Mr. Melewski was animated as he explained it all, with pencil diagrams and in commentary peppered with talk of trusses, piers and cross bracing. In the world of engineering, this is one of the sexier assignments.
 ''I hear from a lot of engineers when I go and do presentations -- they say: 'That is so cool. You're so lucky to be working on that project.' '' Mr. Melewski said, showing off the span from below. ''Yeah, this is very cool. In my profession this is a once-in-a-lifetime project.''
 Mr. Schaeffer said, ''It took 20 years for it to materialize in the 1860s, and people laughed.'' Construction progressed in fits and starts while ambitious plans were drawn and the economy faltered. That was then. His experience with the restoration, which began in 1993, was not much different. ''People thought it was crazy idea in the beginning, but gradually everybody began to believe in it.'' 
 The rebirth of the Poughkeepsie bridge did not really get going until 2007, when the Dyson Foundation, a local philanthropic group, donated $2.1 million to pay for an assessment of just how damaging time and neglect had been. Special inspections were required -- with engineers suspended from ropes to view the sides and support structures and scuba divers with sonar checking the condition of the piers. 
 ''When the inspection came back, it was: This bridge is in fabulous condition -- there's no reason why it can't be done with a small amount of bridge repair and a fair amount of work,'' recalled Amy Husten, the executive director of Walkway Over the Hudson.
 A fair amount of work it has been. ''Most engineers would say it's harder to do a bridge rehab than to design a new bridge because a new bridge -- once you figure out the soils, you have a clean slate; everything is new and you know how it goes together,'' he said. ''But to take an old bridge and rehab it, that's the hardest thing to do.'' 
 With it established that repairing the bridge would be far less expensive than tearing it down, there was just one question left. Could the money be raised? It could.
 ''It became a partnership between federal and state government, businesses, foundations and it mobilized the whole community to get behind it,'' Mr. Schaeffer said. ''Everybody got behind it because they saw how good it was going to be.'' 
 Mr. Melewski found the enthusiasm contagious, and soon he was committing Bergman and Associates to renovate the bridge in two years' time. The 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson's exploration of the river, being celebrated with events throughout 2009, also became part of his inspiration.
 ''One of the reasons we got the project -- we were the only idiots that said, 'We can get this done,' because most people in my office thought I was nuts,'' he said. ''And I wouldn't have said it unless I thought we could do it.''

HEADLINE: New Worries For Next Tier Of Banks

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Absent fresh details on how the nation's 19 largest banks fared in a new government test of their health, analysts are turning the spotlight on a handful of major regional banks that they reckon may be the next weak links in the financial industry. 
 On Friday, the Federal Reserve reported that the banks whose books it had analyzed recently had enough capital to offset a raft of new losses, reinforcing the belief that the government would support the largest banks even if their financial health eroded, and buoying the stock market. 
 But the agency warned that banks would need a new cushion of financing on top of the current minimum levels as a buffer against higher losses if the economy worsened. That guideline, analysts say, could force at least a handful of banks, including several regional lenders, to sell large amounts of common stock to the government or private investors.
 While Citigroup and Bank of America remain troubled, regional banks subject to the government's tests -- including Regions Financial of Alabama, SunTrust Banks of Georgia and KeyCorp and Fifth Third of Ohio -- are girding for huge losses. They are among the hardest hit by the housing bust, and are saddled with a pile of commercial real estate and corporate loans expected to sour further this year. Regions Financial, for example, added just $35 million to its reserves for future loan losses in the first quarter, an amount analysts say may not be enough to cover a surge in its nonperforming loans. 
 Regulators met top executives from the 19 banks behind closed doors at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Friday, and at some of the 12 other regional Fed Bank offices, to review the preliminary results of the tests and inform bankers how much additional capital they must raise.
 The information will not be publicly released until May 4, although the banks have the next several days to dispute any of the findings of the tests. 
 On Friday, Morgan Stanley came forward with its own analysis of which banks might need to raise capital, the latest in a series of private estimates being tallied to allow gambling investors to position themselves to profit from fluctuations in the stock prices of the banks.
 The report identified SunTrust, KeyCorp and Regions Financial -- all major regional banks -- as those that the government would probably determine needed billions in additional capital. Bank of America and Wells Fargo fall into a ''gray zone,'' the report said. Earlier this week, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a boutique investment bank, said all of the 19 banks might need a total of $1 trillion of fresh capital. 
 David H. Ellison, the chief investment officer of FBR Equity Funds, a mutual fund that invests in financial stocks, said all the uncertainty around the stress test results might provide opportunities for big gains. He has viewed at least a half dozen of such makeshift stress tests produced by research firms. ''You make most of your money in financial stocks from going from ugly to O.K., not from good to great,'' he said. ''Right now, we are ugly.'' 
 Even before official stress test results are released, the gap between the strongest and weakest banks has been widening. Among those best positioned to withstand a sharp downtown without needing capital, analysts say, are the major investment and custodial banks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, the State Street Corporation and Bank of New York Mellon. A handful of well-run commercial banks, like JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bancorp, are unlikely to need additional money.
 Besides the regional lenders, a few big banks are also staring down trouble. Citigroup, which has been bruised by the credit crisis, has already announced plans to strengthen itself by converting a portion of the government's $45 billion preferred stock investment into common shares. Some analysts say that GMAC, the privately held finance arm of General Motors, and Bank of America may need to consider taking similar action. 
 Federal officials said that some banks might need to raise additional capital. Others might need to change the form of their existing capital by converting preferred shares into common stock, which is better at absorbing losses. Both measures could dilute existing shareholders or give the government a greater stake.
 The prospects of the remaining lenders are even more unclear. Their fate rests wherever federal banking regulators draw the line on how much capital is enough to provide a cushion. Big credit card lenders, like American Express and Capital One, have huge numbers of customers defaulting on their bills, but they typically set aside more money to cover losses than traditional banks. The BB&T Corporation of North Carolina, PNC Financial and Wells Fargo all showcased their ability to generate earnings in the first quarter, but face a coming wave of heavy losses. MetLife Bank, which is part of the insurance giant, is also a wild card.
 Even so, investors found some relief in the vague 21-page report on stress tests put out Friday afternoon by the Fed. In fact, after starting the day down on nervousness that the report would reveal more trouble at the banks, financial stocks rose sharply when the report suggested the 19 banks were well capitalized. 
 Mr. Ellison said the Fed's report seemed to suggest that the stress test results would not be worse than Wall Street expected. 
 ''Three months ago, all the banks were going to be nationalized and you might just give up and go home,'' he said. ''We are now getting a reality check on how bad it is: sure, it's bad, but it's not the end of the world.''

HEADLINE: Don't Waste Time Cutting Emissions

BYLINE: By BJORN LOMBORG. 
Bjorn Lomborg is the director of the Copenhagen Consensus Center at Copenhagen Business School and the author of ''Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming.''

DATELINE: Copenhagen 

 BODY:
 WE are often told that tackling global warming should be the defining task of our age -- that we must cut emissions immediately and drastically. But people are not buying the idea that, unless we act, the planet is doomed. Several recent polls have revealed Americans' growing skepticism. Solving global warming has become their lowest policy priority, according to a new Pew survey. 
 Moreover, strategies to reduce carbon have failed. Meeting in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, politicians from wealthy countries promised to cut emissions by 2000, but did no such thing. In Kyoto in 1997, leaders promised even stricter reductions by 2010, yet emissions have kept increasing unabated. Still, the leaders plan to meet in Copenhagen this December to agree to even more of the same -- drastic reductions in emissions that no one will live up to. Another decade will be wasted. 
 Fortunately, there is a better option: to make low-carbon alternatives like solar and wind energy competitive with old carbon sources. This requires much more spending on research and development of low-carbon energy technology. We might have assumed that investment in this research would have increased when the Kyoto Protocol made fossil fuel use more expensive, but it has not. 
 Economic estimates that assign value to the long-term benefits that would come from reducing warming -- things like fewer deaths from heat and less flooding -- show that every dollar invested in quickly making low-carbon energy cheaper can do $16 worth of good. If the Kyoto agreement were fully obeyed through 2099, it would cut temperatures by only 0.3 degrees Fahrenheit. Each dollar would do only about 30 cents worth of good.
 The Copenhagen agreement should instead call for every country to spend one-twentieth of a percent of its gross domestic product on low-carbon energy research and development. That would increase the amount of such spending 15-fold to $30 billion, yet the total cost would be only a sixth of the estimated $180 billion worth of lost growth that would result from the Kyoto restrictions. 
 Kyoto-style emissions cuts can only ever be an expensive distraction from the real business of weaning ourselves off fossil fuels. The fact is, carbon remains the only way for developing countries to work their way out of poverty. Coal burning provides half of the world's electricity, and fully 80 percent of it ok? in China and India, where laborers now enjoy a quality of life that their parents could barely imagine. 
 No green energy source is inexpensive enough to replace coal now. Given substantially more research, however, green energy could be cheaper than fossil fuels by mid-century. 
 Sadly, the old-style agreement planned for Copenhagen this December will have a negligible effect on temperatures. This renders meaningless any declarations of ''success'' that might be made after the conference. We must challenge the orthodoxy of Kyoto and create a smarter, more realistic strategy.

HEADLINE: Iron Pipe Maker Is Fined $8 Million for Violations

BYLINE: By DAVID BARSTOW

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
McWane Inc., a major manufacturer of cast iron water pipes, was fined $8 million on Friday for dozens of workplace safety and environmental crimes at its New Jersey plant, the culmination of a multistate series of federal prosecutions against the Alabama-based conglomerate that began in 2003.
 The prosecutions of McWane represented one of the most significant federal crackdowns against workplace safety and environmental crimes of the last decade. The cases revealed a corporation that for years routinely lied to regulators, sometimes altering accident scenes, sometimes fabricating documents and sometimes bullying employees into giving false information to the authorities. 
 In the New Jersey case, the final one pending against McWane, a jury convicted the corporation and four of its managers in 2006 of repeatedly conspiring to deceive regulators at McWane's foundry in Phillipsburg, N.J., the Atlantic States Cast Iron Pipe Company. In long-delayed hearings this week, Judge Mary L. Cooper of United States District Court sentenced the four Atlantic States managers to prison sentences ranging from 6 months to 70 months.
 On Friday, it was McWane's turn. The company faced a maximum fine of $15 million for its conviction on 30 counts. 
 Addressing Judge Cooper, McWane's president, G. Ruffner Page, expressed regret for the McWane employees who had been injured or killed, and for the communities whose air and water were fouled by the company. 
 ''This experience has been extremely painful for this company, and for me personally,'' he said. ''All of us are deeply sorry.''
 Federal prosecutors, with investigators from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the F.B.I., began investigating McWane in response to articles in The New York Times and a companion documentary on the PBS program ''Frontline.'' They described a Dickensian corporate culture that put production and profits ahead of all other considerations, including the well-being of its 6,000 employees, who toil in one of the nation's most dangerous industries. 
 Mr. Page told Judge Cooper that the publicity and prosecutions prompted intense soul-searching among McWane's senior executives. He said the company redoubled its efforts to improve its record, spending hundreds of millions of dollars on improvements, hiring dozens of new safety and environmental managers and, in time, replacing more than 90 percent of the company's top management.
 ''We have to earn back our reputation,'' he said. ''We are a better company in every way as a result of the transformation we've been through.''
 But Andrew D. Goldsmith, the federal prosecutor who led the McWane investigation, expressed skepticism that McWane had changed. He pointed out that many of the company's reforms did not begin until after it became aware that it was the target of a multistate investigation. He also asserted that the corporation had tried to derail the prosecution by hiring politically connected former government officials.
 ''This is the true McWane philosophy,'' he said, after ticking off a long list of crimes committed by McWane managers.
 Judge Cooper, though, was plainly persuaded by McWane's efforts. ''It comes before the court,'' she said, ''with actions of reform, and it has instituted systems and attitudes and upgrades that were hard to accomplish.''
 She also cited McWane as a source of blue-collar jobs in a hard-hit economy, and she took note of what many employees at Atlantic States said about working conditions today. ''They say it's not the same place,'' she said. 
 But just in case, Judge Cooper placed McWane on four years probation and said she would appoint a monitor to ensure that the company makes every effort to comply with all regulations.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Unfazed by Stress Test Details

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
Investors are unlikely to know the results of the government's stress tests of major banks until May 4, but Wall Street cleared one hurdle on Friday: stocks did not lose their footing after regulators laid out how they were conducting the assessments.
 Shares pushed higher even though few details were forthcoming on the ratios and metrics being used to determine whether banks need to raise more capital. Still, investors speculated that most of the 19 financial institutions were well capitalized and would not need huge new infusions of capital from private investors or the government. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 119.23 points, or 1.5 percent, to 8,076.29. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 14.31 points, or 1.68 percent, to 866.23. The Nasdaq composite index gained 42.08 points, or 2.55 percent, to 1,694.29.
 But even with the day's gains, stocks were slightly lower for the week, breaking a six-week winning streak. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.7 percent for the week, while the Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 0.4 percent. Even so, the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.3 percent. 
 Energy companies and producers of basic materials led the market, as commodities like copper and sugar gained ground and oil prices rose above $50 a barrel, buoyed by hopes that the economic decline was slowing. Crude oil for June delivery settled at $51.55 a barrel, up $1.93.
 Investors, who had braced for grim news about corporate earnings, cheered less-bad reports from some major American companies. 
 The automaker Ford Motor reported a $1.4 billion loss for the first quarter, but said it was spending money at a slower pace and did not expect to seek government aid. Two of its competitors, General Motors and Chrysler, have taken billions in government money, and both are facing the possibility of bankruptcy.
 Shares of Ford rose 51 cents, or 11.36 percent, to $5. After slipping to less than $2 in February, Ford's stock has rebounded as investors bet that the company is better positioned than its rivals.
 American Express and Microsoft also surprised investors after the markets closed on Thursday. 
 American Express reported net income of $437 million in the first three months of the year, beating analysts' forecasts. It said it hoped to repay the government's financial bailout money once regulators finished conducting stress tests on the company's health.
 Shares of American Express gained $3.33, or 20.7 percent, to $25.30, pacing other companies in the financial sector on Friday. Shares of major banks like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase rose, but Citigroup declined as investors read through the Fed's 21-page summary of how it conducted the stress tests.
 Shares of Microsoft gained $1.99, or 10.5 percent, to $20.91. The personal computer company said Thursday that both earnings and revenue fell, but investors took solace from Microsoft's cost-cutting efforts. 
 Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods fell 0.8 percent in March, after a 2.1 percent increase in February. Although it was the seventh decline in eight months, economists had been expecting an even steeper drop of 1.5 percent, and saw a silver lining in a 4.4 percent rise in new orders for civilian aircraft.
 A report on sales of new homes in March said they were down again, but less than expected. Sales of new single-family homes fell to an annual rate of 356,000, a decline of 0.6 percent from February and 30.6 percent below last year. Wall Street had expected an annual pace of 337,000 in sales.
 Prices for government debt dropped sharply, pushing yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to 2.99 percent, up from 2.92 Thursday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction from the yield, fell 19/32, to 97 31/32.
 Analysts say that investors who had flocked to safe-haven government debt at the height of the financial crisis are now looking for greater returns in corporate bonds and municipal debt, and growing wary about the vast new supplies of Treasuries that will hit the market as the government raises money to finance its huge stimulus projects.

To the Editor:
 ''In State Pension Inquiry, a Scandal Snowballs'' (front page, April 18) is absolutely right that ''pay to play'' practices should have no place in public pension fund management. In that regard, New York should look to California, where Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed a rule preventing that practice. In 2006, our teachers' pension fund adopted that rule, and we're hopeful that our public employee pension fund will soon follow suit.

HEADLINE: Unemployment in Spain Hits 17.4%

BYLINE: By VICTORIA BURNETT

DATELINE: MADRID 

 BODY:
The number of unemployed people in Spain rose to a record four million in the first quarter as the economy continued to shed jobs created over the last decade by inexpensive credit and a real estate bubble.
 The Spanish unemployment rate climbed to 17.4 percent, from 13.9 percent in the final quarter of 2008, or more than twice the European Union average, the National Statistics Institute said Friday. The 802,800 increase in the ranks of the jobless was the largest quarterly increase in more than 30 years.
 ''These figures are bad and worse than expected,'' the finance minister, Elena Salgado, said. The sharp quarterly increase was a sign of ''how severe and how deep the crisis is,'' she said. 
 Spain's grim employment news came as Britain's national statistics office on Friday reported a 1.9 percent drop in gross domestic product in the first quarter from a year earlier, the largest quarterly decline in output recorded since 1979. 
 It was the third successive quarter of economic contraction in the British economy and cast doubt on projections last week by Alistair Darling, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, that the economy would start to recover by 2010 after shrinking 3.5 percent this year. 
 ''These figures make his forecasts very difficult to achieve,'' said James Knightley, a senior economist for ING in London. He said he expected the British economy to shrink 4 to 4.5 percent this year and predicted that Britain's broad-based decline, with a steep 6.2 percent drop in manufacturing, would be reflected across Europe and the United States. 
 Amid the gloom from Britain and Spain, data from Germany offered a bright spot Friday, suggesting that confidence in the economy might be turning the corner. The Ifo Institute in Munich said corporate sentiment rose in April to its highest level in five months. The business climate index, based on a poll of around 7,000 companies, rose to 83.7, from 82.2 in March, according to Reuters. 
 Meanwhile, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France announced a plan to spend more than 1 billion euros ($1.32 billion), on youth job initiatives in a move to counter a potentially explosive rise in unemployment among people under 25, Reuters reported on Friday. 
 In Spain, Ms. Salgado said she expected unemployment to rise more slowly in the coming months as government employment programs took effect. The government has announced stimulus measures of about 71 billion euros this year in an effort to replace jobs lost in construction and help businesses get credit.
 But economic analysts said the government's optimism had little credibility given the consistent discrepancy between its projections and the economic reality. The labor minister, Celestino Corbacho, predicted in January that unemployment would not reach four million, while the central bank this month said it would reach a maximum of 17.1 percent this year. 
 Debate continued this last week in Spain -- and elsewhere -- about how much the government could afford to stretch its budget deficit to stimulate the economy and cover the costs of supporting the unemployed. 
 The Bank of Spain has warned of little room for additional spending, with Spain's public sector deficit on track to hit 8.3 percent of G.D.P. this year and its ratio of debt-to-G.D.P. set to reach 50 percent. The bank's governor, Miguel Fernandez Ordonez has said that the social security system could go into deficit this year. 
 But Jose Antonio Herce, chief economist at Analistas Financieros Internacionales, a financial consultancy, said new stimulus packages were needed. 
 ''There is a little margin to spend more, and what margin there is should be exhausted on productive infrastructure that will help the economy in the long term,'' he said, adding that there was room to increase Spain's budget deficit by about two more points of G.D.P. ''What we need next is for the government to produce a clear plan which explains to the taxpayer how it is going to fix this mess -- going all the way through till 2019.''

HEADLINE: Auctions for Troubled Property Loans Jump to the Web

BYLINE: By JOHN COLLINS RUDOLF

 BODY:
It is not a game for novices or for anyone lacking courage. But for investors with the right expertise and a serious appetite for risk, the credit crisis is shaping up as a once-in-a-lifetime chance to buy troubled real estate assets on the cheap.
 A brisk trade in some of these assets is already under way, with investors buying and selling billions of dollars in distressed bank loans backed by collateral like homes, land and commercial properties. Many of these problem loans trade on eBay-like auction Web sites, which have grown rapidly over the last year.
 ''All of a sudden, it's in vogue to want to buy distressed assets,'' said Kingsley Greenland, president of DebtX, the industry leader in online loan sales. ''Pools of capital are forming all over.'' 
 Offline, additional billions in troubled loans change hands in a loosely regulated market of transactions among bankers, brokers and investors. 
 Most of these loans trade for a fraction of their original value, a tantalizing target for investors. Yet with the economy mired in recession and real estate values still falling in many markets, aggressive bidders risk overpaying even for assets that appear cheap.
 ''The whole art to all this is figuring out which one is an opportunity and which one's a trap,'' said Chris Moench, who manages a distressed-debt investment fund in St. Petersburg, Fla. ''If you don't buy the thing right, you're never going to make any money.'' 
 Buying loans is a far different proposition from simply buying real estate. The new owner of a delinquent home mortgage, for instance, must essentially take over where the previous lender left off. That means working out a more affordable payment plan with the borrower or foreclosing on the property. 
 ''It's not a quick buck,'' said John Martin, a real estate investor in Foster City, Calif. ''Once you've acquired a note, the challenge is to manage it.'' 
 Investing in troubled loans is also decidedly unglamorous, with buyers commonly referred to as bottom-feeders or vultures. ''This is opportunistic investing, however you want to term it,'' Mr. Moench said.
 Nonetheless, the interest in distressed loans is surging. This February, nearly 2,700 investors registered to bid on DebtX's auction Web site, more than 10 times the number of registrants from the same month last year. The company sold notes worth more than $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008, triple its sales from the same period in 2007.
 DebtX, along with First Financial Network, a loan sale advisory firm in Oklahoma City, has a contract to sell loans from failed banks for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Additional firms are being enlisted in the agency's loan sale effort, David Barr, an F.D.I.C. spokesman, said in an e-mail message.
 The emergence of online auctions represents a major evolution for the loan sale market, which began in the aftermath of the savings and loan crisis in the early 1990s. Once that crisis ended, the secondary market for loans continued to expand, with bankers turning to note sales as an alternative to working out delinquent loans internally. The first online auctions for loans emerged early this decade.
 ''We didn't have the resources or the contacts to go out and get a bunch of buyers from around the country,'' said Kelly George, president of mBank, a community bank based in Manistique, Mich., who has sold loans using DebtX. ''They provided an auction block for these troubled debts.''
 Since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007, the volume of trade in distressed loans has ballooned, according to industry insiders and banking analysts. The F.D.I.C. has been a particularly active seller, auctioning off billions in loans seized from failed banks. 
 The precise volume is difficult to gauge, however. The market is largely unregulated, and while loans are increasingly being sold online, billions of dollars more in loans are traded in relative secrecy by banks and loan brokers. Most experts believe that, even with the recent increases, banks have sold only a fraction of the troubled loans on their books. 
 ''You're going to see so much more transaction volume in the next three to four years that it's going to dwarf, probably by 20 times, what we've seen in the last two years,'' said Chris Marinac, a bank analyst at FIG Partners in Atlanta.
 Though experts urge caution, some small investors are beginning to see these distressed loans -- particularly delinquent home mortgages -- as the next opportunity in real estate. 
 Two new auction Web sites, www.LoanMarket.net and www.BigBidder.com, opened earlier this year, selling troubled residential mortgages on a piecemeal basis. 
 ''If you're interested in buying 1, 2 or 10 notes, you can absolutely do it,'' said Paul Lyons, senior vice president with the LFC Group of Companies, a real estate auction firm behind the Big Bidder site. 
 Dean Engle, a real estate investor in San Francisco, recently created a correspondence course teaching people how to buy and manage distressed mortgages.
 ''The discounts can be massive and the profits are great,'' Mr. Engle says in a video promoting the course. 
 Owen Enaohwo, 26, of Laurel, Md., finished Mr. Engle's course. He hopes eventually to buy troubled loans. ''I'm trying to raise the funds to take down big assets,'' Mr. Enaohwo said.
 As vast amounts of troubled debt move from bank balance sheets into the hands of private investors, intermediaries like DebtX, which earn a commission on each loan sold, stand to profit. The loan sales they facilitate may play a role in restoring order to the country's financial system. 
 ''I believe this is the way to clean up the economy,'' said Mr. Greenland, who began his career as a loan workout officer. ''Whoever's saying that bad assets can't be moved off of banks' balance sheets -- they can. It's a pricing issue. It's not that there's not liquidity out there.'' 
 Loan sales do have their limitations, though. By disposing of loans outright, sellers forfeit their ability to share in any eventual profits if the values of the loans recover -- one reason many banks are resisting what they regard as fire sales. 
 To capture potential profits from a recovery, the F.D.I.C. has begun selling minority interests of large loan portfolios to private investors, while retaining the majority stake for itself.
 Loan sale advisers like DebtX rarely sell so-called toxic securities, like those created from bundles of subprime mortgages, credit card debt or home equity lines of credit. It is so unclear to potential buyers what these complex instruments are worth that they have been difficult for banks and other financial institutions to price and sell. 
 The troubles of many regional and community banks stem not from exotic securities, but from rising default rates on garden-variety mortgages and other conventional loans, like those to home builders. These loans, backed by collateral like land and houses, have proved attractive to investors -- at the right price. 
 And if the federal government ultimately finds itself forced to seize and liquidate vast pools of troubled assets quickly, as in the aftermath of the savings and loan crisis, online loan auctions could prove effective in drawing substantial capital.
 ''One problem in the 1990s was that these auctions were decentralized. We didn't have the technology we have today,'' said Tomasz Piskorski, assistant professor of finance and economics at Columbia Business School. ''Now we could essentially invite the entire world to bid on these assets.''

HEADLINE: Anonymous Donor Gives Millions to Colleges, but Not a Cent for Publicity

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
The call typically comes from a banker, bringing word of a fairy godmother. This is followed quickly by a check arriving in the mail -- or two checks, the larger earmarked for scholarships for women and minority students, the smaller to be spent at the recipient's discretion. 
 The only catch, for at least a dozen colleges and universities that have benefited from the surprise largess over the past two months, is that the donor must remain anonymous. Not just to the public, as is typical, but to the institution itself. No one on campus -- not the president, not the public relations staff, not the chief fund-raiser -- can know where the money came from.
 And no one seems to care, especially as the economic crisis bears down on higher education in the form of shrinking endowments and heightened demand for financial aid. Indeed, the mysterious sprinkling of nearly $70 million on schools including Binghamton University in New York, Montclair State University in New Jersey, the University of Southern Mississippi and, with an announcement on Thursday, Michigan State University, has become a sweet diversion and a huge lift. 
 ''Clearly, whoever it is wishes to remain anonymous and I, for one, am perfectly happy to respect that,'' said Susan A. Cole, president of Montclair State, which received a call from a Wells Fargo representative followed immediately by gifts of $4 million and $1 million in late March. ''In the best of times we never have enough scholarship money for students who have financial need. In these difficult times, that is multiplied. The gift is incredibly important to us. I cannot adequately express the depth of our gratitude.''
 While no one wants to jeopardize the money by speculating about its possible sources, within the quiet halls of institutional advancement -- as college fund-raising departments are often called -- theories abound. 
 Is it an individual or a foundation? Is it a woman (given that the presidents of all the beneficiary institutions are women)? Is there any significance to the types of institutions chosen (all but one, Kalamazoo College in Michigan, are public) or their location (about half in the East, but also Iowa, Indiana, Colorado)? 
 ''It's a favorite parlor game in higher education,'' said Jeff Palmer, a spokesman for Kalamazoo, which has 1,350 students and received $2 million. ''Who's the mysterious donor?''
 Ann E. Kaplan, the director of the Voluntary Support of Education survey at the Council for Aid to Education, a nonprofit research group in Manhattan, surmised that the donor might wish to avoid the pressure of additional giving in the future. ''It's a lot of money but it's not stratospheric,'' she said. ''If it's not one of the wealthiest individuals in the world, it's possible the donor doesn't want to develop a long-term relationship with any of these institutions.''
 There is hardly a clue in the letters accompanying the checks; one letter, for example, was written on a bank's stationery. ''It is hoped that this will make a substantial difference to your students during these challenging times,'' they say, ''enabling a more confident, sharper focus on their studies with improved career and life prospects.''
 Michigan State got the largest amount ($10 million), while Purdue University in Indiana was close behind, with $8 million. The smallest donation, $1.5 million, went to the University of North Carolina Asheville; a larger University of North Carolina campus -- in Greensboro -- reaped $6 million. In each case, 50 percent to 80 percent of the total was designated for financial aid.
 Many of these public institutions have relatively small endowments and are being squeezed by state budget cuts, even as more families priced out of private schools are flooding their admissions offices. More than a few said the gift was their largest ever. 
 ''Particularly for public universities, we don't have 100 years or 400 years of tradition for getting private support, and that's a very different kind of culture,'' said Robert W. Groves, vice president for university advancement at Michigan State.
 David F. Wolf, vice president for advancement at the University of Southern Mississippi, which received $6 million ($5 million of it earmarked for scholarships), called the gift, the largest in the school's history, ''tremendous.'' He noted that most of the recipients were not marquee brand-name schools.
 ''Whoever it was, when you look at the list of schools, you see universities that are not the first to roll off your tongue when you think of state universities,'' he said. ''Yet we are all relevant and have large enrollments and make an impact in the region.''
 The common denominator that seems to have generated the most fascination is that every institution is led by a woman. ''Obviously, the giver of these gifts is a person of great wisdom,'' said Dr. Cole of Montclair State. ''I'm only partly facetious. We've had to work very hard to get where we are, and I believe that women presidents are great caretakers of their institutions and their students.''
 Lois B. DeFleur, president of Binghamton University, one of the four major research campuses in the State University of New York system, agreed. ''The actions say, 'I'm investing in an institution because it has made achievements and I believe that with women leaders it will have future accomplishments,' '' she said. ''That's pretty powerful in my view.''
 Binghamton, which got $6 million, originally planned to keep the gift a secret, in keeping with the request for strict anonymity. ''We didn't have an idea that this was part of a pattern, and I felt we shouldn't announce it,'' Dr. DeFleur said. ''Then the announcements started coming out and people said this is so uplifting, so positive. Binghamton -- the city -- suffered those shootings and people just felt that there is good in the world. There isn't just evil.''
 As much as college leaders are curious to know who their benefactor is, they are too busy figuring out ways to put the money to use to dwell too long on the enigma. 
 ''We're not focusing on the whodunit part,'' said Catherine Sweet-Windham, vice president for institutional advancement at the University of Maryland University College, which received $6 million. ''We're focusing on how this will help our students and letting the donor know that their investment in this institution is good one.''

HEADLINE: Profit at 3M Is Cut in Half As Sales Slip

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The 3M Company said Friday its quarterly profit fell 48 percent as the global economic slowdown hurt its sales in varied product categories, like health care and office supplies. 
 Weak demand in the United States hurt sales of LCD screen coatings, steel coatings and other products, 3M said. 
 The company, known for its Post-it notes and Scotch tape, reported net income of $518 million, or 74 cents a share, down from $988 million, or $1.38 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 21 percent, to $5.09 billion, from $6.46 billion. 
 Revenue for its largest division, industrial and transportation, fell 27.5 percent, to $1.6 billion, in part because of a substantial decline in North American auto manufacturing.
 The company's safety, security and protection unit, which makes products like air duct wrap and steel coatings, declined 15.4 percent.
 Its display and graphics business, which makes the LCD screen coating, posted the worst sales decline among 3M's six core businesses, down 30.2 percent, to $611 million.
 Excluding special items, 3M earned 81 cents a share, missing Wall Street expectations of 86 cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters. 
 The company also cut its full-year profit forecast.
 Earlier this month, 3M offered 3,600 employees, or 11 percent of its work force, early retirement packages and announced plans to cut an additional 1,200 jobs, or 1.5 percent of its work force, because of the global economic slump.
 The company did not say how many employees it hoped would take the voluntary package by May 31, or how much it expected to save if employees opted to retire earlier than planned.

HEADLINE: Obama's Power Plays

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. BECKER and JAMES GERSTENZANG. 
Daniel F. Becker is the director of the safe climate campaign of the Center for Auto Safety. James Gerstenzang is a former reporter for The Los Angeles Times.

 BODY:
WITH its announcement last week that global warming is a threat to public health, the Obama administration has made clear that it plans to cut greenhouse gases substantially. This week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee began its own effort to deal with warming, but Congress's path to legislation is long and uncertain. President Obama can get started without waiting for Congress by taking these three steps: 
 First, he can tighten the Department of Energy's efficiency standards for consumer appliances -- everything from lamps to refrigerators to vending machines. During President Obama's first term, 20 of these standards are up for revision, and if properly improved, they could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 70 million tons annually by 2020. 
 Standards on lighting, for example, should be strengthened enough that manufacturers would be encouraged to produce more L.E.D. lamps, which use a small fraction of the electricity required by incandescent bulbs, and don't waste electricity by generating heat. 
 Second, the Obama administration can direct the United States Agency for International Development to ship simple solar-powered cooking stoves to villages in Africa and Asia to replace the omnipresent twig-and-dung-burning stoves that turn even the most remote settlements into major producers of black carbon -- a fine soot that increases global warming. The solar stoves cost as little as $20 each, and the United States Agency for International Development could distribute 100 million of them under already existing programs. 
 Third and most important, President Obama can slash emissions from power plants and cars. For power plants, this will mean demanding more efficiency and, in many places, switching from coal to natural gas. The Clean Air Act authorizes the president to order that the 100 new coal-fired power plants on the drawing board be built to operate with cleaner natural gas. He can also order existing coal plants to switch to high-efficiency natural gas technology -- and thus cut their emissions by as much as two-thirds. As for cars, the administration can stand up to automakers by following California's example and requiring a 30 percent reduction in tailpipe emissions by 2016. 
 By taking these steps as soon as possible, President Obama can show the largest polluters -- the auto industry and utility companies -- that he is serious, and let scientists and engineers know that their work is urgent. Why wait for Congress?

HEADLINE: Democrat Wins Disputed Race for Seat Gillibrand Held

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
A 39-year-old Democrat in his first run for office emerged Friday as the winner of a hotly contested Congressional race in upstate New York, dashing Republican hopes for the start of a comeback after the party's disastrous November losses.
 The Democrat, Scott Murphy, a venture capitalist who echoed President Obama's promises of bipartisanship, expanded health care and an economic turnaround, said his victory after a drawn-out vote count showed that voters had no patience for partisan bickering and wanted their leaders to work together like grown-ups. 
 ''There was a lot of frustration with old-school politics,'' Mr. Murphy said in a telephone interview on Friday, adding that voters in the special election were still excited about President Obama's message of change and that they welcomed him as a newcomer to politics.
 ''We were 25 points down in the polls when we started, and we were able to get out the fact that I'm a problem solver who's been working to create jobs,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''That resonated with the public. That's the message that worked here, and that's what we need to work on doing.''
 The victory by Mr. Murphy, who will succeed Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand in the House of Representatives, became official when the Republican candidate, State Assemblyman James N. Tedisco, conceded in a phone call to Mr. Murphy and in a statement released just before 4 p.m.
 A day earlier, Mr. Tedisco's lawyers told him that victory was out of reach, aides said. As of late Friday, Mr. Murphy was ahead in the 20th Congressional District, 80,420 to 80,021 -- a margin of 399 votes, with several hundred paper ballots still in dispute. But most of the disputed ballots were challenged by Mr. Tedisco's side. 
 Republicans downplayed the loss in the special election, held on March 31, as predictable given recent Democratic gains in the district, and more generally in the Northeast. But the party had invested heavily in Mr. Tedisco's race, and with good reason: Republicans hold a 75,000-vote registration edge in the district, the party's biggest advantage in New York. And Mr. Tedisco, 58, who was the Assembly minority leader, was a familiar and feisty party spokesman on Albany television, while Mr. Murphy was unknown.
 But Mr. Murphy, a Missouri native who moved to Glens Falls from Manhattan a few years ago, surged from behind with a single-minded focus on the economy. He boasted of having created jobs upstate, and trumpeted the federal stimulus package in a contest that took shape, and drew national attention, as a referendum on the Obama administration's economic recovery efforts.
 Mr. Tedisco's defeat came as an embarrassment for Michael Steele, the Republican national chairman, who publicly identified the race as a prime target and campaigned twice for Mr. Tedisco. (The Democratic National Committee quickly threw Mr. Steele's statements back in his face on Friday, posting a YouTube video called ''Broken Steele.'')
 Mr. Steele did not respond immediately to a request for comment, but he acknowledged in a statement that Republicans ''must be competitive in districts like NY-20 if we are going to regain our Congressional majorities.''
 The stakes for Democrats in Washington were much lower. The party lent workers to Mr. Murphy's campaign and helped him with fund-raising, but did not spend heavily on his behalf. President Obama invested little political capital in Mr. Murphy's campaign, issuing an endorsement by e-mail but refraining from appearing in commercials or on the stump.
 But Mr. Murphy's victory delivered a modest but much-needed lift to New York's embattled governor, David A. Paterson, who created the vacancy by appointing Ms. Gillibrand to the Senate over the objections of some ranking Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who had poured resources into helping Ms. Gillibrand capture the historically conservative district in 2006.
 For Mr. Tedisco, the concession capped a grueling few weeks. He was forced out of his State Assembly leadership post by fellow Republicans angered by his absence from Albany while Democrats were drafting a contentious state budget in secret. This week, he was battered by a report in the Times Union of Albany that he had authorized his closest staff member to pay $32,500 in personal legal bills with Assembly Republican campaign funds.
 In his statement Friday, Mr. Tedisco thanked voters for their patience. ''This was a closely contested election that perhaps lasted a little longer than anyone may have expected or wanted,'' he said. ''But it was important for our electoral process and for the hard-working people of upstate New York that it be resolved fairly and decisively.''
 For his part, Mr. Murphy said he wanted to get to work harnessing some of the federal stimulus money for his district, a 10-county area encompassing the Albany suburbs, faded factory towns, dairy farms, and timberland from the Catskills to the Adirondacks.
 ''These people haven't been represented in Congress for some time,'' he said. ''There's some catch-up to do for sure.''

HEADLINE: Over the Limit

 BODY:
President Obama told banking executives this week to clean up their credit card business. He made clear that he understands the billowing anger and the huge strains placed on millions of American cardholders who face sudden interest rate spikes, hidden fees and tricky contracts that no one without a law degree and a magnifying glass can hope to master. 
 His promises will amount to little unless he follows through quickly to strengthen bills in Congress designed to protect credit card customers.
 The president said after meeting credit card executives on Thursday that he and his economic team recognize the need for credit cards, especially in a tough economy. Small businesses often depend on the cards to order goods or meet the payroll. And consumers have learned to enjoy instant credit at the checkout counter. But as a longtime user of credit cards himself, Mr. Obama told banking executives that it is time to reform this area of their business.
 He demanded stronger protections against unfair rate increases and abusive fees along with more oversight and enforcement. He called for clarity. He wants contracts written in plain language, minus fine print or ''anytime, any reason rate hikes.'' He wants people to be able to comparison shop online, with one option being ''a plain-vanilla, easy-to-understand, simplest-terms-possible'' card for the average user. 
 Credit card operators have long resisted such reforms, and earlier experiments with self-policing resulted in very spotty improvements. After complaints from cardholders who felt tricked by their banks, the Federal Reserve last year proposed several useful changes that will not, unfortunately, take effect until July 2010. 
 There's a better way to help consumers. A credit card bill of rights proposed by Democratic Representatives Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Carolyn Maloney of New York would codify many of the Fed's rules into law. It would ban interest rate increases on existing balances unless payment is more than 30 days late, and it would forbid ''double-cycle billing,'' which means charging interest on debts paid off the previous month.
 It would also require 45 days' notice for a rate increase in most cases. An even stronger bill by Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut would make it harder for people under the age of 21 to get cards, far too many of whom now think plastic is simply another form of cash. It would also require creditors to apply a cardholder's payment to the balance with the highest interest rate. So far, these reforms face fierce Republican opposition, especially in the Senate.
 If the president is really serious about credit card relief, he could pressure Congress to end some of the industry's worst tricks right now. Remember when credit card limits caused great embarrassment at the restaurant? These days, many cards allow the overcharge, sparing the embarrassment but socking the customer with a large fee at billing time. One solution would be to offer consumers the choice of a real ceiling that renders cards unusable above that limit. 
 Mr. Obama has spent a lot of time and energy trying to save the banks. He and Congress must also do more to spare their customers.

HEADLINE: World Finance Leaders Meet, and Cautiously Glimpse 'Green Shoots' of Recovery

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Sounding slightly less terrified than they have at any time in the last six months, finance ministers from the United States and other wealthy nations said Friday that they saw ''signs of stabilization'' in the global economic crisis.
 ''There are signs that the pace of deterioration in economic activity and trade flows has eased,'' said Treasury SecretaryTimothy F. Geithner after meeting with finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of 7 industrialized nations. ''These are encouraging signs, but it's too early to say that the risks have receded.'' 
 In a joint statement, the group went further and predicted that economic activity should begin to edge up later this year, though they cautioned that growth would be ''weak'' and that the outlook could darken again.
 Some economists agree that the downward plunge may be slowing in some parts of the world, but even optimists caution that it will be months before economic activity starts to climb and that unemployment is unlikely to start easing before some time in 2010.
 Even as American and European officials embraced a hopeful new buzz phrase -- the ''green shoots'' of recovery -- they made no apparent progress toward agreeing on how much to stimulate their respective domestic economies or in lining up additional financial commitments to shore up the International Monetary Fund.
 When leaders from the so-called Group of 20 met three weeks ago in London, they agreed to raise an additional $500 billion for the fund, which would use the money to help stabilize poorer countries that were blindsided by the financial crisis.
 Led by the United States, Europe and Japan, governments have thus far pledged about $375 billion. Though some officials had been hoping that more pledges would surface this weekend, that prospect seemed doubtful on Friday.
 Mr. Geithner hosted two back-to-back meetings with finance ministers here on Friday. The first was with ministers from the seven big industrialized countries. The second meeting, which began Friday evening, was with officials from the Group of 20, which includes China, Russia and large developing countries like Brazil, India and South Africa. The Group of 20 comprises 19 nations plus the European Union. 
 Before the meetings began, American officials went out of their way to dampen expectations for any big accomplishments. Noting that only three weeks had passed since leaders from the Group of 20 mapped out an ambitious effort in London to combat the global downturn, Treasury officials said their goals this weekend were simply to ''build on'' the earlier meeting.
 The biggest issue dividing the United States from other wealthy countries is the amount that governments should spend to revive their domestic economies.
 Mr. Geithner and other American officials prodded their counterparts in Europe and Japan to plow more money into public spending projects and tax cuts. But while Japan has increased its stimulus efforts since the London summit meeting, European nations have been unwilling to go further than they have gone.
 ''It is critical that we supply the necessary stimulus to domestic demand in each of our countries,'' Mr. Geithner said, praising China for embarking on an aggressive $500 billion stimulus program and giving a nod to Japan. ''Recovery in the United States depends significantly on recovery in those large and previously rapidly growing economies.''
 Economists said there have indeed been glimmers of hope. The frozen credit markets have thawed somewhat in recent weeks; shares in financial companies have climbed sharply, though from abysmal lows; and mortgage refinancing has soared in the United States.
 But even optimists warn that an economic recovery is likely to be slow and fragile, and may not start until late in 2009. Even if economic activity climbs, they add, it will probably be many months later before unemployment peaks and starts to decline.
 Eswar Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University and a former senior economist at the International Monetary Fund, warned that the hopeful hints might have the unwelcome consequence of making leaders in some countries complacent and reluctant to follow through on the regulatory reforms and stimulus measures they recently supported.
 ''The warm glow from the meeting of G-20 leaders has subsided and we are back to grappling with reality, although reality seems a lot less scary than it did a few weeks ago,'' he said.

HEADLINE: At Ford, a Sense of Survival Despite the Losses Piling Up

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY and BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company unleashed a torrent of dismal financial numbers Friday, saying that it lost $1.4 billion, sales fell 43 percent and it spent $3.7 billion of its cash during the first quarter.
 But in the new math of the Detroit auto industry, this was good news.
 Investors bid up Ford shares by 11 percent Friday to $5, and the stock has roughly tripled in value in the last two months. They appear taken with the notion that Ford is separating itself from its troubled crosstown rivals, General Motors and Chrysler, which are trying to stave off bankruptcy. 
 Ford -- because of a decision more than two years ago under its new chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, to borrow as much as it could -- still has more than $21 billion in the bank. Consequently, the company has not had to ask for help from the federal government.
 ''There are two big events in the history of Ford,'' said James V. McTevia, a corporate turnaround expert who runs the firm McTevia & Associates in Bingham Farms, Mich. ''When Henry Ford figured out the assembly line and when Alan Mulally leveraged the assets so the company wasn't forced to go to Washington and beg for money.''
 Ford has enough money to last through at least 2010, said Patrick Archambault, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, who upgraded his rating on the company this week to buy.
 ''Unlike G.M., we do not foresee bankruptcy at Ford,'' Mr. Archambault wrote to his clients. ''With G.M. and Chrysler likely to file for bankruptcy in coming weeks, in our view, we think the stage is set for a sea change in the structure of the U.S. auto industry.''
 But the seas remain treacherous for Ford. A bankruptcy by Chrysler or G.M. could damage their suppliers, many of whom also provide parts for Ford. Dealers for those two companies, in the event of a bankruptcy, might start a fire sale to clear their lots of unsold cars to pay off their own obligations. That, in turn, would drive down prices for the rest of the industry.
 It is also unclear when the prolonged slump in new-car sales in the United States will end.
 ''Ford still has the problem that its competitors do, which is that the customer out there isn't spending money,'' Mr. McTevia said. ''The danger is that Ford could run out of money before the consumer comes back.''
 Of course, G.M. and Chrysler already have run out of money. They are managing to stay out of bankruptcy with the help of $19.4 billion in government loans, including an additional $2 billion that G.M. received Friday.
 G.M. is expected to disclose a revised restructuring plan Monday, four weeks after the Obama administration rejected its original submission. The new plan will include more job cuts and could call for faster consolidation of its dealership network and the elimination of its Pontiac brand. 
 On Friday, G.M. played down speculation that it would close the Pontiac division, which was scheduled to become a niche brand. But the company also did not specifically deny widespread discussion that such a move was imminent.
 Meanwhile, State Street Bank and Trust has sold the G.M. stock held in the company's employee stock purchase plans because of concerns about the automaker's financial outlook, G.M. disclosed in regulatory filing Friday.
 Chrysler has less than a week to meet the administration's deadline to reach a partnership deal with the Italian automaker Fiat and show that it is worthy of more aid.
 Chrysler's senior lenders on Friday made a new offer to the Treasury Department. The banks proposed taking about 54 cents on the dollar for their $6.9 billion in debt but still wanted a 40 percent equity stake in the reorganized carmaker.
 While Ford consumed cash at a rate of $1.2 billion a month in the first quarter, that was about half the rate at which it depleted reserves late last year.
 Mr. Mulally said Friday that the amount of cash it lost would gradually shrink as Ford brought out new products to stabilize revenue and inventory levels.
 He reiterated that Ford had enough cash on hand to weather the economic crisis, while investing in new cars and technologies.
 ''When we say we have sufficient liquidity, it's not just enough to skim by, but enough to complete the transformation of the company,'' Mr. Mulally said in an interview.
 Ford is acutely aware, however, that a bankruptcy filing by Chrysler or G.M. could put some of its own suppliers at risk.
 Mr. Mulally said that his executives had increased contact with Ford's most vulnerable suppliers, and had identified alternative sources for some parts. He expressed confidence that the Obama administration would do what was necessary to keep suppliers solvent during the restructurings of G.M. and Chrysler.
 ''They understand the supply base is absolutely the highest priority,'' Mr. Mulally said.
 Canadian Union Has a Deal 
 The Canadian Auto Workers union reached a tentative agreement with Chrysler Canada on Friday afternoon, Ken Lewenza, the union's president, said. 
 The pact, which is subject to approval by the company's 8,000 unionized workers, protects base wages and pensions. But Mr. Lewenza said the union agreed to significantly greater concessions in a wider variety of areas than those found in a contract reached recently with General Motors of Canada. That represents an end to the union's tradition of accepting only common contracts between American-based automakers. 
 In exchange, Mr. Lewenza said that both Chrysler and Fiat agreed that no Chrysler factories in Canada would be closed if the company was forced into bankruptcy protection.
 Nevertheless, Mr. Lewenza was still cautious.
 ''The fear and uncertainty isn't over,'' Mr. Lewenza told a news conference. ''Not by a long shot.''

HEADLINE: To Buy or Not To Buy?

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
What kind of car are you thinking of buying? Write to rlieber@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Should you buy a Chrysler or General Motors vehicle right now? 
 I didn't start thinking about this question until G.M.'s chairman, Rick Wagoner, suggested it several months ago. Sure, he was looking for money to keep G.M. out of bankruptcy when he insisted that few would buy a car from an insolvent automaker. 
 But here we are, weeks after President Obama essentially fired him, and the company remains on the brink of some sort of restructuring. Bankruptcy -- even partial liquidation -- seems like a possibility for Chrysler, extending the taint to it, too. So it's certainly fair to address the premise of Mr. Wagoner's concern head on. 
 Why, exactly, did he think so few of us would want to buy his cars? 
 I can think of plenty of reasons, ranging from warranty and resale concerns to disappearing dealers to whether all of the financial trouble will distract employees and affect the quality of the two companies' products. 
 So here's what you're up against if you're considering a G.M or Chrysler right now.
 WARRANTIES Last month, the Obama administration created a ''Warrantee Commitment'' program. It's now paying money into an account that will serve to back up Chrysler and General Motors warranties if either goes into bankruptcy or out of business. 
 Both Chrysler and General Motors consider this redundant. ''Regardless of any changes that may take place'' during any reorganization, a Chrysler spokeswoman, Carrie McElwee, said in a statement, ''we are committed to serving our customers.'' 
 John M. McDonald, a G.M. spokesman, also said that dealers need not be concerned about reimbursement from the company for repairs, even in the event of a bankruptcy filing. ''What we're trying to do is have an ongoing business in the long term,'' he said. ''The way you do that is by paying dealers, honoring warranties and making sure customers have service.''
 So what happens if the business is no longer ongoing? The federal government would appoint an administrator, who would help find another service provider to perform the warranty service. If it comes to that, problems and delays are certainly possible. 
 DEALERS At least one-third of General Motors' dealers are likely to disappear in the next few years. What happens if yours closes its doors? If you insist on service from a dealer, how far might you have to drive?
 Mr. McDonald of G.M. said this should not be much of a concern. ''Most of the issues we have with surplus dealers are in metropolitan areas where we have significant overlap,'' he said. ''In rural communities, a lot of our competitors don't have dealers, and we see that as a competitive advantage.'' Also, Toyota has far fewer dealers than G.M., but you don't hear many people complaining about their lack of access to one. 
 While G.M. brands like Saab, Hummer and Saturn may cease to exist, Mr. McDonald points to the now-shuttered Oldsmobile as evidence that G.M. knows how to care for customers even after it no longer maintains dealerships for their cars or produces them in a factory. (If you're an Oldsmobile owner and agree or disagree, sound off in the comments on the version of this article at nytimes.com/yourmoney.) 
 Service may not be the crucial issue here, though. Jesse Toprak, the executive director for industry analysis at Edmunds.com, said he was more worried about how bankruptcy or insolvency would affect parts manufacturers. ''Where do you get parts if the supplier is no longer in business in five years?'' he asked. 
 RESALE VALUES History offers some comfort here. According to data from Kelley Blue Book, the rate of decline on the resale value of the Oldsmobile Alero didn't increase much in the first year or so after G.M. stopped making it. This may be related to the fact that G.M. announced its intent to retire the brand years before it stopped making some of the cars.
 Another likely explanation for the lack of impact on resale prices is that car companies shut down only underperforming divisions. The brand is already so tarnished, and resale values so poor, that the disappearance of the nameplate may not accelerate the depreciation that much. 
 Juan Flores, director of vehicle valuation at Kelley Blue Book, also takes some comfort in the companies' experience in discontinuing models and doing away with certain brands. 
 ''There are people there who have lots of experience in strategically minimizing the costs in the liquidation process'' to consumers.
 If the whole company were to disappear, however, it might be a different story. That's something Chrysler buyers need to seriously consider. 
 DISTRACTED WORKERS Do employees working for bankrupt companies make substandard cars? The reverse may actually be true, according to D. Kevin Berchelmann, president of Triangle Performance, a consulting firm in Spring, Tex. In bankruptcy, management is no longer worried about creditors calling, he said, and executives may be spiffing up the company for a sale (or merely making themselves employable if it liquidates). 
 Then again, front-line workers are still looking at possible wage and benefit cuts, so they may have other things on their minds. 
 Mr. McDonald of G.M. added that quality depended on many things, including parts that might come from elsewhere and checks and balances that had nothing to do with human beings. 
 THE UPSIDES Given all the potential pitfalls, there are still at least four potentially good reasons to buy a G.M. or Chrysler vehicle. The first is because you want to buy American, although for now you can avoid much of the uncertainty by buying a Ford. If you're specifically interested in supporting American and Canadian union labor, the online version of this article has a link to a page on the United Automobile Workers' Web site that lists cars its members helped build. 
 Second is distinctiveness -- a design you can't find elsewhere. Some people may feel there is no substitute for a Chrysler 300, a Jeep Wrangler or a Hummer. As a fellow design snob, I salute you, though you may ultimately suffer for your obsession. 
 Third is quality. Sure, the vehicles are better than they used to be. Warranty claims at Chrysler are at their lowest rate ever, with a 30 percent improvement in the last 12 months, according to Ms. McElwee. And G.M.'s Buick recently tied for first in J. D. Power and Associates' Vehicle Dependability Study. But Consumer Reports' most recent annual auto survey still puts the companies' vehicles dead last (and dead second to last). 
 Finally, there's price. According to Edmunds.com data from March 2009, Chrysler is offering an average of $4,889 of consumer incentives per vehicle, the highest among the big seven (Chrysler, Ford, G.M., Honda, Hyundai, Nissan and Toyota). G.M is a close second at $4,772. The industry average is $3,153.
 That $1,700 or so is real money at a time when funds are scarce. ''All I would simply ask is to give G.M. a fair shot,'' said Mr. McDonald of G.M. ''If we don't win on quality or value or fuel economy, then don't buy it.''
 Buying a Chrysler seems like an awfully big bet at the moment. And the gamble is similarly high with brands like Saturn and Saab, which have seen better days, or Hummer, which was a bad idea to begin with. 
 But a Cadillac? Sure, take it for a spin. Just remember to imagine what life might be like trying to get warranty service from the federal government.

HEADLINE: Storm of Violence in Iraq Strains Its Security Forces

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and SAM DAGHER; Mohamed Hussein and Suadad N. al-Salhy contributed reporting from Baghdad, and an Iraqi employee of The New York Times from Diyala Province.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
A deadly outburst of violence appears to be overwhelming Iraq's police and military forces as American troops hand over greater control of cities across the country to them. On Friday, twin suicide bombings killed at least 60 people outside Baghdad's most revered Shiite shrine, pushing the death toll in one 24-hour period to nearly 150. 
 Like many recent attacks, the bombings appeared intended to inflame sectarian tensions, to weaken Iraq's security forces and to discredit its government. 
 The bombings on Friday ominously echoed attacks like the one at a Shiite shrine in Samarra in February 2006 that unleashed a wave of sectarian bloodshed and pushed the country toward civil war. 
 The latest bombings -- there have been at least 18 major attacks so far this month -- so far have not prompted retaliatory attacks, but they have strained what remains a fragile society deeply divided between Sunnis and Shiites.
 Two suicide bombers struck within five minutes of each other on streets leading to the shrine of Imam Musa al-Kadhim and his grandson. One of the attacks, and perhaps both, were carried out by women, witnesses said.
 Nearly half of those killed were Iranians making a pilgrimage to the shrine, a golden-domed landmark in the predominantly Shiite Kadhimiya neighborhood of Baghdad that is devoted to 2 of the 12 imams of Shiite Islam. At least 125 people were wounded, many of them also Iranians.
 A loose coalition of Sunni militant forces, the Islamic State of Iraq, has claimed responsibility for carrying out many of the recent attacks.
 Seemingly attentive to the public wrath, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki took the unusual step of ordering the creation of a special committee to investigate the attack on Friday and the lapses in security that apparently allowed it to happen. The state television network, Al Iraqiya, reported on Friday evening that Mr. Maliki also ordered the detention of two national police commanders responsible for security in the area.
 The killing of so many Iranians prompted Iraq to close its border crossing to Iran at Muntheriya in Diyala Province, through which thousands of Iranians a week pass on pilgrimages to Iraq's holy Shiite sites. 
 The deadliest of the three bombings on Thursday struck a restaurant filled with Iranian travelers in Muqdadiya, a town in Diyala not far from the border. The toll in that attack rose to 56, with Iranians making up the majority of the dead. Over all, at least 89 people were killed in the bombings on Thursday, and more than 100 were wounded.
 After the attacks on Friday, angry Iraqis who gathered amid the bloody debris blamed lax security and corruption of the police and government officials for what had happened. Some of their anger had a strongly sectarian cast.
 ''They have been ruling us for 1,400 years,'' said a Shiite army soldier who identified himself only as Abu Haidar, referring to the Sunni domination of Shiites in Iraq. ''We took it over for four years, and they are slaughtering us.'' 
 The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella insurgent group that includes Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, says the recent attacks as part of a campaign called Harvest of the Good, which it announced in March. 
 In a statement distributed on extremist Web sites at the time, the group's leader, Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, ridiculed President Obama as ''Washington's black man'' and called his plan to withdraw American forces by 2011 an ''implied avowal of defeat.''
 On Thursday, Iraq's military claimed to have arrested Mr. Baghdadi, but what was touted as a major success appeared to be in question. 
 Extremist Web sites denied his arrest, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors claims and other statements by terrorist and extremist groups. The American military command also said in a statement that it could not confirm ''the arrest or capture'' of the leader, who the American military believes to be a fictitious Iraqi figurehead of a movement that includes many foreign fighters.
 American and Iraqi officials have expressed growing concern that the Islamic State of Iraq, Al Qaeda and other extremists have been able to regroup and exploit gaps in security that are forming as American commanders have closed scores of combat outposts across the country, leaving day-to-day security in the hands of the Iraqis. ''All the killing of Shiites is done by Al Qaeda,'' a man who identified himself only as Abu Mohammed said after Friday's bombings. ''America was not able to finish them off. How can our forces do it?''
 A senior national police official on Friday bluntly cited the limitations of Iraq's security forces and their equipment for detecting explosives, typically hand-held wands used at checkpoints that the official described as fakes. 
 ''We need to redeploy our security units to fill gaps because the American withdrawal gave the terrorists motives to reactivate their sleeper cells,'' the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he said he would be punished for speaking frankly about such shortcomings. ''We need more cars, modern equipment to detect explosives.''
 Maj. Gen. Abdul-Aziz Mohammed Jasim, a senior commander at the Ministry of Defense, cited other factors behind the recent violence. They included what he called ''reactions to political issues'' that had divided Iraq since provincial elections in January and the release of thousands of detainees held by American forces into a feeble economy. 
 As part of a new security agreement with Iraq that took effect this year, the Americans are required to release all Iraqis in their custody or to transfer them to Iraqi jails. ''They are releasing detainees randomly, and some of the detainees who have been released might still have contact with Al Qaeda,'' General Jasim said in a telephone interview. ''And when they return back to their normal life and do not find work, they return back to Al Qaeda.''
 General Jasim also lamented the inability of Iraqi forces to stop attacks against what he described as soft targets, like markets and mosques. ''The security procedures are continuing,'' he said, ''but the security forces cannot exist in every inch.''
 It was not clear whether the attacks on Friday were specifically aimed at Iranians or the Shiite site they were visiting. The chief administrator at the shrine, Sheik Fadhil al-Anbari, blamed the police for failing to stop the bombings, which he said were intended to disrupt an economy that the visiting pilgrims had bolstered.
 ''The crowds of the Iranian visitors have brought a boom to the economy in Kadhimiya, and Al Qaeda does not want this,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''These attacks are clearly meant to sabotage the country.''

HEADLINE: Sleeping As Your Debt Piles Up

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
As so many people do, Lawrence H. Summersdozed off this week during a discussion of credit cards. However, he happened to be in the White House, seated a few chairs down from President Obama, who at the time was trying to get the major banks to treat their credit card customers with more tenderness than, say, hungry lions tearing at a fresh carcass of gazelle. It may be that Mr. Summers, who has a job advising the president on economic matters, has been working too hard. 
 Or it could simply be that he was hit by the same narcotic power that has made credit cards so spectacularly profitable over the last two decades. 
 Molly Gordy knows exactly how that works. Sometime in the last six months, Bank of America raised the interest rate on a MasterCard held by Ms. Gordy, a writer and teacher in New York. 
 ''It had been 11.99 percent; it crept up to 12.99, and I didn't notice,'' Ms. Gordy said. ''I was lazy. It's tucked in with your bill. It looks like more junk mail.''
 She woke up when another piece of mail arrived on April 8. This time, the bank was raising the interest rate on her outstanding balance to 17 percent; on new purchases, it was going to 20 percent. 
 From there, it gets worse.
 When she contacted the bank on Friday, Ms. Gordy said, she was told that the interest rate on her current balance could stay at 12.99 percent because she was contesting the change, but that if she used the card for any more purchases, it would go to 19 percent for everything. ''I've been a perfect customer,'' she said. ''I asked them, 'Why are you doing this?' ''
 One answer is that banks and credit card companies have been doing precisely this for years: they bring in customers on easy terms, then crank up the rates under a provision buried in the microscopically fine print that permits virtually unlimited increases, as The New York Times reported in 2004. Last year, Bank of America raised the rates on about 9 percent of its card customers, said Betty Riess, a spokeswoman for the bank. In the first three months of this year, the bank sent notices that it was raising rates to ''less than 10 percent of the portfolio'' of customers, Ms. Riess said, either people who were paying below-market interest rates or who showed signs that they were high-risk customers. 
 She said she did not know if the bank was raising rates more aggressively this year than it had in the past. 
 Government limits are almost certainly coming on the credit card industry -- both Congress and the White House have been pushing for them -- but Ms. Riess said the rate increases sent out recently were not an effort to squeeze more money from their customers before any new regulations go into effect. ''It's unrelated,'' she said. ''The primary reason is the deteriorating economic environment.''
 An essay, ''Infinite Debt'' by Thomas Geoghegan in the April issue of Harper's Magazine, argues that credit cards have corroded the nation's economy. When state usury laws -- which capped interest that could be charged on debt, and had their roots in antiquity -- were effectively eliminated by the United States Supreme Court in 1978, Mr. Geoghegan said that the chance for explosive returns in banking began to drain both financial and intellectual capital from manufacturing industries. 
 The banking industry has said that the old usury laws kept some from getting credit because lenders would not be compensated for taking higher risks. 
 In the White House meeting on Thursday, Mr. Obama said he ''had a very fresh memory of relying on credit cards,'' and acknowledged that they were a flexible way to lend money to many people and to small businesses. But that also meant he knew how quickly people could sink under the debt. 
 ''The days of any time, any reason rate hikes and late fee traps have to end,'' Mr. Obama told the bankers. 
 Nearly every day, the civil courts in New York and other big cities are jammed with credit card cases -- people who were given limits of $500, and found that interest rate hikes and late fees quickly pushed their debts to several thousand dollars. More than 1,000 new cases a day are added to the dockets in New York.
 As for Ms. Gordy, the credit card mail is not putting her to sleep. Upromise, another card issuer, recently offered to take over her existing credit balances at zero percent. It so happens that both her MasterCard and the Upromise card are owned by Bank of America.
 ''How come a different computer from the same bank is sending me an offer of zero percent?'' she asked.

HEADLINE: At Ford, a Sense of Survival Despite the Losses Piling Up

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY and BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company unleashed a torrent of dismal financial numbers Friday, saying that it lost $1.4 billion, sales fell 43 percent and it spent $3.7 billion of its cash during the first quarter.
 But in the new math of the Detroit auto industry, this was good news.
 Investors bid up Ford shares by 11 percent Friday to $5, and the stock has roughly tripled in value in the last two months. They appear taken with the notion that Ford is separating itself from its troubled crosstown rivals, General Motors and Chrysler, which are trying to stave off bankruptcy. 
 Ford -- because of a decision more than two years ago under its new chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, to borrow as much as it could -- still has more than $21 billion in the bank. Consequently, the company has not had to ask for help from the federal government.
 ''There are two big events in the history of Ford,'' said James V. McTevia, a corporate turnaround expert who runs the firm McTevia & Associates in Bingham Farms, Mich. ''When Henry Ford figured out the assembly line and when Alan Mulally leveraged the assets so the company wasn't forced to go to Washington and beg for money.''
 Ford has enough money to last through at least 2010, said Patrick Archambault, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, who upgraded his rating on the company this week to buy.
 ''Unlike G.M., we do not foresee bankruptcy at Ford,'' Mr. Archambault wrote to his clients. ''With G.M. and Chrysler likely to file for bankruptcy in coming weeks, in our view, we think the stage is set for a sea change in the structure of the U.S. auto industry.''
 But the seas remain treacherous for Ford. A bankruptcy by Chrysler or G.M. could damage their suppliers, many of whom also provide parts for Ford. Dealers for those two companies, in the event of a bankruptcy, might start a fire sale to clear their lots of unsold cars to pay off their own obligations. That, in turn, would drive down prices for the rest of the industry.
 It is also unclear when the prolonged slump in new-car sales in the United States will end.
 ''Ford still has the problem that its competitors do, which is that the customer out there isn't spending money,'' Mr. McTevia said. ''The danger is that Ford could run out of money before the consumer comes back.''
 Of course, G.M. and Chrysler already have run out of money. They are managing to stay out of bankruptcy with the help of $19.4 billion in government loans, including an additional $2 billion that G.M. received Friday.
 G.M. is expected to disclose a revised restructuring plan Monday, four weeks after the Obama administration rejected its original submission. The new plan will include more job cuts and could call for faster consolidation of its dealership network and the elimination of its Pontiac brand. 
 On Friday, G.M. played down speculation that it would close the Pontiac division, which was scheduled to become a niche brand. But the company also did not specifically deny widespread discussion that such a move was imminent.
 Meanwhile, State Street Bank and Trust has sold the G.M. stock held in the company's employee stock purchase plans because of concerns about the automaker's financial outlook, G.M. disclosed in regulatory filing Friday.
 Chrysler has less than a week to meet the administration's deadline to reach a partnership deal with the Italian automaker Fiat and show that it is worthy of more aid.
 Chrysler's senior lenders on Friday made a new offer to the Treasury Department. The banks proposed taking about 54 cents on the dollar for their $6.9 billion in debt but still wanted a 40 percent equity stake in the reorganized carmaker.
 While Ford consumed cash at a rate of $1.2 billion a month in the first quarter, that was about half the rate at which it depleted reserves late last year.
 Mr. Mulally said Friday that the amount of cash it lost would gradually shrink as Ford brought out new products to stabilize revenue and inventory levels.
 He reiterated that Ford had enough cash on hand to weather the economic crisis, while investing in new cars and technologies.
 ''When we say we have sufficient liquidity, it's not just enough to skim by, but enough to complete the transformation of the company,'' Mr. Mulally said in an interview.
 Ford is acutely aware, however, that a bankruptcy filing by Chrysler or G.M. could put some of its own suppliers at risk.
 Mr. Mulally said that his executives had increased contact with Ford's most vulnerable suppliers, and had identified alternative sources for some parts. He expressed confidence that the Obama administration would do what was necessary to keep suppliers solvent during the restructurings of G.M. and Chrysler.
 ''They understand the supply base is absolutely the highest priority,'' Mr. Mulally said.

HEADLINE: Scrambling to Enroll More Preschoolers

BYLINE: By JULI S. CHARKES; Mary Jo Patterson and Linda Saslow contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DOBBS FERRY, N.Y.
WHILE many Manhattan preschools still find themselves turning away anxious parents and their children because they don't have enough spots, directors at several nursery schools and preschools in the suburbs say that they are worried they won't fill all their openings in September.
''Normally, we have phones ringing off the hook from parents inquiring about the school,'' said Linda Jo Platt, the director of the Community Nursery School here. ''This year, the phones have been dead.''
Private nursery schools have enjoyed robust enrollment in recent years, often having long waiting lists in many suburbs around the region. But directors at private nursery schools said they are concerned that the faltering economy and listless real estate market were contributing to a dip in applications and enrollments. 
Ms. Platt, for example, said she would typically have a waiting list of 40 to 50 families willing to pay annual tuition of $3,300 to $5,800 for full-day instruction. (Other schools in Westchester called that range typical, although the tuition was higher at some schools on Long Island.)
Today, there is neither a waiting list nor full enrollment at Community for the coming year. The school has 10 available spaces for the fall, and in that regard it is not alone.
''Everyone is stunned,'' said Olivia Hewitt, director of the Scarsdale Friends Nursery School and co-president of the Westchester Association for the Education of Young Children, a 300-member consortium of nursery school educators. ''There are empty spaces and whether or not they are in your school, it is making everyone nervous.''
Michelle Vogt, business manager for Smoke Rise Nursery School, a traditional nursery school serving about 55 families in Kinnelon in Morris County, said registration ended three months ago, but two of the school's classes still have openings. ''We don't think we'll be filling all of them,'' she said.
Officials at four Long Island nursery schools said their numbers for the next school year were about normal. ''But I believe we're the exception,'' said Ron Kuznetz, the owner of Miss Sue's Nursery School and Kindergarten in Plainview, which has an enrollment of 210. ''I've heard of other nursery schools that are eliminating their afternoon programs because they can't get enough kids.''
The drop in nursery school enrollment comes as demand for scholarship money toward daylong child-care programs is rising, said Kathleen Halas of the Child Care Council of Westchester. The council administers the county's scholarships for child-care programs, some $1 million for the current fiscal year, Ms. Halas said.
The enrollment declines in the private schools can in some cases seem small. Ms. Hewitt's comments came on a day when she received calls from two families committed to sending children to her school, which has operated in Westchester for 55 years. That left her with just two spaces to fill for the 33-student capacity.
But that she is contending with any available spaces this late in the year, she said, was a sharp contrast to times past. ''Typically at this time of year we are full,'' Ms. Hewitt said. ''We've never seen this before.''
At the Transitional Learning Center in New Rochelle, the director, Jeannette Mirabile, said applications for the coming school year were down some 20 percent. ''People are more hesitant this year, people are holding on to their money a bit more, even if that money is available,'' Ms. Mirabile said.
Perhaps hardest for school administrators is securing enrollment only to see parents pull out later. At Community, Ms. Platt said several families registered children while still living in New York City and planning to move to Westchester, only to reverse those plans because they could not sell properties in the city.
That happened at Good Shepherd Nursery School in Irvington, N.Y., said its education director, Sasha Wilson, when two families reversed plans to send children to her school, choosing instead to enroll them in a preschool program paid for by the state in neighboring Tarrytown. ''That was the hardest,'' she said.
To make up for low numbers, several schools spoke of freezing tuition or extending hours to meet the demands of a changing clientele. Some schools are also marketing themselves more aggressively.
Chris Lacenere, director of Kids Corner Cooperative Nursery School in Plainsboro, said two nursery schools nearby had each canceled one class because of low enrollment. She, however, expects enrollment to be full next year, but only because the school has done extra promotion.
To counter its 20 percent drop in applications, the Transitional Learning Center in New Rochelle is relying on advertising special events, Ms. Mirabile said. Those events include extracurricular activities like pottery and tae kwon do classes and a breakfast for students and their fathers last Tuesday during which several parents stressed the importance of preschool to better prepare children for future schooling.
''We see the extra value of what is provided here,'' said Anthony Frazia, whose 5-year-old daughter, Jessica, is enrolled in the school.
Still, some parents find it unaffordable, particularly now. Mary and Rob Gibbons, of Hastings-on-Hudson, sent the first three of their five daughters to private nursery schools but did not send their fourth daughter after Mr. Gibbons was laid off from his sales job. ''It became an easy decision to make,'' Ms. Gibbons said.
Other schools pointed to the necessity of meeting parents' changing needs. At the Alcott School in Scarsdale, enrollment is full for the fall, but its waiting list has shrunk to 20 families from 40 to 50. Alcott has extended the afternoon session for preschoolers by a half-hour, said the school's executive director, Beth Farkas.
Alcott has also expanded after-school programs including soccer, golf and tennis classes. ''We have had to think creatively, reassess programs and be more flexible,'' Ms. Farkas said.
Gauging parents' needs can be tricky. Bruce Schnittman, owner of Crestwood Country Day School in Melville on Long Island, said it decided to offer an afternoon program that was significantly cheaper than the morning program. ''But only two people signed up,'' he said, and those children will become part of the full-day program.
Still, for administrators hoping to maintain staffing levels, this year has caused worries.
To counter that, Ms. Platt of the Community school said she was putting into place a couple of firsts: an open house on April 26 that she hoped would draw more applications and help avoid having to cut staff. She also posted a sign outside the school to advertise openings. That sign joins two others just down the road from her, advertising space available at two separate schools.
Ms. Platt attributed that visual clue to a changing time. ''We all expanded to meet the demands of the population these past years,'' she said. ''Now we have to figure out how to deal with a contraction.''

HEADLINE: State Weighs Ban On Casino Smoking

BYLINE: By MARK PAZNIOKAS

 BODY:
UNCASVILLE
WITH winks and whistles, whirling lights and raucous song, slot machines beckon gamblers here at the Mohegan Sun casino, generating billions of dollars for the sovereign Mohegan Tribal Nation and its silent partner, the State of Connecticut.
Last year, patrons fed nearly $10 billion into 6,600 slot machines at the Mohegan Sun, a sprawling casino-and-entertainment complex overlooking the Thames River. The state's portion was $221 million here and another $190 million from the other tribal gambling place, Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard.
Since 1993, after Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. signed a gambling compact with the Mashantucket Pequots, allowing slot machines at Foxwoods in return for 25 percent of the gross, Connecticut has made $4.9 billion off casino gambling. 
Now, the state legislature is trying to decide if it is willing to risk seeing that cash flow diminish, or even stop, in the name of public health by requiring the two tribal casinos to ban smoking by Oct. 1, 2011.
The tribes say that a smoking ban would drive away gamblers from a business already hurt by the recession. For the first time since the Sun opened in 1997, slot revenue to the state dipped by $19 million last year after a decade of steady growth.
Moreover, the Mohegans and Pequots assert that a legislative mandate on smoking would violate their tribal sovereignty, allowing them to withhold all slot revenue while they contested the issue in federal court.
''This is the first state to try to do something like this,'' said Bruce Bozsum, chairman of the Mohegan Tribal Council. ''So it's my job right now to try to protect my tribe and to even reach further to protect all tribes across the country. Everybody is watching.''
Jackson King, general counsel to the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, said the proposed smoking ban is the biggest threat to tribal sovereignty since the Pequots and Connecticut signed the compact in 1993. The Mohegans became a signatory after their federal recognition in 1994.
Backing the smoking ban is Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and the United Automobile Workers, a union with many friends among the Democratic majority in the General Assembly. The U.A.W. is now trying to negotiate its first contract with the Pequots on behalf of 2,500 dealers at Foxwoods.
Jack Edwards, a dealer of table games at Foxwoods for a dozen years, attributes his asthma to second-hand smoke, and asked legislators at a public hearing for the same protections afforded most other workers in Connecticut.
By law, the rest of Connecticut's public spaces and major work places have been smoke free since 2003.
''The public health side of this is very simple,'' said Representative Elizabeth B. Ritter, a Democrat of Waterford and co-chairwoman of the public health committee. The tribes do not contest the dangers of second-hand smoke.
But most political odds-makers are betting against the ban. Too much money is at stake at a time when Gov. M. Jodi Rell and the General Assembly are scratching for every dollar. With tax revenues falling, the Rell administration estimates the state is facing a shortfall of nearly $8 billion over the next two fiscal years.
The legislature's nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis estimated that the revenue loss from a smoking ban was ''potentially significant,'' though it warned that the data from other gambling jurisdictions with smoking limits was inconclusive.
The governor's eagerness to maximize casino revenues was evident in February, when she proposed permitting the casinos to sell alcohol 24 hours a day. Her office estimated that more alcohol sold would equate to more gambling, bringing the state another $5 million in annual revenue.
The idea was abandoned after a car leaving the Mohegan Sun at 3 a.m. collided with a van taking college students to the airport for an overseas aid mission. One student was killed. The State Police said the casino patron was drunk and driving the wrong way on Interstate 395 without headlights.
Ms. Ritter, who represents a southeast Connecticut district that sits between the two tribal casinos, said she was distressed to see legislators having to weigh public health issues against the risk of losing slot revenue in a bad economy.
''I think it's horrible and sad -- very, very sad,'' she said.
So far, few legislators have been willing to go on record against the ban. The Public Health Committee approved the bill, 28 to 2. On Monday, the Government Administration and Elections Committee endorsed the measure, 8 to 3. The same committee plans an informational hearing on tribal sovereignty next month.
The bill has a long road ahead. Backers expect it to be referred to other committees, often a tactic legislative leaders employ to buy time or to keep a troublesome bill from consideration by the full legislature.
Mr. Blumenthal said the smoking measure is defensible under the compact, which requires the tribes to abide by public health laws that the state imposes on itself. He said the tribes would have the right to challenge the law in federal court, but not withhold slot revenue.
''There is no legally justifiable reason to withhold that money, except, of course, to put a gun to the state's head,'' he said.
The Mohegans said they were not averse to limiting or, perhaps, eventually banning smoking, but only under the terms of their compact with the state -- through negotiation with the governor.
The tribe has already presented the governor with its smoking-mitigation plan, including a new ventilation system. Smoking is now banned from 90 percent of the Mohegan Sun, though from only 25 percent of the gaming floor.
''We have the right to write our own laws and deal with the governor of Connecticut,'' Mr. Bozsum said. ''The governor has my plan, and that's who I deal directly with.''
Sovereignty is no small matter to the Mohegans and Pequots, two tribes driven to the brink of extinction, he said. Thirteen tribes in Connecticut went out of existence.
They are memorialized in a section of the Mohegan Sun, the ''Hall of Lost Tribes.''
It is smoke free.

HEADLINE: Carrying a Big Load For 2 Automakers

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER JENSEN

 BODY:
PICKUP trucks were pretty simple way backwhen. They were designed for work, and nobody gave a hoot about the comfort of the workers. Forget the rough ride, never mind the roll-up windows -- anything was better than having to lug a dozen hay bales to the barn by hand.
But by the 1980s automakers noticed that a growing number of customers were embracing the trucky Marlboro Man image. They wanted to use their pickups for day-to-day transportation, with the cargo bed occasionally put to use for some weekend-wienie chore.
Thus began a race to see which truck maker could offer the most pampering and creature comforts. By now the ultimate pickups have features remarkably similar to a luxury car's, from heated leather seats to DVD players that let little pardners watch Hannah Montana in the back seat. 
The catch, of course, is that a lot of people still use pickups for work. They care about matters like towing and how much weight can be carried in the bed.
Many of those who bought pickups as a fashion statement, or for occasional hauling, reconsidered early last summer when gasoline prices spiked. Sales of full-size pickups plunged. But after gas fell back to the $2-a-gallon range, sales picked up -- only to drop again in the first three months of 2009, according to J. D. Power & Associates.
Ford and Dodge recently introduced redesigned light-duty trucks into this gloomy and uncertain market. The 2009 Dodge Ram and Ford F-150, which together accounted for almost 462,000 sales in 2008, are crucial to the finances -- indeed, the very survival -- of their parent companies. In reworking their trucks, efforts that began long before the industry fell into turmoil, the two companies took different approaches.
F-150: A Solid Effort
State Route 142 wiggles for about six miles between Franconia and Bethlehem in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. There are blind corners, somewhat neglected and often rough pavement and occasional surprises like a black bear crossing the road with her cubs. Driving the new F-150 up that road also brings surprises.
The first is how incredibly solid the truck feels, partly because Ford used more high-strength steel in it. There is none of the shimmy-shaking that troubles some pickups, including the last-generation F-150.
Another is that the steering is so good. Tight, precise and nicely weighted, it inspires confidence that the driver will be able to guide the big truck through the most tricky turn. Heading through those curves there's none of that keeling-over body lean that you often feel with tall trucks.
The downside is a ride that can be slightly stiff. But Ford reworked the springs in the rear suspension and the ride falls just short of rough.
The final surprise is that the F-150 is so quiet.
While those are all good things, Ford makes it clear that it wants the F-150 to be a respected member of the working class.
''The reputation of the truck rests on the work truck,'' said Matt O'Leary, the F-150's chief engineer. ''People buy a truck based on either capability they are going to use or capability they might use.''
There are three cab styles, four pickup boxes and seven trim levels. There is a choice of three engines, all V-8s.
The entry-level engine is a 4.6-liter V-8 with two valves per cylinder, rated at 248 horsepower. It comes with a 4-speed automatic transmission.
Then there is a 4.6-liter, 292-horse engine with three valves per cylinder, making it more efficient and powerful. It comes with a 6-speed automatic.
The top choice is a 5.4-liter V-8 that pumps out 310 horsepower; it is mated to a 6-speed automatic.
The least expensive model is a regular cab XL with rear-wheel drive, which Ford describes as nothing less than ''a true workhorse.'' Priced at $21,790, it has a 4-speed automatic transmission and the 248-horsepower engine.
On the high end is the Platinum SuperCrew. With the 5.4 engine, 6-speed automatic transmission and 4-wheel drive, it starts at $45,030.
The model I tested was an XLT SuperCrew, which Ford says is the most popular version. It had rear-wheel drive, the 292-horsepower V-8 and a bed 5.5 feet long. The starting price was $32,290. Options, including a $1,420 chrome package and $300 ''premium cloth captains chairs,'' brought the final tab to $35,540.
The SuperCrew has 43.5 inches of rear legroom, almost 5 inches more than last year's model. Two 6-foot adults can now sit in the back in stretch-out comfort. If it is necessary to carry cargo instead of people, the rear seats easily fold up, and the floor is flat. That means boxes or cargo can be stacked without rocking like a teeter-totter.
Life is also good for the people up front. The surroundings are handsome. The seats are wide and offer plenty of thigh support for tall drivers. There's nothing mysterious about the controls.
Reaching into the bed is easier on some models because of clever fold-down steps on the side and rear. The steps by the tailgate even have a help-me-up grab handle.
All F-150s come with important safety features, including antilock brakes, electronic stability control and trailer sway control. Ford says that if the trailer begins to sway enough to move the truck, the pickup's electronic stability control will steady the truck and, ideally, halt the trailer's erratic movements.
In case of a side-impact crash there are seat-mounted air bags up front for torso protection and ''air curtains'' for head protection of occupants in both the front and rear.
The F-150 did so well in front, side and rear crash tests that the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave it the group's highest rating, Top Safety Pick.
For the truck I tested, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates fuel economy at 15 miles a gallon in town and 20 m.p.g. on the highway.
Next year, Ford is expected to add one of its new EcoBoost engines. Mr. O'Leary says that turbocharged V-6 will perform like a V-8 while using fuel like a V-6.
The 5.4-liter V-8 is the choice for maximum towing, and Ford says the F-150 can pull as much as 11,300 pounds, the most in the class and 300 pounds more than the previous model. There is no standard way to calculate towing capacity, but taking each automaker at its word, Ford beats the competition by at least 500 pounds (and perhaps by as much as 2,200 pounds).
Of course, not every F-150 can tow that much. Most are rated between 8,000 and 9,500 pounds. The model I tested was rated at 8,100 pounds.
While Ford has emphasized the work-truck aspect of the new F-150, it has hardly ignored the driver and passengers. The truck is not just more capable but more pleasant, its most serious flaw a stiff, somewhat unyielding ride.
The old F-150 was something of a joke compared with the fresher Chevrolet Silverado and Toyota Tundra, but nobody should be laughing now.
INSIDE TRACK: Ford gets back in the game.
Ram: Smoother Sailing
When Dodge began working on the new Ram, officials decided they didn't care about winning the maximum-towing war. Ram owners said they were happy with their trucks' towing capacity, said Scott Kunselman, vice president for Jeep and truck product development at Chrysler.
''On average, the people are towing between a 2,000- and 5,000-pound trailer,'' he said. ''When we asked them if they need to tow 10,000 pounds they said, 'No, that is what a heavy-duty truck is for.'''
So the maximum towing capability on the new Ram is unchanged at 9,100 pounds.
What Dodge decided was important was making the new Ram more comfortable, refined and luxurious.
''It was clearly a place we could make a lot of headway,'' Mr. Kunselman said in a tacit acknowledgement that the Ram had fallen behind the competition on interior appointments.
In search of a more comfortable ride and better handling, Dodge made a big change in the rear suspension. Instead of using time-tested leaf springs, commonly found on pickups, engineers decided to use coil springs, which are more commonly found on cars.
''A leaf spring, while it is reasonably cost-efficient, has a lot of compromises in terms of a chassis system,'' Mr. Kunselman said.
The advantages of that coil-spring rear suspension are clear at every bump, break, bobble and turn in the road. The Dodge's ride remained comfortable and composed at all times. Under hard cornering there was a moderate amount of body lean, and the steering felt a bit light. But the handling of the Ram was quite good over all.
On the rough stuff, however, the Ram's body didn't feel nearly as solid as the F-150's.
The Ram's suspension, combined with my test model's 390-horsepower 5.7-liter Hemi V-8, makes for great driving entertainment, a phrase not normally associated with pickup trucks.
The acceleration is impressive; the fuel economy, not so much. The federal estimate is 13 m.p.g. in the city and 18 on the highway.
The Hemi is paired with a 5-speed automatic transmission. Two other engines are offered: a 210-horsepower 3.7-liter V-6, which comes with a 4-speed automatic, and a 310-horse 4.7-liter V-8 with a 5-speed automatic.
Prices on the Ram start at $22,420 for a regular-cab ST with rear drive and the V-6. Adding 4-wheel drive raises the price to $26,875.
I tested a top-of-the-line Laramie Crew Cab with 4-wheel drive, which had a starting price of $45,185. The total came to $52,555 at the end of a long list of options that included heated rear seats and a power sunroof.
There was also an $1,895 feature called the ''Rambox cargo management system.'' Those are basically side-saddle lockable storage containers built into the sides of the bed. Dodge is not the first to offer such storage; Chevrolet introduced a similar feature on the 2002 Avalanche; the bins are standard on that truck.
As one would expect for a truck so pricey, the tested Ram's interior was practical, with plenty of storage, as well as plush, with handsome leather atop both the dashboard and the seats.
The new Crew Cab replaces the Mega Ram, an almost cartoonishly large vehicle that wouldn't fit in many garages. Dodge says the Crew Cab has 42 inches of rear legroom. That's enough to keep a couple of 6-foot adults comfortable, and only 2 inches less than the gargantuan Mega Ram.
The rear seats easily fold up for carrying cargo. But the floor is not flat. That greatly increases the chance that cargo will slide and topple.
Mr. Kunselman said Ram owners indicated that the truck's size provided enough protection without any new safety gear. They got some anyway.
All Rams come with electronic stability control and antilock brakes. There are air curtains for head protection and seat-mounted air bags for chest protection in a side-impact crash. As with the F-150, there's a system that tries to bring a trailer under control if it begins to sway.
In the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's tests, the Ram got good marks for front and rear impacts, but a ''marginal'' rating for side impacts.
While the new Ram still looks like a big bruiser, Mr. Kunselman said it was largely aimed at families that ''have gotten into the truck segment for its utility and fallen in love with it -- it becomes the family vehicle.''
Dodge opted out of the battle for maximum-towing bragging rights and instead focused on comfort and a great ride. For many buyers, the payoff from that effort is likely to be greater than it would have been from a higher payload.
The Ram and F-150 are aimed at different consumers and have different strengths. The F-150's body is more solid and it controls body lean far better. But the Ram has a superior ride. It is also clear that while the Ram and F-150 previously trailed well behind the Chevrolet Silverado and Toyota Tundra, they are now serious competitors.
The more important question is whether, in this economy, consumers still care.

HEADLINE: A Place Like a Manor, But With Inconsistencies

BYLINE: By DAVID CORCORAN

 BODY:
IN hindsight, Aldo Cascio could have wished for better timing. Back in 2006, when he closed his Brick House for renovations, who could have predicted that he'd be reopening -- two years and $7 million later -- amid the first tremors of an economic earthquake?
 That was last April, and I'm happy to report that on the basis of two recent visits, this 1851 landmark is spiffier than ever. And it could hardly have a better steward than Mr. Cascio, a 53-year-old native of Sicily with deep roots in Wyckoff, his adopted hometown. 
 Locally, he is best known for Aldo's, a downtown restaurant that is something of a landmark itself: a 26-year-old storefront that was destroyed by fire in 1998, then rebuilt and reopened -- and is still going strong. Clearly Mr. Cascio is a long-haul kind of guy, and the renovation of the Brick House required a lot of hauling. 
 At first a farmhouse, the Brick House was greatly expanded over the decades and had been a restaurant for half a century by the time Mr. Cascio bought it in 1997. For the recent makeover, he knocked down walls and ceilings, creating a soaring entranceway with a charming mural of early Wyckoff (Dutch farm maidens, noble Indians, stone windmill, cows) by the local artist Gail Jeffer. 
 The interior -- 23,000 square feet of it -- holds mirrors, fireplaces, plush carpets, plush chairs; an inviting barroom with a long, curved granite counter; and, downstairs, a wine cellar and even a cigar bar. As for the exterior -- a joined sequence of two-story brick and clapboard structures in a vaguely Georgian style -- it lords over Godwin Avenue like a manor.
 In short, the Brick House is a reassuring emblem of solidity and prosperity for these seismic times. Now it needs to get to work solidifying its kitchen. Its high-priced, middlebrow dishes -- the work of John Marsano, the executive chef -- are an unnerving collection of hits and misses.
 Beef carpaccio, for starters, was glorious: three nearly translucent sheets of raw meat, draped over a tangle of arugula, with generous shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Nothing unexpected, but everything in its place -- a just-the-basics dish no one should try to improve on. 
 Mussels and clams in a Provencal sauce were plump and perfect. A fashion plate of an appetizer featuring beautiful, brawny helpings of roasted red peppers and grilled eggplant would have been perfect, too, if only the lead player, mozzarella, hadn't been cold and dense. Ceviche had a pleasant citrus flavor, but the small shrimps and scallops were chewy and tough. Tougher still were some of the beans in a green-bean salad -- one that seemed particularly superfluous when a garden salad showed up, unannounced, between courses.
 The kitchen's inconsistencies only blossomed when it came to main courses. Rib-eye steak, an inch thick and sprawling over its plate, was tender and properly bloody, with a head-clearing overlay of smoke and pepper. (Thin, crunchy French fries were vastly better than a gluey baked potato.) And baby-back ribs were glistening, meaty and satisfying. 
 So a veal chop should have been terrific too, right, especially at $33.95? Wrong: it was fatty, salty and undistinguished. Bouillabaisse featured accurately cooked seafood in a fish-and-vegetable broth jazzed up with Pernod; but other seafood entrees disappointed, including grouper so lacking in character you could have called it anyfish. Grilled branzino, boned tableside by an overconfident server, presented an unappetizing prospect of miscellaneous chunks and flakes.
 We tried the desserts so you wouldn't have to. The overriding impression left by each of them -- Key lime pie, tiramisu, the usuals -- was of cloying sweetness, unmodulated by canned-tasting whipped cream. A far better place to spend your after-dinner energy is that big, convivial bar, in a crowd of well-dressed singles and couples from an affluent swath of Bergen County that has seen better times and will surely see them again.

HEADLINE: Rebooting a Career, At a Technical School

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
FOR workers who have been laid off, the recession amounts to a crash course in the school of hard knocks. Many of them are responding by taking crash courses of a different sort: programs at technical or vocational institutions that provide marketable skills in a hurry, often in fields completely different from the ones in which they have spent their careers.
 Jonathan Beam, 25, enrolled last year in a course to become an electrical technician, after the closing of a physical therapy practice where he was an executive office assistant. Before that, he supervised a hotel banquet department. The course, at the Houston campus of Everest College, has provided him with a chance to make ends meet -- and to make a clean break with his resume. 
 ''I just wanted something completely different from the hectic pace I was used to and the Word documents and PowerPoint presentations,'' he said.
 The course, which he has nearly completed, runs nine months and costs $14,000. Much of that is covered by a grant and loans, he said.
 Amy Sutton of Portland, Ore., began moving toward the health care field about the time Mr. Beam moved away from it. After her long career as a real estate broker became imperiled by the plunge in home prices and sales, she began a one-year program in January to become a medical assistant, taking classes at Everest's Portland campus.
 Because she was self-employed, there was no single moment when she knew she would need to find another line of work. Sales dwindled until there were none. ''I had gone a number of months without any income at all,'' she recalled. Running her own small business, she said, ''it was like having no job and no unemployment insurance.''
 For Mr. Beam, the new career choice reflects a lifelong interest. ''Ever since I was a kid,'' he said, ''I liked taking things apart and seeing how they work.'' 
 Ms. Sutton, who is 55 and has two grown children, decided on her new field after canvassing job Web sites and seeing thousands of listings for medical assistants. When she finishes the $10,000 course, she will be qualified to do administrative work in hospitals and trauma centers, as well as performing light patient care, like keeping charts and taking blood pressure readings.
 It is unclear how many students in technical or vocational programs are using them to achieve career changes after a job loss. But program providers cite anecdotal evidence to suggest the number is growing. Enrollments over all have been rising, they say, and the student body has been skewing older.
 Vocational colleges and for-profit learning centers are appealing partly because of their convenience and efficiency. Unlike traditional campuses, they tend to offer a workmanlike atmosphere that allows progress to be made at a fast clip.
 ''We don't know how widespread it is, but there are a lot of white-collar workers who have been laid off and are looking to get back to work quickly,'' said Harris Miller, president of the Career College Association, an industry group. ''Our schools are designed so that you can do a two-year program in 16 to 18 months or a four-year program in three years.''
 WyoTech Schools, a chain of technical institutions owned by Corinthian Colleges, the same company that owns Everest, has had an increase in what Stephen Whitson, WyoTech's director of education, calls ''nonstandard students.'' These include those who have been laid off or who fear the worst and have chosen to jump before being pushed.
 The military also accounts for much of the enrollment growth, Mr. Whitson said. Hard times mean that veterans are absorbed less readily into the civilian work force after they are discharged.
 Institutions that offer training in white-collar fields also report an influx of students whom the poor labor market has forced into seeking new careers.
 ''I have heard repeatedly from our admissions offices that when they interview prospective students, they're saying they just lost their job or fear that they might lose their job,'' said David Pauldine, the president of DeVry University, which offers programs in fields related to technology and business.
 Their enrollment is ''a calculated investment as a hedge against unemployment,'' he said. ''They've been in XYZ and now they want to move into something that has legs.'' To attract more of these students, DeVry is offering ''employment gap scholarships'' of up to $1,000 a semester for up to nine semesters for students who have been laid off in the last 12 months.
 The motivation for enrolling at DeVry reflects ''the interaction of passion and practicality,'' Mr. Pauldine said. ''When the economy is good, more often we see those with a passion for the fields we offer. When the economy is bad, practicality starts to trump passion.''
 FOR Ms. Sutton and Mr. Beam, some of both led them to enroll in their courses, but practicality was clearly the main factor.
 Ms. Sutton said she regarded a job as a medical assistant as ''something where I could make a difference'' and also ''something less stressful for the rest of my working years.'' She would like to work in a physical rehabilitation center but plans to keep her real estate license and continue part-time with clients she knows well.
 Mr. Beam said that he considers his customer-service experience and other skills picked up in previous jobs as ''always something I could fall back on,'' but that he views opportunities as an electrical technician to be ''limitless.''
 ''Anything that has a plug in the wall, we can work with,'' he said.
 He is especially interested in finding a job in renewable energy, on a wind farm or at a hydroelectric plant. Displaying the pragmatic streak that led him to enroll in his course, he explained, ''You can work for a couple of years, make killer money and learn an excellent trade.''

HEADLINE: Where Planes Once Droned, Eagles Soar

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
THE old hangars are gone at Flushing Airport, an overgrown 70-acre parcel next to the Whitestone Expressway in College Point, Queens. The runway is under water, the Goodyear blimps are a distant memory, and the airplane enthusiasts who used to lean against the fence for a glimpse of a Cessna or an antique Stinson moved on decades ago.
 The airport, once the city's busiest, has been closed since 1984. Still, there is flight to be seen. On a soggy day last week, a few geese grazed on a forlorn baseball field next to the old airstrip, and another pair swooped low over 20th Avenue, the airport's northern border, and came in for a landing on a Waldbaum's parking lot. 
 A homeless man named Marty who said he grew up in College Point and twice flew out of the airport in his youth watched the geese swoop past and rattled off a list of birds he has seen there: hawks, kingfishers, an eagle and even an albino pheasant.
 ''The brackish water is a big part of this, to have such a variety of life,'' he said, standing next to a large hole in the chain-link fence that surrounds the property.
 Nature has thrived on the site since the airport's closing. Proposals have been floated to use it for a heliport, a warehouse, batting cages, driving ranges, even a blimp port, echoing the site's use as a docking station for Goodyear blimps in the 1960s and '70s. None of the ideas amounted to anything, and the property remained closed. But this could change. 
 The New York City Economic Development Corporation's plan to redevelop Willets Point, near Citi Field, involves moving five businesses into College Point Corporate Park, of which the airport property is a part. The businesses would move next to the airport, leaving the airstrip and adjacent land untouched. But Community Board 7, which represents the area, is pressuring the city to reopen part of the airport property as part of that project and convert about 40 acres next to the runway into a ''soft recreation'' area.
 Representatives of the Economic Development Corporation say any decision on the site's future depends on a full analysis, which will take time. The agency is willing to set aside at least 15 acres as a permanent natural area, said David Lombino, a spokesman for the corporation. As for the rest, he added, the ground is mushy, making future use problematic.
 ''There's really the basic question,'' Mr. Lombino said. ''Is it feasible to develop on this parcel?''
 For one thing, a vast marshland has overtaken the runway. The marshland arose after pumps used to keep the land dry were shut off when the airport closed.
 A friend of Marty's named Kevin, who is a College Point native, had a simpler explanation. ''Nature took it back,'' he said.
 Neither man wanted his last name used because the site is private and they weren't supposed to be there. It is, they said, an uncommonly wild area in the middle of the city. ''By the time you make that curve, the world disappears,'' Kevin said, pointing past the fence toward the weeds, taller than a man, that stood on the other side. 
 In the opinion of Marty, who has cultivated an interest in bird-watching, any reuse of the site, even as a park, would be troublesome. ''I'm not worried about the cost; I'm worried about the animals,'' he said. Then, glancing quickly skyward, he added: ''Look, look, look! There goes a crane over there! They eat frogs, rats.''
 Spend even a little time near the fence, and you can be forgiven for thinking that the airport is already a soft recreation area. A woman wearing a puffy vest popped through the fence; people say she feeds the cats there. A man in a camouflage jacket emerged from the tall grass walking a beagle on a yellow leash; according to him, beagle owners frequent the land to train their dogs for hunting. Recently, somebody built a dirt-bike track, complete with jumps.
 The man with the beagle gave his name as Tony and said that he had come from Astoria for a walk, as he had been doing for years. ''I don't know how long it's going to last,'' he said. ''Sooner or later, they're going to build something.''

HEADLINE: In Hartford, Fans Harbor Hope That the N.H.L. Will Return

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL. 
E-mail: cheers@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Another year has passed without the Whalers in Hartford, running the total to 12 years without an N.H.L. team in Connecticut. But the Hartford Whalers Booster Club, as ferocious as Gordie Howe, is not shutting down. It has 54 members. Not long ago, it had only 13.
 ''I guess our close friends stayed with us,'' Al Victor said, laughing. 
 Victor, 63, semiretired from running a refrigerant recovery business, is the president of a club without an actual team to cheer. After the Whalers played their last game on April 13, 1997, Peter Karmanos, their owner, moved them to North Carolina and renamed them the Hurricanes.
 Jilted fans in Hartford followed the Hurricanes for a while until they became a team of strangers. When Carolina won the Stanley Cup in 2006, only one player on the team, defenseman Glen Wesley, had been a Whaler. He retired as a player a year ago.
 But the booster club still meets once a month, usually in the community room of a downtown office building next to XL Center, formerly Hartford Civic Center, which now is home to the Hartford Wolf Pack, the Rangers' top farm club. Members of the club sometimes attend Wolf Pack games.
 Victor tracks about a half-dozen former Whalers who are active -- Brendan Shanahan, 40, and Bobby Holik, 38, play for the Devils -- and members gather to reminisce about a team they loved even though it lost 175 games more than it won over 18 years in the N.H.L.
 ''They were our team, for one thing,'' said Marty Evtushek, 60, a mail carrier who is the club's vice president. ''They were more rooted in the community. In New York, they were in their high-rises and didn't bother with the average fans. The Whalers were our neighbors.''
 The Whalers, born in Boston in 1971 as a World Hockey Association team, moved to Hartford in 1975 and became the city's own, with quirky traditions like ''Brass Bonanza,'' their hokey theme song. 
 About a dozen Whalers photographs, including action shots of favorites like Ron Francis, Kevin Dineen and Ulf Samuelsson, remain on a wall in the lobby of XL Center. One photograph is from the team's last game in Hartford, a 2-1 victory over Tampa Bay.
 Six white banners with green numbers hang from the arena's rafters, for the six Whalers, including Howe, whose jerseys were retired. A green banner saluting the 1986-87 team that won the Adams Division title hangs forlornly.
 Victor and Evtushek want the Whalers back. Although the economy is bad, and Hartford would probably have to build a new arena to lure an existing N.H.L. team or an expansion franchise, Victor said he thought the city's chances of getting another team were ''maybe 70 to 75 percent.'' The club's online petition to build an N.H.L. arena in Hartford has more than 3,000 signatures.
 Three months ago, Mayor Eddie A. Perez of Hartford updated N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman on the city's plans to build an arena. Perez said all parties at the meeting agreed to keep talking. Two weeks later, he was arrested on bribery and other charges.
 Perez has remained in office, and Victor and Evtushek said the Hartford Whalers Booster Club had not lost any ground in its grass-roots attempts to get a team. Victor said Hartford could be a temporary home to a team renovating an arena to prove Hartford is worthy.
 ''Any place that shows they can support it deserves to be looked at,'' said Shanahan, who played for the Whalers during their next-to-last year in Hartford, before he was traded to Detroit. ''When I was there, it was not a great situation because it seemed inevitable that the team was moving. But they've got a lot of passionate hockey fans.''
 Many have slipped off the bandwagon; the booster club had more than 1,500 members in 1987. But Victor and Evtushek are tenacious; each has converted a room in his home into a Whalers shrine, and the license plates on Evtushek's car read, ''H WHLR.''
 ''They're going to be buried with me,'' he said.
 Chuck Kaiton moved to Hartford from Wisconsin in 1979, the first year the Whalers played in the N.H.L. He had been hired to call the Whalers' games on the radio, and before he got the job, he admitted wondering if Hartford was big enough to support an N.H.L. team.
 Kaiton, who raised three sons in Connecticut with his wife, Mary, moved to North Carolina with the team. He continues to call Hurricanes games, but, as he said of the people in Hartford, ''I still feel I'm with them.''
 As he watched Carolina practice recently at Prudential Center in Newark, he said: ''It's not a change of teams. We're just in a different place.''
 Kaiton said he is not as optimistic as Victor and Evtushek that Hartford would get a team. He loves the city, and he and his wife go back once a year to visit friends. He said he did not think he would call another N.H.L. game in Hartford, but he also knows Victor and Evtushek.
 ''Knowing the people, knowing their zeal and resilience, I'm not surprised they're still around,'' he said of the booster club. ''I'm impressed by that -- really impressed. I think it's great because it's been part of their life.''

HEADLINE: Down In Front? Not in Hollywood

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 KEVIN MISHER, a film producer and former studio executive, asked me a provocative question a few weeks ago: ''The power of studios during tough economic times has probably risen, don't you think?''
 On consideration, I would say, yes. And, in fact, studios may be more powerful than ever.
 Such things, of course, are all but impossible to measure. Hollywood's true power equation is as slippery as the punctuation of a phrase in the clause of your contract that defines ''cash break-even.'' 
 But it is hard not to see tell-tales of studio strength around the movie business these days.
 For nearly 10 months, the big companies plowed straight through an ugly standoff with the Screen Actors Guild, simply shooting their pictures under a contract that expired long ago. (Guild members are now expected to vote on a tentative agreement that negotiators reached this month.)
 Job cuts and a worrisome drop in DVD sales notwithstanding, the major studios -- Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox, Universal Pictures, Walt Disney Studios and Warner Brothers -- have solidified their lock on the prime spring-summer release dates.
 Upstarts like Lionsgate, the Weinstein Company and Summit Entertainment will challenge the big boys with only a handful of smallish, ''counterprogrammed'' films, including dramas and romances, from May through July, while the former major MGM is sitting out until the fall.
 From the construction on Columbia's lot to the sign in the office of the Fox co-chairman Tom Rothman -- ''Big Ideas,'' it says -- evidence points to studio strength. And when the year ends, the six giants are sure to be on top of the box office, much as they have been through living memory. Their dominance has rarely been disrupted by newcomers like New Line Cinema or DreamWorks SKG -- each of which ultimately was folded into one of the majors.
 How the Big Six have managed to retain their hold on the film industry is a mystery that only deepens as seemingly durable banks and Wall Street firms crumble into one another, and as the government nudges Chrysler toward Fiat and General Motors toward bankruptcy.
 In one form or another, the movie oligopoly has persisted since not long after Paramount, the oldest of the current studios, was founded in 1912. Consent decrees separating studios from their wholly owned theater chains in 1948, or splitting Universal's then-prospective parent, MCA Inc., from its talent agency in 1962, proved to be just temporary setbacks.
 Certainly, momentum has something to do with it. The old companies have deep libraries in which many thousands of films, paid for long ago, generate cash in good years and bad.
 A favorite trick among movie studios looking for profit is simply to stop producing movies, as, for instance, Columbia mostly did before its sale to Sony in 1989. Without the expense of new investment, cash from library sales goes directly to the bottom line. 
 This year, the majors have cut overhead and tightened production to bolster profit. At the same time, they are using income from libraries to back movies that newer or smaller companies simply cannot finance in tight credit markets.
 Still, even more subtle factors may be at play. 
 One of them is a brilliantly self-protective game that studios seem to play when it comes to paying for talent. 
 When times are flush, executives are quick to bid up the price of stars, directors and writers, even while complaining publicly about rising expenses -- a reality that has always been thus.
 ''They don't mind paying for stars; it doesn't bother them,'' said Robert Evans, the producer and former Paramount chief, who knows how this stuff works.
 Like tall guys marching a line of short ones into deep water, the studios -- acting more by instinct than policy -- are simply drowning competitors who cannot afford to match their rates.
 But when times are tough, as now, the same executives can present a remarkably united front in attacking rich deals.
 When speaking privately, industry lawyers and agents complain bitterly that such behavior results from studio collusion -- something that would presumably be illegal under restraint of trade laws.
 One theory holds that studio executives and lawyers, while engaged in legitimate joint bargaining through the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers during the three-month writers strike and, later, with the actors guild, used idle moments to reach an industrywide consensus that talent costs should come down.
 If such thinking is a shade too dark, it is nonetheless rooted in a certain truth: Big studios, while competing at the multiplex and the video store, tend to help one another out when they can. 
 Any reporter who has ever done a touchy story about the industry will have learned that public relations types at one studio are quick to check signals with counterparts at another. Similarly, an independent producer mulling how much to offer a star may find that a studio will disclose the actor's last ''quote'' to a fellow studio, but isn't so quick to share it with someone outside the club.
 In fact, an invisible web-work of unwritten rules and invisible understandings -- for instance, with regard to ''turnaround,'' the mechanism for shifting projects from one company to another -- generally keep the big studios on message and in sync with one another. Over time, such professional courtesies help the big guys stay big.
 They also feed a self-fulfilling myth that says Hollywood really belongs to six giants, all of whom live behind studio walls. Their companies may change hands occasionally -- bouncing from Matsushita to Vivendi to General Electric or whatever. But the studios, and their power, remain as eternal as the hills around which those gated lots are built.
 ''We are a mini-monopoly,'' summed up Mr. Evans. (His coming project, an HBO miniseries about Sidney Korshak, the Hollywood kingpin lawyer, will have its own take on the myth.) 
 And will it ever change?
 ''Never,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Airfare Debate: Buy Now or Wait?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
BOOK now or play the waiting game? That's what a lot of travelers planning a trip to Europe this summer are asking themselves as they watch the price cutting that has gone on among the major airlines this spring, yielding some pretty sweet deals for bargain hunters. 
 In recent weeks, travelers have been able to find nonstop round-trip flights, including taxes and fees, for $477 from Chicago to Madrid for travel in April, $312 from Newark, N.J., to Dublin in May, and $482 from Washington to London in early June. 
 But even though some summer fares look attractive compared with last year's prices -- about 20 percent less on average from June through August, according to Farecast.com, which tracks airfares -- they are still considerably higher than those that were being offered this spring. (For instance, that Chicago to Madrid flight would now cost about $1,019 if you were looking to travel in mid-July.) 
 So here's where the waiting game comes in: Will airlines go through another round of price cutting as summer nears, providing great deals for those who held off buying their tickets? Or are the relatively low summer fares being offered right now the best that travelers are going to see -- especially as the stronger dollar has made Europe a more attractive option for many travelers, thus increasing the potential for fuller planes?
 In recent years, that was almost never a calculation that travelers had to make. The rule of thumb was book early, book cheap. 
 But a look back at this past Christmas-New Year's travel period -- like summer, a time when airfares typically jump -- is instructive. Many travelers found that if they waited until shortly before they flew, they were sometimes able to score considerably lower airfares than if they had booked well in advance, as airlines started cutting prices as the holidays neared and they realized a lot of seats had gone unsold. 
 Will summer offer a repeat of that trend? ''It's an important question given the current economy,'' said Steve Danishek, a Seattle-based travel agent, who has been getting asked more frequently by clients if they should book now or wait. 
 His advice: ''If they have firm dates -- a bargain cruise in Europe with specific dates -- book now because fares are very reasonable. A lower fare may occur in a week or two but may not be on dates they need.''
 Of course, those who don't want to gamble will find plenty of reason to book now. Lower fares traditionally found in the quieter shoulder seasons of May and September have already been creeping into June and August, according to Farecast.com. For example, travelers have been able to find fares between Boston and Madrid in early June for $561 compared with $840 a year ago, or New York and Paris the first week in August for $480. 
 And some deals have begun to pop up even for the peak month of July. Earlier this month, Air France was offering flights from New York to Zurich with a stop in Paris for $483 round trip, including taxes, on nearly every day in July, for example. And American is offering round-trip fares between London and New York starting at $707 round trip; last year at this time, that same fare would have been around $1,000. 
 Even better deals are being found in the front of the plane. Business-class fares to Europe, which normally run from $4,000 to $10,000 round-trip when demand is high, have been falling as corporate travel has slowed and companies have asked their employees to trade down to cheaper seats in coach. 
 American, for example, has been running a summer business-class sale to Europe, making it possible for a traveler to fly from New York to London in late June in coach and return in business class in July for $1,677 round trip, including taxes and fees. (That compares with $797.30 for a discounted coach seat in both directions -- but you also earn 863 extra miles for flying business.) 
 Continental, British Airways and Delta have also been offering attractive business-class fares aimed at leisure travelers who can book well in advance, like $1,894 from Newark to Amsterdam and $1,998 from Cleveland to London. (Keep in mind that these fares usually come with more booking restrictions than a standard business-class fare.)
 For those deciding on whether to book now or hold off, the timing of their trip might be a key consideration. Rick Seaney, chief executive of Farecompare.com, which tracks ticket prices, recommended booking now for trips to Europe in May or early June but holding off for flights later this summer. 
 ''Right now, the great deals to Europe are for departures before the end of May, and some are leaking into mid-June,'' he said, citing average nonstop round-trip fares to Europe on Continental that recently dipped to $800, which he said were a nearly unprecedented price for that month. ''I expect prices to come down for July shortly.'' 
 (To see if he is right, you can go to www.continental.com/web/en-US/content/deals/offers.)
 Mr. Seaney also expects business-class fares to go even lower. Referring to that New York-London $1,677 fare for an outbound flight in coach with a return in business, he said: ''$1,600 in late June is pretty appealing for that 'half-half' trip. I am a gambler, however, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that price point come down a bit more in a few weeks.'' 
 (In fact, two weeks after that conversation with Mr. Seaney, the fare on that same coach-business combination ticket on American dropped to $1,475.)
 Another option: Hope for a same-day upgrade. You don't have to be a frequent flier to get one these days. Major carriers including American, United and US Airways have been selling upgrades at the airport for $500 to $1,000 one-way for international flights on the day of travel -- no miles required. (Typically, a one-way upgrade from coach to business on a trans-Atlantic flight would cost 25,000 miles on American, plus a $350 processing fee.)
 For travelers simply looking for a cheap seat across the Atlantic, tinkering with travel dates is an easy way to cut costs. Kayak is one of several travel sites that allow you to quickly scan an entire month's fares for a specific destination, pinpointing which travel dates are the cheapest. 
 For instance, a recent search for a round-trip flight from New York to Paris in July showed fares ranging from $471 to $826, depending on what date you could fly. (Among the lowest: Friday the 17th and Monday the 27th; among the highest, Saturday the 11th and Friday the 24th.)
 Some travel sites offer online tools to help travelers figure out whether to book now or wait. Farecompare.com offers star ratings to show how good the fare is compared with past prices. Farecast.com evaluates price movements over time to offer travelers predictions on whether fares will go up, down or hold steady on a given route, each likelihood indicated by an arrow. 
 And practically every online travel site has its version of a fare alert system to offer potential customers a heads-up when airfares drop on a given route. 
 But predicting airfares is a bit like forecasting the weather. Even with the most sophisticated technology, you can still be way off. Ultimately, travelers must decide for themselves when to push the buy button.

To the Sports Editor: 
 Re ''Is This Seat Taken? In Front Rows of New Ballparks, Not Yet,'' April 22: What the Mets and the Yankees failed to take into account in their new stadium calculations -- a mistake Major League Baseball has been making for years -- is what constitutes a real baseball fan. I keep hearing endless hype about the fan-friendly ballpark: sushi bars and luxury suites and added legroom and galleries and other extras and distractions that have nothing to do with the game, which in the minds of the planners is far too dull to keep one's attention for nine innings.
 Sports ''tourists'' may be seduced by such frippery into plunking down big bucks for a visit to the new amusement park in town. All we real fans want is a good view of the field at a reasonable price, so we can go back again and again and feel at home, not save up our pennies to afford one trip a year while we struggle to stay involved via television and radio. 
 Louise T. Guinther
 Queens
 To the Sports Editor:
 There are still plenty of people who could afford those tickets if they chose to, but it seems that few people desire to flaunt their wealth in these unfavorable economic times. 
 Collin Orcutt
 New York
 To the Sports Editor:
 The Yankees' remedy for empty seats is to hire a real estate brokerage firm, apparently as a way of tapping into a wealthy source of customers. Rather, they should be applying the skills of revenue management as practiced by major cruise lines. 
 The same basic conditions apply in both markets: a perishable resource of limited supply for which different customers are willing to pay different prices. If a cruise line can't sell its best cabins, it often sells more lower-category fares and allocates inventory by upgrading passengers.
 The Yankees should oversell their inventory of midprice seats. Every buyer is guaranteed at least a midprice seat location, with the possibility of an upgrade to a seat in a superior location.
 Joel E. Rosenbluth
 Weston, Fla.
 To the Sports Editor:
 I continue to sit in my nonpremium $25 seats in Yankee Stadium's Grandstand, commonly referred to as the upper deck. But my outrage was sparked when I arrived two hours before game time with my 10-year-old son and was told that we could no longer stand along the outfield wall on the field level to catch home runs and tossed balls during batting practice. Going to batting practice is a tradition for kids who don't sit in the premium seats so they can get close to the players and catch balls. Now, only people with tickets for those seats are allowed in. 
 I've tried to remain a Yankees fan, but it is becoming all too clear that the corporate dollar has turned this ball field into an elitist endeavor. 
 Brenna B. Mahoney 
 Leonia, N.J. 
 To the Sports Editor: 
 Not content with all of the financial gifts they received from the city and the state, the Yankees and the Mets decided that this was the chance to get the fans to give past where it hurts. To pay more for a family's season tickets than it would cost to send a child to college for a year. To get the fans to pay more for some hot dogs, drinks and snacks than it would cost to have dinner at a good New York City restaurant. For the opportunity to have an obstructed view of the field. And now the fans are saying no. Michael Ginsburg

HEADLINE: Back Home, for One More Look

BYLINE: By SALLY FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
THE tickets were tacked up on the kitchen bulletin board for weeks. I would glance at them occasionally, and then walk away. They made my heart lurch. 
 They were our $20 entry passes to the home we had occupied for 28 years, the one in which our three daughters had grown up and married, each standing with her groom near the giant beech tree in the side yard.
 The Moorestown, N.J., Garden Club had included our former home in its annual tour, in which interiors as well as gardens are open to visitors.
 The new owners of our old home had brought the place back to its earlier glory, something we'd had neither the energy nor the resources to do. Though I was curious about the restoration, I struggled with the idea of my husband, Vic, and I handing over our tickets to a stranger at the door just to see what had been ours to begin with. 
 I had returned just once in the five years since we pulled out of the driveway, willing ourselves not to look back. That visit was to allow my aging and infirm mother one last look at the place that she, too, had loved. 
 The new owners had been extraordinarily gracious, even in the midst of their major renovation. Mom leaned on her cane and drank in the rooms, struggling to keep her composure. The visit was urgent for both of us.
 Vic, however, had never set foot in the place after we moved.
 The day of the garden tour dawned as one of those golden late spring days, making our decision even tougher. The old house always took on a kind of glow on days like this. The sun would dance off the leaded glass windows in the den, and the dining room would blush. This was a house in which rooms could, and did, blush. 
 Vic and I had left it with deep regret, the kind empty-nesters feel when the silence of absence starts climbing up the walls and the term ''rattling around'' takes on new meaning.
 Most of our friends had already turned their backs on the colonials or split levels of their earlier years, and had gratefully settled into sleek condominiums with amenities like snow removal and lawn care. We were among the last holdouts.
 Our reasons for staying were far more emotional than practical. For both of us, the house we first saw as a lark turned out to have a certain determinism about it. No matter that it was wildly impractical for a young family. No matter that it took a decade of stripping and sanding and replacing and refinishing before the place was reasonably habitable. The moment the Realtor had opened the front door to this old Jacobean (not Tudor, she had emphasized, but Jacobean) house, we knew we had to own it. We hadn't looked for things like traffic flow, insulation, sound wiring or that wonderful catchall practical people call ''low maintenance'' when we joyfully signed on the dotted line.
 Impregnable as a fortress, sometimes, and as frail as a swooning maiden at other times, the place knew no consistency. Gradually, ''it'' became ''she'' as we anthropomorphized the house into ''the Old Girl.'' We would still be hard put to explain why.
 As demanding and tyrannical as this house had been, it was also a place whose intricacy of design intrigued us for years, and whose imperfection was, itself, a kind of wonderful perfection.
 We left it for a cluster-community on a September day when the rain fell in sheets. Three burly movers cleared their throats and looked away at the sight of a woman sobbing in her emptying house. 
 Our friends assured us that we were doing the perfectly right thing. Our accountant found some way to make our move seem economically judicious. Even our daughters adjusted.
 That left two of us who never have. 
 So we did go on the garden club tour. We arrived at our old house with hordes of other ''tourists'' who also were asked to remove their shoes in the front foyer. That was probably the strangest moment of all.
 We wandered the first-floor rooms, dazed and disoriented. The bones of the house were the same. The wonderful chestnut paneling in the foyer was polished to a gleam but otherwise basically unchanged. The molding in the dining room -- ''dentil,'' we were advised by some expert -- was untouched. And yes, the den still had its wonderful old bookshelves. 
 There were even a few remnants of us. The wall sconces painstakingly made by a local artisan to replicate the late-'20s era when the house was completed were in place on the living room wall opposite the fireplace. The wallpaper we had picked for the downstairs powder room -- the source of some spirited arguments, as I recall -- also had survived.
 Upstairs, in the space we had used as our family room, the crazy patterned carpeting that we had let our daughters select in a moment of folly was gone. We'd grown to love it for its quirkiness alone. But the sweeping views of the yard were as magical as ever, and the softer wall color was definitely better than our strange choice of refrigerator white.
 Many of the other garden club wanderers recognized us -- Moorestown is a small town. Was it pity I read in their faces? Curiosity? Or just those nods of recognition that this must be bittersweet for us?
 It was the kitchen that left us speechless. Ours had been a relic, but a beloved one. It was gone. In its place was a magnificent, modern, tasteful, perfect kitchen, the kind we had dreamt about having -- someday. Everything familiar had been swept away in a major, marvelous renovation. 
 Except -- could it be? -- the old light fixture with its amber globe and sassy red ironwork was hanging where it always had. How many times that fixture had illuminated our kitchen life, including the talks I'd had so many nights with three fierce daughters, all of us sprawled on the kitchen floor, never on chairs. We'd sit there sorting out our lives, singing, bingeing on pretzels and peanuts too easily retrievable from the pantry closet nearby. It was the one place in the house where I had to blink back tears.
 It was almost dusk when we reclaimed our shoes and walked the grounds. The new owners are superb gardeners, and we marveled at the improvements. They had gotten it right. Their flowers and shrubs thrived -- ours too often withered. The grass was the green of magazine ads. 
 And, yes, the wedding tree was still there. It was the one each daughter circled with her father before she met her waiting groom.
 Some new arrivals walked up the path as we left. This time, we looked back every few steps. At one point, my husband reached for my hand. Chances are, the Old Girl wouldn't be seeing us again.

HEADLINE: Home Builders, Preparing for a Thaw

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
THE long-awaited revival for home builders has been put on hold again.
 While business was bleak last year, few in the industry foresaw the further turmoil ahead: a worsening credit crisis, sky-high foreclosure rates and plunging home values, not to mention a deepening recession.
 ''I think the picture from a year ago has certainly been tougher than most of us would have imagined,'' said Ivy Zelman, the chief executive of Zelman & Associates, a housing research firm. 
 Beleaguered builders, meanwhile, have again ramped up their defensive strategies to bolster their balance sheets and share prices, as they ride out the economic storm. To thin inventories -- and to counter competition from bank-owned houses and existing homes on the market, as well as houses from bankrupt builders -- many companies have sweetened the incentive pot, offering not only upgrades and discounts but also financing and payment protection programs. To cut costs, some are scaling back the size of the houses they build.
 At the same time, the federal government has intervened. The new economic stimulus package includes an $8,000 tax credit for certain first-time home buyers for this year, while the Federal Housing Administration has stepped in with attractive loan terms. 
 By some accounts, these measures seem to be helping somewhat. ''Instead of being six feet under, we're in critical condition,'' Ms. Zelman said of the new-home sector these days.
 Indeed, share prices of home builders are up slightly from the start of the year, after falling sharply in early March. An exchange-traded fund, SPDR S.& P. Homebuilders, which tries to replicate the performance of all publicly traded home building companies, was up about 8 percent for 2009 as of Thursday.
 Even builders are a bit more sanguine. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, which measures industry confidence, rose to 14 in April from 9 in March -- the first time it has been in double digits since October (when it was also at 14). The index, though, is still far below the level of 50 at which more builders are considered more optimistic than pessimistic.
 New-home sales have been showing signs of improvement. Last week, the Commerce Department reported that March sales were off just 0.6 percent, exceeding analysts' expectations, after climbing in February. 
 Investors in home-builder shares may be wondering whether the housing market is near its nadir or -- finally -- on the way to recovery.
 Industry analysts are at least open to the latter possibility, with some pointing to this month's announcement by Pulte Homes that it would acquire the Centex Corporation for $1.3 billion in stock, creating the nation's largest home builder.
 ''I can't imagine them making a move like this if they thought things are going to continue to deteriorate,'' said Paul Puryear of Raymond James & Associates. 
 Mr. Puryear, however, was dubious about the next recovery, which many housing experts don't expect to occur until late this year or early next. ''Even if we are seeing signs that we're at a bottom, that doesn't mean home builders will run out and start building a lot of houses anytime soon,'' he said. ''It's going to be a very long, slow recovery.''
 Mr. Puryear says the market needs to absorb as many as 1.1 million excess housing units ''before we get back to normal levels of inventory.'' And that, he said, doesn't even count the number of houses that would have been up for sale had the market been in better shape.
 The most recent census figures indicate that there was a 12.2-month supply of new homes for sale in February, or roughly double the average supply. 
 Still, some market experts predict that the new-home sector will be the first to recover in the housing market. Working in its favor, they point out, are less expensive construction materials and land, with a significant slowdown in building. (Housing starts plummeted 10.8 percent in March, to the second-lowest annual rate in records dating back 50 years, according to the Commerce Department.)
 ''There's not a lot of speculative building happening,'' said Megan McGrath, an analyst at Barclays Capital. ''Most builders are only starting construction for a home on which they have an order.'' 
 Shifting demographics also augur well for builders. ''This is a market that is increasingly dominated by first-time buyers,'' said Nishu Sood, a real estate analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. 
 He noted that this market segment, which encompasses adult offspring of the baby boomers, is unencumbered by a home to sell or a mortgage under water. Further, these buyers can take advantage of a rising number of builder financing programs, along with lower prices and interest rates and the $8,000 credit. (California offers an additional $10,000 credit for buyers of new homes; in Utah, there's a similar, $6,000 tax credit.) 
 As a result, demand for entry-level homes is expected to increase. That is why Ms. McGrath says she favors companies like D. R. Horton and KB Home, which are focused on building smaller, less expensive houses. She said she also liked Toll Brothers because of its relatively low debt level, and because the company will probably benefit from pent-up demand for the luxury homes it builds after the market recovers. 
 But even the more established buyers are scaling back right now. ''What you're seeing in the new-home market is a preference for simpler homes,'' Mr. Puryear said. ''Over-the-top finishes are out.'' 
 Pulte Homes has embraced the trend toward simplicity. 
 ''There's a bit of a move toward a smaller product nationwide in our communities,'' Richard J. Dugas Jr., the president and chief executive, said in a recent interview. He explained that floor plans for some of its new homes are more basic, and their architectural features less elaborate, than those the company once specialized in, with a greater focus on energy efficiency. 
 Pulte's purchase of Centex would provide a strong foothold in the entry-level market, thereby allowing the company to cover all demographic and geographic bases when combined with other brands like its Del Webb active-adult communities. 
 Included in the Centex portfolio are an abundance of buildable lots. ''Half of the lots are fully finished; we don't have to put any more cash into them in order to build homes on them,'' Mr. Dugas explained.
 Wall Street has been generally positive about the merger, with analysts calling it a good fit. Home builders' shares rose after the announcement. 
 In acquiring Centex, Pulte inherits around $1.7 billion in cash, doubling its cash reserve, said Vicki Bryan, a senior analyst at Gimme Credit, a bond research firm. ''The most valuable thing about that transaction is getting the cash,'' she said.
 Mr. Sood of Deutsche Bank Securities agreed, ''They have combined resources to survive through the downturn with a greater cash balance.''
 The companies with the strongest liquidity are, in fact, the best positioned, he said. ''It's like a sand timer -- the more cash they have, the more time they have,'' he said, and a Pulte-Centex combination makes for ''a pretty enormous sand timer.''
 Could further consolidation follow in the industry? Ms. Zelman says potential takeover targets could include the Ryland Group and Richmond American Homes, while possible buyers include D. R. Horton, the Lennar Corporation and NVR Inc. 
 ''NVR has the best business model,'' Ms. Zelman said, explaining that the company buys housing lots only when it's ready to build. Of limited interest are Hovnanian Enterprises and Beazer Homes USA, she said; both are highly leveraged.
 And Toll Brothers? ''Toll is a survivor,'' she said. ''But are they going to give me good returns? I'm all about the returns.''

How Low Rates Could Go
 To the Editor:
 In ''Maybe the Fed Should Go Negative'' (Economic View, April 19) N. Gregory Mankiw suggests that negative interest rates could kick-start the economy. A way to achieve this, he argues, is for the Federal Reserve to produce enough inflation to motivate people to borrow and spend. 
 But can't our current problems be traced to unsustainable levels of borrowing and spending? Keeping that merry-go-round spinning will only prolong and deepen the crisis. 
 Remember that someone has to save in order for someone else to borrow, and that savings squandered on consumption are not available for investment. Economies grow precisely because consumers do not spend but loan their savings to businesses to fund capital investment instead.
 The column argued that more inflation may be preferable to current economic problems. But with its ability to wipe out savings and stifle investment, inflation is the ultimate weapon of financial destruction. At best such a plan trades short-term gain for long-term pain. Ask anyone in Argentina if it's a deal worth making. Peter Schiff
 Wilton, Conn., April 19
 The writer, president of Euro Pacific Capital, was an adviser to the 2008 presidential campaign of Ron Paul.
 To the Editor:
 The idea of negative interest rates and a government bolstering of inflation might not be a problem for millionaires and those still in their earning years. But what about the millions of senior citizens who, struggling to get by on fixed incomes, have already been penalized by the way their interest income has dwindled away to practically nothing over the past seven months?
 When interest rates don't keep up with the cost of living, seniors are in a sense already paying the government to keep their money, and fueling whatever recovery the economy has seen. Why make it worse? Piri Halasz

HEADLINE: Would Detroit Sound Any Better in Italian?

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: Turin, Italy 

 BODY:
 BY the time Sergio Marchionne saw the other car, it was too late. 
 Zipping down the highway, the chain-smoking, risk-loving chief executive of Fiat could only brace for impact as his red Ferrari plowed into the creeping Renault with an elderly driver at the wheel. Mr. Marchionne walked away from the accident, as did the other motorist, but what was a $265,000 sports car a moment before was now junkyard scrap.
 Fast forward 18 months. Instead of driving around in one of his company's Ferraris, Maseratis or Alfa Romeos, Mr. Marchionne has been jetting back and forth among Turin, Detroit and Washington to make a deal for Chrysler, the near-bankrupt American carmaker that other auto executives consider a road hazard.
 And as Mr. Marchionne rushes to complete the Chrysler transaction by this Thursday, the deadline set by the White House, he's also kicking the tires of that other troubled American car giant, General Motors, eyeing a stake in Opel, its European unit, and its Latin American operations. 
 While industry watchers debate the merits of Mr. Marchionne's maneuvers -- and whether he can quickly complete and digest two megadeals -- a bigger question looms: If Mr. Marchionne gets his way, will the combined company soon end up resembling his ill-fated Ferrari?
 After all, Fiat is a company that itself was near bankruptcy five years ago and whose poor reputation for reliability in the 1970s led American consumers to nickname it Fix It Again Tony.
 ''It's a huge management gamble,'' says Max Warburton, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst who suggested that Mr. Marchionne wants to create a new Roman empire in the auto industry. ''It will be enormously difficult to make it truly functional. It's a moon shot.''
 The obstacles now facing Mr. Marchionne shouldn't worry just Fiat shareholders, American assembly line workers or the big United States banks that are owed tens of billions by G.M. and Chrysler. American taxpayers also have plenty at stake. (Talks between Fiat and G.M. are still very preliminary, so the hard bargaining won't start until after Chrysler's fate is decided.)
 Assuming that fractious lenders, labor leaders, Chrysler executives and Fiat itself agree on concessions and strike a deal with the government by Thursday, the White House will pour an additional $6 billion into Chrysler, bringing the Treasury's total contribution to $10 billion. Even if Chrysler ends up in bankruptcy, as seems increasingly likely, Fiat could still be in a position to acquire some of its assets. 
 And how much cash will Fiat ante up in exchange for the 20 percent stake it is now seeking in Chrysler? None, Mr. Marchionne contends. 
 Instead, the Italian automaker will offer technology that it says is worth $10 billion to enable Chrysler to make the kind of small, fuel-efficient but stylish cars that rescued Fiat from its own near-death experience in 2004. As for Opel, Fiat could end up getting help from the government of Germany, where Opel is based, akin to the federal aid being doled out in the United States. 
 ''Maybe, just maybe, he's got a once-in-a-lifetime chance to pick up car companies for free,'' says Mr. Warburton. ''It's almost too good to be true.''
 Then again, Fiat executives argue that if they succeed in reviving Chrysler, it will be more likely that American taxpayers will get their money back. Mr. Marchionne declined to comment for this article. But in a conference call with analysts on Thursday afternoon, he acknowledged the risks he faces, as well as the industry's consistent inability to cut capacity or make megadeals succeed. 
 ''Size managed well is good,'' he said. ''Size managed for empire-building purposes is nonsense.'' 
 OUTSIZE personalities and braggadocio are nothing new at Fiat. The Agnelli family, which helped found Fiat in 1899 and still owns nearly a third of the company, has always had both in abundance. 
 Often compared to the Kennedys, ''the Agnellis occupy a unique position in Italy,'' says Henry A. Kissinger, who got to know and became a close friend of the patriarch of the family, Gianni Agnelli, after President Richard M. Nixon visited Italy in the early 1970s. ''The Kennedys have some of the charisma and political impact, but not the economic and cultural impact of the Agnellis.''
 Besides, others say, the Agnellis bring an almost regal pride to their holdings.
 ''It's very much of a dynasty,'' says Diane von Furstenberg, whose first husband was an Agnelli and who is close to the current leader of the family, John Elkann. ''They are committed to the family and to keeping Fiat.''
 And in an industry facing the prospect of bankruptcies and downsizing on one continent after another, Mr. Marchionne and the Agnellis are a rare throwback to the brio that was once as much a part of making cars as gearboxes and carburetors.
 At Fiat headquarters, the top brass seem to relish the opportunity despite the awful experience of Daimler of Germany, which lost more than $10 billion after it bought Chrysler just over a decade ago and failed to turn it around. Detroit, longtime Fiat executives say, needs to take more chances, not fewer. ''They don't like risks at all; sometimes we like them too much,'' said Nevio di Giusto, head of the Fiat Group's research center.
 Of course, it's easy to be bold if you're not putting any money down, at least not right now. And that has angered lawmakers who aren't thrilled about a foreign company getting what they see as a sweetheart deal.
 ''The U.S., through its citizens, through its banks and through its workers, is delivering a company with a bow tied around it to Fiat,'' says Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, who has been critical of help for Detroit in the past but now says he does favor a more balanced deal to rescue Chrysler. ''Fiat isn't bringing much to the table,'' he said. ''I'd like them to have more skin in the game.''
 The negotiations are likely to go down to the last minute this week, and Mr. Marchionne has been playing his hand coolly. He already said the Chrysler deal has only a 50-50 chance of happening and is willing to walk away if the unions won't make more concessions or the lenders demand a cash injection from Fiat. In the conference call on Thursday, he wouldn't detail his interest in Opel, which was disclosed on Thursday by American government officials involved in the negotiations.
 ''He's unbelievably tough,'' says one top government negotiator who spoke on condition of anonymity because of his direct role in the talks. ''Marchionne is a larger-than-life character.'' 
 But more is at risk for Fiat than its poker-faced chief executive lets on. Getting the deals done is only the first step; if Mr. Marchionne fails to make them work, the cash drain could undo the turnaround he has engineered at Fiat. And if both Chrysler and Opel elude his grasp, Fiat, instead of being a driver, could end up a victim of the industry consolidation that just about everyone agrees is coming.
 AS audacious as Mr. Marchionne's dual bids may be, this isn't Fiat's first waltz with Detroit, or even with Opel. In 2000, G.M., then in the driver's seat, struck a deal to buy 20 percent of Fiat's auto unit, which in turn would help Opel and G.M. develop diesel engines while gaining new designs for its product line.
 But in what could be an omen of the challenges ahead for Mr. Marchionne, Fiat's own executives say that trying to blend the very different cultures of G.M. and Fiat was a disaster. ''We saw them like bureaucrats,'' recalls Rinaldo Rinolfi, vice president for power train research and technology. ''It was a mess.''
 Though Opel eventually benefited from Fiat's expertise with diesel engines, bitterness remains over G.M.'s unwillingness to collaborate on more-efficient gas engines that would pollute less yet have more power. ''It was difficult for them to accept that these Italian guys had good technology,'' Mr. Rinolfi said. ''They said it's too complex, too costly.''
 Eventually, the two companies parted ways, with G.M. handing Fiat $2 billion to extricate itself from the partnership, a payment negotiated by Mr. Marchionne after he became Fiat's chief executive in 2004.
 The design for the innovative gas engine that Mr. Rinolfi pushed didn't go to waste. With G.M. gone from the scene and with Mr. Marchionne's backing, Fiat developed the engine on its own. Known as the Multi-Air engine, it will have its debut in September. It consumes 10 percent less gasoline and emits 20 percent less carbon dioxide than conventional gas engines, according to Fiat. 
 Mr. Rinolfi said Fiat's more recent encounters with Chrysler engineers and executives have been much smoother. Still, his frustration with the cautious Americans five years ago seems as fresh as ever. 
 ''We had it done then,'' he said, pointing out the intricate valves and pistons of the new engine. ''We could have been in production five years ago.''
 Although Fiat executives are confident now about their ability to profit from Detroit's failings, it wasn't long ago that Fiat itself was regarded the same way as Detroit is now. It wasn't government-controlled like other European auto giants, but employees still referred to it as the ''Ministry of Auto Production,'' or simply the ministry.
 As long as Fiat dominated the Italian market, it could afford the bureaucracy, as well as the failures elsewhere -- as in the United States. But by 2004, aging models, bloated costs and the new competition that came from a more open European market had brought it to the brink of bankruptcy.
 The financial problems, along with the death of Gianni Agnelli in 2003, led some people to conclude that the era of the Agnellis and Fiat as an independent company was over. ''When my grandfather passed away, people thought we would sink and we didn't,'' said Ginevra Elkann, Mr. Agnelli's granddaughter and the sister of John Elkann, 33, the current head of the family and Fiat's vice chairman. 
 Mr. Elkann, then 27, was chosen to lead the family, which in turn brought in Mr. Marchionne from SGS, a Swiss quality-control and testing company controlled by the Agnellis. Mr. Marchionne, a lawyer who was born in Italy and raised in Canada, quickly set about revamping the company and its culture.
 He also speeded up the introduction of promising smaller models like the Punto and the redesigned Fiat 500, which began to recapture lost market share, and made a hugely successful bet on Brazil, one of the world's best car markets in recent years. Between 2006 and 2008, revenue rose to 59.3 billion euros ($76.8 billion) from 51.8 billion euros, while profit increased to 3.36 billion euros from 1.95 billion euros.
 But turning around Chrysler, and possibly Opel, will be much, much harder. Even if Fiat can retool Chrysler's factories to produce appealing, smaller cars based on Fiat technology, it will be three years before they arrive on the market, warns Philippe Houchois, an analyst at UBS.
 Mr. Marchionne is more optimistic. He says that the first cars from the Fiat-Chrysler partnership could be rolling off the assembly line in 18 months. As for Opel, union leaders in Germany are already warning that they will oppose the job cuts and workplace changes that Fiat will need to make the deal pay off. 
 Meanwhile, like just about every other big carmaker these days, Fiat is in the red. On Thursday, it reported that it had lost 410 million euros in the first quarter.
 So why would Mr. Marchionne want to take on such long odds? Aside from being remembered as the boldest auto executive of his generation, the answer is scale.
 He has long argued that Fiat needs to be far larger if it is going to be consistently profitable, producing 5.5 to 6 million cars a year rather than its current 2.2 million. Together, Fiat, Opel and Chrysler would churn out nearly six million cars a year, precisely meeting Mr. Marchionne's goal, and making Fiat one of the top five automakers in the world.
 At an extraordinary moment when the global financial crisis has put governments, rather than auto executives, in the driver's seat, Mr. Marchionne may have found a way to build an empire with -- almost -- no money down. 
 ''Never write off car companies,'' Mr. Warburton said. ''They do have a habit of coming back from the dead.''

GOD IS BACK
 How the Global Revival of Faith Is Changing the World
 By John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge
 405 pp. The Penguin Press. $27.95
 Not all that long ago, the great minds of Europe predicted a future with little or no religion. Science would make us highly skeptical of miracles. Psychiatry would direct all of our awe and wonder inward. Changing roles for women would weaken the patriarchal structure that props up clerics. Whatever script for modernity one followed, it had God playing a bit role.
 As we all know, it didn't happen that way. Modernity arrived and improvised new starring roles for God. The Americans led the way by becoming both ''the quintessentially modern country'' and a very devout one, John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge write in their new book, ''God Is Back,'' and most of the world has followed that model. In rich countries and poorer ones, democratic and undemocratic, primarily Islamic and primarily Christian -- everywhere, basically, except Europe -- devotion to God has remained surprisingly robust. 
 ''The very things that were supposed to destroy religion -- democracy and markets, technology and reason -- are combining to make it stronger,'' write Micklethwait, editor in chief of The Economist, and Wooldridge, the magazine's Washington bureau chief, who together have written previous books about globalization and American conservatism, two similarly sweeping topics. 
 To anyone who lives outside Europe, the Harvard campus or Manhattan (all faith-free zones singled out by the authors), this conclusion is not exactly startling. In most of the United States, for example, God is always back in one form or another. And various religion-stoked conflicts in the Middle East and Africa make the modern era sometimes feel like a replay of the Crusades. But the book's strength is in dissecting exactly how God managed to morph and evolve and become indispensable to the world at a time when he should have faded away. 
 Micklethwait and Wooldridge do not display the usual horror at overt religiosity that we heard in abundance from British and other European writers during the Bush years. Starting with the cheerful ad-speak of the title, they are instead astute social observers in the Tocquevillean mode, reporting from a distance in a tone just short of admiring. When it comes to American religion, they marvel mostly at its astounding success at replicating itself all over the world.
 While fundamentalists of all kinds get most of the attention, the authors zero in on another phenomenon: the growth and global spread of the American megachurch. With no state-sanctioned religion, American churches began to operate like multinational corporations; pastors became ''pastorpreneurs,'' endlessly branding and expanding, treating the flock like customers and seeding franchises all over the world. The surge of religion was ''driven by the same forces driving the success of market capitalism: competition and choice.''
 The market that niche religious leaders stepped into was the hole opened up by modernity, and their product was something the authors call ''soulcraft.'' Instead of raging against modern life, they sold themselves as easing the way for the harried middle class. Church became a place to form social bonds, get dates, meet fellow moms isolated in suburbia, lose weight. Christian America spawned a parallel world of popular culture, with books and movies telling people how to live meaningful lives. The most popular, like Rick Warren's ''Purpose-Driven Life,'' perfectly mirrored the can-do ethos of American success culture. 
 ll the while, religion began shedding its association with anti-intellectualism, and became the province of the upwardly mobile middle class. Evangelicals began graduating from college in record numbers, and Christian philanthropists began building an ''intellectual infrastructure,'' including programs and endowed chairs in the Ivy League. A new class of thinkers emerged representing what some have called ''the opening of the evangelical mind,'' and a solid religious left began to take shape, symbolized most powerfully by Barack Obama. Obama beat Hillary Clinton for many reasons, but one was his ability to ''out-God'' her, they write.
 Much of Micklethwait and Wooldridge's analysis of domestic evangelical culture is familiar. The most original parts of the book come when they follow the trail overseas, where homegrown Rick Warrens are popping up in unlikely places. The book opens with a scene from what sounds like a typical Wednesday night Bible study in, say, Colorado Springs -- a doctor, an academic, a couple of entrepreneurs, a young hipster in a Che T-shirt, sitting around someone's living room and chatting about the Bible. Only this is taking place in Shanghai, one of the many places where the casual, personalized, distinctly American style of worship is thriving. They do the same thing a group of American evangelicals would do: debate homosexuality and Darwin, vow to spread the Word, and then check their BlackBerrys before heading home.
 The authors track the explosion of Pentecostalism -- with its perfect mix of ''raw emotion and self-improvement'' -- to Brazil and South Korea. The American style even has converts in the Muslim world. Indonesia's Abdullah Gymnastiar, who has been criticized as ''the Britney Spears of Islam,'' favors wireless mikes, a chatty sermon style and casual dress. (Aa Gym, as he's known, is making a comeback after being brought low by a sex scandal in 2006.) Amr Khaled, ''Egypt's answer to Billy Graham,'' is ushering his followers into the televangelist age. His TV show features testimonials from sports stars and actresses, and he peddles cassettes and sweatshirts on his Web site. 
 Much like their American models, this new generation of religious leaders is an interesting mix of modern style and traditional message. The trick they try to pull off is making concessions to modernity without diluting their message, but in the Muslim world, especially, it's not clear how much influence they have.
 In many Muslim regions, democracy and the markets are leading to an explosion of religion in the opposite way, as fundamentalists react against sexual promiscuity and other excesses they see in modern life in general and American-style capitalism in particular. The Muslim world, Micklethwait and Wooldridge acknowledge, has been much slower to engage with modernity and has remained mostly hostile to it. There is no Koran equivalent of the various Bible zines that tailor their message to teenagers or hip-hop fans in America. There has never been a Muslim equivalent of the Enlightenment. 
 The result is a modern era that seems to be replaying the religious wars of the 17th century in a slightly altered form. Radical Islam dominates Iran, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, casting itself as an enemy of the Judeo-Christian West. Nigeria is split along religious lines. 
 Despite the dark side, the authors ultimately conclude that ''God is back, for better.'' By this they mean that religion is now a matter of choice for most people, and not a forced or inherited identity. But if that choice can lead you to either buy a sweatshirt or blow up a building, the conclusion itself seems a little forced. The reality is that God is back, for better or worse.

HEADLINE: Guitars and a New Jerseyan Scream

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
Booker T.
 Booker T. Jones, the organist who led the M.G.'s on their own and as the Stax-Volt studio band on countless Memphis soul classics, sounds more pithy and forceful than ever on ''Potato Hole'' (Anti-), an album of rock and soul instrumentals. Backed by the Drive-By Truckers with Neil Young adding lead guitar, Mr. Jones still jabs terse, unhurried melodies that sound as if he knows the lyrics but would never tell; one called ''Native New Yorker'' all but begs for words. Where the M.G.'s suavely underplayed their aggression, the rockers' multiple-guitar attack, with distortion and feedback, gives the music teeth. Familiar songs from Tom Waits (''Get Behind the Mule'') and OutKast (''Hey Ya'') are no less succinct than Mr. Jones's own pointed, ornery tunes. 
 Monks 
 The joyously hostile songs on the Monks' 1966 album, ''Black Monk Time'' -- newly reissued on the Light in the Attic label -- would be essential, strange 1960s artifacts even without the band's back story. The Monks were American G.I.'s stationed in Frankfurt who after their discharge in 1964 stayed there, put on robes and shaved their hair into tonsures to play songs expatriated not just from the United States but from anything approaching sanity. With instruments including a typical cheap electric organ and an atypical electric banjo, they cackled through songs that straddled skiffle and garage-rock, mixed vocal harmonies with atonal yowls and encompassed both relentless one-chord minimalism and peculiar stabs at pop. The album starts with a jittery antiwar screed, ''Monk Time,'' and goes on to juggle come-ons, tirades and manic, beat-driven nonsense. The levels of craftsmanship, savage glee, concept, put-on and inspiration are innumerable and inseparable. 
 Hanne Hukkelberg
 The Norwegian songwriter Hanne Hukkelberg's skewed, endearing 2006 album, ''Rykestrasse 68,'' was full of clarinets, tinkly percussion and Kurt Weill cabaret oompah. So it's a surprise that her new one, ''Blood From a Stone'' (Nettwerk), opens with electric guitars and a rock pulse hinting at U2. But even as her music turns toward rock, any thought that she has gone conventional doesn't last long; for one thing the beat never comes from a typical drum kit, and the songs teem with hovering voices and found sounds. The album gets stranger as it goes along, with Ms. Hukkelberg singing (in English) about desire and artifice, the nonexistence of God and the humble strength of things we take for granted, like ''the grass under your feet.''
 Anni Rossi
 In the era of unlimited multitracking, Anni Rossi's ''Rockwell'' (4AD) is a solo album that feels like one: an exercise in austerity, recorded in a single day. Ms. Rossi accompanies her clear, confident voice with her viola -- plucked or bowed or strummed -- abetted by bare-bones drumming and an occasional cello or keyboard. The results are akin to Andrew Bird and Joanna Newsom. Her songs have leaping, asymmetrical melodies and far-flung locales; she imagines herself as a boxer in Las Vegas, a tourist in Venice, a beekeeper in the Himalayas. Behind the whimsy she defies her own frailty. She stays on the move, with uncertainty wherever she alights. 
 Screaming Females
 Screaming Females, the scrappy New Jersey band, offer partial truth in packaging. There's only one woman, but she's the singer and guitarist, Marissa Paternoster, and she works her reedy voice up to screams on the group's new album, ''Power Move'' (Don Giovanni). She makes her guitar wail too, in songs that reach back to late-1960s power trios, with fuzzed-out riffs and psychedelic guitar solos full of scurrying lines and wah-wah abuse, tempered with an indie-rock concision that shapes the blare into songs. Everything Ms. Paternoster has on her mind -- loyalty, anger, horror-movie mayhem, ambition -- arrives in a fervid din.
 Royksopp
 Bad love and upbeat synthesizers are a perennial combination in electropop, and so are thoughts of human versus machine. Leave it to Royksopp, a duo from Norway, to combine them on its new album, ''Junior'' (Astralwerks). Between instrumentals that bounce or pump steady eighth-notes, songs with vocals by Karin Dreijer Andersson (from the Knife), Anneli Drecker (from Bel Canto), Robyn and Lykke Li sketch human-cyborg interactions including unrequited love. Robyn could be complaining about a workaholic, human or mechanical in the Abba-Philip Glass hybrid ''The Girl and the Robot,'' while in ''Vision One,'' over a keyboard riff from Stevie Wonder's ''Too High,'' Ms. Drecker describes a post-human world: ''We've already evolved into machines in our minds.'' If so, the music makes them efficient machines, busy but never threatening. 
 Neil Young
 Ever busy, Neil Young knocks out albums nowadays like blog entries. It seems he has 10 songs in him on any topic that grabs his attention: war, his childhood and now the Linc Volt. It's a 1959 Lincoln Continental, a primordial gas guzzler, that he converted to an electric hybrid. The 10 songs on ''Fork in the Road'' complement a YouTube channel, a prospective documentary and, yes, a blog (www.lincvolt.com) with manifestoes about retooling the automobile industry. Mr. Young is in his electric bar band mode as the music stomps with bluesy distorted guitar riffs. But he hasn't come up with another car song like ''Sedan Delivery'' or ''Long May You Run.'' Most of the lyrics are merely topical; it can't be easy to write something archetypal about fuel economy. A reflective ballad tucked among the rockers, ''Off the Road,'' yields a Youngian maxim: ''You know the end is not in sight/You can never take your eyes off the road.''

HEADLINE: Out of the Bodega and Onto the Scene

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

DATELINE: INDIO, Calif. 

 BODY:
 OUTSIDE a small ranch house in the Southern California desert on April 19, one of the satellite parties of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival was reaching its midafternoon peak. The D.J. blared Lil Jon into the open air, the V.I.P.'s escaped the baking sun for shade, and the girls by the pool giggled as they tossed around a bright yellow beach ball marked with the logo for one of the party's sponsors.
 But unlike most of the 18 other brands on display here (Imeem, Vitaminwater) this one stood out: Cafe Bustelo, the old Cuban-style espresso. Around the pool, its retro-kitsch symbol was everywhere: on the empty cans of Bustelo Cool littering every table; on the burlap gift bags stamped with ''I Cafe Bustelo''; and on the artfully ripped T-shirts on the models handing out coffee-and-vodka cocktails they call Dirty Bustelos. 
 For anyone who hasn't been keeping an eye on beverage marketing, it was enough to draw a confused double-take. A decadent party at a prestigious rock festival is hardly what comes to mind when you think of Cafe Bustelo, whose plain yellow and red can has been a bodega standby for eight decades. Potent, cheap and with an aura of both urban exotica and blue-collar utility, it's long been an item on the bohemian shopping list, even making it into the lyrics to ''Rent'' (''Bustelo, Marlboro, banana by the bunch''). 
 In the D.J. booth, Dominique Keegan, 37, alternated between puffs on a cigarette and praise for the coffee's down-market perfection. ''I live on Avenue C, and I go to the Essex market every day,'' he said in a half-Irish, half-French accent. ''I get my Bustelo coffee for like $2 a half-pound, and I live on that.''
 But as if proof that every humble product will eventually get its upscale rebranding, Cafe Bustelo is in the midst of a makeover. As with Pabst Blue Ribbon and Hush Puppies before it, Bustelo's appeal to the hipster demographic is being seized upon by a company eager to exploit its every last drop of cool. For the last two years, Bustelo has been a fixture at parties and giveaway suites from the Winter Music Conference to Sundance to the Oscars, and the company behind it has been sending truckloads of it to 50 Cent and Perez Hilton. 
 Whenever there is coolsploitation, however, there is potential trouble, and marketing experts say that Cafe Bustelo's reboot will not be easy. For one, it has a loyal Hispanic customer base that it can't afford to alienate. It also faces competition for that urbanite coffee dollar from Goliaths like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts. And then there is the danger that Bustelo might not be as hip as its purveyor thinks it is.
 ''Every company tries to be a lifestyle brand now,'' said Jonah Disend, the founder of Redscout, a brand strategy firm in New York. ''Everybody comes in and goes to the cool places and thinks it will just work. But it can come off as very hollow.''
 Bustelo was founded in the Bronx in 1928, and it was bought in 2000 by Rowland Coffee Roasters of Miami, a family-run former rival with deep roots in Cuban coffee making. For decades, Rowland -- and Bustelo, too -- did scant promotion beyond routine efforts like grocery samplings. But J. P. Souto, a 33-year-old grandson of the founder, has recently taken over as head of marketing, and Rowland has gone aggressive about raising Bustelo's profile. 
 Mr. Souto, trim and energetic, with striking blue-green eyes, has been working in the family business since he was 14, and says he has been drinking coffee since the cradle. (''People say it was in my bottle,'' he said. ''Just a little cafe con leche.'') 
 He says he had no idea about the jet-set youth subculture until 2007, when he was invited to the Winter Music Conference, the dance-music festival in Miami renowned for its endless parties. He took samples of Bustelo Cool, a newly introduced cafe con leche in a can whose sales couldn't get off the ground; older customers were baffled by coffee in a can. But to Mr. Souto's amazement, the kids snapped it up, looking for something to keep them going all night.
 ''My dad and my uncle would always say, 'We have to go after the young people, the young people,' but they didn't know how to do it,'' Mr. Souto said at the Coachella party, swaying to the music by Bustelo's giveaway tent. ''I was seeing people putting four or five of these things in their bag, like they were stealing something. I'm like, 'Guys, we have to start going to these events.' ''
 And indeed they have turned up, everywhere. At the MTV Video Music Awards. Lollapalooza. Los Angeles Fashion Week. On the tour rider for Jennifer Lopez (along with white lilies and Jo Malone scented candles). In music videos by skinny-jeans bands like Cobra Starship. At the elegant Gansevoort hotel in Miami, where Bustelo opened its flagship store last fall.
 So far it's been working. The company says that since 2000 Bustelo sales have increased 57 percent, to $58 million, helped by new accounts at Walgreens and 7-Eleven. Still, Bustelo is a mere bean compared with the mountains of the industry, with about a 1 percent market share of ground coffee retail sales, according to Information Resources Inc., a market research firm.
 Being the underdog -- and being inexpensive -- can be good for Bustelo's pitch. It stands to benefit from recession chic, as well as from the backlash against Starbucks, which has closed hundreds of stores and introduced new brews to fight the perception that it has lost its coffeehouse soul. Bustelo, on the other hand, has a wealth of cultural capital to spend, said Allen Adamson of Landor Associates, a branding agency.
 ''With coffee, it's about the ritual of how you prepare it, the story you tell behind it,'' Mr. Adamson said. ''How many more Colombian coffee stories can you tell? The Cuban story has the same authenticity, but it's a little fresher.''
 But there are complications. Knowing that it's unlikely that your average 20-something L train rider will brew espresso at home in Brooklyn, Rowland is pushing Bustelo Cool in hopes of eventually drawing new customers to their wider product line. 
 And then there is its ethnic juggling act. To hold on to its Hispanic base -- and to reach younger Hispanics who might not exactly be thrilled by drinking Grandma's coffee -- the company is promoting Tiempo Libre, a Grammy-nominated Cuban-American band, on one million cans of Bustelo. Jorge Gomez, the band's founder and musical director, said that the deal is the Cuban equivalent of being put on the Wheaties box. 
 ''Drinking coffee and dancing salsa is part of our culture and tradition,'' Mr. Gomez said. ''You make it a party every day, and for a Cuban party you need a little Bustelo coffee and a little music and a little rum.''
 At the Coachella party, however, salsa -- and Tiempo Libre's variant, timba -- was not in favor, and brand recognition was mixed. Jen Cooper, 26, who works in fashion, said she had never heard of Cafe Bustelo before, and tried it at the urging of her friend, Cristina Parker, 32, a music publicist who is Puerto Rican and grew up in New York. 
 If you have iced coffee in a bottle from any other company, like Starbucks, they're really milky and make your stomach a little sick,'' she said by the bar. ''But this is really good.'' She grabbed three Bustelo Cools for the road.
 A moment later, Alison Kendall Dabney, 18, strolled by in a black bikini, carrying one of the yellow beach balls. When asked over the booming bass what she thought of Cafe Bustelo, Ms. Dabney at first had no reaction. But when directed to the logo, she smiled and pointed to the flower in her hair, which had come from a patch of violets nearby.
 ''The flowers over there are purple, and this is yellow,'' she said, holding the ball. ''And the purple and the yellow contrast really well.''

HEADLINE: Avoiding a Second Trip to the Hospital

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Back in the Hospital Again'' (editorial, April 16) rightly states the fundamental challenge in reducing rehospitalizations: our nation's fragmented health system. 
 Preventing readmissions is a complex issue that involves hospitals, physicians, caregivers, patients and families. As you state, ''Most patients were readmitted for problems other than those that led to their original hospitalizations.'' Most unplanned readmissions can be traced back to our fragmented delivery system, and to the lack of social support programs for many elderly and sick patients. 
 Thoughtful public policy is needed to address this issue. As the community's health care safety net, hospitals support reform that promotes care coordination for patients and better health for America. 
 Rich Umbdenstock President and Chief Executive American Hospital Association Washington, April 16, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Members of the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers have been working with disabled adults and the geriatric population for more than 20 years to provide a service that works to keep them out of the revolving door of hospital admissions. 
 Care managers who are primarily nurses, social workers and other human services professionals in private practice coordinate medical care, ensure that their clients are getting to post-hospital doctor appointments (often accompanying them to appointments) and keep all their physicians informed as to the changes in medications and medical incidents that have taken place since their last appointment. 
 In addition, many of us are already using electronic medical records to keep track of our clients' diagnoses, medications, results of doctor appointments and dates of all hospitalizations, testing and procedures. We are at the forefront of working to prevent hospital readmissions.
 Connie Rosenberg Morristown, N.J., April 17, 2009
 The writer, a registered nurse and president of Services and Resources for Seniors, was president of the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers in 2001.
 To the Editor:
 Why are hospital readmissions so common for Medicare patients? High-risk elderly patients with multiple chronic conditions need continuity and coordination of care, not the rushed and incomplete discharge process they often experience. Patients are often too sick, too frail or too disoriented by the hospital stay to understand complicated medication regimens and instructions. 
 Follow-up care is frequently handed off not to another professional, but to an untrained and often terrified family member who has been given short notice of the discharge. Gaps in communication lead to medication and other errors, which lead to hospital readmissions. 
 This is not just a cost issue. The patients' safety and well-being are at stake. Any solution needs to include family caregivers. They can, with training and support, help reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions.
 Carol Levine New York, April 17, 2009
 The writer is director of the Families and Health Care Project at the United Hospital Fund.
 To the Editor:
 The high rate of hospital readmissions reflects a deeper illness in Medicare. Medicare now rewards doctors and hospitals for volume and pays nothing for coordination of care across time and setting. Hence, patients often leave hospitals with poor follow-up care and predictably bounce back into the hospital. 
 As you note, ''No one seems clearly in charge of a patient's welfare.'' Medicare's fee schedules are built to keep it that way.
 One answer is mobile medical teams that follow elderly patients before, during and after hospital stays, until the end of life. Dozens of these house-call teams now operate in the United States, but they are underfinanced. They make medical visits within 24 hours after a discharge to ensure that an elderly patient is stable at home and to prevent readmissions. Medicare should hold such teams accountable for clinical and economic outcomes and let them share in the savings.
 Eric De Jonge Washington, April 16, 2009
 The writer is director of geriatrics at Washington Hospital Center.
 To the Editor:
 Readmissions to the hospital are an increasing problem in hospital management today. The three main reasons are communication, communication and communication.
 There is lack of communication between the varied and numerous consultants on inpatients.
 The growth of uninsured patients leads to a disconnect in follow-up care after discharge.
 Emergency Medicaid will sometimes cover hospital costs but will not cover rehabilitation or follow-up nursing care. This leads to readmissions.
 The disconnect between hospital care and outpatient follow-up is aggravated by the increase in hospital-based physicians and the decrease in primary-care physicians managing their own patients in the hospital.
 Albert E. Sacknoff Plainview, N.Y., April 16, 2009
 The writer, a retired physician, was director of palliative care services at Huntington Hospital.
 To the Editor:
 We should have no tolerance for avoidable hospital readmissions, because keeping people healthy and out of the hospital benefits everyone.
 Fortunately, there is at least one clear, cost-effective solution to this problem: Medicare could provide ''transitional'' care designed to help people who leave the hospital stay out of the hospital.
 Nurse-led teams of medical specialists would coordinate transitions, meeting patients before discharge and developing plans for follow-up and coordinated care as they moved from different care delivery sites.
 These nurse managers would provide needed follow-through to help ensure that services are delivered, instructions followed and medications are taken as prescribed. People would stop falling through the cracks of our disjointed system, and costly readmissions would be reduced.
 At AARP, we view this idea as a common-sense strategy to help patients stay as healthy as possible while easing pressure on their caregivers and saving money. Shouldn't that be what health reform is all about? 
 Jennie Chin Hansen President, AARP Washington, April 16, 2009

HEADLINE: A Spring Surprise: Openings in Preschools

BYLINE: By JULI S. CHARKES; Mary Jo Patterson and Linda Saslow contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DOBBS FERRY 

 BODY:
 WHILE many Manhattan preschools still find themselves turning away anxious parents and their children because they don't have enough spots, directors at several nursery schools and preschools in the suburbs say that they are worried they won't fill all their openings in September. 
 ''Normally, we have phones ringing off the hook from parents inquiring about the school,'' said Linda Jo Platt, the director of the Community Nursery School here. ''This year, the phones have been dead.''
 Private nursery schools have enjoyed robust enrollment in recent years, often having long waiting lists in many suburbs around the region. But directors at private nursery schools said they are concerned that the faltering economy and listless real estate market were contributing to a dip in applications and enrollments. 
 Ms. Platt, for example, said she would typically have a waiting list of 40 to 50 families willing to pay annual tuition of $3,300 to $5,800 for full-day instruction. (Other schools in Westchester called that range typical, although the tuition was higher at some schools contacted on Long Island.) 
 Today, there is neither a waiting list nor full enrollment at Community for the coming year. The school has 10 available spaces for the fall, and in that regard it is not alone. 
 ''Everyone is stunned,'' said Olivia Hewitt, director of the Scarsdale Friends Nursery School and co-president of the Westchester Association for the Education of Young Children, a 300-member consortium of nursery school educators. Ms. Hewitt stressed the noncompetitive nature of schools that cater to young children, yet acknowledged the breadth of the challenge. ''There are empty spaces and whether or not they are in your school, it is making everyone nervous,'' she said. 
 Michelle Vogt, business manager for Smoke Rise Nursery School, a traditional nursery school serving about 55 families in Kinnelon in Morris County, N.J., said registration ended three months ago, but two of the school's classes still have openings. ''We don't think we'll be filling all of them,'' she said.
 Officials at four Long Island nursery schools said their numbers for the next school year were about normal. ''But I believe we're the exception,'' said Ron Kuznetz, the owner of Miss Sue's Nursery School and Kindergarten in Plainview, which has an enrollment of 210. ''I've heard of other nursery schools that are eliminating their afternoon programs because they can't get enough kids.''
 The drop in nursery school enrollment comes as demand for scholarship money toward daylong child-care programs is rising, said Kathleen Halas of the Child Care Council of Westchester. The council administers the county's scholarships for child-care programs, some $1 million for this fiscal year, Ms. Halas said. 
 The enrollment declines in the private schools can in some cases seem small. Ms. Hewitt's comments came on a day when she received calls from two families committed to sending children to her school, which has operated in Westchester for 55 years. That left her with just two spaces to fill for the 33-student capacity.
 But that she is contending with any available spaces this late in the year, she said, was a sharp contrast to times past. ''Typically at this time of year we are full,'' Ms. Hewitt said. ''We've never seen this before.''
 For the nursery school of the Hudson River School of Music, which had 18 enrolled, a decline in applications has led to the elimination of the program entirely, said its director, Nancy Dexter. 
 Ms. Dexter, who has headed the school in Dobbs Ferry since its inception in 1980 (and who continues as director of the school of music), said competition from a cluster of other nursery schools in the area was detrimental to her school. But she also pointed to the challenge of running a program that distinguished itself by offering violin instruction to students and required some parental participation. ''It wasn't for everyone,'' she said.
 At the Transitional Learning Center in New Rochelle, the director, Jeannette Mirabile, said applications for the coming school year were down some 20 percent. ''People are more hesitant this year, people are holding on to their money a bit more, even if that money is available,'' Ms. Mirabile said. 
 Perhaps hardest for school administrators is securing enrollment only to see parents pull out later. At Community, Ms. Platt said several families registered children while still living in New York City and planning to move to Westchester, only to reverse those plans because they could not sell properties in the city. 
 That happened at Good Shepherd Nursery School in Irvington, said its education director, Sasha Wilson, when two families reversed plans to send children to her school, choosing instead to enroll them in a preschool program paid for by the state in neighboring Tarrytown. 
 Ms. Wilson, along with other administrators, said that the drop in enrollment had brought home the sobering reality that preschools are very much linked to the fluctuations of the real estate market. ''We depend, to a certain extent, on those new families moving into town,'' she said.
 HOME sales since last September in Westchester have fallen about 40 percent compared with the same period the previous year, said Gilbert P. Mercurio, chief executive of the Westchester County Board of Realtors. 
 ''The market cooled dramatically beginning last fall,'' he said. Mr. Mercurio pointed to the beginning of the economic downturn last fall as a trigger point for a decline in the housing market.
 To make up for low numbers, several schools spoke of freezing tuition or extending hours to meet the demands of a changing clientele. Some schools are also marketing themselves more aggressively.
 Chris Lacenere, director of Kids Corner Cooperative Nursery School in Plainsboro, N.J., said two nursery schools nearby had each canceled one class because of low enrollment. She, however, expects enrollment to be full next year, but only because the school has done extra promotion.
 To counter its 20 percent drop in applications, the Transitional Learning Center in New Rochelle is relying on advertising special events, Ms. Mirabile said. Those events include extracurricular activities like pottery and tae kwon do classes and a breakfast for students and their fathers last Tuesday during which several parents stressed the importance of preschool to better prepare children for future schooling.
 ''We see the extra value of what is provided here,'' said Anthony Frazia, whose 5-year-old daughter, Jessica, is enrolled in the school.
 Still, some parents find it unaffordable, particularly now. Mary and Rob Gibbons, of Hastings-on-Hudson, sent the first three of their five daughters to private nursery schools but did not send their fourth daughter after Mr. Gibbons was laid off from his sales job. ''It became an easy decision to make,'' Ms. Gibbons said.
 Other schools pointed to the necessity of meeting parents' changing needs. At the Alcott School in Scarsdale, enrollment is full for the fall, but its waiting list has shrunk to 20 families from 40 to 50. Alcott has extended the afternoon session for preschoolers by a half-hour, said the school's executive director, Beth Farkas.
 Alcott has also expanded after-school programs including soccer, golf and tennis classes. ''We have had to think creatively, reassess programs and be more flexible,'' said Ms. Farkas, who acknowledged that as one of Westchester's largest programs -- the Scarsdale campus caters to 130 families -- the school can absorb lower enrollment numbers more easily than smaller schools.
 Gauging parents' needs can be tricky. Bruce Schnittman, owner of Crestwood Country Day School in Melville on Long Island, said it decided to offer an afternoon program that was significantly cheaper than the morning program. ''But only two people signed up,'' he said, and those children will become part of the full-day program.
 Still, for administrators hoping to maintain staffing levels, this year has caused worries. 
 To counter that, Ms. Platt of the Community school said she was putting into place a couple of firsts: an open house on April 26 that she hoped would draw more applications and help avoid having to cut staff. She also posted a sign outside the school to advertise openings. That sign joins two others just down the road from her, advertising space available at two separate schools. 
 Ms. Platt attributed that visual clue to a changing time. ''We all expanded to meet the demands of the population these past years,'' she said. ''Now we have to figure out how to deal with a contraction.''

HEADLINE: When Cartier Was Just for the Likes of Liz

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
LUXURY once denoted stuff that was costly and hard to obtain. The noun bespoke well-upholstered and Gatsby-esque lives played out against a backdrop of mansions and servants and among others who, as Holly Brubach once observed in The New York Times, ''ordered their trunks from Louis Vuitton, their trousseaux from Christian Dior, their Dom Perignon by the case.'' 
 Carriage-trade luxury went south a while ago and with it went the carriage trade itself. On the way out, it passed a new class of people who -- although they might never be able to afford an apartment at 740 Park Avenue or a summer place in Dark Harbor -- had acquired both the ability and the hankering to purchase themselves little nothings from Vuitton, Chanel or Dior. 
 And thus, even in a recession, the client most crucial to luxury goods purveyors is no longer a Rockefeller but a Real Housewife of New York.
 And that may account for the decision made by Cartier, the 163-year-old French jewelry house now owned by the Richemont group, to take a populist tack when celebrating its United States centenary. Gathering baubles commissioned over the last century by the celebrated, the rich and the swell, Cartier has installed them in its Fifth Avenue flagship for ''Cartier ... 100 Years of Passion and Free Spirit in America'' (opening May 1) a rare chance for hoi polloi to get a close look at how the other half once lived.
 ''Cartier is a true luxury brand,'' Frederic de Narp, president and chief executive of Cartier North America, said last week, adding that ''there is no fashion at Cartier, there are no seasonal products. There is just the timelessness of something valuable cherished for generation after generation.''
 Yet like most of its competitors, Cartier long ago expanded its scope to include perfume and eyewear, stuff that lacks the recherche glamour of an emerald parure but that does a lot for a company's bottom line. 
 It is true that people are left in the world who recognize where to go when they suddenly find themselves in need of a diamond tiara, but they are few. Even before the economy got Madoffed, the pool of clients had dwindled for the sort of baubles the ultrarich once bought to amuse themselves. 
 And so, particularly at a time when strapped consumers are questioning both their buying habits and the durable value of last year's ''It'' bag, there is a certain pleasure to be gained from ogling the keepsakes of boom times, when people with plenty of money -- but also time and taste -- dropped into Cartier when they felt the itch for a jeweled card case.
 Borrowed from clients, estates or else the vaults of Cartier's Swiss archive, the show is replete with objects like the Duchess of Windsor's lorgnette and the diamond and panther brooch created for the Woolworth heiress Barbara Hutton. 
 There is a bracelet of carved emeralds and rubies made for Ganna Walska, the marginally talented opera singer whose genuine gift was marrying well and often (six times). There is the jeweled handbag Conde Nast's wife had engraved with her home address (1040 Park Avenue) in the possibly delusional expectation that it would be returned if ever mislaid. 
 And among the other giddily refined oddments is Mary Pickford's vanity case, Mrs. Cole Porter's tutti-frutti dress clips, J. P. Morgan's perfume bottle, the Triple Crown trophy, Mrs. Vanderbilt's jeweled car travel case and Grace Kelly's poodle pin. From Elizabeth Taylor's legendary trove is a ruby and diamond suite that her husband Mike Todd gave her (at poolside, as captured on a film clip that is part of the show). Also there is La Peregrina, a pear-shaped pearl that was discovered in the early 16th century, owned by Mary Tudor, the Spanish queens Margarita and Isabel, and purchased at auction in 1969 by Richard Burton for $37,000. Cartier set it with diamonds, pearls and rubies in 1972.
 ''We are all about stories at Cartier,'' said Mr. de Narp, an assertion seconded by Ms. Taylor herself. 
 ''Of course I wear my jewelry!'' the actress said in an e-mail exchange. ''I wear the important pieces as well as the simpler ones that I love as much. '' Wearing an exceptional gem ''gives me a real high,'' she added, and playing with jewelry is among her preferred pastimes, ''because each piece tells a story, taking me back to a special person or time or place.'' Stones have a life of their own, said Ms. Taylor, whose authority on the subject is incontestable. ''There's something mystical about them. They have their own vitality.''
 For Cartier and other luxury goods houses, as Mr. de Narp said, ''We are in a defining moment because people are disoriented and need reassurance,'' by the economic downturn. ''They need something rock solid,'' he added, like rocks.

 BODY:
BAD MONEY: Reckless Finance, Failed Politics, and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism, by Kevin Phillips. (Penguin, $16.) When Phillips's 14th book was published last year, some found its warnings of America's declining position in the world economy to be overly pessimistic. Now he has added a preface and epilogue and sharpened his argument about how ''speculative finance rose to a counterproductive economic and political dominance.'' ''The best way to understand what went wrong is to conduct a postmortem'' on this ''25-year metastasis,'' he writes. 
 TRAUMA, by Patrick McGrath. (Vintage, $14.95.) McGrath trades in his customary Gothic methods for a more straightforward Freudianism in this story of a New York psychiatrist in the 1970s who counsels trauma victims. Guilt about the unintended consequences of his actions and long-delayed recognitions about his life send the man into a downward spiral. 
 A CRIME SO MONSTROUS: Face-to-Face With Modern Day Slavery, by E. Benjamin Skinner. (Free Press, $16.) ''There are more slaves today than at any point in human history,'' Skinner writes in this devastating book. By slaves he means people coerced by violence to work for no pay. Some prostitutes fall into this category, but a majority of slaves, he says, are domestic servants or forced laborers. Skinner reports from centers of the modern slave trade, including Haiti, Sudan, Romania, Turkey, India, the Netherlands -- and Miami. 
 SNEAKER WARS: The Enemy Brothers Who Founded Adidas and Puma and the Family Feud That Forever Changed the Business of Sports, by Barbara Smit. (Ecco/Harper Perennial, $15.99.) Smit's thesis is that the rift between Adi and Rudolf Dassler, who founded a small shoe company together in the 1920s but eventually parted ways and started rival companies, gave rise to the payoffs and endorsement deals that characterize sports today. 
 WOLF TOTEM, by Jiang Rong. Translated by Howard Goldblatt. (Penguin, $15.) This novel, which describes the education of an intellectual from China's Han majority who lives with nomadic herders in the grasslands of Inner Mongolia during the Cultural Revolution, was a runaway best seller in China and won the first Man Asian Literary Prize. Jiang (a recently retired political scientist writing under a pseudonym) conveys the romantic desolation of the steppes and praises the ''vigorous, unrestrained blood'' of the Mongolians over the docile Chinese, whom he likens to sheep. Writing in the Book Review, Pankaj Mishra found the novel's literary claims ''shaky'' but recommended it as a ''guide to the troubled self-images'' of the Chinese people as they ''stumble . . . into modernity.'' 
 THE SECOND PLANE. SEPTEMBER 11: Terror and Boredom, by Martin Amis. (Vintage International, $14.95.) These essays about Islamism, terrorism and theocracy are ''an invitation to behold the prose and not the plane,'' our reviewer, Leon Wieseltier, wrote. 
 THE PAINTER FROM SHANGHAI, by Jennifer Cody Epstein. (Norton, $14.95.) Epstein's ''luminous first novel,'' as Sarah Towers called it in the Book Review, tells an ''irresistible story'' based on the life of Pan Yuliang, a child prostitute who became a well-known artist both in China and in Paris. 
 A SUMMER OF HUMMINGBIRDS: Love, Art, and Scandal in the Intersecting Worlds of Emily Dickinson, Mark Twain, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Martin Johnson Heade, by Christopher Benfey. (Penguin, $16.) In this charming book, Benfey suggests that the summer of 1882 saw a transformation of sensibility among a loose group of cultured New Englanders. 
 THE MAYOR'S TONGUE, by Nathaniel Rich. (Riverhead, $16.) Everyone tells stories in this magical realist novel, Rich's first, which centers on the search for a mysterious author who disappeared 30 years ago. Rich writes ''generously and movingly,'' our reviewer, Sophie Gee, said, praising the novel's ''dreamlike quality'' and ''novelty denouement.'' 
 PHYSICS OF THE IMPOSSIBLE: A Scientific Exploration Into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel, by Michio Kaku. (Anchor, $15.95.) ''The serious study of the impossible has frequently opened up rich and unexpected domains of science,'' Kaku, a theoretical physicist and tireless science popularizer, writes. Here he examines which ''impossibles'' might be achievable in our century and which will have to wait. (Unfortunately, it turns out that an invisibility cloak like Harry Potter's would hide you but also make it impossible for you to see anything.) 
 A CARRION DEATH, by Michael Stanley. (Harper, $14.99.) This first novel, awash in local color, centers around shady business at a diamond mine and the land claims of Kalahari Bushmen; it introduces a portly Botswanan detective known as Kubu, Setswana for hippopotamus. ''Michael Stanley'' is the team of Michael Sears and Stanley Trollip, Johannesburg natives.

HEADLINE: No, You Can't Get an Upgrade

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
We are not going anywhere.
 That is what we learned from a report last week by the Census Bureau which found that fewer Americans are changing residences than at any time since 1962, back when there were 120 million fewer Americans than today.
 The numbers are yet another worrying beep from the array of gizmos that monitor our economic coma. But the report also signals a profound, if barely noticed, change to our national psyche, one that goes far beyond the way we think about housing. 
 For decades, Americans have been known as epic consumers, but it would be more accurate to call us epic upgraders. During all those years of packing up and moving, we were headed to a bigger house, at a better address, perhaps for a higher-paying job. We were trading up, and that urge -- to acquire something bigger or better, preferably something bigger and better -- is a quintessentially American urge. It is so neatly woven into the double helix of our DNA that we hardly notice it.
 When we buy a television, it's rarely because we lack a TV. We want a thinner TV, or a bigger TV, or a TV with features that sound beguiling even if we have no idea what they do. Like the DynaLight Dynamic Back Light Control on the latest Toshiba high-definition set. What is that? We don't know. But we'll take two.
 Or we would if we could afford them. To fully understand our collective shock over our pulse-less economy, take a good look at the upgrade cycle that we've been gleefully riding for at least three decades. Until last year, if you were living the 2.3 version of Life, you had your eyes on version 2.4 and odds were pretty good that you'd get it. Maybe on an overextended credit card, or from a loan that you really couldn't afford. But you'd get it.
 Now, if you're living Life 2.3, your ambition is to avoid Life 2.2.
 Forget the upgrade. The game now is avoiding the downgrade. This is grim and troubling, in part, because so much of our consumer culture is built around the enticements of the Better. 
 Entire corporate strategies target the bottomless American appetite for the upgrade. Holders of American Express's regular old green card might eventually get an invitation to upgrade to a gold card. (More privileges, more perks! For a fee, of course.) And once you've swiped that baby for a while, you might get an invitation to upgrade to platinum. (Yet more privileges, yet more perks! And higher fees.) If you behave yourself with the platinum card, you could join the purportedly exclusive ranks of black card holders, who pay a one-time initiation fee of $5,000 and then $2,500 annually.
 All of these slabs of plastic do basically the same thing -- help you acquire stuff -- but they also confer ever larger increments of cachet on the holder. This allows you to upgrade your material life while signaling, to anyone who can see you in midpurchase, just how upgraded your material life already is.
 No company has exploited America's upgrade fever quite as deftly as Apple. The company is one of the very few that has kept most prices at prerecession levels while managing to report profits, as it did last week. Of course, Apple makes wonderful computers, software and gadgets, but is also brilliant at making everything you bought from it nine months ago seem slow, fusty and passe.
 The compulsion to upgrade is most glaring in cities -- particularly New York and Los Angeles -- which are filled with the upwardly mobile who relocate in search of upgraded opportunities surrounded by savvier, richer, trendier people. These transplants are constantly trading up not just their jobs but their group of friends. Everyone in New York and L.A. has had this experience: you make a plan for dinner with a buddy, which he cancels with a lame, last minute excuse (''I'm just exhausted''). What you both know is that he got a late-breaking better offer. He upgraded his dinner.
 The cities themselves are constantly being upgraded; there is scarcely a block in Manhattan that is far from a construction site, or a building that's just been knocked down to make way for a bigger, better building. The upgrade-seekers of the city intuitively understand the city's own upgrade addiction and are remarkably tolerant of the noise and inconvenience. Contrast that with Paris, a city that radiates a contentment with its present state. You can walk for miles without seeing a crane, hard hat or jackhammer.
 In the United States, upgrade-mania has bred a sense of entitlement, which has only stoked upgrade demands. In recent years, when anything went wrong in any transaction -- the airline misplaced your luggage, Little Caesars sent you a medium with pepperoni and mushroom and you hate mushrooms -- you were owed an upgrade. A business class ticket, an order of crazy bread, something.
 Perhaps the sense of being owed an extra won't go away any time soon.
 But there has long been an on-again, off-again war in the American soul between the forces of consumerism and the countervailing force of austerity. The consumers have had the upper hand for decades, but we might have little choice now but to find comfort in the words of the philosopher and transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau, who wrote, ''Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.''
 Obviously, this man didn't live in the age of Canon Elph, or the XBox 360 or the Range Rover LR3. But we can't afford that cute new, teeny weeny digital camera in the Best Buy insert, so we'll have to stick with the now ungainly looking model we bought a year ago. We can't afford the Elite Passes and Gold Club memberships that were the open sesame to spiffier rental cars and bigger hotel rooms, so we'll have to get used to compact vehicles and the double at the Motel 6.
 And the house you own? Well, if you can still make the mortgage payments, learn to love it. Because for the time being, it will have to do.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. in Advanced Stages of Plan to Sell Bonds to Raise Money for a New Loan Program

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Hoping to raise money quickly for a new $500 billion emergency loan program, the International Monetary Fund is in the advanced stages of a plan to sell bonds for the first time in its history, officials for the group said Saturday.
 The bonds' buyers are expected to be the governments of fast-growing emerging economic powers like China, Russia, Brazil and India. 
 Though the fund has been authorized for decades to raise cash by selling bonds, officials have never done so because they wanted to avoid what amounts to short-term borrowing. 
 But the new plan is a response to the growing political clout of countries like China and Brazil, which have become important economic powers and potentially major contributors to the fund, but which are frustrated by their small share of voting power.
 As the United States and the European Union have pushed to raise money for the $500 billion lending program to help countries weather the global financial crisis, the big emerging-market countries have demanded that they obtain a bigger voting stake in the fund in exchange for big new financial contributions.
 The United States has generally supported an overhaul of the organization's voting structure, but many European countries oppose a dramatic shift, because it would dilute their own voting power. 
 To get around the roadblock, fund officials said they are close to agreeing on a plan to sell bonds to countries including China, Russia, Brazil and India. The bonds would have to be repaid after one or two years, so they would not increase the fund's permanent resources. 
 But they would provide the fund with a way to raise the entire $500 billion quickly enough to help countries trapped in cash squeezes because of the frozen credit markets.
 ''There was a lot of discussion that the fund would use the possibility to issue notes that could be bought by central banks, which could be a vehicle for some countries to provide resources to the fund,'' said Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the I.M.F.'s managing director, after a meeting with officials from member countries here on Saturday.
 Other officials said the plans were serious and in an advanced stage, though they stopped short of saying that a bond offering was ready to be started.
 ''What this signifies is that the emerging markets are drawing a line in the sand,'' said Eswar Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University and a former senior economist for the I.M.F. ''From the perspective of the key emerging countries, they are being asked to contribute a very substantial amount of resources in exchange for a very uncertain promise of reform.''
 China, for example, has only 3.78 percent of the voting power at the I.M.F. But the United States and other wealthy nations are hoping that it contributes $40 billion, or 8 percent, of the new emergency fund. 
 American officials said they supported the proposed bond issue, adding that the most important priority was to raise the necessary money as quickly as possible. The United States, Europe and Japan have each pledged to contribute $100 billion to the new lending facility. 
 Though finance ministers attending the I.M.F.'s annual meeting here have expressed increased optimism that the global financial crisis is easing, American officials and fund officials have also warned that a recovery is still months away and that it will be even longer before unemployment stops climbing and begins to recede. 
 The idea for the new lending program is to provide flexible credit lines to poorer countries that found themselves blindsided by the sudden inability to borrow in global capital markets.
 Poland, Mexico and Colombia have signed up to borrow from the program, and more countries are expected to do so as well.

HEADLINE: Without Superfund Tax, Stimulus Aids Cleanups

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: VINELAND, N.J. 

 BODY:
The Superfund program to clean up the nation's most contaminated industrial sites was established nearly 30 years ago on the principle that those responsible for toxic pollution should pay for it. 
 So why is the government spending $600 million in stimulus money to work on sites like the defunct arsenic-fouled Vineland Chemical Company plant here in South Jersey? 
 Environmental Protection Agency officials and environmentalists say the Superfund program has been chronically underfinanced since a tax that supported it expired in 1995. 
 What is more, the old Vineland plant, like hundreds of other toxic dumps, is a so-called orphan site, meaning that either no responsible party has been found or money from the original polluter has been exhausted. So the taxpayer is on the hook for the remedial work.
 Vineland's former owners, now deceased, paid $3 million toward a cleanup that began a decade ago and has already cost more than $120 million. The site will get $10 million to $25 million in stimulus money to speed a continuing project to purge arsenic and other chemicals from soil and water on the site's 54 acres.
 Lisa P. Jackson, administrator of the E.P.A., said the use of stimulus money would accelerate progress at 50 Superfund sites in 28 states, including eight abandoned industrial sites in New Jersey and two on Long Island.
 ''Under the Recovery Act,'' Ms. Jackson said, using the formal term for the stimulus package, ''we're getting harmful pollutants and dangerous chemicals out of these communities and putting jobs and investment back in.''
 Ronald Naman, the E.P.A. manager for the Vineland site, said the new money would create or save about 20 jobs and allow the current phase of the cleanup to be completed in as little as two years rather than four. As Mr. Naman spoke, three large earth-moving machines were scooping muck out of the Blackwater Branch creek, piling it up to dry so the toxic chemicals could be removed and shipped to landfills.
 Mr. Naman said arsenic in soil and water from the company's pesticide operations still posed a threat to human health and would take years to remedy. The agency, working with private contractors, has processed billions of gallons of tainted water and millions of pounds of polluted soil over the past several years.
 Until 1995, cleanups at orphan sites like Vineland were paid in part from a trust fund based on taxes from polluting industries. But that year, the Republican-run Congress, responding to industry complaints, refused to reauthorize the Superfund tax, which once collected hundreds of millions of dollars a year from chemical and oil companies.
 President Obama wants to restore the tax and assumes it will provide $1 billion in revenues for his 2011 budget. 
 Until then, financing for work at the nation's nearly 1,600 Superfund sites will come from taxpayers in the form of E.P.A. appropriations or stimulus money. The $600 million in stimulus money virtually doubles the amount available for Superfund work in the current fiscal year, officials said.
 ''The money we provided in the recovery package for Superfund sites in New Jersey and nationwide is critical for putting people to work cleaning up polluted sites to protect the health of our communities,'' said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, who is sponsoring legislation to restore the Superfund tax. ''Ultimately, however, it should be polluters that pay for these cleanups, not taxpayers, which is why we will work to restore the 'polluter pays' principle.''
 E.P.A. officials said the agency continued to spend millions of dollars a year investigating Superfund polluters and forcing them to pay for their misdeeds. None of the stimulus money will go to lawyers to pursue recovery, they said, though the new money will allow the agency to use appropriations to pursue polluters.
 Officials said the 50 sites receiving stimulus money were chosen because their cleanups had progressed considerably. The goal at most sites is to remove the toxins and to allow the property to return to productive or recreational use.
 Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said the elimination of the Superfund tax had undermined the program by slowing progress at hundreds of orphan toxic dumps across the country.
 ''We need the money,'' Mr. Tittel said. ''Some of these sites are just sitting there, with chemicals leaching into groundwater and toxic dust blowing around.''
 Mr. Tittel said he would have preferred that the new money be directed to the most dangerous sites rather than those closest to completion. But he said any new money was welcome until Mr. Obama could make good on his promise to reinstate the tax.
 ''Those who created these problems are those who should be cleaning it up,'' Mr. Tittel said, ''not the taxpayers.''
 The American Chemistry Council, the industry's trade association, said that its member companies had paid for hundreds of investigations and toxic cleanups and that it favored making the parties responsible for the messes pay for them. It opposes renewing the Superfund tax that makes all manufacturers pay for the sins of the few.
 ''We strongly believe that Superfund taxes should not be reinstated,'' the group said in a policy statement. It added that it believed such taxes supported a variety of activities -- including administration, research and cleanup of abandoned sites -- that should properly come from general government revenue.
 Jane Morton Galetto, president of a citizens' group in the area around the Vineland site, praised the E.P.A.'s efforts so far, although she expressed anger that the owners of the chemical plant had paid just a fraction of the cleanup cost.
 ''The amount of arsenic on this site is huge, and we've waited a long time to see it cleaned up,'' she said. ''Anything that can expedite the cleanup of this highly contaminated area is welcome. 
 ''The faster we address it, the better off the entire ecosystem will be.''

HEADLINE: The Rocket Science of Missile Threats

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
Many Western analysts greeted North Korea's failure to put a satellite into orbit early this month with scorn, with one joke complimenting the dictator for a successful launch into the deep sea.
 ''Pacific plankton will forever live in fear of the mighty reach of Kim Jong Il,'' one analyst wrote, ''now that millions have perished in one mighty splash.''
 But not everyone is laughing. Others have portrayed the rocket launching not as an embarrassing flop but a technical success that threatens the West with atomic ruin. ''This is a very serious development,'' Frank J. Gaffney Jr., a former Pentagon official who directs the Center for Security Policy, a private group in Washington, said of the Korean launching on the MSNBC talk show ''Hardball.'' Eerily, such upbeat assessments sounded much like those of Pyongyang, which boasted that the satellite was up there after all, broadcasting patriotic tunes from outer space. 
 What gives? Nothing unusual in the strange world of defense lobbying, where threat inflation and deflation can portray the same potential enemy as a dwarf one minute, a towering giant the next.
 In this case, the hidden agendas centered on the Pentagon's antimissile program, which has consumed some $100 billion in the last decade and still costs about $10 billion a year. Analysts pooh-poohing the North Korean launch want that money for arms control, while the ringers of alarm bells want to save the program from administration budget cutters.
 ''The advocates want to scare people, so they hype the threat,'' said Philip E. Coyle III, a former director of weapon testing at the Pentagon and a senior adviser to the Center for Defense Information, a private group in Washington, D.C. They see stark portrayals of Korean danger, Dr. Coyle added, ''as an opportunity to promote missile defense.''
 Such portrayals take bravado, since the failed launching was North Korea's third unsuccessful bid to loft a satellite in a decade, the splashdown made all the more humiliating by Pyongyang's weeks of drumrolls and world defiance.
 Still, antimissile backers rose to the occasion. ''North Korea has successfully tested a long-range ballistic missile,'' Riki Ellison, president of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, commented in a news release. ''This success coupled with the North Korean nuclear weapons makes North Korea a nuclear threat.''
 Mr. Ellison, a former linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers, makes no apologies for his group's advocacy. Located in Old Town Alexandria, Va., just down the road from the Pentagon, the alliance has on its advisory board three former directors of the Pentagon's antimissile program, as well as a number of other military heavyweights.
 Mr. Gaffney, a pioneer of antimissile advocacy, is a conservative celebrity. An architect of President Ronald Reagan's Star Wars program, he left the Pentagon in 1987 and then set up the Center for Security Policy, which prides itself on antimissile education.
 The technical products upon which these men lavish such hopes and praise already sprawl across the wilds of Alaska and a sister base in California. There, in the last five years, military contractors have installed two dozen interceptor rockets meant to shoot down North Korean warheads.
 But test flights of the interceptors have repeatedly fallen short, and critics call the supposed protection a mirage. ''The U.S. track record for the successful interception of ballistic missiles is not much better than North Korea's track record for launching ballistic missiles,'' said Tim Brown, a senior fellow at GlobalSecurity.org, a private group in Alexandria, Va.
 Even so, Mr. Gaffney hails the weapons as potential saviors. After telling ''Hardball'' that a North Korean nuclear attack could turn the United States ''into a preindustrial society,'' he lauded the arsenal of interceptors. ''Thank God we've got a missile defense,'' he said.
 Antimissile foes take the other tack, demeaning the Korean threat. Joseph Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund, a private group that seeks to curb the spread of nuclear arms, dismissed the Korean test flight as not only a failure but intrinsically nonthreatening. To become a military danger anytime soon, he told CNN, North Korea would need to make bigger missiles, and warheads that are more compact to put atop them. 
 ''North Korea simply does not have the technical background or institutional capacity,'' he argued. ''It is time to put aside the hype.''
 Engineers tend to inhabit the middle ground, saying that failures teach more than successes and that the North Koreans are slowly -- albeit very slowly -- learning rocketry. David C. Wright, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Cambridge, Mass., noted that the recent Korean test was less of a failure than the nation's 2006 attempt, and that the flop might provide useful information about how to make improvements.
 The scary warnings over the Korean test seem to have had little impact on Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates. On April 6, the Monday after the launching, he proposed $1.4 billion in budget cuts for the Pentagon's antimissile program in the coming fiscal year -- a reduction of about 15 percent.
 Mr. Gates said he would recommend against a planned increase in the number of interceptors in Alaska, and would scrap efforts to develop an advanced interceptor warhead.
 But he also sought the middle ground. In a nod to emerging dangers, as well as his political constituencies, Mr. Gates said the department planned to keep financing research meant to improve existing defenses against rogue states -- a threat, he added, that ''North Korea's missile launch this past weekend reminds us is real.''

HEADLINE: A Long Wait for Another Shot at Broadway

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
AMONG the many oddities in and around Samuel Beckett's ''Waiting for Godot,'' which returns to Broadway this spring after a wait of more than half a century, maybe none is more bizarre than the location of the play's American debut. 
 Beckett's bleak, mordant masterwork, probably the most important play of the 20th century, was born in America astride a palm tree. The first performances took place at the Coconut Grove Playhouse in Miami, at the height of the winter tourist season.
 Perhaps unsurprisingly -- apologies to the good people of 1956 Miami -- the reception amid the swizzle sticks and shuffleboards was general nonplusment. During the two-week run of this darkly funny meditation on life's meaningless routine, audiences left in droves and lines routinely formed at the box office to return tickets. 
 In an interview a decade after the production with Mel Gussow of The New York Times, Bert Lahr, who played the role of Estragon, noted the incongruity, saying that performing the show in Miami ''was like trying it out in truant school.'' Lahr, a versatile comic actor who would come to consider the role the most significant artistic experience of his career, also offered pithy variations on the joke: ''Playing 'Waiting for Godot' in Miami was like doing 'Giselle' at Roseland,'' he once said. 
 An out-of-town tryout was standard for the time, but ''Waiting for Godot'' was hardly your standard Broadway-bound fare. And the hucksterish marketing tactics of the producer, Michael Myerberg, did not prepare audiences for the play's aesthetic radicalism. In advertisements Myerberg famously hyped the show as ''the laugh sensation of two continents.'' Har har. Two scruffy tramps hope, fear, bicker and bond, are bored, make jokes and despair, to no discernible end. Estragon himself put it best: ''Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful!''
 To his credit Myerberg was a believer in the play's appeal to audiences, with or without knee-slapping laughs. Unbowed, he revised the production and brought it to Broadway. Lahr remained but his co-star, Tom Ewell, left, to be replaced by E. G. Marshall. (Herbert Berghof replaced Alan Schneider as the director, although Schneider would go on to become Beckett's preferred American director. Reflecting on ''Godot'' in Miami for The Times in 1971, Schneider wrote that ''the debacle on opening night in Florida made the charge of the Light Brigade seem like a triumphal march up Fifth Avenue.'') 
 Myerberg, still flop-sweaty from Florida but with his salesman's instincts hardly squelched, took out an advertisement warding off the average theatergoer. ''I respectfully suggest that those who come to the theater for casual entertainment do not buy a ticket to this attraction,'' the copy huffed importantly. In an interview with The Times the weekend before the show opened, he suggested that the play's success depended on the recruitment of 70,000 intellectuals to attend.
 Although history does not record the number of registered intellectuals who heeded this call, the production had a respectable but by no means stellar run of a couple of months. The reception was similar to the reactions to its 1953 premiere in Paris and a subsequent London production: bafflement sometimes tinged with outrage from sectors of the popular press, high praise and thoughtful analysis from a few more forward-thinking critics. While it has become a staple of world theater, ''Godot'' curiously has never since been produced on Broadway (aside from an all-black staging that ran for a handful of performances shortly after the original).
 I respectfully suggest that no Myerbergian warnings, disclaimers, plugs or pandering attempts will be necessary this time around, as ''Godot'' prepares to open on Thursday in a Roundabout Theater Company production starring Bill Irwin as Vladimir, Nathan Lane as Estragon, John Goodman as the brutish Pozzo and John Glover as his slave, Lucky.
 To anyone with a glancing knowledge of culture, ''Godot'' is now almost as familiar a brand as Tide detergent or MTV. It is among the most studied, monographed, celebrated and sent-up works of modern art, and perhaps as influential as any from the last century. The nonstory of two tramps at loose ends in a landscape barren of all but a single tree, amusing or distracting themselves from oppressive boredom while they wait for a mysterious figure who never arrives, the play became the ur-text for theatrical innovation and existential thought in the latter half of 20th century.
 But as with all the great works of dramatic literature, its continuing importance to contemporary culture has to be tested and tried in performance. Artworks of any kind that are deeply influential can change the rules of the game fundamentally. But after their innovations have pervaded the art form, they can seem less potent, coming to be seen more as stylistic inflexion points than enduringly nourishing works. I recall emerging stupefied and mystified from a French film class in college after a screening of a Jean-Luc Godard movie -- I think it was ''Alphaville'' -- feeling that the innovations Godard had introduced had been so completely absorbed by subsequent filmmaking that the movie itself was exposed as a flashy but empty shell.
 More than a half-century on, the stature of ''Godot'' is not likely to undergo any serious revision. But today seems a propitious moment to re-encounter it as a dramatic enactment of human experience at its essence. The play draws its energy from vaudevillian routines, literate humor and the occasional bleak, blunt reflection, but also from reduction, an unlikely source that is linked to its elusive meanings.
 Gone are the usual building blocks of theater: narrative, place, a dramatic arc and the specifics of character. Psychology is reduced to essentials. Vladimir and Estragon have distinct personalities -- Didi is the more cerebral and logical, Gogo the instinctual and playful -- but their history and purpose are obscure to us and to them, their needs minimal and primal. They exist nowhere and do nothing, and yet possess a theatrical reality potentially as expressively powerful as any dramatic characters you could name.
 As it happens, reduction has become both necessary and somewhat fashionable lately. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the Classical Theater of Harlem staged ''Godot'' at the intersection of two streets in the Lower Ninth Ward, one of the sections of the city hit hardest by the storm and the neglect and confusion of the government's response. The play has often been performed in times of crisis and despair; Susan Sontag directed a production in a besieged Sarajevo during the agonizing Balkan conflict.
 America as a whole has now been hit by an economic storm of devastating size and scope, leaving almost everyone feeling at least a little bit reduced, financially, psychologically, emotionally. Calls are being made to strip away the glossy distraction, the unnecessary indulgence. Ostentation is out; austerity in. Send in the tramps!
 Nobody stripped experience down to its fundamentals more rigorously than Beckett in ''Waiting for Godot,'' but it is hardly the kind of reduction that celebrates the simple things in life, that renews and refreshes, the aesthetic equivalent of a closet purge or a colonic irrigation. Beckett would probably scorn the idea that the simple life is morally healthier than the superficially opulent one; the regal puffery of Pozzo hides a dependence on his slave, Lucky, that is shown to be utterly abject in the play's second act. Life is a long, short, mysterious trek at the best of times and the worst, for pauper and prince alike.
 We may seem to be at the beginning of something new, or at the end of something old. But as Beckett so powerfully and piteously clarifies in ''Godot,'' a play that has no real beginning and no real end, if we are living we are always somewhere in the middle, the past and the future equally distant and maybe equally obscure. 
 The great British critic Kenneth Tynan, among the first to recognize the immeasurable importance of ''Waiting for Godot,'' summarized Beckett's achievement as pithily and as profoundly as anyone: ''Passing the time in the dark, he suggests, is not only what drama is about but also what life is about.'' Today's darkness is a little starker than usual, but it offers the possibility that the light given off by art will be perceived with renewed clarity.

HEADLINE: Money Lending, the Old-Fashioned Way

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER. 
E-mail: joeberg@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
 ACROSS the United States, banks have been failing like cocksure students who try to cram a semester's work into the night before the final. Indeed, banks got into trouble by being cocksure, thinking they could profitably offer mortgages whether the home buyers could document their income or not.
 But in Westchester at least one bank is not in such trouble. While Citibank, Wells Fargo and Bank of America are sagging with foreclosed properties they can't unload in a stagnant market, Community Mutual Savings Bank, which has its headquarters here and has only five branches in the county, has not had a foreclosure in three years. 
 Its officers say they achieved that record by running their bank the old-fashioned way: When people come in looking for a loan, they have to pass a common-sense test. After all, how many of us would lend money to people we weren't sure could pay it back? Maybe to a brother-in-law, but that's about it.
 Community Mutual's officers lend money to local residents whose income they verify with pay stubs and tax returns, making sure the mortgage and other monthly property payments do not exceed 30 percent of that income. They research whether a property's market value bears a strong relation to the loan amount, and they require down payments of at least 20 percent of the mortgage.
 ''We stick to the parameters that are age-old tested in the banking industry,'' said Christopher Strauss, Community Mutual's senior lending officer.
 None of this would have been surprising five years ago, but in the frenzy of recent years, many prestigious and wealthy banks shrugged off those criteria.
 Thomas G. Ferrara, the chairman of the board, calls Community Mutual ''the old plain-vanilla bank'' and compares it to the mythical and intimate small-town institution in the Christmas chestnut ''It's a Wonderful Life.'' 
 ''We know our customers,'' Mr. Ferrara said. ''I won't say we're the Bailey Brothers Building and Loan, but we've been around long enough that we're probably older than they were. We've been around since 1887.''
 With just $200 million in assets, Community Mutual is small enough that for all of Westchester there are only two residential lending officers. Officers say it is not unusual for a customer calling after hours to get the bank president on the line.
 That president, John E. Ritacco, said that during the lending fever of this decade, ''we stayed traditional.''
 ''We got to know our customers,'' he said. ''We saw them at closings. We looked them in the eye. Our standards remained very conservative.''
 Until it went public and started selling shares in April 2007 to raise capital for improving the bank's branches and technology, the only money the bank lent came from the deposits of its savings customers, so it had to be prudent. And the core of its lending business remains residential mortgages to owners of one- to four-family homes.
 Many homeowners find out soon after closing on their residences that the bank servicing their mortgages is not the one they borrowed from. That seldom happens with Community, its officers say.
 ''Most loans we make we keep for our own portfolio, so there's a consistency of whom you're dealing with,'' Mr. Ferrara said. ''If a customer runs into difficult times, they're still dealing with the same people involved in the origination of the loan because we are as small as we are.''
 Community Mutual, which opened its first branch in Mount Vernon and has added branches in Eastchester, Greenburgh, Mount Kisco and Silver Lake, has 700 loans in its portfolio, 100 of which were signed last year early in the economic downturn, according to bank officials. 
 By contrast, many mainstream banks aggressively tried to find borrowers -- for mortgages or for refinancing -- wherever they could, as other countries, hedge funds and speculative investors were clamoring for securities backed by mortgages. These banks capitalized on the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which was designed to encourage lending in low-income communities by searching out willing borrowers in neighborhoods they had once redlined.
 But the banks often abandoned all caution. Some bankers contend they were pressured to ease standards because a good Community Reinvestment Act score made it easier to open new branches. 
 There is debate on whether the act, strengthened during the Clinton administration, encouraged predatory subprime lending, where banks promised low initial interest rates that, after two or three years, mushroomed beyond the borrower's ability to pay. The seeming rationale for offering such risky loans was that rising house values would yield a profit for the bank even in the event of foreclosure, a rationale that foundered when home prices went into free fall. 
 Community Mutual was under the same kinds of pressures to lend in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, but its officers say that rather than simply offering loans willy-nilly or letting shadowy brokers do it for them, the bank held seminars on borrowing and tried to search out applicants who could meet its standard criteria. About 10 percent of its loans have been made to low- and moderate-income borrowers, bank officials said.
 ''Nowhere in the C.R.A. regulations does it require that banks make loans to noncreditworthy borrowers,'' Mr. Ferrara said, referring to the reinvestment act. ''It requires an outreach effort. It doesn't require any bank to make a bad loan.''
 So while some banks in the current meltdown are pulling back on lending money even to creditworthy borrowers, Community Mutual is dangling cash.
 ''We're looking to lend,'' Mr. Ferrara said. ''We're on the flip side of what's happening.''

HEADLINE: The Man Who Improvises With the Tenor Sax

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ

 BODY:
LAST October, acting on a whim, the saxophonist Joe Lovano showed up uninvited at the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis's show at the Paramount Center for the Arts in Peekskill. Horn in hand, he came ready to play -- and play he did, adding an unexpected and welcome note to the evening.
 On May 9, Mr. Lovano, 56, will return to the Paramount. While his appearance this time will be planned -- Mr. Lovano will be leading his nonet, his old friend Mr. Marsalis probably nowhere in sight -- expectations are high that he will continue to surprise, if mainly in the improvisations that flow from his much-heralded horn. 
 ''Joe is much more spontaneous'' than most musicians, said John Patitucci, a bassist from Westchester, minutes before taking the stage at Birdland, in Manhattan, where he joined Mr. Lovano's quartet this month for the final night of a five-night engagement. That show, featuring bop to ballads, brought the packed house down. 
 Having seen the quartet perform earlier in the week, Gunther Schuller, the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer and arranger, praised Mr. Lovano for his continuing spontaneity, inventiveness and imagination. ''I don't know of anyone who combines those three things at such a high level so consistently,'' he said.
 Mr. Schuller, 83, should know. He played French horn and did some conducting on Miles Davis's seminal mid-20th-century LP ''Birth of the Cool,'' and adapted material from that record for Mr. Lovano's album ''Streams of Expression,'' which was nominated for a Grammy in 2007. 
 Some of the pieces from ''Streams of Expression'' will be heard at the Paramount next month, Mr. Lovano said. Prominent among them: ''The Birth of the Cool Suite,'' which incorporates ''Moon Dreams,'' ''Move'' and ''Boplicity.'' Mr. Schuller's adaptation includes a new introduction and interludes that connect the pieces.
 For the suite, Mr. Schuller said, Mr. Lovano had asked him to elaborate on the original tunes ''without a major stylistic break'' from them and to employ his ''third stream'' approach -- a term Mr. Schuller coined in 1957 to describe his marrying of classical and jazz elements, then a controversial idea.
 ''That was a challenge,'' he said, referring to Mr. Lovano's request, ''but nothing I couldn't do.''
 A major hurdle, he said, was approximating the sonorities of the Davis ensemble, which, unlike the Lovano group, had a French horn and tuba but no tenor saxophone. Because Mr. Lovano's tenor was the prominent solo voice, Mr. Schuller said, achieving the appropriate colors in the accompanying parts fell to the other winds and brass -- no easy task, but one that Mr. Lovano's musicians were up to, the composer said.
 Mr. Lovano attributed the nonet's success on ''The Birth of the Cool Suite'' in part to empathy among the musicians. Of the saxophonists alone, he counted Steve Slagle, alto, Ralph Lalama, tenor, and Gary Smulyan, baritone, as friends and associates with whom he has shared stages -- and, in some cases, living quarters -- over the years. 
 ''There's a real beautiful communication and sensibility about the way we play together,'' he said.
 But even groups with close ties can lose a groove, especially when handling finely calibrated charts like ''Birth of the Cool.'' For the Peekskill date it won't hurt that the nonet will have performed the night before at the Aetna Theater in Hartford, affording the players a chance in concert to iron out musical kinks that may have developed since they last worked together, in the fall.
 Jazz performers at the 1,000-seat Paramount have typically drawn 30 percent to 50 percent of capacity, compared with 90 percent or more for rock acts, said Jon Yanofsky, the center's executive director. Mr. Lovano's show, he said, is not deviating markedly from the pattern. 
 That tickets are not flying off the shelf at the Paramount could point to more than a historical reluctance to patronize jazz. Aficionados considering buying tickets in Peekskill might be aware that, in addition to the Hartford concert on May 8, the nonet has scheduled six dates at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola at Lincoln Center in June. 
 But whatever the competition from other scheduled performances, Mr. Lovano is taking the situation in stride. Few musicians enjoy successful working groups in as many configurations as he does, from a celebrated duo relationship with the pianist Hank Jones up to the nonet, which is in its 10th year. 
 ''For an ensemble that size, in today's economic scene,'' Mr. Lovano said, ''that's rare.''
 Joe Lovano Nonet at 8 p.m. on May 9 at the Paramount Center for the Arts, 1008 Brown Street, Peekskill. Tickets, $25 and $35. Information: (914) 739-2333 or paramountcenter.org.

HEADLINE: In Slump, More Art Is Selling In Private

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
During good times, an auction is the obvious choice for any collector wanting to sell a work of art. But as the recession takes its toll, many collectors have changed strategies and retreated to the more hidden, and potentially less lucrative, world of private sales.
 For many sellers, the driving factor is fear. Fear that their friends will discover they need money. Fear that if a Picasso or Warhol, Monet or Modigliani does not sell at auction, it will be considered yesterday's goods.
If they do not have to, fewer collectors are putting their holdings up for auction at Sotheby's and Christie's, where prices and profits have plummeted. But executives at both houses say business in their private-sale departments has more than doubled in recent months. 
 Even institutions like the Museum of Modern Art are avoiding auctions. This season it has decided to sell two early classic 1960s paintings by Wayne Thiebaud through Haunch of Venison, a gallery owned by Christie's. In 2005, when the market was nearing its peak, it sold a variety of works at auction at Christie's for strong prices. 
 ''There's an element of uncertainty with an auction that in this climate makes it more prudent to sell privately,'' said Ann Temkin, chief curator in the department of painting and sculpture at MoMA. (The Thiebauds were donated to the Modern with the express purpose of selling them to raise cash for future acquisitions.) 
 ''The game has definitely shifted,'' said Christopher Eykyn, a former head of Impressionist and modern art at Christie's who is now a dealer in New York. ''A lot of clients don't want to be seen selling, so the private route is suddenly more attractive.'' 
 Just six months ago Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art sale brought $223.8 million; its May 5 sale is expected to fetch only $81.5 million. Christie's Impressionist and modern art auction in November totaled $146.7 million; its May 6 sale is estimated at only $94.9 million. 
 ''Clients want it now,'' said Marc Porter, president of Christie's in America. ''And that means cash in their pockets.'' Why wait months for the regularly scheduled auctions when you can have instant money, even if it means forfeiting the possibility of sparking a bidding war at auction? 
 Another factor is that collectors, seeing prices fall, are for the most part hanging on to their art, waiting for the auction market to rebound. 
 So secret are private transactions that confidentiality agreements bind the dealers and auction-house executives. Still, the art world loves to talk, and in recent months among the expensive paintings that have quietly changed hands are a 1970s de Kooning abstract canvas sold for around $30 million; a Cy Twombly ''Blackboard'' painting for $12 million; one of Gerhard Richter's ''Color Charts'' for $18 million; and Jeff Koons's ''Hanging Heart Violet'' sculpture for $11 million. 
 There are exceptions, of course. Estates continue to go to auction because executors have a fiduciary responsibility and prices are rarely challenged after public sales.
 For the auction houses, private sales are lucrative and inexpensive. Generally Sotheby's and Christie's charge 5 to 10 percent of the purchase price of an artwork, depending on its value and the agreement with the seller. (If a work goes to auction the houses charge sellers 25 percent of the first $50,000, 20 percent of the next $50,000 to $1 million and 12 percent of the rest.) Money earned from private transactions comes cheap, without expenses like advertising, insurance and shipping associated with auctions. 
 The dismal sales in New York in November, when night after night paintings by Monet and Matisse, Bacon and Warhol went unsold, meant big losses for Sotheby's and Christie's, which had a financial interest in most of this expensive art in the form of guarantees, undisclosed sums paid to sellers regardless of a sale's outcome.
 After the fall auctions, both houses immediately began changing the way they conduct business. In addition to announcing hundreds of layoffs, with perhaps more to come, they mostly halted the practice of guarantees and stopped giving consignors a cut in the fees they charge buyers. The days of publishing luscious catalogs have ended as well. 
 For their part, dealers say that their phones started ringing after Sept. 15, the day Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. ''It's been pretty steady ever since,'' said Steven P. Henry, director of the Paula Cooper Gallery in Chelsea. He said he had been getting inquiries about selling art from people who had investments with Bernard L. Madoff, or who had seen the value of their stock or real estate assets collapse. 
 Matthew Marks, another Chelsea dealer, has noticed that sellers ''just aren't into gambling anymore and auctions are no longer a sure thing.'' 
 Gone are the new rich -- the Russian oligarchs and oil-rich Middle Easterners, as well as the American hedge fund magnates -- who in flush times were willing to pay any price. Gone too are the Europeans who were active when the weak dollar made their purchases seem cheap.
 Today's buyers tend to be older collectors who bowed out of the market when prices began escalating several years ago. These patrons have far more conservative tastes, preferring works by tried-and-true names like Alexander Calder or Robert Ryman rather than those by younger artists like Takashi Murakami or Damien Hirst who were snapped up by speculators and have now lost some 50 percent of their value. 
 What is selling, said Brett Gorvy, a co-head of Christie's postwar and contemporary-art department, is '' the right artist and the right work.'' 
 Tobias Meyer, head of Sotheby's contemporary-art department worldwide, concurred: ''If it's blue chip, like a Richard Serra sculpture, then we have a list of people who want them.'' 
 For the last six months, pricing has been tricky, a kind of tug of war between greedy sellers and bargain hunters. ''Nobody knows where the market is right now,'' Mr. Meyer said. ''If it's not something totally unique, the problem is figuring out what it's worth when something comparable could come up at auction for 50 percent less.'' 
 Indeed the sales next month include works that had been kicking around the private market at prices significantly higher than their estimates from the auction houses. Among them are a late Picasso canvas owned by Julian Schnabel at Christie's, as well as a Giacometti cat sculpture owned by an undisclosed European collector and a Koons sculpture belonging to the hedge fund manager Daniel S. Loeb, both for sale at Sotheby's. 
 Dealers say that despite the increase in private sales, deals do not happen as briskly as they did in the days when collectors were on waiting lists for hot artists. ''Everything is a negotiation,'' Mr. Marks said. 
 Still, Mr. Marks is grateful for business. ''I'm not asking sellers any questions,'' he said. ''I'm just happy the phone is ringing.''

HEADLINE: New Homes For a Varied Cast

BYLINE: By ALEC APPELBAUM

 BODY:
SCHERMERHORN HOUSE, a new residential building in downtown Brooklyn, has a striking two-toned facade of aluminum and glass. Inside, the 217 units all have natural light in the kitchens and cleverly designed storage space. There is a gym with floor-to-ceiling windows and a performance space for arts groups.
 But this is not a luxury building: The units are almost all small studios, and amenities include job training. Low-income workers, mostly in the arts, will occupy nearly half of the apartments, while the other half will be for people who have been homeless or who need daily support. 
 Designed by Polshek Partnership Architects, the 11-story building, a block west of the Hoyt-Schermerhorn subway stop, sits right over the A, C and G lines. This perch precluded a basement, so common areas like the gym and laundry room are on the second floor. 
 The project began when two real estate development companies, Hamlin Ventures and Time Equities, teamed up in 2001 to buy a block-sized parcel that New York State wanted to develop with mixed-income housing and commercial space.
 Abby Hamlin, Hamlin's principal, had given up on financing conventional affordable housing soon after the Sept. 11 attacks, so she approached Roseanne Haggerty, the president of Common Ground, a nonprofit organization that has converted old hotels in the Times Square area to facilities for formerly homeless people.
 ''I turned to supportive housing because its sources of subsidy are deeper,'' Ms. Hamlin said. ''And Roseanne said, 'I can consider it, but you're going to have to double the number of supportive units.' '' 
 Common Ground brought in the Actors Fund, which among other things serves low-income stage professionals. The Center for Urban Community Service came to coordinate on-site services like job training. And all parties agreed that the ground-floor space would be for public performances. 
 The Brooklyn Ballet has agreed to rent the building's storefront for its offices and school. ''There will be a lot of little kids wearing tutus,'' said Ellen Selnik, an on-site social worker with the Actors Fund. 
 But Schermerhorn House's fundamental work involves integrating people with special needs into an upscale area. ''When you see the building, you'll see a workout room, a green terrace and other community space,'' said Timothy Marx, Common Ground's executive director. ''You'll be surprised by its normalcy.'' 
 Ms. Hamlin wanted a performance space on Schermerhorn House's ground floor to ensure that the building would ''not operate in isolation'' from its ever-hipper surroundings. While the project evolved, she built 14 town houses across the street that sold for more than $2 million apiece.
 Actors Fund clients include stagehands and electricians. Because they are often freelancers, many people in the arts find ''the application process for an apartment can be difficult,'' said Barbara Davis, the fund's deputy executive director. The fund received 2,000 applications for the first of the 100 slots. 
 To be eligible for the Schermerhorn, Ms. Selnik said, the theatrical workers must earn $21,770 to $29,760 per year. Rent, pegged to income, begins at $635 a month.
 Day-to-day living for itinerant arts professionals can be difficult, too, Ms. Selnik said, so the ample kitchen space and help with job referrals provide a measure of stability. 
 The building's interiors were also designed by Polshek. The studios have beds with shelving underneath and kitchens with ample cabinets. The specially treated glass on the north-facing windows, said Gamal Basiouny, the property's manager, is thick enough to damp noise from the trains underneath. Windows on the south side look out over the harbor. Hallways bend at angles, with warm track lighting, creating what Mr. Marx called ''a human scale.'' 
 Mr. Basiouny says that he can smell cooking in the hallways and that he expects full occupancy by June 30.
 Once the economy rebounds, Ms. Hamlin said, she hopes to develop the parcel with more town houses, a market-rate rental apartment building, a hotel and a school.

HEADLINE: Despite Voters' Fears, School Budgets Fare Well

BYLINE: By JOHN MOONEY

DATELINE: EAST BRUNSWICK 

 BODY:
 IN this economy, says Donald Macioci, it is hard not to worry about your job. ''I'm hanging on,'' he said.
 But with his two young sons in tow, the 53-year-old software engineer stood outside his polling place in this Middlesex County suburb on Tuesday and said he did not hesitate much in voting for his local school budget.
 He had heard all the worries about the school vote from parents at Little League practice that afternoon, he said. 
 ''Every school budget that comes up, we're worried,'' Mr. Macioci said. ''Property taxes are so high, especially here. But even now, I'd rather pay than see the services go.''
 It was a common -- and somewhat unexpected -- sentiment of support across the state last Tuesday, as voters passed three in every four school budgets in the 549 districts with elections, according to a preliminary tally by the State Department of Education. Voters also approved 15 of 19 school construction referendums.
 Turnout was typically light, with 13.5 percent of registered voters casting ballots. But the 73 percent approval rate was only slightly below that of last year, when big increases in state aid helped ease local property taxes. 
 For the coming year, Gov. Jon S. Corzine has proposed no increase in aid for most districts, and he was able to avoid cuts only with the help of $1 billion in federal stimulus money.
 In response, many districts came back with local budgets that were equally austere.
 In East Brunswick, the district's Board of Education proposed a $133 million spending plan with a slight drop in the tax levy. Included in the cost-saving measures was a freeze in salaries for administrators and nonunion employees.
 ''It was a tough year,'' said Jo Ann Magistro, East Brunswick's superintendent of schools. ''The commitment of the board and the administration was to go out there and not add to the pain of the community.''
 The day after the budget vote, Mr. Corzine gave credit to voters for recognizing that not just their own pocketbooks were lean this year. 
 ''When times are tough, people focus on the most important elements that they want to be committed to,'' he said in an interview after making a speech in Montclair. ''Education is at the top of the heap.''
 Not all budgets fared so well, however, including those in some of the state's wealthiest communities. In Mountain Lakes, the budget was rejected by 30 votes, ending a long streak of approvals. Hunterdon County as a whole saw 15 of 29 budgets go down.
 After a budget is defeated, the local municipal council is charged with reviewing and making cuts, if it chooses to. Those cuts may be appealed to the state.
 Burlington Township's $56 million spending plan, rejected by voters on Tuesday, will go next to the local council. The Burlington County district, nestled between Trenton and Philadelphia, is in line for a 5 percent boost in state aid next year, helping to keep the proposed tax increase to less than 1 percent.
 Still, that was not enough for Bob and Gail Rosenberg, who said they had voted no on the budget. 
 As she and her husband left the polling place at the district's middle school, Ms. Rosenberg, a teaching assistant in another school district, said her own job could be in jeopardy, so she could empathize with the districts' plights.
 ''But a lot of people will be voting out of their own wallets this year, out of necessity,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. ''I have to vote with my own wallet.''

HEADLINE: The House of Much History

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH GIDDENS

 BODY:
MY house, an asymmetrical wood-frame with a mansard roof in Bedford-Stuyvesant, sits over a mysterious tunnel. No one can say what purpose the passageway served. Coal chute? Too long and curvy. Sewage outlet? Too wide. Water intake? Too far from the cistern. Underground Railroad? Not likely. 
 Though architectural historians are flummoxed, amateur archaeologists are delighted, as the tunnel was filled with a century and a half of debris -- a perfect slice of archaeological data stretching backward from 2004, when I bought this Brooklyn house, to the 1860s, when it was built. 
 The first few strata were dense with inauspicious fossils: crack vials, condoms and (ouch) hypodermic needles. Looks like the '80s -- proceed with caution. Then came the '70s, full of liquor bottles, pantyhose and cigarette butts. The next few layers yielded scores of bones and bone fragments (probably butchers' bones) and, finally, for good measure, yet another liquor bottle, this one made of heavy, mottled glass, presumably left by the men who built the tunnel. 
 The things the occupants left behind in this rambling four-story house have mostly to do with vice. The main exception is the last, best relic, from the very bottom of the dig: a cast-iron horse, a child's toy from the 1870s. 
 Thanks to the tunnel, and to five years of renovation, I have established a respectable little reliquary on my bookshelf, and by sheer coincidence it is nestled in the American history section. 
 The tunnel piqued my interest in the history of the house, and a rich one it is, populated by 19th-century socialites, 20th-century prostitutes, R & B luminaries, enterprising crack dealers and Brooklyn notables like Hugo Tollner, the scion of the famous restaurant family. He bought the house 126 years ago next Sunday. 
 In fact, my neighbors say that so much has happened in my house that it must be haunted, which suggests another possible explanation for the tunnel: portal to the underworld.
 As far as I can tell, the living currently outnumber the dead -- I have six housemates in my ramshackle, 10-bedroom house on Franklin Avenue. We haven't seen any ghosts, but sometimes the building seems to be brooding over its past. It has a strangely haunted look, burdened as it is with much black exterior paint and a striking resemblance to the house in ''Psycho.'' 
 It predates by decades the surrounding brownstones, and with its gracious front porch and spacious side yard and backyard, it's about as close as Brooklyn gets to a pastoral idyll. As an architectural anomaly, it stands out in the collective neighborhood consciousness, which makes it an irresistible repository of local myth. 
 And so, as I delved into the house's past, I found that it had a louder history than most, and that this history was both real and imagined. 
 ONE January morning, sitting in my parlor, clutching my coffee cup and rummaging through the online archives of The Brooklyn Eagle, I suddenly found myself reading about the very room in which I was sitting. 
 ''The commodious house was thrown open entirely,'' The Eagle reported of a soiree held in 1901, with the third-floor billiards room ''being reserved for the men guests.'' 
 My restless sock feet stopped midtap, on the very floor those gentlemen trod in their calfskin shoes and spats. 
 The gracious host of the party was Mr. Tollner, who bought the house in 1883. Hugo was the son of Eugene, co-owner of Gage & Tollner, the fabled restaurant in Downtown Brooklyn that maintained a tuxedoed staff and gas lights for 125 years, only to be transformed, five years ago, into a T.G.I. Friday's. 
 Mr. Tollner and his family were good copy for The Eagle. In 1907, the paper reported on his success in selling Brooklyn's first electric landaulet, a motorcar shaped like a horse-drawn carriage. The Eagle also reported on a number of newsworthy social events that the family held at the house, including an 1897 reception for Hugo's bicycle racing team, the Uralia Wheelmen. 
 Given the number of newspaper inches and celebrities, the best party seems to have been the one in honor of the Lenox Euchre Club. (Upper-class Americans took their cards very seriously in the 1890s, and euchre was the national game.) 
 The gala fell in 1895, near the end of what was then called the Great Depression (before the 1930s usurped the title), a 24-year slump during which unemployment reached 19 percent. Apparently, the situation was not so dire for Mr. Tollner, who was at least able to employ a few musicians for the occasion.
 ''Dancing,'' The Eagle reported, ''was indulged in to the strains of a string orchestra until midnight, when a choice collation was served.'' 
 The collation -- a light meal -- would have had the guests departing in the morning hours, which was fine because the considerate hosts had scheduled the party to coincide with the full moon. The ride home would have been through a genteel if sparsely populated suburblike section of Brooklyn, which was then still independent as well as being the third-largest American city. F. W. Woolworth, the king of nickel-and-dime merchandise, lived right around the corner. 
 My house, which is now part of the giant trapezoid called Bedford-Stuyvesant, was then part of plain Bedford, an area centered on the intersection of two old Indian trails, running roughly along Bedford and Fulton Avenues. Two and a half centuries before Mr. Tollner's parties, when Brooklyn was largely wild, Dutch settlers hewed close to those trails, and in 1668 an entrepreneur named Charles Lambertse wisely established an inn at the intersection. A town slowly emerged around the junction.
 Bedford was still mostly farmland when our house was built in the 1860s, but in 1885 an elevated railroad linked the area to the new Brooklyn Bridge, and development exploded forthwith. By the time of the euchre ball, the house was already old and anomalous, stranded in a sea of new brownstones. 
 THE parties held at the house in the 1960s and '70s were not the sort that get written up in newspapers, which is a shame because they were apparently epic throw-downs. These events do, however, exist in the memory of the neighborhood; in fact, it's nearly impossible to find someone over 50 who doesn't know something of the house's doings back then.
 The prize relic from this era is unquestionably the basement bar -- not your father's rinky-dink liquor stand but a professional, 12-foot-long baroque affair made of plywood and complete with upholstered sides and mirrors.
 A big bar made sense because the house in that era was a sort of latter-day speakeasy, an unlicensed club tricked out not only with the elaborate bar but also with a handful of card tables, thousands of Christmas lights and a jukebox full of James Brown and Al Green. According to neighbors, revelers caroused throughout the house at all hours, limousines deposited big shots from the R & B scene, and there was dancing every night, often to live music.
 Thanks to the lights, according to my neighbor Charles Mayfield, ''it was like Christmas all the time.'' 
 Accounts vary wildly as to who held the parties and who ran the bar. As with much about the house, a current of myth runs through these days. Some claim a famous R & B singer lived there. Some say a doo-wop group owned it. Others say that the Martins, the people whose names were on the deed, were the Rockefellers of Bedford-Stuyvesant and just liked to have parties. 
 Whoever they were, they managed to disappear into the mists of time more thoroughly than their 19th-century counterparts. 
 As the '70s limped into the '80s, the house fell into disrepair and was abandoned to squatters. Crack swept through in the early '80s and devastated the neighborhood. The famous club became an infamous crack house, and the gracious parlor where Hugo Tollner's guests danced the night away became the stash room from which a gang sold huge amounts of drugs. 
 These dealers, who were reportedly serious and well organized, ran a disciplined business and controlled it with an impressive arsenal. They waged a brief war with nearby competitors, which, according to neighborhood lore, they won by dint of a gun so powerful that it put holes all the way through the enemy building.
 ''That's when we knew they were serious,'' said Clarence Figgures, an ironworker who witnessed the house's transformation from across the street. 
 The relics in the house from this era are bleak: countless crack vials piled in a wall cavity of the old billiards room; deep gouges on a 19th-century door that appear to be the frantic clawings of a large angry dog; human waste stashed in strange and unlikely places. 
 The stories, gleaned from neighbors, are bleaker: A woman lived in a cardboard box on the front porch. Another slept under the stoop and in the alley. Even the 150-square-foot sub-basement seems to have been inhabited for a time. 
 With its 10 bedrooms, the house was the perfect ''crack hotel.'' As one local resident remembers, ''There were women in every one of them rooms.''
 Even the spacious backyard was put to use. Though it hardly seems credible, neighbors claim that as many as a dozen women at a time would service customers there. One man who parked in the yard remembers opening his car door and interrupting two busy couples. 
 The house's stint as a crack den was ended by a spate of homicides in the late '80s and early '90s.
 ''Once people get killed at a good spot,'' Mr. Figgures said, ''it's not a good spot anymore.'' 
 Neighbors say a number of violent deaths, three to six, occurred within these walls. Some say that a man was shot point-blank in the front yard. Others say a man was chased into the house and shot in the basement. Still others say that a drive-by shooting took the lives of several men sitting on the front porch.
 ''A lot of people died in your house, man,'' Mr. Figgures said on the day I moved in.
 BETWEEN Mr. Tollner's elegant parties and the speakeasy years, the house seems to have lapsed into domestic quietude. Apart from the butcher bones in the tunnel, the apparent relics of that era include a child's bed that was sealed inside the wall and a full-length, hooded woman's robe, which eight washings revealed to be bright red. 
 The bed now awaits the first member of the household to have a child, though I suspect it may be a nightmare machine, and the robe hangs in an uncannily lifelike manner from my bookcase. 
 I'm writing this in the erstwhile billiards room, mulling over my favorite tunnel find, the little cast-iron horse, frozen in flight beside me. My discoveries have changed the way I think about where I live. We buy a house believing it's ours, but in fact it's an ever-shifting palimpsest and we are merely the latest to write over it. 
 Nevertheless, for continuity's sake, my housemates and I have kept to the tradition of holding big parties. It's practically a civic duty. It would be selfish to keep all this house and yard to ourselves. 
 As befits a home built in an old farming district, we also have made a point of working the land, gradually putting the yard back into operation over the years. We removed 12 tons of concrete there, covered the devastated soil with free city compost and planted an organic garden that produces so many vegetables we've considered opening a farm stand. 
 We planted a fig tree and several berry bushes, and we bought a wine press to accommodate the fruits of the prolific grapevine. (As a concession to our retrograde American attachments, we put down a lawn just big enough for bocce but a touch too small for a cow.)
 The garden is a particularly busy place now that spring is here. We've set up a coop in preparation for the chickens we have on order. We bought more than 50 varieties of seeds, many of them heirlooms that haven't been in wide use since the house was built. And we're stocking up on canning and pickling jars -- the tunnel will make an excellent root cellar. 
 Among the stranger produce we've harvested from the garden is a doll we call Pinkie, who, with the hole in her stomach and her grossly misshapen head, was probably scary even before she was buried decades ago. Pinkie has become the house mascot. She sits on the front-porch swing, which is somehow always rocking, and keeps a constant vigil, staring into the middle distance through her one good eye.

HEADLINE: Health Care Reform, Step One

 BODY:
The Senate has a not-to-be-missed opportunity in the next few weeks to pass legislation giving the Food and Drug Administration the power to regulate tobacco products. It should move quickly -- during the brief period of calm before the senators must grapple with health care reform and other difficult issues. 
 A bill to grant the F.D.A. the needed authority was approved by the House last year. It stalled in the Senate in the face of Republican threats to filibuster, a veto threat from President George W. Bush, and a crowded legislative schedule before the November elections. The prospects may be better this year -- provided the Senate jumps on the issue early. 
 The House has already passed a strong bill by a 298-to-112 margin. President Barack Obama supported it. The American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association and hundreds of other respected organizations backed it. So did Philip Morris, the industry giant, which is apparently confident that it could dominate any regulated marketplace. 
 The bill would empower the F.D.A. to regulate the content of tobacco products and their marketing. The agency could order a reduction in nicotine levels and the elimination or reduction of other harmful ingredients. It could restrict marketing and sales to young people to the extent allowed by the First Amendment, crack down on misleading health claims and require larger, more effective health warnings on packages and advertisements. 
 No senator should be fooled by a weak substitute bill offered by two tobacco-state senators, Richard Burr, a Republican, and Kay Hagan, a Democrat, both from North Carolina. Their bill would create a new regulatory agency within the Department of Health and Human Services to handle tobacco products on the superficially plausible rationale that the F.D.A. is already overburdened with its current regulation of drugs, medical devices and food safety. 
 Such a fledgling agency would almost certainly be much less effective than the F.D.A., especially since the senators don't propose to grant it the broad powers and ample resources provided by the House-passed bill.
 As the Senate prepares for a bruising battle on health care reform, there would be no more fitting prelude than to authorize F.D.A. regulation of tobacco products that kill 400,000 Americans each year and impose huge costs on the health care system, corporations and the national economy.

A GRAYING water tower breaks up the blue sky beyond the large front windows of the SoHo loft Trisha Brown has lived in since 1973 and now shares with her husband, the visual artist Burt Barr. The hulking wooden structure conjures her 1971 site-specific work ''Roof Piece,'' in which a line of dancers, led by Ms. Brown and staggered across multiple city blocks in SoHo, played a sort of visual game of telephone, moving their limbs as if transmitting mysterious messages.
 That SoHo, a rough-and-tumble wilderness, bears little resemblance to the gaudy, commercial neighborhood of today. And Ms. Brown, whose newest dance, ''L'Amour au Theatre,'' will have its premiere on Wednesday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in a program spanning more than 40 years, beginning with the 1968 work ''Planes,'' has undergone several radical transformations of her own, including, most recently, going public as a visual artist. 
 Her career had its start within the postmodern dance ferment of the 1960s. The experiments of Ms. Brown and her peers in the Judson Dance Theater turned many a dearly held idea about dance on its head. Yvonne Rainer wrote her ''No Manifesto'' (no to spectacle, to virtuosity, to all that good stuff) in 1965, and Ms. Brown has said that during the early years of the Trisha Brown Dance Company, founded in 1970, she was forever having to give herself permission to say yes. 
 In the end she did, to almost everything: music, the proscenium stage, ballet, even opera, which she began directing in 1998. 
 ''It's so big-time I can't tell you,'' Ms. Brown said of making operas, which she likened, with a mischievous smile, to driving a Maserati. The form, she said, allows her to work with narrative and character: exotic territory for an abstract artist. ''It's not something I ever allowed myself with dance. You can play.''
 Fanciful images abound in her new work for the Brooklyn Academy. Set to excerpts of Rameau's ''Hippolyte et Aricie,'' it is tentatively scheduled to be part of a Rameau evening that will have a European premiere in 2010. Ms. Brown is pretty big-time herself, particularly in Europe, where she works frequently and on a large scale. In the United States she maintains a streamlined company of nine, which in June gave up its financially burdensome West Side rental studios to allow for more flexible operations (a prudent move in hindsight, given the recession). 
 The Brooklyn Academy program features the United States premiere of another European work, ''O z 3/5lstrok 4/5ozony/O Composite.'' Commissioned in 2004 by the Paris Opera Ballet, it was Ms. Brown's first foray into classical dance; the three principals of the Paris Opera who originated it (and whom she affectionately calls ''my etoiles'') will perform in Brooklyn. Ms. Brown, who has never seriously studied ballet, said she counted on the dancers to keep her from resorting to ballet cliches, since she didn't know enough about the form to even know what those might be.
 ''She really tried to understand what was our vocabulary, because she was very sure about her vocabulary, and she wanted, maybe, to build a language with those two identities,'' said one of the dancers, Nicholas Le Riche. ''She was really like a cook: she has all the ingredients in front of her, and she says, 'O.K., well, more salt.' ''
 Completing the evening is Ms. Brown's first work for the proscenium stage, ''Glacial Decoy.'' Created in 1979, the landmark work solidified an enduring collaboration with Robert Rauschenberg, and the program is dedicated to the artist, who died last spring. He and Ms. Brown gave the world visions like ''Set and Reset,'' which includes a transparent aerial sculpture illuminated by film footage that, in Rauschenberg's words, forms ''a hovering environment for the dance.'' 
 ''I needed to go forward,'' Ms. Brown said of her artistic trajectory, which has led many supporters to praise her unstinting explorations and a few dissenters to criticize her betrayal of experimental roots in favor of mainstream work. For Ms. Brown her Judson days, much like that vanished SoHo, are a long-forgotten world. ''I wouldn't have made 'Set and Reset' if I'd stayed and chased my tail about things like walking down the sides of buildings.'' (Been there, done that, for the record, in 1970: ''Man Walking Down the Side of a Building.'')
 Ms. Brown's career is now zooming forward in a new world: the visual arts. Though she has long been known for her collaborations with artists, it is less known that she has also produced a substantial body of drawings. (In the early days she often drew late at night, when she had trouble sleeping.) 
 In recent years Ms. Brown has shown these drawings, including during a major multidisciplinary celebration of her work last year at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. Her art is being used as the backdrop of the Rameau work at the academy. And on May 9 the Chelsea gallery Sikkema Jenkins & Company, which represents Mr. Barr, will present her first solo exhibition in New York. It is also something of a retrospective, featuring work dating to the 1970s.
 ''Honestly, we've asked her to do something for several years,'' Michael Jenkins, the gallery's senior partner, said. ''Her practice has its roots in Minimalism and performance drawing -- people like John Cage and even earlier drawings by Jasper Johns and that whole group of people. She certainly has her own knowledge of visual art making, and you see it, they really do stand up as individual drawings, separate from any aspect of her choreography.'' 
 Yet they are also linked. Deeply sensual and usually abstract, her drawings are full-body productions (she sometimes uses her feet, for example), snapshots of a mind in motion. Looking through books of her drawings at her loft, Ms. Brown at one point said, ''Dancers think this way, but I don't think people do.''
 Mr. Barr concurs, in a way; for him, the dance is as much drawing as vice versa. 
 ''When she does a piece choreographically, I always think of a visual artist,'' he said, suggesting this as one reason for her art-world following. ''She speaks their language, and they in turn seek her out.''
 But she did not necessarily divulge all her secrets to her collaborators, even, or perhaps especially, Rauschenberg. 
 ''I never showed Bob my books,'' she said, her eyes widening at the thought. A reporter's dumb follow-up question prompted a girlish giggle. ''Because, how stupid would that be?''
 Ms. Brown, who admitted to some nervousness (amid her glee) about her impending debut, will get something of an answer next month. And New York will get its first real look at yet another Trisha Brown exploration.

HEADLINE: Debating a Question That Arises in Every Downturn: Stay or Go?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Last week, the City Room blog asked readers how willing they would be to leave New York if they either lost their job or believed that they were in danger of being laid off. 
 Among the hundreds of comments, many said they were fed up with taxes, the high cost of housing and the overall quality of life in the city and were already packing -- San Francisco and Atlanta seemed to be the favored destinations. Others said they wanted to leave but had no idea where to move. 
 But for many reasons -- people stuck with houses and apartments they cannot sell or the dearth of employment opportunities elsewhere -- the net loss of New Yorkers to other states last year was the lowest in at least two decades. In 2008, the number of people who left surpassed the number who moved to the city by about 76,000, according to the census, about half the average loss every year since 1990. 
 Still, others who commented insisted that they would never leave, or had left and returned or hoped to come back because, whatever the downside, New York still had more to offer than anyplace else. And some offered survival tips, more of which can be found in City Room at nytimes.com/cityroom.
 Octavio Fenech, who lives in Brooklyn and is a designer, recalled that ''when I got laid off my job during the 2001-2002 bust, I got another job at almost half the pay. You gotta do what you gotta do to stay here. To me all these people leaving the city because it's not as easy as it once was for them is just a natural Darwinian process that thins out the wussies from the New York City herd.'' 
 He also said, ''It comes down to this: Do you want to live in the greatest city in the U.S.A. or do you want to save $2,000 a year and live in the suburbs of St. Louis?'' 
 A reader named Phil said he moved to New York from Colorado early in 2001, not intending to stay long, ''but the events of that September opened my eyes to the fact that the people of this city were MY people and that this was MY city and I was instantly reborn a New Yorker...so I stayed despite the bleak prospects of the following winter. Gradually, things got better and before long I was doing better than ever. Now the biggest economic hurricane of my generation has struck causing long-standing institutions crumble down to their very foundations.
 ''It's frightening to witness how quickly things are changing and the temptation to run away to perceived greener pastures is strong. However, this still remains MY city and I want to continue to live here. For me to stay requires I make radical adjustments such as subdividing my shoebox-sized apartment and bringing in a roommate or two to help me ride out the storm and endure the rebuilding process.''
 A comment by Barbara S. Jones said: ''I cannot -- please God, will not -- live in a car-centric city filled with miles of strip malls and oceans of parking lots and people who if they can't say anything nice won't say anything at all. But I'm going to lose my job soon and I'm going to have to leave. Where do I go? Someone, please tell me where I can find the vibrancy, the humor, the sarcasm, the irreverence and the beauty of this city?'' 
 Rachel Vessey wrote that she spent much of her 20s in the city teaching, among other jobs, attending graduate school and ''can't think of a better place to have come into my own as an adult.'' But now that she and her boyfriend are graduating, they're moving. ''This is not a city where I would ever want to raise children,'' she wrote. ''Or even a dog.'' 
 Patricia Nealon, a native New Yorker and human resources specialist who left for Texas, provided a particularly poignant comment. 
 In a lengthy e-mail message, she wrote: 
 ''I worked there, ate there, loved and grew up there. I survived breast cancer. I adopted my darling girl at the age of 47. I was a third-generation life-long renter, and felt completely protected by rent stabilization, correctly I think. When I brought my daughter home I had the great good fortune to move into Stuyvesant Town. ... The local public school is great.
 ''I didn't leave because I wanted to. As a first step I accepted that I was not going to much like or love our new life, but that I had no choice in terms of my family's future. I have a graduate degree from Columbia, and was earning about $75,000. My rent was taking 40-50 percent of my paycheck after benefits costs and 401(k) contributions were deducted.
 ''In 2007 I broke my wrist and in April I lost my job. Although I am well respected in my area of expertise it is a narrow niche, and I could not find work until the fall. ... In 2008 my unemployment benefits ran out. I withdrew money from my 401(k)...to live on and to continue to meet my obligations which included loans and five-day-per-week after-school care for my daughter while I was working. 
 ''At 55, with a child in fourth grade, depleting my 401(k) was simply stupid. I wept often, slept often, and one day asked myself, 'What do you give up for a city?'
 ''I'd be very pleased with forty or fifty thousand a year. That much money goes very far in Austin, far enough for me to finally get out of debt and pull ahead, perhaps Austin checked out as far as culture and politics and general sense of humor, so I judged it to be potentially bearable, which it indeed has proven itself to be, although I live in a suburb and hate that aspect of it (Where are the sidewalks?). 
 ''I would give a kidney, an arm, a ventricle, to return to any of New York's boroughs. I miss my friends, my family, every street and every familiar and surprising face.''
 Ms. Nealon attached her resume.

HEADLINE: Stocks Slip, Despite a Friday Rally

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
After almost two months of gains, the stock market declined modestly last week, although a rally on Friday helped to mitigate the losses. 
 On Friday, the Federal Reserve disclosed its methodology in the stress tests it has conducted for 19 banks to determine whether they are prepared to cope with a continuing economic downturn. The results of the tests were not revealed. 
 Technology stocks turned in strong performances on Oracle's announced plans to acquire Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion. Sun shares rose 37.5 percent for the week to top the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 55.04 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 8,076.29. The S.& P. 500 index dropped 3.37 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 866.23. 
 The Nasdaq composite index, with its heavy weighting of technology shares, rose 21.22 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 1,694.29.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.99 percent from 2.95 percent the previous week. The futures price of a barrel of oil in New York rose to $51.55 from $50.33. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: A Time to Sew, A Time to Mend

BYLINE: By MARCIA WORTH-BAKER

 BODY:
WHILE sewing is a creative act, turning fabric and inspiration into a quilt or a dress, mending suggests humbler tasks -- a quick fix for a sagging hem or a missing button -- for which the so-called sewing kits found in hotel bathrooms are adequate. I have several such kits containing thread in two neutral colors, a needle and a white shirt button. 
 Serious mending, however, the kind that puts lined woolen pants and beloved stuffed animals back into circulation, demands serious equipment. My mending basket holds a seam ripper, steel needles imported from England, and aquamarine chalk for marking an even hem. 
 When I was about 8 years old, my prized Christmas gift was a red and white wicker sewing basket decorated with strawberries. I used it happily for years, patching doll clothes and hemming scraps of fabric during play dates. My 12-year-old daughter would probably be dismayed to receive such a gift now. 
 As early as fourth grade and certainly through eighth grade, my school taught needlework basics, straight seams and sewing buttons. I was in the sewing club in eighth grade. I recall one session where the dozen of us -- all girls -- sat in a classroom in our uniform of white blouses, plaid vests, gym shorts and navy blue knee socks, often with suede Earth Shoes. Sister Ellen Mary taught us to let down the hems of our plaid pleated uniform skirts and rehem them with seam tape so that our skirts would fall closer to the knee. (Looking back, I wonder if that might have been the whole point of the class.) 
 An era of jeans and T-shirts followed, then years when I changed styles -- preppy, sporty, severe career -- before my clothes could show their wear. When my children were old enough to toddle and fall, their clothes often needed repair. But I put them aside in what a friend of mine calls ''the pile of shame'' until it was too late; the clothes were outgrown before they were worn out, and wound up casually discarded or donated. 
 With a greater focus these days on thrift and reducing waste, I've begun to mend again. When a needle and thread I'd held onto for years both broke while repairing a torn seam in my favorite work skirt, I learned that there was no longer a single fabric store within 10 miles of my house. Then I remembered the bushel basket that belonged to Mrs. Samuelson, an elderly neighbor of mine who moved south several years ago. 
 In the hasty clearing-out of her house, her daughter gave me Mrs. Samuelson's wheelbarrow, knitting needles, some kitchen equipment and assorted garden tools. As I was wheeling my tools away from the house, the daughter thrust an old wooden bushel basket at me. ''Take this,'' she said. ''Nobody sews anymore, but maybe you'll find something to do with the basket.'' I studied the basket with distaste; dirty beige thread was tangled around the cracked handle. It didn't escape me that Mrs. Samuelson was leaving behind only the tools of the homemaker trade, equipment for doing housework. Her books and art went south with her. 
 I accepted the basket without enthusiasm and shoved it behind the storm windows in my basement. When I found it recently, searching urgently for charcoal gray thread, I had to wipe a layer of grime from the lid. The first layer of mending supplies wasn't exciting; I saw plastic spools of drab poly/cotton thread, the kind I used to buy at Woolworth's. I dug into the basket, stabbed my hand on several straight pins, and dumped the contents onto the kitchen table. Wooden spools fell and rolled across the floor, while a pair of gold-plated scissors -- the blades engraved like the beak and feathers of a graceful bird -- fell into my lap. 
 I marveled at a tiny tissue paper package of English needles priced in pence and spools of silk thread in glowing colors, as bright as the day they were milled. I found magenta, cerulean, amber, the colors of a tropical bird. A small wicker box within the big basket held swatches of fabric, already cut into patches for clothes, pinned together with long dressmaker's straight pins. 
 Mrs. Samuelson may also have sewn, but these tools were for mending. There wasn't a sewing machine needle or bobbin in the basket, and the jar full of mismatched shirt buttons was a certain sign of repair work. The spools of thread were hardly used, and many had threaded needles stuck into them, as if Mrs. Samuelson had made a quick repair and put the supplies away in a rush. 
 Several of the wooden spools were stamped with their factories of origin. It has been a long time since Groton, Conn., and my hometown, Paterson, N.J., produced silk in their mills to be sold at the notions counter; these particular factories closed or went south in the 1940s. The thread cost 9 and 19 cents per spool, and the labels were from department stores in Newark closed years ago. One sleeve of needles made in England advertised its ''War Economy Packaging.'' 
 For my worn jeans and seams that don't show, I use the brightest colors of the bunch. And though I still don't enjoy mending -- it remains a chore -- I've found a certain satisfaction in crafting a seam as straight as the narrow wooden ruler in the basket. I feel I've inherited a worthy task along with notions and needles, one that connects me to the past. 
 When Mrs. Samuelson put down her needles, she little knew that I would pick them up. I wasn't yet born when she was shopping for Clark thread No. 12 or the 30-cent zipper I found in the bottom of the basket. Decades have passed, prices have risen, and the world has changed. When I bought thread recently to match a torn coat pocket, I ordered it online from a city I've never seen. It came a few days later, via airmail, tightly wrapped on a clear plastic reel. Mending, however, remains the same: Holes demand patches and tears need repair. Needles and thread are old tools for a job that's new again.

HEADLINE: In Budapest, A Snapshot Of a World Now At Risk

BYLINE: By MARCUS MABRY

 BODY:
The decline of the world economy is usually chronicled in numbers -- 8.5 percent unemployment in the United States; 15 percent unemployment in Spain; Chinese exports dropping 25 percent; Japan's dropping 49 percent; global trade expected to fall for the first time in 80 years, by more than 13 percent.
 But the numbers, cold and stark, do not convey the real cost this downturn may yet extract, if it isn't turned around. Budapest does that. 
 When I first visited, as an exchange student in January 1989, Budapest was the capital of Communist Hungary. And despite the moroseness that hung over the city like a cloud, it held a certain charm beneath layers of dirt and gloom. When I returned last month, a journalist on vacation, Budapest was Europe, as European as Paris or Barcelona, and as dazzling. 
 Twenty years ago, Hungary was a Soviet satellite, one of the less hard-line regimes of Eastern Europe but Communist all the same. As a student of the Soviet Union's domestic and foreign policy, I figured I knew the country intellectually. I had no idea. 
 My first memory of Budapest was riding a subway from the train station to Moszkva ter, Moscow Square. When I emerged onto the square atop one of the many hills on the Buda side of the Danube, I was stunned. Across the steel-gray river, in Pest, stood Hungary's Parliament, a collection of a dozen delicate Gothic spires surrounding a majestic dome. The dome was off-white with terra cotta-color tiles, its luster dimmed by the caked-on pollution. Still, it was audacious.
 I spent the next days discovering that Budapest, like the Parliament, was regal. But the grandeur seemed out of place amid the unmistakable sadness that hung over it and other Eastern European capitals of the time. 
 I had felt that sadness in East Berlin, too. But in Budapest, from beneath the grime that covered the turn-of-the-century palaces and houses, a splendor managed to seep through. The fine lines and rich architecture made these buildings seem like wealthy people impersonating characters out of Dickens. Two world wars and two authoritarian regimes had not erased their sophistication. If you stood long enough on Andrassy Street, the wide boulevard bisecting the city, and peered through the midday haze of exhaust from old Trabants and Ladas, you could sense the city's past greatness. 
 The people of Budapest were equally out of phase with the atmosphere that surrounded them. There was a furtive energy in the eyes of strangers on the packed subways, but also an apprehension, reflecting the fact that Hungary was loosening up politically even though freedom had not yet burst forth. The Hungarians, their muffled pride clear in every conversation, rushed past the oversize Soviet monuments that dotted their city.
 For an Eastern bloc nation, Hungary was relatively prosperous, but there was still a drabness to the clothes people wore, a sameness to the products in the stores. The city seemed to simmer in the hopelessness of a failing economic system. 
 When I returned to Budapest last month, I was once again amazed. After two decades of economic and political liberalization, the city's potential was no longer hidden, glimpsed like a shadow disappearing around a corner. 
 Budapest had become a dream realized, full of world-class hotels, ubiquitous construction cranes, mansions and museums scrubbed clean. Stylish women and men filled the subways and sidewalks. The stores were full to bursting, with local products as well as global brands. 
 Hungary, it struck me, was part of Europe again. 
 That is what is at stake in the current meltdown -- a truly globalized world, increasingly connected and increasingly familiar, and, as the contagion of economic weakness has shown, more fragile because of its interdependence. 
 In the years since China, then Russia and its satellites, joined the world economy, confidence has become the currency of this globalized world. One of our era's dominant features had been a swaggering self-assurance, a sometimes smug pride in our modernity. Until it all started to come apart last year, a sense of optimism and possibility infected a border-hopping elite and, to some extent, the middle and working classes from Budapest to Bangalore. 
 Global trade rose as economic barriers fell, and prosperity grew and spread. More than a billion people were lifted out of poverty in the last four decades, most of them in Asia. And in much of Eastern Europe, prosperity and personal freedom arrived together. 
 We took that world for granted. We behaved as if it were perfectly natural to be able to travel freely from one side of Europe to the other, to withdraw money from our home checking accounts at A.T.M.'s in Africa. 
 An entire industry grew up around globalization, with its cheerleaders and critics, its Thomas Friedmans and Fareed Zakarias on one side, and Joseph Stiglitzes and Samuel Huntingtons on the other.
 Now, the globalized world faces its greatest challenge: an economic contraction the likes of which it has never seen. As many economies shrink under the burden of bank bailouts and consumers and creditors tighten their grips on their wallets, unemployment will rise most everywhere.
 The director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, testified in February that the threat of political and social upheaval caused by the downturn has replaced terrorism as the greatest immediate threat to American security. 
 The threat to much of Eastern Europe is even more immediate. Western Europeans, seeking to shore up their own economies, could pull their money home, leaving the East to fend for itself. Already, governments whose popularity had slid have fallen in Hungary and the Czech Republic. A fortress Western Europe would go further, endangering the very optimism that produced the new Budapest. 
 For as much as things have changed, there remains a generation gap in Eastern Europe. Many young people still shrug off the current economic crisis. In response to a question about how much pain she and her family are feeling, one woman told me, ''We used to have communism'' -- as if to say, ''Are you kidding?'' 
 But a 2002 Gallup poll in Eastern Europe found that people over 60 were only half as likely to support free-market capitalism as those under 30.
 And the danger of banks, or even governments, defaulting in Eastern Europe is real. The International Monetary Fund had to give Hungary billions last year to avoid a national default. 
 The problem is that much of the prosperity of Hungary and its neighbors was borrowed, from foreign banks in foreign currency. As volatility roiled world markets, international investors fled into dollars and United States bonds, hammering other currencies and making Hungarians' foreign-denominated debt more and more expensive. 
 Other developing countries are caught in their own globalization binds -- from Mexico, heavily dependent on consumers in the United States as customers, to even China, its export juggernaut slowing so much it is likely to grow half as much this year as last.
 What will happen around the world if millions continue to lose their jobs? What will be left of a world that thought fortunes moved only in one direction? 
 The truth is that no one knows. 
 In Eastern Europe, the nightmare of widespread protests remains more talk than reality.
 For the moment, anyway. Sitting in a cafe on Andrassy Street, the sun sparkling across the scrubbed facades, the fleets of German cars streaming by, it is still hard to believe we could ever return to a time when Europe was not whole and free -- or that Budapest could again find itself hostage to a failed economic system.

 ''How It Ended: New and Collected Stories'' assembles much of the short fiction Jay McInerney has written over the course of a career now approaching three decades' duration. The better part of ''Model Behavior: A Novel and Stories'' is included, along with the story that grew into his Salingerian first novel, ''Bright Lights, Big City,'' as well as ''Smoke,'' which introduced Russell and Corrine Calloway, the Manhattan couple-with-everything whose marital vicissitudes animate McInerney's two most ambitious novels, ''Brightness Falls'' and its sequel, ''The Good Life.'' Short stories ''often turned out to be warm-up exercises,'' McInerney confides in a preface. ''There's psychological as well as practical value in using one as a sketch for a novel; the idea of undertaking a narrative of three or four hundred pages, which might consume years of your life, is pretty daunting.'' As it unfolds a synoptic map of McInerney's literary progress from the 1980s (downtown clubs, New Wave music, cocaine) to the 2000s (Upper East Side lairs, ''The Sopranos,'' pastoral detox spas), ''How It Ended'' implicitly proposes an apologia pro vita sua of an author often tagged as a kind of Lizard Lounge act, his repertoire limited to reports on Manhattan hedonism -- particularly in the 1980s and '90s, when for the entitled few the borough was a den of iniquitous pleasures and McInerney himself a bleary-eyed magnet for tabloid photojournalists and eavesdropping waiters doubling as anonymous tipsters. 
 In fact, McInerney has been throughout a productive artist -- this is his 10th book and his eighth work of fiction -- and also a diligent one, who has steadily refined his craft and rigorously deepened his subjects and themes. 
 ''How It Ended'' reminds us how impressively broad McInerney's scope has been and how confidently he has ranged across wide swaths of our national experience. It reminds us too that for all the many literary influences he has absorbed, McInerney's contribution -- and it is a major one -- is to have revitalized the Irish Catholic expiatory tradition of F. Scott Fitzgerald and John O'Hara, with its emphasis not only on guilt but also on shame: on sins committed and never quite expunged, always in open view of the sorrowing punitive clan. Even the most alienated characters in McInerney's universe remain tethered, or chained, to others. He is preoccupied with the many varieties of the strangling embrace, whether felt by star-struck political hirelings reduced to pimping for a philandering senator (''My Public Service''), Irish-American brothers locked in competitive mother-love (''The Madonna of Turkey Season'') or a Bible Belt couple whose sexual dysfunction degrades them into sick rituals of voyeurism (''Invisible Fences''). 
 In ''Con Doctor,'' a drug-addicted physician, Kevin McClarty, exiled from Chicago to a generic Southeastern city and still wobbly after rehab, penitently administers to inmates in a high-security prison, and at night repairs to the walled-in ''community'' where he cohabits with a local clothier, herself a recovering alcoholic, brassy and voluptuous. ''She looked like someone who would be dating a pro athlete, or a guy with a new Ferrari who owned a chain of fitness centers,'' McInerney writes. In bed with her, McClarty ''feels simultaneously that he is slumming and sleeping above his economic station.'' The wit is mordant, the language honed, the status calibration elegantly exact -- and it all enriches the fatalistic mood.
 McInerney's gifts have never been in question. He possesses the literary naturalist's full tool kit: empathy and curiosity, a peeled eye and a well-tuned ear, a talent for building narratives at once intimate and expansive, plausible and inventive. His sentences, vivid but unshowy, exhibit the same strengths he once identified in Fitzgerald's; they are ''sophisticated without being superior, conspiratorial without the gossip's malice.''
 All this was present from the outset, as was McInerney's romantic attraction to soured glamour. The oldest entry in the new collection, ''In the North-West Frontier Province,'' eerily predicts our current postterrorist age. It is a glimpse of hell, set in the parched hilly borderlands between Afghanistan and Pakistan, where a global menage of young dead-enders have converged in search of drugs and thrills. ''Pathan tribesmen with Enfield rifles strapped over their shoulders and bandoliers of ammunition wrapped around their baggy shirts'' patrol the local bazaar and menacingly enforce ''the code of tribal honor, blood relation and vendetta'' even as they broker heroin sales and calculate their odds of exploiting strung-out Western women. 
 One evening the American protagonist dines with an Australian primed for fresh adventure after two years in Outback opal mines. ''He had a dry, brick-red tan against which his green eyes and the gaudy opal pendant on his chest glistened. Over kebabs he told Trey, who hadn't asked, that he was in Landi Kotal to score hash oil. He was going to swallow it in condoms,'' and then excrete the drug back in Sydney. ''Trey felt obliged to tell him that it was an old trick and that people had died in the bargain; any residual alcohol that hadn't been boiled off in the processing of the oil would eat through the condoms, and once that happened it was permanent deep space.'' 
 The Australian is smilingly dismissive. ''Trey had left him licking chili sauce from his cracked lips and yesterday had seen the opal pendant for sale at a stall in the bazaar,'' clipped from its owner's corpse. The tone and atmosphere are derivative (Hemingway, Graham Greene, Robert Stone), but the aura of danger is convincingly sustained.
 The story was written at Syracuse University, where McInerney, after being fired from The New Yorker's fact-checking department, had enrolled in fiction workshops, his teachers Raymond Carver and Tobias Wolff, both masters of compressed narrative. McInerney submitted ''In the North-West Frontier Province'' to The Paris Review, at the time a generously wide gateway for young fiction writers. The editor, George Plimpton, liked it -- not enough to publish but enough to phone the author and ask for something else. McInerney promptly extruded, in a single all-night session, he says, ''It's Six A.M. Do You Know Where You Are?'' an evocation of the downtown Manhattan club scene, later expanded into the novel ''Bright Lights, Big City'' (1984), which deservedly made its 29-year-old author famous: the wounded, smart-aleck wit, the imagistic depiction of 1980s Manhattan, in transition from ''Taxi Driver'' dilapidation to ''Wall Street'' opulence. 
 Once again McInerney created a picture of hell -- actually two alternating hells, held in clever counterpoise, one the staid, venerable magazine where the unnamed 24-year-old protagonist distractedly labors in a continual panic of low-paid drudgery, the other the night-town of bars and clubs where he seeks escape, the ''Bolivian marching powder'' he sniffs less a stimulant than a sedative against fresh humiliations. Jilted by his wife, a model, he thrashes in alternating comic torments ofrage and grief and envisions a photo caption in The New York Post: ''Sexually Abandoned Hubby Goes Berserk.''
 Each generation needs its Manhattan novel, and many ache to write it. But it was McInerney who succeeded -- through the inspiration of the present-tense, second-person voice, the vehicle of false insinuating intimacy twinned with coolly ironic deflation. ''You have this desire to prove that you can have as good a time as anyone, that you can be one of the crowd,'' the narrator intones in weary condescension, like a therapist bored by his patient. ''You will learn to compound happiness out of small increments of mindless pleasure.'' What seems a coming-of-age story becomes instead a case study of acute narcissism, the universal condition of young male literary aspirants. The second-person narration flowed so easily because McInerney was lampooning all those other self-conscious, self-absorbed young novelists whose every ''he'' was really an ''I.'' Thus: ''You thought of yourself in the third person: He arrived for his first interview in a navy blue blazer. He was interviewed for a position in the Department of Factual Verification, a job which must have seemed even then to be singularly unsuited to his flamboyant temperament. But he was not to languish long among the facts.''
 A quarter-century after its publication, ''Bright Lights, Big City'' remains the sharpest and funniest of the many reprises of ''The Catcher in the Rye'': the unhappy young footloose hero whose flaunted small miseries camouflage deeper unacknowledged ones; the suffocating pretensions of adults who enforce the tribal code with sadistic glee. Summoned by his boss after hilariously botching a nightmare fact-checking assignment, the hero knows what's coming:
 ''You try to alleviate the terror by thinking how ridiculous her French braids look, like spinnakers on a tugboat. You suspect that deep down she enjoys this. She's been looking forward to it for a long time.
 'Do you realize just how serious this is?' she demands. 'You have endangered the reputation of this magazine. We have built a reputation for scrupulous accuracy with regard to matters of fact. Our readers depend on us for the truth.'
 You would like to say, Whoa! Block that jump from facts to truth, but she is off and running.''
 That the novel's vision of the literary life was ultimately sentimental only compounded the charm, though some found its commercial success disorienting, even distressing. ''But if McInerney was at first more a cultural phenomenon, or symptom, than a literary one, his books are worth attention,'' the critic Thomas R. Edwards allowed in 1996. The attention was assumed to be a surprise because the two phenomena couldn't coexist. But they had coexisted in Fitzgerald, and in Salinger too. Both were ''voices of a generation.'' So is McInerney. He was the first novelist born in the 1950s who throttled the demon of ''belatedness,'' in Harold Bloom's term. For Bloom ''anxiety'' is exerted by the intimidating weight of literary forebears. McInerney and his contemporaries felt that, of course. They also felt the belatedness of having grown up in the Vietnam period but come of age just when its rebellions were being commodified by the unleashed market forces of the Reagan years. Many novelists were struggling to make sense of this barometric change. But McInerney got there first. It is one reason his prose seems so free of self-consciousness and of mannerism, and at once postmodern and naturalistic. Firmly anchored in his time, he confidently projects from his own experiences. ''I'd largely avoided the drug culture of the '70s,'' the narrator of the title story in ''How It Ended'' relates, ''but even I could remember when drugs were viewed as the sacraments of a vague liberation theology or, later, as a slightly risky form of recreation. But in this era the romance of drug dealing was a hard sell.'' 
 The only relief from the hard sell is fellowship, re-entry into the bruising embrace of the clan -- usually not one's lineal kin but the company of kindred spirits. ''The capacity for friendship is God's way of apologizing for our families,'' McInerney writes in his novel ''The Last of the Savages,'' his most sustained attempt to sort through the 1960s. Its narrator hungers to be ''one of the crowd.'' All McInerney's characters do. This is why his notations of status, though as sharp as Tom Wolfe's, feel much warmer, conspiratorial but free of malice. He erases rather than imposes anthropological distance. And it is why the many casual couplings in his fiction often seem conjugal, reunions rather than transgressions. In ''The Good Life,'' McInerney's elegiac post-9/11 novel, published in 2006, Corrine Calloway meets an appealing man amid the rubble of the World Trade Center aftermath. Much would seem to separate them. He has reaped millions on Wall Street and has a fashion-plate wife. Corrine is a full-time mother married to an underpaid book editor. But the two become lovers, conjoined by ''a certain tribal sense of identity, affinities of background and education that weren't supposed to matter anymore, at this leveling moment.'' 
 The leveling was the handiwork of the pious Afghan warlords, or their spiritual descendants, whom McInerney had chillingly described 20 years before. But McInerney knows every moment is a leveling exercise, or threatens to become one, and that ''the code of tribal honor'' is often exacted most ruthlessly within the clan. In ''The Good Life,'' a 14-year-old caught having sex in her bedroom tells her father she's simply trying to fit in with the herd at her exclusive prep school, whose hazing rituals are the 21st-century edition of the tortures that helped edge Holden Caulfield over the brink. ''It's all about belonging to a tribe and not getting pushed out into the jungle,'' she explains, ''where you starve to death and the hyenas eat you.''
 I have spoken with Jay McInerney at most four or five times. The occasion I remember best is the first. It was in October 1998. I was an editor at The Times's Op-Ed page, and I asked McInerney to write about the latest Wall Street convulsion. He seemed well suited to the task. No one else grasped so surely the fatal delusions of the ''hard sell.'' In ''Bright Lights, Big City,'' he had presciently guessed that ''the new writing will be about technology, the global economy, the electronic ebb and flow of wealth.'' And he had explored the intricacies of the 1987 junk bond crash in ''Brightness Falls.'' McInerney submitted an essay that accused the financial wizards of historical ignorance and unseemly greed. Some of the culprits were his friends, but his analysis was unsparing. ''For those who weren't content with a mere 30 percent return on capital, hedge funds came along and made greenmail seem like a piker's game,'' McInerney wrote. ''Nobody knew how they worked, but the nomenclature was reassuring: 'hedge fund' sounded like a conservative, cover-your-bets financial instrument. It rang totally '90s, just as 'junk bond,' from our '90s perspective, sounds so perfectly, vulgarly '80s. I mean, what did those clowns at Drexel Burnham expect?''
 I showed the essay to the Op-Ed editor, Katy Roberts, as alert a reader as I've known. She stared at the computer in silence and then pronounced the essay letter-perfect. However, The Times's standards of propriety required that one word be changed. McInerney wasn't happy about it -- in fact he fumed a bit -- but he understood. ''Clowns'' was our compromise. He'd written ''bastards.''

HEADLINE: Telling the Brutal Truth

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT.

 BODY:
A LINGUISTIC shift took place in this newspaper as it reported the details of how the Central Intelligence Agency was allowed to strip Al Qaeda prisoners naked, bash them against walls, keep them awake for up to 11 straight days, sometimes with their arms chained to the ceiling, confine them in dark boxes and make them feel as if they were drowning.
 Until this month, what the Bush administration called ''enhanced'' interrogation techniques were ''harsh'' techniques in the news pages of The Times. Increasingly, they are ''brutal.'' (On the editorial page, they long ago added up to ''torture.'')
 The choice of a single word involved separate deliberations in New York and the Washington bureau and demonstrated the linguistic minefields that journalists navigate every day in the quest to describe the world accurately and fairly. In a polarized atmosphere in which many Americans believe the nation betrayed its most fundamental ideals in the name of fighting terror and others believe extreme measures were necessary to save lives, The Times is displeasing some who think ''brutal'' is just a timid euphemism for torture and their opponents who think ''brutal'' is too loaded. 
 The controversy over this word echoes others that The Times has faced: Was it an insurgency or a civil war in Iraq? Must the paper call Hamas a terrorist organization, as some readers demand? Are we in a recession or a depression?
 Robert Ofsevit of Oakland, Calif., asked, ''Why can't The New York Times call torture by its proper name?'' He added, ''Please find more backbone and fulfill your journalistic responsibilities by describing these immoral and illegal practices for what they were.'' Theodore Murray of Cambridge, Mass., said that if The Times fails to adopt the word torture, ''you perpetuate the fantasy that calling a thing by something other than its name will change the thing itself.''
 But Cynthia Jacobson of Phoenix said The Times is ''outrageously biased'' to use a term like brutal. ''The Times has simply placed itself as one actor in a political fight, not a neutral media outlet,'' she wrote.
 The word had appeared a few times before in this context, most recently on April 10, when the Central Intelligence Agency said it was closing the network of secret overseas prisons where interrogations took place. Scott Shane, who covers national security, said he and his editor in the Washington bureau, Douglas Jehl, negotiated over the wording of the first paragraph. Shane wrote that methods used in the prisons were ''widely denounced as illegal torture.'' Jehl changed that to the ''harshest interrogation methods'' since the Sept. 11 attacks. Shane said he felt that with more information coming to light, including a leaked report by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the words harsh and even harshest no longer sufficed. He proposed brutal, and Jehl agreed.
 A week later, Jill Abramson, the managing editor for news, came to her own conclusion that the facts supported a stronger word than harsh after she read just-released memos from the Bush-era Justice Department spelling out the interrogation methods in detail and declaring them legal. The memos were repudiated by President Obama.
 ''Harsh sounded like the way I talked to my kids when they were teenagers and told them I was going to take the car keys away,'' said Abramson, who consulted with several legal experts and talked it over with Dean Baquet, the Washington bureau chief. Abramson and Baquet agreed that ''brutal'' was a better word. From rare use now and then, it had gone to being the preferred choice. The result of that decision was this top headline in the printed paper of April 17: ''Memos Spell Out Brutal C.I.A. Mode of Interrogation.''
 That offended Daniel Pilon of Solon Springs, Wis., who said he agreed that the article described brutality but did not want The Times making that judgment for him. ''Presenting the facts and letting the reader decide how to characterize what happened would be more in the spirit of objective journalism,'' Pilon said. He said The Times should have dropped all adjectives in this case.
 I asked Deborah Tannen, an author and professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, what she thought of a suggestion like Pilon's. ''The search for words that are not in any way evaluative is hopeless,'' she told me. ''All words have connotations.''
 I was not sure I saw a huge difference between harsh and brutal -- my dictionary says one meaning of harsh is brutal. Tannen said there is a big difference, and she noticed the change in The Times right away. Brutal suggests something animal-like and ''goes beyond the way humans are supposed to act,'' she said.
 And why not, then, go all the way to torture? Jehl said that when the paper is discussing what is generally regarded as the most extreme interrogation method the C.I.A. used, waterboarding, ''we've become more explicit in saying in a first reference that it's a near-drowning technique'' that Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder and many other experts ''have called torture.'' But he said: ''I have resisted using torture without qualification or to describe all the techniques. Exactly what constitutes torture continues to be a matter of debate and hasn't been resolved by a court. This president and this attorney general say waterboarding is torture, but the previous president and attorney general said it is not. On what basis should a newspaper render its own verdict, short of charges being filed or a legal judgment rendered?'' Jehl argued for precision and caution. I agree.
 Waterboarding, for which the United States prosecuted Japanese interrogators after World War II, is a deeply troubling issue. The Times has referred to it as ''simulated drowning,'' which upset Winnie Boal of Charlevoix, Mich. ''Simulated drowning sounds like a video game,'' she said, ''and I'm sure waterboarding doesn't feel anything like a game.'' Boal noticed that The Times now calls it ''near drowning,'' a change she appreciates. Jehl said that because information was classified, it was unclear for a long time how the C.I.A. administered waterboarding. As details emerged, ''we concluded that 'near drowning' was a more accurate description.''
 Shane said that, when there is space, he tries to say exactly what waterboarding is: ''water poured over the mouth and nose to produce a feeling of suffocation.''
 I have read the Justice Department memos -- by turns clinical about inflicting pain and oddly solicitous about diaper rash. It is a disquieting experience. Reporters and editors need to leave moral and political judgments to editorial writers and readers, but they cannot be so detached that they appear oblivious to the implications of the facts.
 The Times should strive to tell readers exactly what a given interrogation technique entails, as Shane does with waterboarding. But that is not always practical, as in a headline. When the paper needs a short description, the word brutal is accurate and appropriate, whether you think the acts were justified or not.

HEADLINE: Attention Must Still Be Paid

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN.

 BODY:
ASIDE from some gardening and baby-sitting in my neighborhood when I was a child, my first summer job was in the summer of 1962, just before my first year of college. It was at Shoe Giant, a large discount shoe store in Langley Park, in Prince George's County of Maryland, and I got the job thanks to a high school pal who also worked there.
 The job entailed selling shoes. The shoes were tossed about in giant bins and some were stored in boxes. Once the customers had picked out the kind of shoes they wanted, my task was to find the right size, close the sale, write up a receipt with my sales clerk number on it and escort the customer to the cashier. (A pair of shoes there was rarely more than $10 -- and was often less.) 
 I made not much more than a dollar an hour, as well as a small commission. I recall that my first week's paycheck was about $70.
 I did not stay at that job for long. Later that summer, my mother found me a job at the Civil Service Commission, where I sat at a desk and added numbers on an ancient Marchant machine with a crank, to find Civil Service health insurance payment data for various kinds of injuries and sicknesses. I hated that job, but I did it anyway. I missed Shoe Giant. I missed the drama of selling.
 Even after all these years, and after many other jobs, my mind often returns to my brief stint as a shoe salesman. It was then, amid that tangle of sandals, sneakers, oxfords, high heels and brogans, that I discovered the ballet that is sales. Forever after, I have had a deep respect for selling and for salesmen and saleswomen.
 Sales -- when done right -- is more than a job. It is an art. It is a high-wire act. It is, as Arthur Miller immortally said, being out there ''on a smile and a shoe shine.'' It is learning the product you are selling, learning it so well that you can describe it while doing a pirouette of smiles for the customer and talking about the latest football scores. It is knowing human nature so well that you can align the attributes of your product or service cleanly with the needs and wants of your customers.
 At its best, selling is taking a doubt and turning it, jujitsu style, into a powerful push. Selling is making the customer feel better about spending money -- or investing it -- than he would have felt by keeping his wallet zipped.
 I have special memories of people who have sold brilliantly. 
 In 1976, when I moved to Los Angeles, I desperately wanted a Mercedes 450 SLC, a car that was -- even in used form -- far more than I deserved or could afford at my entry-level, highly tenuous work as a scriptwriter. My salesman at Mercedes-Benz of Beverly Hills, Larry Anish, listened to my objections and simply asked, ''Don't you believe in your own future?'' Of course, I bought the car.
 Many years later, an insurance broker came to call on my wife about disability insurance. I scoffed at him and told him how incredibly unlikely it was that a healthy woman like my wife would ever be disabled. ''Yes,'' he said. ''That's what we think, too. That's why it's so cheap and pays so much if she does get disabled.''
 I bought the policy, and when my wife did get temporarily disabled, it paid off magnificently and we needed it. 
 When in doubt about any aspect of human interaction, I always consult the best salesman I have ever known, Barron Thomas, real estate and airplane salesman extraordinaire, and occasional writer, who could sell oil to the Saudis.
 In particular, I've come to love insurance sales representatives. After many years of skepticism, and despite many warnings from consumer ''experts,'' I have come to believe that you can rarely have too much insurance, and that whatever insurance you don't have is exactly what you will wind up needing. The fact that so many people in insurance sell you what's good for you, even when smart alecks are telling you not to buy it, makes their work extremely impressive. I wish I had paid more attention to them.
 People who work in sales often sit next to me on airplanes, which are my true home. In ''Death of a Salesman,'' Arthur Miller also wrote: ''A salesman is got to dream, boy. It comes with the territory.'' Those who are in sales are always aware that the next sale is behind the next door, and they are always great companions. They are where the rubber of production meets the road of consumption, whether in a showroom or a studio or on the phone or calling you at home. When the recovery starts, they will be the ones making purchases happen.
 Lawyers and doctors and dentists and politicians and accountants and actors -- all of us sell something, every day and every time we meet someone. For me, it all goes back to Shoe Giant, 47 years ago, and I wish that every 17-year-old I know could have that experience. It takes some ability at sales to believe in your own future, no matter what that future may be.

HEADLINE: Think Big, Even in Defeat

BYLINE: By ROBERT DALLEK. 
Robert Dallek is the author of ''Lone Star Rising'' and ''Flawed Giant,'' a two-volume biography of Lyndon B. Johnson.

 BODY:
OF all America's recent presidents, none seem to have a stronger continuing hold on the public than John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. The source of their shared appeal is not any particular program they promoted, like Social Security or civil rights, but a common impulse to encourage a belief in a better -- a more prosperous, safer -- America. Kennedy's ''New Frontier'' and Mr. Reagan's ''Morning in America'' remain inspirational reminders to see better days ahead.
 Cynics can scoff at the country's love affair with presidents whose feel-good rhetoric chases away gloom in hard times. But Herbert Hoover, of whom it was said, ''A rose would wilt in his hand,'' longed to find a song, a poem, a joke that could lift the country's spirits in the Great Depression. Now Barack Obama, faced by another economic collapse, has found his feel-good prescription in ''action, and action now,'' as Franklin Roosevelt phrased it. 
 President Obama has put forward a bold agenda of reforms that aims to fulfill his campaign promises to restore the country's economic well-being, provide health insurance coverage to millions of uninsured Americans, end the war in Iraq, defeat the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and, more generally, restore America's good name around the world. 
 Some believe that the president's ambitious agenda is a pipe dream; even friendly critics think he is overreaching. But history shows these counsels of caution are more a formula for defeat than Mr. Obama's rush to remake the world in a grand swoop. Lyndon Johnson understood that John Kennedy's assassination had brought on a mood of despair, and that Americans wanted deeds that encouraged a sense of forward movement, that could overcome fears of a divided, violent America and create a Great Society where Americans would be ''more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods.''
 He made his wishes clear -- and reassured a nation -- in his address to Congress five days after that terrible moment in Dallas. The nation, he said, needed ''to do away with uncertainty and doubt,'' and to show that ''from the brutal loss of our leader we will derive not weakness, but strength; that we can and will act and act now.'' Invoking Kennedy's famous injunction, ''Let us begin,'' Johnson said, ''Let us continue.''
 Lyndon Johnson is not a comfortable model for President Obama to imitate. He is an all but forgotten president -- pilloried for the failed war in Vietnam and criticized for grandiose reforms conservatives denounce as the epitome of federal social engineering that costs too much and does too little. 
 But Mr. Obama can take heart from the knowledge that all Johnson's major initiatives remain a part of the national life: civil rights and voting rights; Medicare and Medicaid; federal aid to elementary, secondary and higher education; the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development; environmental protections; consumer rights; medical research; and support for the arts and humanities.
 The Johnson presidency also provides valuable lessons on the more prosaic level of politics. While Johnson had larger Congressional majorities than Mr. Obama's, he nonetheless launched a campaign of carrots and sticks to win support on the Hill for his reforms. He insisted that aides return any representative's or senator's call in ''10 minutes, or else.'' He phoned to thank Republicans who supported his proposals; Democrats who defied him felt his ire.
 Like Roosevelt and Johnson, President Obama is not only trying to overcome decades of inherited problems, he is also renewing the country's faith in its institutions. His program of reforms at home and abroad is not simply an answer to the difficulties of our time but also a call to Americans to believe once again in the greatness of the nation and the promise of American life. Like Lyndon Johnson, President Obama understands that timidity in a time of troubles is a prescription for failure.

HEADLINE: President Emphasizes Discipline In Budgets

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama, saying the government must act ''the same way any responsible family does in setting its budget,'' called Saturday for Congress to pass legislation that would require lawmakers to offset any new tax cuts or spending increases with equivalent tax increases or spending cuts. 
 The legislation, dubbed Paygo, for pay-as-you-go, has become a rallying cry for fiscally conservative Democrats, who are pushing for it to be applied to the health care legislation that the White House is hoping will pass this year. 
 Speaking in his weekly radio and Internet address to the nation, Mr. Obama said he wanted it applied more broadly.
 ''We need to adhere to the basic principle that new tax or entitlement policies should be paid for,'' he said. ''This principle, known as Paygo, helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s. 
 ''Now, we must restore that sense of fiscal discipline.''
 Mr. Obama has spent the first three months of his presidency presiding over a huge burst of federal spending; his economic recovery bill will cost taxpayers $787 billion, and the government is pumping $700 billion more into the economy to keep shaky financial institutions stable. Now the president is turning his attention to the other side of the budget equation: cutting the deficit.
 ''All across America, families are tightening their belts and making hard choices,'' he said. ''Now, Washington must show that same sense of responsibility.''
 But Mr. Obama's efforts to show fiscal responsibility have so far brought derision from some budget analysts and many Republicans. On Monday, he used the first cabinet meeting of his presidency to challenge department heads and agencies to trim $100 million from their budgets over the next 90 days. Analysts said it was the equivalent of asking a family that spent $40,000 a year to cut $1 from its budget.
 On Saturday, Mr. Obama used his address to defend the effort and to return to the fiscal discipline theme. While his initiatives to stabilize the economy may be driving up the federal deficit, he noted that he also inherited a hefty deficit, estimated at $1.3 trillion this year, from his predecessor, President George W. Bush, and said his administration ''identified two trillion dollars in deficit reductions over the next decade.''
 That $2 trillion figure, however, is widely scorned by budget analysts, who say it is unrealistic because it reflects inflated assumptions on spending in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research institution, said a more realistic figure for deficit savings was $900 billion. 
 In his address, Mr. Obama also pledged to look for budget-cutting ideas ''from the bottom up,'' saying he would establish a process through which every government worker could submit ideas on how to save money. He offered an incentive for workers to participate, saying he would meet later this year with those who come up with the best ideas.

HEADLINE: Time To Come Clean

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
If, God forbid, terrorists release nerve gas in movie theaters from Los Angeles to Washington tomorrow, the debate about torture will change 180 degrees. The public will turn on President Obama for having ''coddled'' terrorists.
 In short, today's revulsion at waterboarding is broad but fragile. And that makes it essential that the United States proceed with an independent commission to investigate harsh treatment and tally its costs and benefits.
 President Obama worries that the commission will be a distraction, but the truth is the opposite. Revelations will continue to trickle out -- including a new hoard of photos of abuses scheduled to be released by May 28 -- creating a constant roar of charges and counter-charges. Liberals will jab Mr. Obama from the left, and Dick Cheney from the right, until the president resembles St. Sebastian (the human pincushion). Mr. Obama won't be able to escape torture. 
 ''He's trying to get it off the news cycle, and that's not going to happen,'' said Elisa Massimino, chief executive of Human Rights First. ''You can't say you're going to follow the evidence and then not look for any.''
 Morton Halperin of the Open Society Institute, a leader in the coalition supporting a commission, said: ''He's better off saying, 'there'll be a commission report, and I'll deal with it when it's over.' It's a much more credible way to get it off the table.''
 There are three solid reasons for a national commission:
 First, it could help forge a consensus against torture, for almost everyone in the national security world believes that the result would be a ringing affirmation that we should not torture. 
 It's in Mr. Obama's interest to reach such a consensus, because otherwise the next major terror attack -- and there will be one -- will be followed by Republican claims that the president's wimpishness left America vulnerable. His agenda on health care, climate change and education will then risk a collapse into dream dust. The way to inoculate his agenda is to seek common ground through a nonpartisan commission.
 Second, a commission could help restore America's standing by distancing ourselves from past abuses. Alberto Mora, a former general counsel for the Navy, has said that some flag-rank officers believe that Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo constitute ''the first and second identifiable causes of U.S. combat deaths in Iraq,'' because they galvanized jihadis. An Air Force major and interrogator of prisoners who goes by the pseudonym Matthew Alexander told Harper's Magazine that ''hundreds but more likely thousands of American lives'' were lost because of ''the policy decision to introduce the torture and abuse of prisoners.'' 
 Third, a commission could help counterterrorism efforts. Foreign governments have been wary of cooperating with us for fear of being tarnished by scandal. At home, Arab-American and Somali-American communities have been leery of reporting tips because they see the authorities as unjust and hostile to Muslims.
 ''Oftentimes, the communities from which we need the most help are those who trust us the least,'' Robert Mueller, the F.B.I. director, told the Council on Foreign Relations recently. Last fall, a Somali-American was among a group of suicide bombers who killed more than 20 people in the northern Somalia; he may have been the first American citizen to commit such a suicide attack. 
 There's no magic bullet to prevent that from happening in Minneapolis next time, but a truth commission would perhaps be one way to clear the air, build trust among American Muslims and improve counterterrorism.
 The truth commission shouldn't be bipartisan. Rather, it should be nonpartisan, led by prominent legal figures and national security experts who are not strongly associated with a political party. Among those often mentioned are Sandra Day O'Connor, Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton, along with retired generals and intelligence experts. Such a panel could not be accused of a witch hunt.
 It could explore whether there should be criminal responsibility, and whether health professionals should lose licenses for participating in torture. 
 Conversely, I hope the commission would also recognize some of the most heroic figures since 9/11: those brave military officers, especially military lawyers, who defied the Pentagon to stand up for terrorism suspects -- or, more accurately, for principles of justice.
 At a time when we in the news media became lapdogs rather than watchdogs, when Congress and the courts dozed, those military lawyers sacrificed their careers to defend American values. They deserve medals. 
 Mr. Obama is right that we have to focus on the economy and move ahead. But one of our most precious possessions is our moral core, our value system, and when you've lost your way it's important to retrace your steps to understand where you went astray. Come on, Mr. Obama, let's not delay that process.

HEADLINE: 'Green' Freight Rail System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Obama Seeks High-Speed Rail System Across U.S.'' (news article, April 17):
 President Obama's high-speed rail plan is welcome news for all Americans. President Obama cited the need for a transportation system that will unclog our highways, eliminate destructive emissions and create jobs. The good news is that America's freight rail system is already doing just that, delivering environmental and economic benefits to our nation every day. 
 One train can haul a ton of goods 436 miles on a single gallon of fuel and carry the load of 280 trucks. That means that for every ton-mile of freight moved by rail instead of by truck, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by two-thirds or more. 
 Freight rail companies have eliminated 538 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions since 1980. Freight railroads are also an engine for economic growth: every $1 billion invested in freight rail creates 20,000 infrastructure-related jobs. 
 Our national surface transportation plan should build upon the successes of America's freight rail system, helping passengers and freight move as efficiently and ''greenly'' as possible. To do that, we must continue to invest in revitalizing and expanding rail infrastructure. 
 Many of the tracks over which passenger trains operate are owned by freight railroads. The stimulus is a great start, but public-private partnerships and tax credits will help spur even greater investment in our vital rail infrastructure. 
 We look forward to working with the administration, Congress and the states to see that the promise of expanded freight and high-speed passenger rail is realized.

HEADLINE: To Get Out of Those Damned Spots

BYLINE: By BARRY EDELSTEIN. 
Barry Edelstein, author of ''Bardisms: Shakespeare for All Occasions,'' directs the Public Theater's Shakespeare Initiative.

 BODY:
President Obama's conscious emulation of Lincoln is a matter of record, whether it is in announcing his candidacy in Lincoln's hometown or taking the oath of office on Lincoln's Bible.
 Given Mr. Obama's particular fondness for Lincolnesque oratory, it's surprising that he hasn't adopted one of Lincoln's favorite habits: quoting Shakespeare.
 Lincoln was a lifelong Bardolater and serial Shakespeare-quoter, as Mr. Obama noted in remarks at the recent reopening of Ford's Theater. Lincoln regarded Shakespeare, whose 445th birthday was last week, as many things: an oracle to be consulted for wisdom; a pastor with whom to share confidences and from whom to seek comfort, a friend. He kept a ''Complete Works'' close at hand in the White House. 
 Sitting for one official portrait, for instance, Lincoln fought the tedium with a spontaneous performance of the opening soliloquy from ''Richard III,'' along with running commentary on how most actors he'd seen play the role had botched it. 
 He knew much of ''Hamlet'' by heart, and shared with one correspondent his still unorthodox view that the best speech by the villain Claudius, ''the soliloquy commencing, 'O, my offense is rank' surpasses that commencing 'To be or not to be.' '' It was ''Macbeth,'' though, that seemed to haunt Lincoln. He quoted from it countless times, and the ''Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow'' soliloquy gripped his imagination with unusual power.
 Late one night in the difficult summer of 1864, John Forney, secretary of the Senate and frequent White House guest, found Lincoln asleep at his desk, ''ghastly pale, rings under his caverned eyes.'' His Shakespeare lay open beside him. Lincoln started awake and immediately read aloud the remarkable speech, with its imagery of life as bad acting and human endeavor as the noisy and meaningless soundtrack accompanying our progress toward death. When he finished, Lincoln told a stunned Forney that Macbeth's extreme nihilism and utter hopelessness ''comes to me tonight like a consolation.''
 Lincoln wasn't the only president fascinated by ''Macbeth,'' although few were as compelled by its bleakness. Ronald Reagan recited the entire ''Tomorrow and tomorrow'' speech from memory at a school event in Tennessee. He construed the lines as a caution against the morbid mindset Lincoln found in them, telling his young audience, ''I hope that none of you ever get that pessimistic or that cynical about life.'' 
 Bill Clinton reeled off the same speech at a White House celebration of American poetry. He observed wryly that ''Macbeth'' was ''hardly designed to entice me to a public career'' but that through the play, ''I learned about the dangers of blind ambition, the fleeting nature of fame, the ultimate emptiness of power disconnected from higher purpose.''
 John Adams and Thomas Jefferson revered Shakespeare so much that they made a pilgrimage together to his house in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1786 (Adams was moved; Jefferson complained about how expensive everything was). Adams's son John Quincy Adams was a serious Shakespeare lover, too, and the only president to have published a volume of Shakespeare criticism.
 James Garfield read Shakespeare to his young children in the White House; Millard Fillmore read Shakespeare to factory workers in his native Buffalo -- part of his effort to encourage working-class literacy. John F. Kennedy hosted the first Shakespearean performances in the executive mansion and claimed him as ''an American writer.'' George W. Bush knew Shakespeare, too: he told an interviewer that on vacation in 2006 he had ''read three Shakespeares,'' but he didn't disclose the titles.
 Mr. Obama seems primed to join the ranks of Bard-quoting presidents. Like his hero Lincoln, he prefers the heavier works: his Facebook profile lists ''Shakespeare's Tragedies'' among his favorite books. He has yet to cite them in public.
 His closest brush was in his Inaugural Address, where his evocative phrase ''this winter of our hardship'' glanced at Shakespeare's ''winter of our discontent'' from ''Richard III.''
 The step from literary allusion to direct quotation is small, however, especially since there is no shortage of Shakespeare with which Mr. Obama might address the country's challenges. For example:
 On the trouble in the Gulf of Aden, he could say this from ''Antony and Cleopatra'': ''I must / Rid all the sea of pirates.'' He could quote from ''Henry IV, Part I'' on limiting Wall Street bonuses: ''A little / More than a little is by much too much.'' When he cashiers the next Fortune 500 C.E.O., some ''Pericles'' might come in handy: ''We would purge the land of these drones, that rob the bee of her honey.''
 Deploying more troops into Afghanistan, he could offer the Joint Chiefs this advice from ''Henry V'': ''In cases of defense, 'tis best to weigh / The enemy more mighty than he seems.'' Should he ever bump into Dick Cheney he might recall some ''Henry VI, Part II'': ''In your protectorship you did devise / Strange tortures for offenders never heard of.''
 Imagine this plea for Congress to put patriotism before partisanship, from ''Henry VIII'': ''Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's.''
 Or this response, from ''The Two Gentlemen of Verona,'' when a reporter asks the president if the economy is going to improve: ''Ask my dog. If he say ay, it will. If he say no, it will. If he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.''
 During his precious downtime, at Camp David, say, the president might tell his staff to hold all calls with this line from ''Coriolanus'': ''My wife comes foremost.''
 He could whisper a benediction from ''The Winter's Tale'' as he tucks Sasha or Malia into bed: ''You gods look down, / And from your sacred vials pour your graces / Upon my daughter's head.''
 And when it's time to gear up for 2012, Mr. Obama could substitute some ''Timon of Athens'' for his celebrated rallying cry:
 ''What we can do, we'll do.''

HEADLINE: In Reagan's Debt

BYLINE: By LOU CANNON. 
Lou Cannon is the author of five books on , Ronald Reagan and a co-author of ''Reagan's Disciple: George W. Bush's Troubled Quest for a Presidential Legacy.''

DATELINE: Summerland, Calif. 

 BODY:
 WEDNESDAY will be Barack Obama's 100th day in office and, for better or for worse, he has done more to transform the political landscape than any other president in the early days of his tenure since Ronald Reagan. After succeeding unpopular presidents during an economic crisis -- Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush had identical final Gallup approval ratings of 34 percent -- Mr. Reagan and Mr. Obama quickly restored shattered public confidence. Mr. Obama's approval rating has hovered around 60 percent since his inauguration. Mr. Reagan's ratings were similar for two months, and soared to 68 percent after he was shot by a would-be assassin on March 30, 1981. 
 Approval ratings, while fleeting, are crucial to presidential success. Mr. Reagan's substantial public backing enabled him to persuade a Democratic-controlled House to pass his tax and budget bills. Mr. Obama might have been able to push his $787 billion stimulus package through Congress on Democratic votes alone, but he would have had to negotiate around a potential Republican filibuster. Instead, he won the support of a handful of Senate Republicans and got it approved quickly. 
 Apart from their rhetorical skills and ability to connect with the American people, though, Mr. Obama and Mr. Reagan are widely regarded as opposites. Mr. Reagan saw government as the problem. Believing that government was strangling the private sector, he proposed lower taxes and reduced regulations. In Mr. Obama's catechism, government is the solution. In addition to trying to spend the nation out of recession, Mr. Obama seeks regulations to curb the excesses of Wall Street and tax increases on the wealthy to help pay for a near-universal health care system.
 A closer look suggests, however, that these two presidents are not as far apart as their partisans and critics believe. For all his thunder about the dangers of big government, Mr. Reagan during his eight years in office preserved the core of social programs that were the basic legacy of Franklin Roosevelt, his first political idol. Mr. Reagan's high-risk budget director, David Stockman, tried an early maneuver that would have reduced Social Security benefits. After this plan backfired, Mr. Reagan named a bipartisan commission that proposed mild reforms that were embraced by the Democratic House speaker, Tip O'Neill, passed by Congress and extended the solvency of the system for a generation. 
 Conservatives urged Mr. Reagan to take another run at Social Security or other entitlement programs. He never did. As the columnist George Will observed, Mr. Reagan understood that Americans were indeed conservative, and wanted to conserve the New Deal. 
 In the early months of his presidency, to the trepidation of the left, Mr. Obama has given signs of being every bit as practical as Mr. Reagan. Although some on the right accuse him of leading the nation down the road to socialism, he has in fact moved cautiously. He has been reluctant to nationalize financial institutions, and his banking plan, to the degree it can be understood, relies heavily on private investment. 
 On health care, Mr. Obama is leaving the details to Congress and has moved closer to the plan that was proposed by his onetime rival, Hillary Clinton, and that is also accepted by many in the health care industry. The most controversial element of Mr. Obama's tax plan -- limiting tax deductions for high earners to 28 percent of deductions for mortgage interest, local taxes or charitable deduction -- isn't radical either. This would essentially return the deductions limit to close to what it was during the Reagan years.
 Unfortunately, Mr. Obama also shares with Mr. Reagan a tendency to indulge in best-case economic scenarios. Mr. Reagan never submitted a balanced budget to Congress. Spending as a share of gross domestic product increased to a high of 24.4 percent during the Reagan years, and the national debt quickly hit $3 trillion. 
 Mr. Obama could do even worse. The usually reliable Congressional Budget Office estimates that Mr. Obama's spending plans will add $9.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, more than $2 trillion higher than White House projections. This could give Congress jitters about backing White House proposals like the health care plan.
 Mr. Obama, like Mr. Reagan, is an appealing president. But he has unwisely allowed his optimism to get the better of his budgeting, which was Mr. Reagan's most worrisome legacy to the nation.

HEADLINE: He Wants Subjects, Verbs and Objects

 BODY:
This interview of Richard Anderson, chief executive of Delta Air Lines, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.
 Q.What was the most important leadership lesson you learned? 
 A. I've learned to be patient and not lose my temper. And the reason that's important is everything you do is an example, and people look at everything you do and take a signal from everything you do. And when you lose your temper, it really squelches debate and sends the wrong signal about how you want your organization to run. And it was a good lesson. It was a long time ago. And I had a C.E.O. who I was very close to, and he just took me aside and gave me a really short instruction about it. And it was a really important instruction.
 We have a tendency in these jobs to push really, really hard and want to go really, really fast. Change can't ever be fast enough. But you do have to be patient enough and make sure that you always remain calm. 
 Q.Are there other things that you've learned to do more of, or less? 
 A. You've got to be thankful to the people who get the work done, and you've got to be thankful to your customers. So, I find myself, more and more, writing hand-written notes to people. I must write a half a dozen a day.
 Q. Looking back over your career, even to the early years, do you recall an insight that set you on a different trajectory?
 A. Yes, and it was actually at my first job while I went to night law school at South Texas College of Law. And I had a good full-time job as the administrative assistant to the D.A. And what you understood was you really needed to be a problem-solver, not a problem-creator. You know, don't bring a Rubik's cube to the table, unless you have an idea on how you're going to try to get an answer. And always try to be a leader that comes up with the creative answers to the hard problems. 
 Q.And what about advice on your career? 
 A. If you just focus on getting your job done and being a good colleague and a team player in an organization, and not focused about being overly ambitious and wanting pay raises and promotions and the like, and just doing your job and being a part of a team, the rest of it all takes care of itself.
 Q. Did somebody give you that advice, or was that something that you came to understand yourself?
 A. My mother and father died from cancer when I was 20, and so I was working full time, and I was pretty fortunate to be around a lot of good people that had that kind of culture and approach to things. It was just by osmosis that I came to those kinds of conclusions.
 Q.Let's talk about hiring. What are you looking for in job candidates? 
 A. Typically, when you're hiring a vice president of a company, they already have the resume and they already have the experience base. And so what you're trying to find out about are the intangibles of leadership, communication style and the ability to, today, really adapt to change. 
 And there are a lot of ways to go at that. I like to ask people what they've read, what are the last three or four books they've read, and what did they enjoy about those. And to really understand them as individuals because, you know, the resumes you get are wonderful resumes. Wonderful education, great work history. So you have to probe a little bit deeper into the human intangibles, because we've all seen many instances where people had perfect resumes, but weren't effective in an organization. 
 So it's not just education and experience. It's education, experience and the human factor. The situational awareness that a person has and their ability to fit into an organization and then be successful in the organization. It's a whole series of intangibles that are almost gut instincts about people. 
 Q.What other questions do you ask? 
 A. You want to know about their family. Where they grew up. What their parents did. Where they went to high school. What their avocations were. How many kids they had in their family. You know, what their whole background and history is.
 I learned that from a C.E.O. I worked for. The C.E.O. wouldn't really spend that much time on the resume, but spent most of the time wanting to know everything about the person's life, family, what they liked, where they liked to go on vacation, what their kids were like. And it gave you a really good perspective about who they were as people. 
 You spend more of your waking time with your colleagues at the office than you do with your family and when you bring someone into that family -- we have 50 senior leaders at our company and 70,000 employees -- you need to make sure that they're a fit to the culture. And that they're going to be part of that group of people in a healthy functioning way. 
 Q. What are you listening for as somebody describes their family, where they're from, etc.? 
 A. You're looking for a really strong set of values. You're looking for a really good work ethic. Really good communication skills. More and more, the ability to speak well and write is important. You know, writing is not something that is taught as strongly as it should be in the educational curriculum. So you're looking for communication skills.
 You're looking for adaptability to change. You're looking at, do you get along well with people? And are you the sort of person that can be a part of a team and motivate people? You know, do you have the emotional I.Q.?
 It's not just enough to be able to just do a nice PowerPoint presentation. You've got to have the ability to pick people. You've got to have the ability to communicate. When you find really capable people, it's amazing how they proliferate capable people all through your organization. So that's what you're hunting for. 
 Q.And is there any change in the kind of qualities you're looking for compared with 5, 10 years ago?
 A. I think this communication point is getting more and more important. People really have to be able to handle the written and spoken word. And when I say written word, I don't mean PowerPoints. I don't think PowerPoints help people think as clearly as they should because you don't have to put a complete thought in place. You can just put a phrase with a bullet in front of it. And it doesn't have a subject, a verb and an object, so you aren't expressing complete thoughts. 
 And a lot of what we do in communication, when you write e-mail, you need to express yourself very clearly so people understand whether we're going to L.A. today or we're going to Boston today. 
 The second thing is, I think you've got to have what our pilots call operational awareness. You've got to have your head up. You know, when you're flying an airplane, you've got to have your head up and you've got to have situational awareness of everything that's going on around you. There is so much going on in the world today, you've got to know what's going on globally, what's going on around you, particularly today with what's going on in this economy. 
 And, third, you've got to have not just the business skills, you've got to have the emotional intelligence. It's not just enough to be the best person operating an H.P. calculator. You have to have the emotional intelligence to understand what's right culturally, both in your company and outside your company.
 Q.Any good management or leadership books that you've read?
 A. I think good history books are the best books on management. And particularly autobiographies and biographies. Right now, I'm reading ''Theodore Rex.'' 
 Q.What about time management?
 A. Only touch paper once. No. 2, always have your homework done. No. 3, return your calls very promptly. No. 4, stick to your schedule. I keep my watch about 10 minutes ahead. It's important to run on time, particularly at an airline. And use your time wisely. And then, once a month, take the rest of the calendar year, or the next six months and re-review how you are using your time and reprioritize what you're doing.
 Q.How do you run meetings? 
 A. One, get the materials out ahead of time and make sure they are succinct and to the point. Second, start the meeting on time. Third, I tend to be a stoic going into the meeting. I want the debate. I want to hear everybody's perspective, so you want to try to ask more questions than make statements.
 I don't think it's appropriate to use BlackBerrys in meetings. You might as well have the newspaper and open the newspaper up in the middle of the meeting. So let's stay focused on what we're doing. Let's have a really good debate, but it can't get uncollegial. If it gets uncollegial, we actually have a bell you can ring, in the conference room. 
 Q. Tell me more about this. 
 A. If you are in a really hard debate and somebody veers off the subject and goes after you in a way that isn't fair, you get to ring the bell. It's a violation of the rules of the road. So you ring the bell if something wasn't a fair shot, and we all laugh.
 Q. If you had to choose another profession, what would it be?
 A. Probably a public defender. I enjoyed doing criminal trial work. Teach law school or go back into health care. You know, I spent three years at UnitedHealth Group, and the health care problems we face as a country are so daunting that it would be interesting, particularly given the focus on our government today, on trying to solve that set of problems. 
 Q.Are you a list keeper?
 A. I use Moleskines. It's just lists of things. Sometimes I'll just sit down and write what I'm thinking about things, because I'm not a PowerPoint person. I'll start at the upper left corner of the page and start writing, in complete thoughts, what I think. I have a long paper that I'm writing about our marketing strategy.
 Q. What would you like to see business schools teach more? 
 A. When you're managing as much change as corporations globally must deal with today, the ability to communicate and communicate effectively is so important that it ought to be a core capability in a business school curriculum. We measure, study, quantify, analyze every single piece of our business. Business schools in the United States have done a phenomenal job of creating that capability. But then you've got to be able to take all that data and information and transform it into change in the organization and improvement in the organization and the formulation of the business strategy.
 You've got to execute, and that human factor part is important. I know it's intangible and it's not like finance where 2 plus 2 is 4. I don't know whether it can be taught, but it can certainly be studied.

HEADLINE: Neo-Nazi Group Resurfaces, Citing Obama

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho 

 BODY:
When the Aryan Nations compound was publicly bulldozed eight years ago, many people here thought they had seen the end of a neo-Nazi group that brought notoriety and violence to this part of the Northwest. 
 But the group has surfaced again, distributing fliers that say it is recruiting members to create a ''world headquarters'' here.
 That has drawn the attention of the human rights advocates who helped destroy the old Aryan Nations.
 ''As best I can find out, it's two men and they operate out of a P.O. box,'' said Tony Stewart, a longtime advocate and board member of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations. ''There is no way that this compares to when the Aryan Nations had a compound here and drew hundreds for conferences.''
 A new Web site lists two Coeur d'Alene residents, Jerald O'Brien and Michael Lombard, as leaders of Aryan Nations. Both use the title of pastor, which was also used by Richard Butler, who brought the organization to Idaho from California in the 1970s.
 Mr. O'Brien said a handful of Mr. Butler's supporters remained in the area after he died in 2004, but kept a low profile. It was the election of Barack Obama as the nation's first black president that prompted them to begin seeking new members.
 ''He's one of the greatest recruiting tools we could have asked for,'' Mr. O'Brien said of Mr. Obama. ''He's helping to awaken the eyes of a lot of Americans.''
 The group distributed fliers in a Coeur d'Alene subdivision. The fliers showed a young girl asking her father, ''Why did those dark men take Mommy away?''
 The fliers were widely denounced in the area.
 Mr. O'Brien declined to say how many people had joined the white separatist, anti-Semitic group.
 In a recent report sent to American law enforcement agencies, the Homeland Security Department warned that right-wing extremists could use the bad state of the economy and the election of Mr. Obama to recruit members. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which follows such groups, reported that there were 926 active hate groups in 2008, up 50 percent from 2000.
 The center, based in Montgomery, Ala., is not much concerned with this new manifestation of Aryan Nations, said a spokeswoman, Heidi Beirich.
 ''The recent fliers that the handful of remaining members passed out is the most we've seen A.N. members do in a long, long time,'' Ms. Beirich said. ''We stomped the Aryan Nations pretty seriously.''

HEADLINE: Changing the American Mind

BYLINE: By JEAN EDWARD SMITH. 
Jean Edward Smith, a professor of political science at Marshall University, is the author, most recently, of ''F.D.R.''

DATELINE: Huntington, W.Va. 

 BODY:
 IN terms of legislative achievement, President Obama's first 100 days scarcely compare to those of Franklin Roosevelt. Franklin Roosevelt faced circumstances that are unlikely to be duplicated. One-quarter of the nation was unemployed. Commodity prices had collapsed, factories were idle, businesses were closing their doors and the banking system teetered on the brink of collapse.
 There was no safety net. Bank deposits were not insured, there were no agricultural price supports, no federal unemployment compensation, no pension system, no federal relief program. Labor was denied the right to bargain collectively, and the financial markets were unregulated. Half the nation's farms faced foreclosure, and 44 percent of homeowners could not make their mortgage payments. 
 ''This nation asks for action, and action now,'' Roosevelt said, and Congress responded with 15 historic pieces of legislation that put the country on the road to recovery.
 Neither President Obama -- nor any of Roosevelt's successors -- has matched that record. But none have faced his challenges. Yes, Mr. Obama is confronting two low-intensity wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, a recession, rising unemployment, a failed auto industry and chronic health care, education, energy and environmental problems. These are all severe and they are urgent, but they are not immediate and are in no way comparable to what Roosevelt faced. The safety net provided by the New Deal allows time for government to move deliberately.
 Mr. Obama's approach to governing is also markedly different from Roosevelt's. While Mr. Obama is a team player, someone who appears most comfortable reaching out for consensus, Roosevelt was a one-man show. During his New Deal years, Franklin Roosevelt was a polarizing figure. His supporters were so numerous it often seemed that Roosevelt was a unifier, but the truth is that he waged unrelenting class war and thrived on the vilification of his enemies. ''They are unanimous in their hatred for me -- and I welcome their hatred,'' he told a Madison Square Garden crowd in 1936.
 There is one way in which the resemblance between Roosevelt and Mr. Obama is striking: in their ability to change the nation's mindset and usher in a new set of assumptions.
 In 1933, Franklin Roosevelt became the leader of a nation that for half a century believed government was best when it governed least. President Obama inherited a third-generation spin-off of that sentiment, popularized by Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, that government is the problem, not the solution. In both instances, that mindset was overtaken by events.
 The same is true with regard to foreign relations. Roosevelt faced a nation locked in the embrace of a xenophobic isolationism. Mr. Obama confronts its direct descendant, the contemporary doctrine of American exceptionalism. The isolationism of the 1930s caused the United States to ignore the threat of German and Japanese imperialism and to close its borders to Europe's oppressed. The American exceptionalism practiced by the Bush administration provided a license for unilateralism, the dismissal of long-accepted international rules of behavior and a rejection of the canons of diplomatic practice. 
 To convert public opinion Roosevelt turned to the radio and the fireside chat. Mr. Obama has turned to text messaging and the Internet, the 21st-century equivalents. And just as Roosevelt benefited from his opponents' inability to exploit the radio effectively, Mr. Obama has been aided by a technologically inept Republican leadership. (When Roosevelt sought to challenge isolationist sentiment in the country, he shed his partisan mantle, putting Republicans like Henry L. Stimson and Frank Knox in his cabinet -- just as Mr. Obama has kept his predecessor's defense secretary, Robert Gates, on the job.)
 ''I have been so struck,'' King George VI wrote Roosevelt in June 1941, ''by the way you have led public opinion by allowing it to get ahead of you.'' To judge from his record thus far, President Obama seems to have decided that what worked for Roosevelt just might work for him, too.

HEADLINE: On Iraq Trip, Clinton Reassures a Nation Still Jittery After Recent Suicide Attacks

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived unannounced here on Saturday to reassure Iraqis that the United States will support them, even as it withdraws combat troops. But with Iraq reeling from a wave of suicide bombings, she got a jittery reception from a country that still plainly relies on the United States for security, stability and economic survival.
 In an encounter with Iraqi students, journalists and activists, she was peppered with questions about how the United States could help Iraq in ways large and small -- from restoring confidence in the Iraqi armed forces to supplying farmers with more up-to-date machinery. 
 Mrs. Clinton, making her first visit to Baghdad as secretary of state, promised to help. But, she told the audience of 120, there were some things Iraq had to do for itself.
 ''The more united Iraq is, the more you will trust the security services,'' she said in response to a question from a young Iraqi journalist. ''The security services have to earn your trust, but the people have to demand it.''
 Mrs. Clinton insisted that last week's suicide bombings, which killed 160 people and wounded hundreds more, did not mean that Iraq was slipping back into the sectarian violence that convulsed it two years ago.
 At her first stop here, Mrs. Clinton received a security briefing from the American commander in Iraq, Gen. Ray Odierno. ''His view is my view,'' she said, ''that these are tragic and terrible events, but they do not reflect any diversion from the security progress that has been made.''
 Appearing alongside Mrs. Clinton, Iraq's foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, said the attacks would not ''derail the government's determination to pursue plans to stabilize the country.''
 Mrs. Clinton, who had flown in from Kuwait on a military transport plane, was greeted by Mr. Zebari; the new American ambassador to Iraq, Christopher R. Hill; and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen. She was driven into the city in a heavily armed motorcade, though she did not wear an armored vest over her bright rose-colored jacket.
 Earlier, Mrs. Clinton described the violence as a last gasp. The attacks, she said, are ''in an unfortunately tragic way, a signal that the rejectionists fear that Iraq is going in the right direction.''
 Mrs. Clinton, who came to Iraq three times as a senator, said she was pleased to be back, but the attacks cast a shadow over her visit.
 While the violence is far below the worst levels in 2006, 18 major attacks this month have kindled fears that Baathist jihadist elements could be reconstituting themselves into a smaller, but still deadly, insurgency that will exploit the withdrawal of American troops between now and 2011.
 Mrs. Clinton compared these suicide bombings to a terrorist attack that occurred several months after the Good Friday peace accord ended years of conflict in Northern Ireland.
 At times, her analysis echoed that of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. Mr. Cheney spoke of the insurgency being in its ''last throes'' during a period of extreme violence; Mr. Rumsfeld talked of ''dead-enders'' who kept fighting a lost cause.
 Mr. Zebari said that Islamic militants came to Iraq from several Persian Gulf and North African countries. Iraqi forces, he added, were coordinating efforts with the United States so that when American troops departed, there would not be a dangerous vacuum.
 At least half the dead from the recent bombings were Iranian pilgrims, and on Saturday, Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blamed American troops for the killings.
 ''They have occupied an Islamic country claiming that they want to fight terrorism while tens of thousands of people are being killed and insecurity is on the rise,'' the ISNA news agency quoted him as saying.
 Mrs. Clinton brushed aside the charge, saying the attacks were ''clearly traced to the Al Qaeda remnants and other violent groups.'' Mr. Zebari also dismissed American involvement, though he expressed condolences to the families of the pilgrims, whom he described as ''soft targets,'' and he pledged to improve security.
 The violence did not curtail Mrs. Clinton's crowded schedule during her 14-hour visit. In addition to official meetings, she played host at a round table of Iraqi women -- something she had done in previous trips to Iraq. She roamed the stage at the town-hall-style event.
 This is a format that Mrs. Clinton mastered as a presidential candidate, and that, as secretary of state, she has used from South Korea to Belgium. But the audience in Baghdad seemed less dazzled by her celebrity than in those countries, and more worried about the American commitment.
 Among those questioning Mrs. Clinton was a human rights activist who asked whether the Obama administration, consumed by the economic crisis, had put Iraq on the back burner.
 ''Let me assure you, and repeat what President Obama said,'' she replied. ''We are committed to Iraq; we want to see a stable, sovereign, self-reliant Iraq.'' But, she added, there is a transition under way.
 Mr. Hill, the new ambassador, beat Mrs. Clinton to Baghdad by one day. 
 In Iraq, Mr. Hill will lead the shift in emphasis by the United States from military to civilian operations. Judging by the questions Mrs. Clinton received, he will be busy. When time at the meeting ran out on Saturday, she offered to listen to the pleas of Iraqis again on her next trip.
 ''Is that a promise?'' an Iraqi woman in the audience shouted. ''That's a promise,'' Mrs. Clinton replied.

HEADLINE: Moore's Law And the Law of More

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
It is not an exaggeration to say that the team that President Obama appointed to promote his green agenda is nothing short of outstanding -- a great combination of scientists and policy makers committed to building an energy economy that is efficient, clean and secure. Now there is only one vacancy left for him to fill. And it's one that only he can fill: Green President. Is he ready to do that job with the passion and fight that will be required to transform America's energy future? Hope so. Not sure yet. 
 Have no doubt, the president is off to a terrific start: His stimulus package will provide an incredible boost for all forms of renewable energy. The energy bill being drafted by House Democrats Henry Waxman and Ed Markey contains unprecedented incentives for energy efficiency and clean-tech innovation. And the ruling from Mr. Obama's Environmental Protection Agency saying that carbon dioxide is a pollutant that threatens public health was courageous and historic. 
 But while all of that is hugely important, we must not fool ourselves, as we have done for so many years: Price matters. Without a fixed, long-term, durable price on carbon, none of the Obama clean-tech initiatives will achieve the scale needed to have an impact on climate change or make America the leader it must be in the next great industrial revolution: E.T., or energy technology. At this stage, I'd settle for any carbon price mechanism -- cap and trade, fee-bates, carbon tax and/or gasoline tax -- as long as it real and provides consumers and investors a long-term incentive to shift to clean cars, appliances and buildings.
 Bob Lutz, a vice chairman at General Motors, offers a useful example of why price matters. When Congress demands that Detroit make smaller, lighter, better mileage vehicles, but then refuses to put a higher price on carbon -- like with a gasoline tax -- so more consumers will want to buy these smaller cars, said Lutz, it is the equivalent of ordering all American shirtmakers to make only size smalls while never asking the American people to go on a diet. You're not going to sell a lot of size smalls.
 Have no doubt: From right-wing tea parties to coal states to manufacturers, there is going to be a no-holds-barred campaign to kill any carbon price signal, including cap and trade. A vast army of lobbyists is already working against it. Only President Obama can blunt this. Only he has the platform for framing and elevating the issue properly and taking it to the American people with the passion and clarity needed to move the country. It will take more than one speech.
 Here's one way to start: ''My fellow Americans, I want to speak to you about a new economic law. You've heard of Moore's Law in information technology. I'd like to speak to you about the 'Law of More' in energy technology. Americans, Indians, Chinese, Africans, we all want more -- more comfort in our homes, more mobility in our lives, more technologies with which to innovate. But there is only one way all 6.3 billion of us can have more and not make this an unlivable planet, and that is by living our lives and running our businesses in more sustainable ways and properly accounting for it.
 ''Right now we're paying a huge price -- a tax -- for everyone trying to achieve more in an unsustainable way. But the 'More Tax' is not imposed by the U.S. government. It is a tax imposed by the market and will continue rising indefinitely as more and more people want more and more stuff. It will steadily drive up gasoline prices, home heating prices and factory electricity prices. But because this 'More Tax' is set by the market and not the government, many opponents contend that there's nothing to be done: 'Oh, $4.50 a gallon gasoline -- that's just the market at work. We can't do anything about that.' And then all that tax money out of your pocket goes to enrich oil companies and petro-dictators.
 ''My proposal is that today we fix a durable price on carbon-based fossil fuels, but set it to begin only in 2011, after we're out of this recession. Every home builder, air-conditioning manufacturer, gasoline refiner, carmaker will know that it's coming and will, I believe, immediately look for ways to profit from and invest in more energy efficient systems. Yes, the cost of gasoline or kilowatt hours will rise in the short term. But in the long term, your actual bills and expenses will go down because your car, appliances and factory will become steadily more productive and give you more power for less energy.
 ''I call it the 'Carbon Tax Cut.' You won't receive the dividend in the first week or month, but you will get it soon, and it will be a permanent tax cut, a gift that will keep on giving.
 ''So those are our choices, folks -- an escalating 'More Tax' forever, premised on immediate gratification and short-term thinking, or a 'Carbon Tax Cut' forever, which is exactly what you'll get from establishing a carbon price signal that shapes the market in favor of American interests and not those of our adversaries and competitors. If you're with me, write your member of Congress and senator today.''

HEADLINE: The Republican Bright Side: Lots of Room for Improvement

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
For Congressional Republicans, these first 100 days of the Obama administration must feel like 1,000.
 Driven deep into the minority, they have run up against a highly popular Democratic president and chafed under the rein of emboldened House and Senate Democrats. They have been marginalized, criticized and categorized as the Party of No. 
 They have groped for an effective strategy for countering President Obama, lacked a dominant message or messenger and had trouble breaking through even with themes that in the past might have resonated. On Friday, they officially lost a special House election in New York that by all rights they should have won. They are on the verge of being down 59 to 41 in the Senate, a whisker away from mathematical elimination from filibuster contention. 
 Only 614 more days until 2010 and a new Congress.
 ''In President Obama's first 100 days, we haven't found our voice,'' said Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the No. 3 Republican in the Senate. ''But in the first 100 days, we don't need to. He has the ball.''
 Like many others in his party, Mr. Alexander said he believed Republicans had recently steadied themselves after a rough start in the Obama era.
 Representative Adam H. Putnam of Florida, a former Republican House leader, said: ''It has been better in the last 20 days than in the first 80. We have struggled to find our footing in the new world order but have recovered.'' 
 Republicans point proudly to their ability to close ranks, noting that only three Senate Republicans backed the $787 billion economic stimulus measure (though they provided the crucial margin of victory) while not a single Republican voted for budgets approved by the House and Senate. They rightfully note that they have so far held the line against a measure that would ease union organizing in the workplace. 
 They say they are reconnecting with their core voters by emphasizing what they see as profligate Democratic spending. And they believe they are laying the groundwork for a comeback by putting themselves solidly on the right side of multiple issues in preparation for a public souring on the Democratic agenda on spending, health care, energy, etc.
 ''We are defining the debate and drawing contrasts and hopefully in most cases putting forward positive alternatives'' said Senator John Thune of South Dakota. ''That's what we are here to do.''
 But it is tough, Mr. Thune acknowledged, saying that Mr. Obama ''is riding a wave of popularity and the Democrats in Congress have a lot of running room with the American public.''
 It might even be tougher than tough. The fact is that the Republican Party, for the first time since 1995, has no power center in Washington. It controls not the White House, the Senate or the House. It is shut out.
 That power vacuum has led to competition among Republicans to find a leading figure for the party, a fight that one Republican strategist compared to warlords battling it out for supremacy. The contest has diffused the party's message, making it less coherent, and left the public wondering who is speaking for Congressional Republicans. Newt Gingrich or Eric Cantor? Mitch McConnell or Michael Steele? Dick Cheney or John A. Boehner? 
 And while Republicans were effective in banding together against the stimulus and the budget, they have splintered elsewhere, most embarrassingly on a now-defunct Democratic plan in the House to levy a huge tax on executive bonuses. 
 After Mr. Boehner, an Ohio Republican who is the House minority leader, heaped scorn on the plan, Republicans still split down the middle as dozens backed it out of fear of the political consequences of opposing a tax on executives who are seen by the public as having caused the economic crisis but still cashing in.
 Republicans have also sent mixed signals about how they intend to take on the president, initially blaming Congressional Democrats for leading him astray, then pouncing on Mr. Obama. Now, in the wake of strong new poll numbers, Republicans have expressed renewed willingness to work with Mr. Obama -- while simultaneously assailing his policies and suggesting he is soft on terrorism.
 The ultimate reality check for Congressional Republicans had to come Friday, when Scott Murphy, a Democrat, was declared the winner over James N. Tedisco, a Republican, in a House race in upstate New York.
 Though the seat was vacated by Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a Democrat, so she could accept a Senate appointment, Republicans had a 70,000-voter registration advantage. More important, the party out of power often wins these sorts of contests in the aftermath of national elections as voters experience buyer's remorse. Republicans had the more experienced candidate and went at the contest hard, only to come up short. It is likely to haunt the party and potentially depress candidate recruitment and fund-raising.
 But there are some glimmers of Republican relief on the horizon. Democrats are entering a difficult legislating phase when they will have to produce support for the details of health and energy measures. Democratic discomfort with the escalation in Afghanistan is becoming evident. Party divisions over whether to pursue Bush administration officials for the harsh treatment of terrorism detainees have yet to play out. And plans to protect health care legislation from Senate filibusters could cause all sorts of complications.
 ''They have their share of problems coming,'' said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, adding that ''the mood of the Republican caucus is pretty good.''
 Perhaps that is because Republicans figure the only direction is up.

HEADLINE: The Visible Man

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
-- Dick Cheney became a one-of-a-kind vice president for two reasons: he cared deeply about governance, and not a bit about his future political standing.
 Those same factors, for better or worse, have turned him into a one-of-a-kind former vice president. In a sharp break with long-standing practice, Mr. Cheney has emerged as the highest-profile critic of the new administration. 
 Repeatedly during Mr. Obama's transition and his first 100 days in office, Mr. Cheney has carried his anemic favorability rating into the ring to slug it out with a successor who enjoys considerable public support on issues from the role of the vice presidency to his trademark issue of national security. On the economy, he complained in a Fox News interview last week, ''There doesn't appear to be any limitation whatsoever in terms of the spending commitments that this administration wants to make.'' But if Mr. Cheney seems intent on vindicating decisions he helped shape during the two terms of the Bush presidency, some Republicans prefer that he join Mr. Bush in shunning the public spotlight. 
 ''Generally speaking Dick's voice is probably not going to move the ball forward,'' one prominent Republican, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said. Nonetheless, members of both parties say Mr. Cheney, with his tenacity and his insider's knowledge of government and politics, continues to influence the Washington debate.
 His role appears all the more striking because it defies normal tidal rhythms of presidential politics. Protocol decrees that when a new administration arrives the old one quietly departs and, at least for a while, defers to its successor by remaining inconspicuous. That pattern has generally held even through dramatic transitions of ideology and political style, as happened when the Democratic incumbent, Jimmy Carter, lost decisively to Ronald Reagan in 1981.
 In the first months of the Reagan Revolution, Mr. Carter and his vice president, Walter Mondale, ''never attacked us,'' Martin Anderson, the White House domestic policy chief under Mr. Reagan, recalled. Such etiquette flowed in no small measure from political realities. Mr. Reagan's decisive victory in 1980 made it clear that American voters wanted to turn the page.
 Former vice presidents often have other reasons for keeping quiet. Mr. Mondale was contemplating his own run for the White House and was intent on presenting himself as a viable candidate, rather than on defending the president he had served. The same held for other former vice presidents eying the presidency: Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, George H. W. Bush, Al Gore. 
 But Mr. Cheney is an altogether different case. No one expects another campaign from him, freeing him to speak his mind. ''If he were running for office he'd be tempered more by how it would appear,'' the presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin said. ''His main constituency right now is history.''
 Indeed, a lack of presidential ambition seems to have been a major reason George W. Bush selected Mr. Cheney as his running mate in the first place. It was clear from the beginning that Mr. Cheney -- with his history of heart trouble and advancing age -- was highly unlikely to seek the highest office. This made him, in theory at least, the ideal adviser to Mr. Bush, who was able to draw freely on Mr. Cheney's decades of expertise as a former White House chief of staff, leading member of Congress and defense secretary.
 Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, recalled that from the time he and Mr. Cheney entered the chamber together, in 1979, ''The No. 1 thing that has driven him his whole career is national security.''
 Eight years later, Mr. Cheney, the ranking Republican on the Congressional committee that investigated the Iran-contra scandal, helped prepare a report that signaled his expansive view of presidential prerogatives.
 After the 9/11 attacks, Mr. Cheney's influence in the Bush administration became even greater. He had been, after all, the defense secretary during the first gulf war. Mr. Bush, who took office in 2001 with virtually no experience in foreign policy, relied increasingly on Mr. Cheney's judgment, which, whatever its other virtues or defects, seemed uncolored by personal political ambition. Reminded last year in a television interview that most Americans considered the Iraq war not worth fighting, Mr. Cheney responded, ''So?''
 ''It didn't bother him about being unpopular,'' said Mr. Graham, who during the Bush administration challenged Mr. Cheney's stance on treatment of terror suspects. ''He almost wore that as a badge of courage.''
 In Mr. Graham's view Mr. Cheney's defiance was ''a weakness'' that undercut the Bush's administration's ability to lead. On most issues, Mr. Graham said, he would prefer that Mr. Cheney avoid speaking out so that Republicans might cultivate ''new voices and new faces.''
 But on the issue of terror investigations, which dominated last week's headlines, more than the others, Mr. Cheney remains a commanding figure on the right. Mr. Cheney's defense of brutal interrogation techniques like waterboarding still resonates for many within his party. And by leading the counterattack, Mr. Cheney ''relieves Republicans of the newer generation from having to fight old fights,'' said Ed Gillespie, a former Bush White House official and Republican National chairman.
 Mr. Graham credits Mr. Cheney with causing the normally steady new president to wobble on his stance concerning a possible Congressional inquiry into the Bush's administration's handling of terror suspects. After Mr. Cheney called publicly for declassification of memos he contends show the benefits of ''enhanced techniques,'' Mr. Obama took a tougher line against an investigation, though he earlier appeared to have left the door open for one.
 At the same time, Mr. Cheney's talent for polarization works both ways. His aggressive defense of the Bush administration has energized the Democrats.
 ''He's the least popular public figure in the country,'' said Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the target of an expletive from Mr. Cheney on the Senate floor several years ago. ''The more he talks, the more people say, you've got to get to the bottom of this.''
 Some veterans of the Bush White House say Mr. Cheney had little choice but to speak out given the barbs directed his way by Mr. Obama, who -- in a pointed rejoinder to the Bush administration's interrogation policies -- said, ''we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.'' 
 And there is also the matter of history. Mr. Cheney's vocal defense of the national security policies he did so much to create seems to reflect his determination to retain a measure of control over the narrative of the Bush years, though in fact Mr. Bush himself began to reassess Mr. Cheney and his counsel. In his second term, Mr. Bush leaned more heavily on the advice of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He also dismissed Mr. Cheney's longtime colleague Donald Rumsfeld as defense secretary. And -- in a direct blow to Mr. Cheney -- Mr. Bush declined to pardon his onetime chief of staff, I. Lewis (Scooter) Libby Jr., after Mr. Libby was convicted of lying to a grand jury and to F.B.I. agents investigating the leak of the identity of a C.I.A. operative. 
 ''Dick's a true believer,'' said Thomas Cronin, a political scientist at Colorado College who has known Mr. Cheney since both began their careers in Washington four decades ago. In some ways, Mr. Cronin added, ''He has more vested interest in this than George W. Bush.''
 Which raises the question of what Mr. Bush, who reiterated just last month that Mr. Obama ''deserves my silence,'' makes of his vice president's volubility. According to former aides, Mr. Bush had not asked Mr. Cheney to speak up.
 And this, in turn, suggests that Mr. Cheney's agenda is his own. Mr. Mondale, himself a vice president in an unpopular administration, speculated that Mr. Cheney's combative stance stems from ''an obsession'' with the unfettered use of executive authority for national security. ''After 9/11, they took the gloves off,'' Mr. Mondale said. ''He just can't let it go.''
 Mr. Mondale, who knows a good deal about the complex relationships between chief executives and their understudies, suspects Mr. Bush, unlike his combative vice president, is prepared to move on. ''I wonder whether Bush, at this point in his life, wants to be defined by Cheney's attitudes,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 3, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about former Vice President Dick Cheney's new role as defender of the Bush years and critic of the Obama administration misstated the name of his former chief of staff. He is I. Lewis (Scooter) Libby Jr., not Lewis I. (Scooter) Libby.

HEADLINE: Obama Calls on Congress to Offset Spending Hikes with Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Saying that the government must act ''the same way any responsible family does in setting its budget,'' President Obama called for Congress to pass legislation that would require lawmakers to offset any new tax cuts or spending increases with equivalent tax increases or spending cuts. 
 The legislation, dubbed ''PAYGO,'' for ''pay as you go,'' has become a rallying cry for fiscally conservative Democrats, who are pushing for it to be applied to the health care reform legislation that the White House is hoping will pass this year. But speaking in his weekly address to the nation on Saturday, Mr. Obama said that he wanted it applied more broadly.
''We need to adhere to the basic principle that new tax or entitlement policies should be paid for,'' the president said. ''This principle -- known as PAYGO -- helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s. Now, we must restore that sense of fiscal discipline.''
 Mr. Obama has spent the first three months in office presiding over a huge burst of federal spending. His economic recovery bill will cost taxpayers $787 billion, and the government is pumping another $700 billion into the economy to keep shaky financial institutions stable. Now, the president is turning his attention to the other side of the budget equation: cutting the deficit.
 ''All across America , families are tightening their belts and making hard choices,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Now, Washington must show that same sense of responsibility.''
 But Mr. Obama's efforts to show fiscal responsibility have so far brought derision from some budget analysts and many Republicans. On Monday, the president used the first Cabinet meeting of his presidency to challenge department heads and agencies to trim $100 million from their budgets over the next 90 days. Analysts said it was the equivalent of asking a family that spent $40,000 a year to cut $1 from its budget.
 On Saturday, Mr. Obama used his address to defend the effort and to return to the fiscal-discipline theme. While his initiatives to stabilize the economy may be driving up the federal deficit, he noted that he had also inherited a hefty deficit, estimated at $1.3 trillion this year, from his predecessor, former President George W. Bush. Mr. Obama also said his administration had ''identified $2 trillion in deficit reductions over the next decade.''
 That $2 trillion figure, however, is widely scorned by budget analysts. Three quarters of the ''reductions'' Mr. Obama cited reflect assumptions that the nation would have as many troops in Iraq in 10 years as it does now, even though Mr. Obama has committed to a further drawdown of forces and Mr. Bush signed an agreement with Baghdad before leaving office that would result in the withdrawal of all American forces in three years.
 In his address, Mr. Obama also pledged to look for budget-cutting ideas ''from the bottom up,'' saying he would establish a process through which every government worker could submit ideas on how to save money. And he offered an incentive for workers to participate, saying he would meet later this year with those who came up with the best ideas.

HEADLINE: Chrysler and Union Agree to a Deal

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY and BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Union leaders said Sunday that they had reached an agreement with Chrysler that meets federal requirements for the automaker to receive more financing.
The deal includes Fiat, the Italian automaker with which Chrysler was ordered by the government to form an alliance before Thursday.
Neither the United Automobile Workers union nor the company released details of the tentative agreement, which would modify the union's 2007 contract and reduce the amount of money Chrysler must pay into a new health fund for retirees. 
The union plans to have its 26,000 Chrysler workers vote on the deal by Wednesday.
Chrysler said the agreement, reached during marathon negotiations over the weekend, satisfied the requirements laid out by the Obama administration for a deal by an April 30 deadline.
Even with the agreement, Chrysler is expected to seek Chapter 11 protection, in a case mapped out by the government in advance, including safeguards meant to protect worker benefits, people with knowledge of the company's plans said Sunday night.
A new company would be set up with the best assets of Chrysler, these people said. Fiat of Italy would own 20 percent to 35 percent of the new Chrysler, they said, with the government also holding a stake. Some of the equity in the new company would also be given to Chrysler's creditors as repayment.
These people spoke on condition of anonymity because the deals had not been finalized.
The Treasury Department has also reached an agreement with Daimler of Germany, the former owner of Chrysler, to settle tax and other claims left over from its sale of Chrysler in 2007 to Cerberus Capital Management, the private equity firm.
In order to persuade the union to back the sale to Cerberus, Daimler agreed to pay $1 billion to Chrysler if the company's pension plans were terminated in a subsequent bankruptcy filing. Details of the Treasury's deal with Daimler were not available.
Last week, the union reached an agreement in principle with the administration and Chrysler that would protect workers' pensions in the event of a bankruptcy filing and provide for a change in the financing of a health care trust set up in 2007.
Under that pension deal, workers would lose some benefits after the bankruptcy filing but would receive more protection than they would with a Chapter 11 filing that lacked government direction, people with knowledge of the agreement said.
Chrysler, which has received $4 billion in federal loans, is in the final stages of a reorganization process ordered by the government, which includes a mandate to provide financing for half of all union retiree health care using company stock.
In a statement Sunday night, Chrysler said the union agreement ''provides the framework needed to ensure manufacturing competitiveness and helps to meet the guidelines set forth by the U.S. Treasury Department.''
Meanwhile, the Canadian Automobile Workers union said Sunday that its members had ratified a cost-cutting deal covering 8,000 Chrysler workers in that country. The deal, which is expected to lead to similar cuts for Canadian workers at General Motors and Ford Motor, cuts workers' benefits, reduces time off and creates a health care trust for retirees.
The union said 87 percent of its members voted in favor of the deal, even though the union's president, Ken Lewenza, described the negotiation process as ''torturous and unfair.''
G.M. is set to unveil a revised revamping plan on Monday.
The union deals increase pressure on Chrysler's lenders to come to an agreement to reduce the automaker's $6.9 billion in secured debt. The lenders, a group of banks and private funds led by JPMorgan Chase, are still in talks with Treasury officials over terms of a debt-for-equity exchange to eliminate at least two-thirds of the debt.
Talks between the government and the lenders have picked up in recent days, with four proposals having passed between them. While a gap remains over how much the creditors should be repaid -- as of Sunday, the two sides were about $2.25 billion apart -- it has shrunk over the last two weeks.
In February, Chrysler said bankruptcy would most likely result in the liquidation of the company. But since then, the company has signaled that it could file for bankruptcy protection without having to shut down.
''My sense is that it's not liquidation, that it would be a reorganization,'' a Detroit-area Chrysler dealer, Carl Galeana, said Sunday. ''I just think a shutdown of a corporation this size, in this economy, would be devastating.''

HEADLINE: It's No Time for Hysteria Over the New Flu

BYLINE: By SUSAN DOMINUS. 
E-mail: susan.dominus@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Nobody panic. The government may be spending its last dime on the bailout package, but it's apparently filthy rich with stockpiles of Tamiflu. We've been told that officials can mobilize ventilators on the turn of a dime (which is supposed to be reassuring). And the cases of swine flu confirmed at St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens appear, so far, to be relatively mild. 
 Besides, it's not as if there aren't guidelines on how to handle even scarier outbreaks of influenza than this one. Consider ''Preparing for Pandemic Avian Flu: Family and Neighborhood Readiness Workbook,'' published in 2006 by Joe and Rita Sterling, a couple whose vague online biography says that they have been ''guiding corporations and communities to succeed for nearly two decades.'' (Avian flu, which can be deadly in humans, is different from the H1N1 swine flu now causing illnesses from Mexico to St. Francis, but it's interesting reading nonetheless.) 
 ''What if there is lawlessness?'' asks a hypothetical question in the 150-page book. ''I need to protect my family and myself. What are essential safety items to have?'' The authors note that this is ''a very personal question, of course'' (of course!), and advise neighborhoods to start having group conversations about it ahead of time. 
 ''Someone in your neighborhood will surely ask about firearms.'' (Surely!) Collaboration reduces fear and stress, the Sterlings advise, before going on to list the ''minimum'' items for a safety kit: duct tape, work gloves and a cellphone, among them. Also ''hatchet/ax,'' ''deterrents (Mace, pepper spray, whistle, etc.),'' and, oh yeah, ''a folding shovel.'' In your car you'll want an air horn, a deck of cards (there's only so much fun you can have eating a year's worth of canned goods) and a Taser. 
 Who would have thought that swine flu might be just the comeback opportunity Rudy Giuliani has been waiting for? 
 Actually, it's the star of Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, New York City's health commissioner, that has the most potential to rise. Until now, Dr. Frieden has been known mostly as the data-collecting head of the city's vice squad, the vices being smoking, trans fats and sodium, all of which Dr. Frieden has attacked through either legislation or persuasion (some food industry types would say bullying). 
 Critics say that he's been overly aggressive in trying to dictate behavior, and that his approach to the diabetes crisis invades patients' privacy. Fans say he's merely passionate and gets results. (They also like that he has kept a bowl full of condoms in his reception area.)
 At a news conference this weekend to address the outbreak of influenza at St. Francis, potentially the same swine flu that has killed more than 80 people in Mexico, Dr. Frieden appeared the kind of figurehead people crave in a crisis. 
 Calm, confidence-inspiring and transmitting compassion even for those who were overtaxing Queens hospitals with mild flu symptoms, he exhibited evident concern about the situation -- but a mild strain of concern, suggesting the current situation was nothing New York's hospitals and leaders couldn't handle. Instead of spending all that energy learning Spanish, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg might think about spending some time studying Dr. Frieden's bedside manner (as for Spanish, Dr. Frieden is fluent).
 Dr. Frieden has been a teacher, an epidemiologist and, according to his official Web site, a community organizer, that newly golden political credential. Mayor Bloomberg, a titan of finance, came to power when the city was rolling in money. Dr. Frieden, who toiled in India for five years combating tuberculosis, might be the kind of leader who stands out in a new New York, a New York that looks beyond money as its core value (if only because it no longer has any). 
 The prospect of a flu pandemic could make anyone nostalgic for the good old days when our biggest worries were rising gas prices and China's seemingly unstoppable growth. Actually, a book like ''Preparing for Pandemic Avian Flu'' could make anyone nostalgic for the good old days when our biggest worries were a global financial meltdown, high unemployment and entire neighborhoods inhabited by squatters.
 For those inclined to big-picture angst, the weather hasn't helped. By Sunday, it was hot enough to raise inevitable questions of global warming. Would rising sea levels and widespread flooding soon enough make us all nostalgic for the good old days when all we had to worry about was swine flu? 
 You know what I really miss? Y2K.

HEADLINE: G.E.'s Breakthrough Can Put 100 DVDs on a Disc

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
General Electric says it has achieved a breakthrough in digital storage technology that will allow standard-size discs to hold the equivalent of 100 DVDs.
 The storage advance, which G.E. is announcing on Monday, is just a laboratory success at this stage. The new technology must be made to work in products that can be mass-produced at affordable prices. 
 But optical storage experts and industry analysts who were told of the development said it held the promise of being a big step forward in digital storage with a wide range of potential uses in commercial, scientific and consumer markets. 
 ''This could be the next generation of low-cost storage,'' said Richard Doherty, an analyst at Envisioneering, a technology research firm.
 The promising work by the G.E. researchers is in the field of holographic storage. Holography is an optical process that stores not only three-dimensional images like the ones placed on many credit cards for security purposes, but the 1's and 0's of digital data as well. 
 The data is encoded in light patterns that are stored in light-sensitive material. The holograms act like microscopic mirrors that refract light patterns when a laser shines on them, and so each hologram's recorded data can then be retrieved and deciphered.
 Holographic storage has the potential to pack data far more densely than conventional optical technology, used in DVDs and the newer, high-capacity Blu-ray discs, in which information is stored as a pattern of laser-etched marks across the surface of a disc. The potential of holographic technology has long been known. The first research papers were published in the early 1960s. 
 Many advances have been made over the years in the materials science, optics and applied physics needed to make holographic storage a practical, cost-effective technology. And this year, InPhase Technologies, a spinoff of Bell Labs of Alcatel-Lucent, plans to introduce a holographic storage system, using $18,000 machines and expensive discs, for specialized markets like video production and storing medical images.
 To date, holographic storage has not been on a path to mainstream use. The G.E. development, however, could be that pioneering step, according to analysts and experts. The G.E. researchers have used a different approach than past efforts. It relies on smaller, less complex holograms -- a technique called microholographic storage. 
 A crucial challenge for the team, which has been working on this project since 2003, has been to find the materials and techniques so that smaller holograms reflect enough light for their data patterns to be detected and retrieved. 
 The recent breakthrough by the team, working at the G.E. lab in Niskayuna, N.Y., north of Albany, was a 200-fold increase in the reflective power of their holograms, putting them at the bottom range of light reflections readable by current Blu-ray machines.
 ''We're in the ballpark,'' said Brian Lawrence, the scientist who leads G.E.'s holographic storage program. ''We've crossed the threshold so we're readable.'' 
 In G.E.'s approach, the holograms are scattered across a disc in a way that is similar to the formats used in today's CDs, conventional DVDs and Blu-ray discs. So a player that could read microholographic storage discs could also read CD, DVD and Blu-ray discs. But holographic discs, with the technology G.E. has attained, could hold 500 gigabytes of data. Blu-ray is available in 25-gigabyte and 50-gigabyte discs, and a standard DVD holds 5 gigabytes.
 ''If this can really be done, then G.E.'s work promises to be a huge advantage in commercializing holographic storage technology,'' said Bert Hesselink, a professor at Stanford and an expert in the field.
 The G.E. team plans to present its research data and lab results at an optical data storage conference in Orlando next month. 
 Yet, analysts say, the feasibility of G.E.'s technology remains unproved and the economics uncertain. ''It's always well to remember that the most important technical specification in any storage device, however impressive the science behind it, is price,'' said James N. Porter, an independent analyst of the storage market.
 When Blu-ray was introduced in late 2006, a 25-gigabyte disc cost nearly $1 a gigabyte, though it is about half that now. G.E. expects that when they are introduced, perhaps in 2011 or 2012, holographic discs using its technology will be less than 10 cents a gigabyte -- and fall in the future.
 ''The price of storage per gigabyte is going to drop precipitously,'' Mr. Lawrence said.
 G.E. will first focus on selling the technology to commercial markets like movie studios, television networks, medical researchers and hospitals for holding data-intensive images like Hollywood films and brain scans. But selling to the broader corporate and consumer market is the larger goal.
 To do that, G.E. will have to work with partners to license its holographic storage technology and expertise, and the company is already talking with major electronics and optical storage producers, said Bill Kernick, who leads G.E.'s technology sales unit. The holographic research was originally related to G.E.'s plastics business, which it sold two years ago to the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation for $11.6 billion.

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Ever-Changing Art Of Financial Forecasting

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
General Motors is expected to announce on Monday its third new business plan of the last four months, detailing further plant closings and plans to eliminate its Pontiac brand.
 One reason the target keeps shifting is the difficulty in trying to predict the direction of the overall car market in the next few years. 
 For G.M. and other automakers, everything in their business plans flows from assumptions about the market, which determine the number of plants that must be closed, the number of jobs that must be shed, the amount of money a company will need to restructure and the amount that creditors can expect to receive. 
 In today's economic climate, trying to forecast the car market is not easy, even for people who make their living at it. ''There's a lot of variability out there,'' said Ron Pinelli, the president of Autodata Inc., which tracks industry statistics.
 G.M. has a history of making forecasts that later proved to be too optimistic, a pattern that contributed to the ouster by the Obama administration of G.M.'s former chief, Rick Wagoner.
 Already, for example, the worst-case sales forecast that G.M. predicted in December has become its working assumption. 
 People with knowledge of the company's planning say that figure is expected to drop again, especially since G.M. announced deep production cuts last week. 
 On March 30, G.M. told the Treasury Department that it expected industry sales this year of 10.5 million vehicles, and that sales could drop to 9.5 million under the worst of conditions. (The industry sold 13.8 million vehicles in 2008, an 18 percent decline from 2007.)
 That 10.5 million figure was what G.M. predicted as its worst-case situation on Dec. 2, when its expectations were that American auto sales for the industry in 2009 would be 12 million vehicles. 
 Now, its new forecast might be closer to 10 million vehicles, say people familiar with its plans. 
 That is two million less than its working assumption in December, and 3.8 million fewer cars and trucks than the industry sold in 2008.
 G.M. officials declined to comment on their new projections. 
 ''Until we have a formal viability plan filed with the government, it's not something we want to discuss in any detail,'' John McDonald, a G.M. spokesman, said last week.
 The only agreement among industry analysts is that sales this year will be dismal. Autodata predicts auto sales in the United States this year will reach 10.5 million, the same as G.M. 
 Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car buying advice, predicts the market will be around 10.8 million sales this year, while Brian Johnson, a veteran analyst with Barclays Capital, expects sales of 11 million vehicles. Any of the forecasts would make this year the worst in nearly three decades.
 Last month, Treasury hired the Boston Consulting Group to prepare its own market forecast for the next few years.
 David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, said automakers had been surprised at how dismal the car market had been, despite efforts by the administration to make credit more widely available. 
 ''Nobody has realized how deep this trough has been,'' Mr. Cole said. ''There are forces at play that make it almost impossible to predict where this thing is headed.''
 Given G.M.'s track record, Mr. Cole said it might be wise for the company to underestimate the car market, sending a signal to the administration that it has learned its lesson. 
 ''It is a lot better to exceed a forecast,'' he said, ''than not live up to it.''
 Plotting G.M.'s future may force forecasters to become far more creative. For years, auto companies have based their projections on reliable economic data, like employment, consumer sentiment, housing starts and the rate at which consumers were scrapping old vehicles.
 But erratic fuel prices and the economic crisis have made it difficult to rely on statistics that were accurate in the past, said Mr. Pinelli of Autodata.
 ''Since time began, forecasting methods didn't change -- now, change is a given,'' he said. For G.M., ''a lot has happened since December.''

HEADLINE: After 43 Years, a French Town's Nostalgia for Harry and Joe Lingers

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: CHATEAUROUX, France 

 BODY:
More than 40 years ago the American military left this town in central France, but Harry and Joe stayed on.
 The two Americans had been here because France was a member of NATO and Chateauroux housed the largest American base in Europe, a huge supply center and aircraft repair unit with about 8,000 Americans and 3,000 French civilian employees -- cooks, chauffeurs, barbers, accountants, carpenters. 
 But in 1966 de Gaulle decided that France, which had survived two world wars with the help of soldiers from Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States, could stand on its own militarily, so he withdrew France from the military side of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and told the Americans to leave. 
 For many here in Chateauroux of the older generation, the years at the NATO base were the good old days, with well-paying jobs plentiful at the base and splotches of color -- as off-duty Americans sported Hawaiian shirts and tooled around in their brightly colored Chevrolets and Oldsmobiles -- in the dreary grayness of postwar France. About 450 weddings were celebrated between American servicemen and Frenchwomen in City Hall. 
 Of course, not everyone welcomed the Americans. Communists and Socialists regularly smeared walls with ''U.S. Go Home.'' But now, as President Nicolas Sarkozy leads France back into the bosom of NATO, some are wondering hopefully whether those years might be coming back.
 If the Americans returned, ''it would not disturb me,'' said Sophie Bara, a woman in her 40s who works for a government agency, understatement marking her voice. ''They're talking about it.''
 Even today, however, the Americans are not entirely gone. In January, 1952, Joseph Gagne, a native of Augusta, Me., who had landed on the Normandy beaches, got wind of the plans to build a base here. So together with his French wife, Jeanine, he opened a hamburger restaurant, Joe from Maine, in narrow Rue Ledru Rollin. Joe died this month at the age of 86 in a local hospital, but his daughter Annette still serves up hamburgers, hot dogs and Tex-Mex dishes six days a week.
 ''The customers are now French, though G.I.'s who served on the base back then continue to come back, or their children,'' said Annette, entertaining a visitor between meals under a faux-Tiffany lamp that read, ''Schlitz on Tap.'' ''When Dad opened in January of 1952 the French didn't know what a hamburger was,'' said Annette. ''We made our own ketchup; we got spices on the base.'' 
 Beneath the restaurant is a vaulted stone cellar, about 30 square feet, now used for storage, where American airmen once quaffed endless amounts of beer, chain smoked and danced with French girlfriends. The vaulting is covered with their carved names. ''Benny. Tom. Fagan.''
 Harry leaves an even bigger mark on the city. In the 1960s a local entrepreneur, Paul Picard, the owner of a baked goods business, was impressed by the strange square white bread that the American servicemen ate. Like other Frenchmen accustomed to long, crusty baguettes, Mr. Picard had never seen anything like it, yet he thought it offered possibilities.
 So he visited bakeries in the United States to learn how it was baked, then returned to France where he essentially re-engineered Wonder Bread. To give it an American flair, he called it Harry's American Bread and decorated the packaging with the stars and stripes of the American flag. No one can say who Harry was, probably just a name that sounded American.
 Though the base closed too soon for Mr. Picard to sell his bread there, it soon became a hit with the French. Now Harry's huge baking plant outside Chateauroux bakes about 130 million loaves of white bread and other bakery products a year. That is about one-third of what Harry's produces at other plants scattered across France. Its six bakeries spread across France make it the largest producer of packaged baked goods in the country. 
 Mr. Picard is now retired to a chateau in the region, where he collects vintage racing cars; his company is owned by an Italian food multinational. But the factory here with its 400 employees, plus another across town, makes Harry's the second largest employer in the region. The leader, an auto parts company, is shedding jobs fast because of the auto industry slump, so Harry's will soon be No. 1.
 ''He was a visionary,'' said Jacques Laurent, 42, the plant manager, describing Mr. Picard. White sandwich bread, he concedes, is ''secondary in France,'' where only about 7 percent of the bread market is sliced sandwich bread. ''The French eat baguettes,'' he said. Still Harry's continues to churn out new products, many with an American flair, like Doo Wop, a snack for kids, and a crustless white bread for children who won't eat the crust. Harry's bakes hamburger rolls for Quick, a local competitor of McDonald's, though not for Joe From Maine, which bakes its own. 
 Chateauroux, with its 66,000 people, has never been in a league with Paris, Versailles or Chartres. It has some charming back streets but no soaring cathedral, and its oldest church, St. Martial, is opened to visitors only by appointment. Its modern town hall has the charm of an automobile inspection station. When the writer Edith Wharton visited Chateauroux while touring France in 1906 she described it as ''undeniably disappointing.''
 Still, in recent years the rising tide of the French economy lifted Chateauroux, and now the crisis threatens to shake it. The city's mayor, Jean-Francois Mayet, muses about what the return of a NATO base might bring. The landing strips built by the Americans in 1951 are still there, and Chateauroux's airport does some business with freight, aircraft repair, pilot training and charter flights. 
 ''Let them come, though things are no longer the same,'' Mr. Mayet said. ''The presence of the airport could be useful. There is a place for the Americans to come to.''
 For others, though, the American period will always remain the golden age. Last year, Michel Blanchandin, 74, who worked on the American base straight from school operating an I.B.M. punch card machine, gathered with about 150 other former employees to form an association, to keep alive the memory of those years. Some members still drive old Chevrolets, Mustangs and Cadillacs.
 Could the Americans return? ''No,'' he said, ''the context is not the same. There is no cold war.'' He thought a moment, then added, ''If they came, we'd welcome them.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 4, 2009

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the Chateauroux Journal article last Monday, about the American influence in Chateauroux, France, formerly the site of the largest American military base in postwar Europe, misstated the size of a stone cellar that once housed a dance hall beneath the Joe from Maine hamburger restaurant, founded by an American G.I. and his French wife. It is 30 feet square -- meaning 30 feet by 30 feet -- and not 30 square feet, which would be far less.

HEADLINE: Are Americans Just Villagers at Heart?

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''Small-Town Big Spending,'' by Tom Brokaw (Op-Ed, April 20): 
 Mr. Brokaw is right to call for a thorough rethinking of anachronistic local-government structures. The fundamental geographic unit of the 21st century is the metropolitan area. New forms of governance must reflect this shift. 
 Metropolitan areas -- tightly linked collections of cities, suburbs and townships -- are the engines of American prosperity. They house about 80 percent of the United States population and account for almost 90 percent of the G.D.P. We need metropolitan-scale governance to address global competitiveness, climate change and poverty reduction, all of which transcend local boundaries. 
 Places like greater Denver, Louisville and Portland have developed transportation and land-use strategies that reflect the true metropolitan scope of economic and social life. States and the federal government must support these and other collaborative efforts by changing laws and rules that split metropolitan areas apart. 
 Bruce Katz Jennifer Bradley Washington, April 20, 2009
 The writers are, respectively, the director and a senior research associate for the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program.
 To the Editor:
 We should not just accept the idea that consolidation leads to cost savings. 
 While we do have a lot of governments -- more than 75,000, not including school districts -- I have seen no empirical evidence that the number of units raises the cost of government. In fact, much of the research shows that large government units (for populations greater than 250,000) have diseconomies of scale that make them both inefficient and costly.
 Robert Yehl Sanford, Fla., April 20, 2009
 The writer is the city manager of Sanford, Fla., and is writing a dissertation about fragmentation and the cost of government in the Dallas and Houston metropolitan area.
 To the Editor:
 Tom Brokaw argues that consolidating small municipalities into larger units would save money. Unfortunately, it doesn't always work that way.
 In New Jersey, we have found that small municipalities spend no more per capita than larger places. That's because they just don't provide the same level of services.
 Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago have reported that metropolitan areas with a multitude of small governmental units actually have lower costs than those with fewer, but larger, communities. In smaller units, public services can be tailored to the needs and desires of the inhabitants, instead of being provided where they may not really be wanted.
 Only when public services are offered at a relatively uniform level as in school districts do the economies of scale become effective in reducing costs.
 Ernest C. Reock Jr. Kendall Park, N.J., April 20, 2009 The writer was director of the Center for Government Services at Rutgers University. 
 To the Editor: 
 Tom Brokaw's article raises important issues on how states, specifically New York, must work more closely with local governments to administer services more efficiently and cost-effectively. Gov. David A. Paterson shares that concern and was very supportive of the creation of the New York State Commission on Local Government Efficiency and Competitiveness in 2007. 
 But Mr. Brokaw states that only a few of the recommendations of the commission will survive. 
 All but 2 of the more than 30 recommendations have been advanced in some form. Through the state's Local Government Efficiency Program, we are working with local governments to reduce the cost and complexity of services. In 2008, local governments projected a savings of one-quarter billion dollars from a $27 million state investment in 139 projects over the last two years. 
 We are working with school districts across the state to help consolidate their back-office and support services. And we've developed municipal health insurance cooperatives that are starting to show real prospects of cost savings. 
 An important goal of the Paterson administration is to reduce our local property tax burdens and ensure that all New Yorkers are receiving value from their tax dollars; the continued commitment to carrying out the recommendations made by the commission will help make certain that this happens.
 Lorraine Cortes-Vazquez Secretary of State Albany, April 23, 2009
 To the Editor:
 There is a problem with consolidation of local governments. Affluent towns would never allow poorer, neighboring towns to have schools that were as good as their own because property values would adjust accordingly.
 Consolidation would be defeated as it became less about saving costs as a larger community and more about protecting one's own.
 Laura DiMambro Newton, Mass., April 20, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I am concerned about the inevitable loss of mid-level jobs that would accompany consolidation of local governments.
 Before we start downsizing, we should have plans in place to help laid-off workers find new jobs. 
 Joanne O. Hamilton Brookhaven, N.Y., April 20, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Local institutions mean participatory democracy. 
 Why are ''Washington'' and ''inside the Beltway'' such epithets? Why are the names of capitals -- Albany, Trenton, Tallahassee -- spat out like curses?
 Sometimes inefficiency is the price we pay for democracy.
 Rebecca Schlam Lutto West Palm Beach, Fla., April 20, 2009

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Computer Program to Take On 'Jeopardy!'

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: YORKTOWN HEIGHTS, N.Y. 

 BODY:
This highly successful television quiz show is the latest challenge for artificial intelligence. 
 What is ''Jeopardy''? 
 That is correct. 
 I.B.M. plans to announce Monday that it is in the final stages of completing a computer program to compete against human ''Jeopardy!'' contestants. If the program beats the humans, the field of artificial intelligence will have made a leap forward.
 I.B.M. scientists previously devised a chess-playing program to run on a supercomputer called Deep Blue. That program beat the world champion Garry Kasparov in a controversial 1997 match (Mr. Kasparov called the match unfair and secured a draw in a later one against another version of the program). 
 But chess is a game of limits, with pieces that have clearly defined powers. ''Jeopardy!'' requires a program with the suppleness to weigh an almost infinite range of relationships and to make subtle comparisons and interpretations. The software must interact with humans on their own terms, and fast. 
 Indeed, the creators of the system -- which the company refers to as Watson, after the I.B.M. founder, Thomas J. Watson Sr. -- said they were not yet confident their system would be able to compete successfully on the show, on which human champions typically provide correct responses 85 percent of the time. 
 ''The big goal is to get computers to be able to converse in human terms,'' said the team leader, David A. Ferrucci, an I.B.M. artificial intelligence researcher. ''And we're not there yet.'' 
 The team is aiming not at a true thinking machine but at a new class of software that can ''understand'' human questions and respond to them correctly. Such a program would have enormous economic implications.
 Despite more than four decades of experimentation in artificial intelligence, scientists have made only modest progress until now toward building machines that can understand language and interact with humans.
 The proposed contest is an effort by I.B.M. to prove that its researchers can make significant technical progress by picking ''grand challenges'' like its early chess foray. The new bid is based on three years of work by a team that has grown to 20 experts in fields like natural language processing, machine learning and information retrieval.
 Under the rules of the match that the company has negotiated with the ''Jeopardy!'' producers, the computer will not have to emulate all human qualities. It will receive questions as electronic text. The human contestants will both see the text of each question and hear it spoken by the show's host, Alex Trebek.
 The computer will respond with a synthesized voice to answer questions and to choose follow-up categories. I.B.M. researchers said they planned to move a Blue Gene supercomputer to Los Angeles for the contest. To approximate the dimensions of the challenge faced by the human contestants, the computer will not be connected to the Internet, but will make its answers based on text that it has ''read,'' or processed and indexed, before the show.
 There is some skepticism among researchers in the field about the effort. ''To me it seems more like a demonstration than a grand challenge,'' said Peter Norvig, a computer scientist who is director of research at Google. ''This will explore lots of different capabilities, but it won't change the way the field works.'' 
 The I.B.M. researchers and ''Jeopardy!'' producers said they were considering what form their cybercontestant would take and what gender it would assume. One possibility would be to use an animated avatar that would appear on a computer display.
 ''We've only begun to talk about it,'' said Harry Friedman, the executive producer of ''Jeopardy!'' ''We all agree that it shouldn't look like Robby the Robot.'' 
 Mr. Friedman added that they were also thinking about whom the human contestants should be and were considering inviting Ken Jennings, the ''Jeopardy!'' contestant who won 74 consecutive times and collected $2.52 million in 2004.
 I.B.M. will not reveal precisely how large the system's internal database would be. The actual amount of information could be a significant fraction of the Web now indexed by Google, but artificial intelligence researchers said that having access to more information would not be the most significant key to improving the system's performance.
 Eric Nyberg, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon University, is collaborating with I.B.M. on research to devise computing systems capable of answering questions that are not limited to specific topics. The real difficulty, Dr. Nyberg said, is not searching a database but getting the computer to understand what it should be searching for.
 The system must be able to deal with analogies, puns, double entendres and relationships like size and location, all at lightning speed.
 In a demonstration match here at the I.B.M. laboratory against two researchers recently, Watson appeared to be both aggressive and competent, but also made the occasional puzzling blunder.
 For example, given the statement, ''Bordered by Syria and Israel, this small country is only 135 miles long and 35 miles wide,'' Watson beat its human competitors by quickly answering, ''What is Lebanon?'' 
 Moments later, however, the program stumbled when it decided it had high confidence that a ''sheet'' was a fruit. 
 The way to deal with such problems, Dr. Ferrucci said, is to improve the program's ability to understand the way ''Jeopardy!'' clues are offered. The complexity of the challenge is underscored by the subtlety involved in capturing the exact meaning of a spoken sentence. For example, the sentence ''I never said she stole my money'' can have seven different meanings depending on which word is stressed. 
 ''We love those sentences,'' Dr. Nyberg said. ''Those are the ones we talk about when we're sitting around having beers after work.''

HEADLINE: At Papers, New Levels of Job Insecurity

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The fast-shrinking newspaper business set a new standard for job insecurity in the last couple of weeks. Winning your profession's highest honor does not mean you get to keep your job, and neither does taking a bullet while at work. 
 On Feb. 7, 2008, Todd Smith, a reporter and editor, went on a routine assignment to cover a city council meeting in Kirkwood, Mo., for the Suburban Journals, a chain of papers outside St. Louis. A man with a gun and a grudge stormed City Hall and fatally shot six people, before being killed by the police.
 When the gunman aimed his way, Mr. Smith raised his right hand in a reflexive, shielding gesture, and a bullet tore through his hand and grazed his chest. Even after two reconstructive surgeries, he has permanent damage that limits the use of his thumb.
 Amazingly, Mr. Smith, 37, says he had been shot before, in the leg, in an armed robbery 11 years earlier. But he counts himself lucky; he was the only person shot that night in Kirkwood who survived.
 On April 15 of this year, when Mr. Smith was called to a meeting at the Suburban Journals, owned by Lee Enterprises, he wondered if the staff had won an award for coverage of the massacre. Instead, he learned that he and several others were being laid off.
 As the online editor, ''I thought my job was pretty safe,'' he said. ''And yeah, I thought getting shot for the company might be looked at as something important, but I guess not.''
 Unemployment is bad, he added, but ''to be honest with you, getting shot was worse.''
 Mr. Smith said he's not sure what he's going to do next. His superiors at the Suburban Journals did not respond to calls for comment.
 Paul Giblin and Patti Epler, former journalists at The East Valley Tribune outside Phoenix, have fared somewhat better. Last year, two reporters at The Tribune, Mr. Giblin and Ryan Gabrielson, wrote articles critical of a county sheriff and Ms. Epler, an editor, guided the project.
 The Tribune, owned by Freedom Communications, endured a wrenching downsizing in January, as it cut printing from seven days a week to four, dropped some areas of circulation, became a free paper and laid off about 40 percent of its staff, including Mr. Giblin, 45, and Ms. Epler, 55. 
 Days later, they and a few colleagues started The Arizona Guardian, a news Web site supported by subscriptions and advertising.
 Since then, Mr. Giblin, who does some freelance work for The New York Times, and Mr. Gabrielson have won a string of awards for their project at The Tribune, including, last Monday, a Pulitzer Prize.
 ''I was at The Tribune for 14 years, I had a great run, I made great friends and a few enemies,'' Mr. Giblin said. ''But things have changed and newspapers are in a tough situation. We're all adults and we can see that.''
 At The Guardian, ''we're making a go of it,'' Ms. Epler said. ''We don't make much, but it's more than we would collecting unemployment.''
 ''It's been so hectic, I really haven't had time to think about The Tribune or being laid off,'' she added. ''I've moved on.''

HEADLINE: One Internet Village, Divided: In Developing Countries, Web Grows Without Profit

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE and MIGUEL HELFT

 BODY:
Facebook is booming in Turkey and Indonesia. YouTube's audience has nearly doubled in India and Brazil.
 That may seem like good news. But it is also a major reason these and other Web companies with big global audiences and renowned brands struggle to turn even a tiny profit.
 Call it the International Paradox. 
 Web companies that rely on advertising are enjoying some of their most vibrant growth in developing countries. But those are also the same places where it can be the most expensive to operate, since Web companies often need more servers to make content available to parts of the world with limited bandwidth. And in those countries, online display advertising is least likely to translate into results. 
 This intractable contradiction has become a serious drag on the bottom lines of photo-sharing sites, social networks and video distributors like YouTube. It is also threatening the fervent idealism of Internet entrepreneurs, who hoped to unite the world in a single online village but are increasingly finding that the economics of that vision just do not work.
 Last year, Veoh, a video-sharing site operated from San Diego, decided to block its service from users in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, citing the dim prospects of making money and the high cost of delivering video there.
 ''I believe in free, open communications,'' Dmitry Shapiro, the company's chief executive, said. ''But these people are so hungry for this content. They sit and they watch and watch and watch. The problem is they are eating up bandwidth, and it's very difficult to derive revenue from it.''
 Internet start-ups that came of age during the Web 2.0 era, roughly from 2004 to the beginning of the recession at the end of 2007, generally subscribed to a widely accepted blueprint: build huge global audiences with a free service, and let advertising pay the bills.
 But many of them ran smack into global economic reality. There may be 1.6 billion people in the world with Internet access, but fewer than half of them have incomes high enough to interest major advertisers.
 ''It's a problem every Internet company has,'' said Michelangelo Volpi, chief executive of Joost, a video site with half its audience outside the United States.
 ''Whenever you have a lot of user-generated material, your bandwidth gets utilized in Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, where bandwidth is expensive and ad rates are ridiculously low,'' Mr. Volpi said. If Web companies ''really want to make money, they would shut off all those countries.''
 Few Internet companies have taken that drastic step, but many are exploring other ways to increase revenue or cut costs in developing countries.
 MySpace -- the News Corporation's social network with 130 million members, about 45 percent of them overseas -- is testing a feature for countries with slower Internet connections called Profile Lite. It is a stripped-down version of the site that is less expensive to display because it requires less bandwidth.
 MySpace says it may make Profile Light the primary version for its members in India, where it has 760,000 users, although people there could click on a link to switch to the richer version of the site. 
 Perhaps no company is more in the grip of the international paradox than YouTube, which a Credit Suisse analyst, Spencer Wang, recently estimated could lose $470 million in 2009, in part because of the high cost of delivering billions of videos each month. Google, which owns YouTube, disputed the analysis but offered no details on the site's financial situation.
 Tom Pickett, director of online sales and operations at YouTube, says the company still hews to its vision of bringing online video to the entire globe. In the last two years, it has pushed to create local versions of its site in countries like India, Brazil and Poland.
 But Mr. Pickett also says that YouTube has slowed the creation of new international hubs and shifted its focus to making money. He says that does not rule out restricting bandwidth in certain countries as a way to control costs -- essentially making YouTube a slower, lower-quality viewing experience in the developing world.
 ''We may choose to set a limit to how much we are willing to pay in bandwidth cost,'' Mr. Pickett said. In some countries, he said, ''there may be particular peak times where instead of high definition, we might decrease the resolution.''
 The Facebook social network is also considering lowering the quality of videos and photographs delivered to some regions in an effort to reduce expenses.
 ''We can decide, either on a country by country or user by user basis, to engineer the quality of the service for that cohort of users,'' said Jonathan Heiliger, the executive who oversees Facebook's computing infrastructure.
 Facebook is in a particularly difficult predicament. Seventy percent of its 200 million members live outside the United States, many in regions that do not contribute much to Facebook's bottom line. At the same time, the company faces the expensive prospect of storing 850 million photos and eight million videos uploaded to the site each month.
 Facebook, which says it favors membership growth over profitability for now, is trying to increase revenue overseas by hiring advertising sales staff in countries like Britain, Australia and France. 
 In other parts of the world, Microsoft serves ads on the site and Facebook offers self-service tools to advertisers. But those ads are far less lucrative than the ones Facebook itself sells in the United States and Western Europe.
 As a result, speculation has swirled about Facebook's finances. Industry analysts wonder aloud how fast the company is losing money and whether it needs to solicit another round of investment.
 Facebook said last month that it was on track to become profitable next year. But as it did, Gideon Yu, Facebook's experienced chief financial officer, left the company. Three people familiar with the internal maneuverings at Facebook said Mr. Yu objected to such a rosy projection as the company was struggling to finance its expensive global growth.
 Web entrepreneurs like Mr. Shapiro of Veoh, still struggling with his decision to restrict his site from much of the world, might have to find a way to soothe their battered consciences.
 ''The part of me that wants to change the world says, 'This is unfair, it shouldn't be like this,' '' Mr. Shapiro said. ''On the other hand, from the business side of things, serving videos to the entire world is just not supportable at this time.''

HEADLINE: Ecuador Re-elects President, Preliminary Results Show

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador 

 BODY:
President Rafael Correa appeared headed for victory in elections on Sunday as the old political establishment was unable to muster a coherent alternative to his combination of asserting nationalistic control of the economy with broadly popular social welfare programs for the poor. 
 According to preliminary results, Mr. Correa won 51 percent of the vote, with his closest challenger, Lucio Gutierrez, a former army colonel ousted as president in 2005, getting 29 percent. The victory would further cement the power of Mr. Correa, an American-educated economist first elected in 2006 when voters repudiated an elite that had overseen a chronically unstable political system. 
 ''We've taken a historic step in consolidating our social revolution,'' an ebullient Mr. Correa said Sunday afternoon after exit polls signaled his victory.
 Nelson Basantes, 47, who voted at the Juan Pio Montufar School in a working-class district here, said, ''Correa is the only leader in this country capable of putting our house in order.'' Mr. Basantes, a paper recycler, said he admired Mr. Correa's efforts to alleviate economic misery by providing poor families with a $30 payment each month. 
 Low oil prices are already straining Mr. Correa's hopes of sustaining such social spending. Since Ecuador defaulted on its foreign debt in December, hard currency reserves have fallen by about a third to $3 billion. Rising unemployment in Spain and the United States, countries with large numbers of Ecuadorean immigrants, is also pushing remittances lower. 
 Mr. Correa, 46, has responded to the sharp economic slowdown by seeking more than $1 billion in loans from China and imposing restrictions on hundreds of imported products in an attempt to prevent United States dollars, used here as the official currency, from flowing out of the country. 
 The 7.4 percent inflation rate, while lower than in many neighboring countries, also weighed on some voters. Mr. Gutierrez, the former president, ran advertisements raising alarm about the rising cost of basic foods. 
 But many voters said they still had faith in Mr. Correa to address such fears. 
 ''Correa is better than the thieves that came before him,'' said Mariana Sanchez, 52, a street vendor. 
 Mr. Correa, who won approval of a new Constitution last September that eroded checks on the presidency, has emerged as Ecuador's most powerful president since military rule ended here in 1979. The country's 10th leader since 1996, he will start a new four-year term with a chance of re-election, if the preliminary returns from Sunday hold up. 
 Indeed, even Ecuador's once unruly legislature, which ousted presidents with ease, has increasingly come under his sway. 
 Citing the greater centralization of power at a time of political stability, Michael Shifter, vice president of Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, said ''it is less clear what kind of democracy is being constructed.''
 ''For now such a trade-off seems acceptable for most Ecuadoreans,'' he said, ''but when economic conditions worsen, there may be greater discontent with virtually one-man rule.''

HEADLINE: In a City Under Strain, Ladling Out Fortification

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

DATELINE: FALL RIVER, Mass. 

 BODY:
 In the immaculate kitchen of an old social club now receiving the gray morning light, a deep silver pot has been filled with buckets and buckets of cold water. The cook measures not by the quart but by the heart, so if you ask exactly how much water, the answer is: exactly the right amount.
 With her navy beans washed, her beef shanks unwrapped, her kale and cabbage ready to be chopped by hand, the time has come to make another batch of restorative soup for ailing Fall River. She lights the stove.
 Her name is Ines De Costa, but the city calls her Vovo, familiar Portuguese for grandmother. She is 76, with salt-white hair and a small body transformed by spinal degeneration into the shape of a cupped hand. This means she must stand on tiptoe to stir. 
 Among the many soups in Ms. De Costa's oceanic repertoire are those with a specific purpose, including a chicken-and-potato concoction for pregnant women. But the soup she is making now, this Portuguese soup she learned from her mother, is for a working-class city with 16 percent unemployment, nearly double the average in Massachusetts and recently raised by the layoffs of dozens of police officers and firefighters.
 For $3.50, you get a heaping bowl of nourishing soup, a fresh Portuguese roll and some butter. ''It's a disaster in Fall River,'' she says, her accent still strong nearly 60 years after leaving the Azores. ''No work, everybody loses their jobs.''
 So this is what Vovo says: You want another roll?
 Ms. De Costa rises well before dawn from the hospital bed her children installed in her Somerset cottage several years ago. There, surrounded by portraits and statues of Jesus, the Blessed Virgin and a host of saints, including her beloved St. Teresa of Avila, who suffered so, she begins her morning ritual of praying for you, me, everyone. Then a cup of coffee, decaf.
 Every day except Monday, her daughter, Ines Bates, who tries in vain to get her fragile mother to cut down on these 70-hour weeks, drives her across the Taunton River to Fall River. Past the triple-decker houses and ghostly mills, the run-down housing project and the Portuguese bakery, to here: the St. John's Athletic Club, a social anchor of the Maplewood section since before the Depression, and the place where Vovo has run a restaurant for 30 years.
 On one side of a wall: the bar, where Quaker Fabric factory workers once lined the counter two deep; no bar stools necessary. But the factory, which employed more than 2,000 people just a few years ago, closed in 2007, forcing the shot-and-beer bar to adjust. There is Friday night karaoke now, and if for some reason you suddenly crave an appletini, the St. John's can provide.
 At 8:30 this morning, though, only a few men disturb the emptiness, a couple of them presiding over shot glasses with Dunkin' Donuts chasers.
 On the other side of the wall: the kitchen-and-dining-room domain of Ms. De Costa, now chopping kale. She slices away the spines with surgical precision, rolls several leaves together, then chops, her gold wedding ring winking from the dark-green mound. Her cherished husband, Manuel, died 20 years ago; he too made a good soup.
 She could buy the kale and cabbage already chopped, but she insists the strips sit better in the bowl when cut by hand. All leavings, by the way, from tired cabbage bits to day-old bread, are set aside for a man in Westport who keeps goats.
 ''Like St. Francis,'' she says. 
 The club is silent, save for knife-blade clicks in the kitchen and billiard-ball clacks in the bar. Ms. De Costa rarely goes into the bar, and only then to raise money for one of her many causes: an orphanage in Calcutta, a local nursing home, the occasional destitute dead in need of a coffin.
 When asked if she takes a drink now and then, the saintly, knife-wielding Ms. De Costa snaps, ''Hell, no.''
 The pot burbles. She reaches up with a spoon and stirs the brown broth.
 Outside the club spreads a city of 95,000 that is all too familiar with hard times. Once a textile manufacturing capital, the city has spent most of the last century trying to adapt, as the industry moved away, as fires burned the downtown, as revitalization plans remained only plans. Its motto, ''We'll Try,'' sounds almost apologetic.
 The mayor, Robert Correia, is the latest to try. This month he announced a many-faceted plan to turn Fall River into a center of renewable energy that would attract businesses, create jobs and make use of the city's many old mills. It includes the ambitious and expensive proposal to ''daylight'' -- or unearth -- the muscular Quequechan River, once the generator of power for all those mills, but diverted long ago into pipes beneath the city.
 The city clearly needs daylight, hope -- a plan. In the meantime, how about some soup? The mayor has known Vovo for nearly 40 years; he knows all about her charitable works, her influence on local-boy-made-good Emeril Lagasse, her portions so plentiful that customers usually leave with leftovers.
 ''She's one of these people you never hear from because they're too busy holding up the rest of us, and we don't realize it,'' he says. As for her Portuguese soup: ''In Fall River you would say it's the kind your mother made.''
 At 11:10, Ms. De Costa removes the shanks to dice their meat. As she trims the fat, she remembers how her father used to love a piece of fat in his Portuguese soup, topped with a splash of red wine. When she arrived here in 1952 at 19, he told her: ''Everybody in America drinks from the same glass'' -- meaning everyone's the same.
 ''As I find out, this is not the case,'' she says.
 Soon Ms. De Costa has mixed all the ingredients together into the pot: kale and cabbage, beans and beef, some ground chorizo, and salt; just the right amount. She stirs again, then taps the spoon against the pot's lip, as if instructing the ingredients to cooperate with one another for the next two hours. She can be stern; just ask her waitresses.
 The Tuesday lunch crowd arrives, if it can be called a crowd. Times are tough too at the club, where the motto on the lottery machine -- ''This is your lucky day!'' -- can seem like a taunt. A couple of years ago, though, Ms. De Costa bought a ticket, won $1,000 and immediately sent it all to those orphans in Calcutta.
 Her daughter, Ms. Bates, has given up cautioning her mother about her endless giving of money and, especially, of food. Some days the business makes money, sometimes it does not. ''She says God will provide,'' the daughter says, smiling a helpless smile.
 Says the mother, ''I like to see everybody leave full.''
 Sometime around 2, with drab skies threatening rain, Susan Bertrand, a nurse, and John Arruda, a cement truck driver, arrive for lunch. It's been a tough year, they say, as they count all the friends and relatives who have lost jobs. Mr. Arruda, in fact, just started working after a three-month layoff.
 She orders the steak sandwich, he orders the chorizo sandwich, and they both order the Portuguese soup, now ready to be served. Out come two sustaining cups of Vovo.
 Delicious, they say.

HEADLINE: A Life's Work, Devalued

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The economic uncertainty hanging over baby boomers and older workers was poignantly laid out in ''Longer Periods of Unemployment for Workers 45 and Older'' (news article, April 13). 
 Sadly, layoffs -- and the fear of layoffs -- have repercussions that reach beyond the employees themselves. 
 Employees are shortening resumes to cover up years of accumulated skills and experience to appear more youthful. Older employees now warn their children of the pitfalls of job loyalty, recommending that they adopt a free-agent mentality. 
 Even more worrying: our research shows that job insecurity is leading to demonstrable health concerns, including higher blood pressure among men and greater depression among women. 
 We need to understand the high cost of dismantling and devaluing a life's work. And we need to preserve the value of experienced workers' accomplishments, even as all workers need to make compromises in the face of economic challenges.
 Ariel Kalil Chicago, April 14, 2009 The writer is director of the Center for Human Potential and Public Policy and associate professor at the Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago.

NEW YORK ON LESS:
 A Neighborhood
 Feels a Slowdown
 At first glance, it looks as if the recession has spared downtown Flushing from the shuttered storefronts seen in some New York City neighborhoods. Along Main Street, in the heart of Community Board District 7, the sidewalks are crowded with shoppers clutching red plastic bags, darting in and out of shops and haggling with street vendors over slippers and DVDs. 
 But that doesn't mean that the area, known as one of the city's other Chinatowns, isn't struggling. Peter Koo, a native of Shanghai who arrived in Flushing 26 years ago, says the effects are just more subtle. Business has dropped 10 percent at the five pharmacies he owns there as shoppers cut back on beauty products like makeup, combs and mirrors.
 As president of the Flushing Chinese Business Association and a founder of the Flushing Business Improvement District, Mr. Koo has also heard from fellow business owners running restaurants, bakeries, barber shops and beauty salons that business has dropped by as much as 20 to 30 percent and that owners have trimmed some workers' weekly schedules to four days from six. He discussed the situation in a recent interview.
 Q. When did you notice that the recession had arrived in Flushing?
 A. It was way after the holidays we noticed. In the beginning we heard depression, it was just news to us. The impact is here now. I have a friend who got laid off from HSBC bank. When I talk to my friends they all know someone who got laid off.
 Q. Give an example of how one Flushing business has been affected.
 A. Flushing bakeries sell pastries, coffee, tea. Usually the day laborers wait and buy beverages there. Sometimes their bosses, when there was construction break, they had two breaks. Usually the bosses would come and buy their coffee and their pastries to eat. There are a lot of new buildings are being built here. Some are done already. Some are on hold. There is a lot of apartment remodeling. All of that is gone or slowed down a lot. During the day, they would come down to eat for lunch and coffee breaks. These jobs are gone. So the business is done.
 Q. How does the economic slowdown you're seeing now compare to what you have seen in the 26 years you have been in the neighborhood?
 A. I remember in the early '90s it was slow. People would tell me, 'I had a whole day without any customers.' This is the worst. After 9/11 it was actually not that bad. It didn't affect us that much. After 9/11 our business got better. They didn't go to Chinatown; they came here.

HEADLINE: Losses in Good-Will Values Compound Bank Troubles

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY; Louise Story contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When times were flush, businesses bought up rivals and absorbed smaller companies to grow as big as possible as fast as possible. But now, those purchases are starting to look a lot like housing bought at the peak of the bubble -- overpriced and losing value fast.
 Companies are taking billions of dollars in losses as they write down the value of assets known as good will -- the amount they overpaid for a business compared with the sum of its parts. As the economy sinks lower and businesses struggle, that good will is going bad. 
 The losses from these write-downs have already been in the tens of billions of dollars, and analysts say they are likely to continue as companies reassess the value of old deals in the light of faltering stock markets, declines in real estate and weak corporate revenues.
 ''It's not the end of the tragedy,'' said Feng Gu, an assistant professor at the State University of New York at Buffalo and an author of a paper on good-will impairments with Baruch Lev, a professor at New York University. ''Things continue to get worse.''
 For the nation's banks, which are already bracing for another spate of big losses from commercial real estate loans and credit card businesses, the rapid declines in good will represent another potential source of losses. 
 Banks wrote down more than $25 billion in good will in 2008, up sharply from $790 million a year earlier, according to data compiled by Frank Schiraldi of Sandler O'Neill & Partners. By the end of the year, banks still had $291 billion worth of good will on their books. An incomplete tally of write-downs from the first quarter showed that banks had taken a $3.5 billion hit to good-will values. 
 For some companies, the losses will be staggering.
 Before it was scooped up in a merger with Wells Fargo last year, the Wachovia Corporation cut the value of its good will by $18.7 billion, largely from its purchase of the troubled mortgage lender Golden West Financial and other acquisitions that took on water as housing markets sank and the economy hurtled lower. 
 Macy's took a good-will charge of $5.4 billion in 2008. In February 2008, the cellular carrier Sprint Nextel wrote down $30 billion from Sprint's purchase of Nextel. 
 Companies characterize the hits as nothing more than accounting losses, a revaluing of assets that were not tangible to begin with. And they say the write-downs do not threaten their credit, their cash flow or their long-term health.
 ''It was just a paper entry sitting on your balance sheet,'' said Rex S. Schuette, chief financial officer of United Community Banks, which wrote down $70 million of good will in the first quarter.
 But the losses take a real bite out of corporate earnings, like a first-quarter good-will charge of $2.6 billion at Huntington Bancshares that contributed to its $2.4 billion first-quarter loss. And they could lead to more declines in company share prices as many are grappling with declining market value, crumbling real estate portfolios and lower revenues.
 ''Investors will have to be wary of these things,'' said J. Edward Ketz, an associate professor of accounting at the Pennsylvania State University, who has studied good will. ''You never know when an intangible asset is going to be written off.''
 If nothing else, the decline in the value of good will shows that corporations across the spectrum spent far too much during the merger mania of the last decade, analysts said. As the markets roared higher, companies looked at their rising share prices like lottery money, and deployed their stock to go on a buying binge, eager to show shareholders growth and expanding sources of revenue.
 If the mergers were lavish wedding ceremonies, the slumping value of the good will has been the rocky marriages that followed. 
 ''If they overpaid for it and they have to take a write-down, that definitely is an indicator that they overpaid, and that the corporate acquisition group is not doing its job that well,'' said William Hughes, managing director of the Valuation Research Corporation.
 The value of good will represents intangible qualities like the value of a company's brand name, its customer base and reputation. Every year, companies that list good will as a leftover asset from mergers have to test its value to see whether it has held up.
 SunTrust Banks, based in Atlanta, had been monitoring its $7 billion in good will every quarter since the end of 2007, and cut its value by $715 million this spring. The bank said it had made the write-down because economic declines had continued to hammer its mortgage and commercial real estate assets.
 ''There's been some erosion in financial performance, but the uncertainty and sentiment in the marketplace has also had a meaningful effect,'' said the bank's controller, Thomas E. Panther.
 For the quarter, SunTrust reported a net loss of $815 million but said the good-will charge had no effect on its levels of capital required by government regulators. It also said that some signs of improvement in deposits and mortgage lending were emerging and that it thought it had revalued its good will to match current conditions. 
 Although SunTrust played down the significance of the write-down, the analysis of good-will losses by Mr. Gu and Mr. Lev found that they often presaged rough waters ahead. If the write-downs mount, they can lead businesses to cut jobs, reduce capital investments, slash budgets and close plants.
 Still, the losses don't mean that businesses have less money to pay off their debts, or that they are on the brink of insolvency. And with investors already bracing for the worst, some analysts said the good-will write-downs did not provide much additional shock. 
 ''You're pushed down so low anyhow,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''What's more bad news on top of bad news?''

HEADLINE: Advocates Fear City Budget Cuts Will Put Children at Risk

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
The threat of more than $83 million in budget cuts at New York City's child-welfare agency has left advocates for children afraid that recent improvements in its operations, including reduced caseloads, could be threatened. 
 To bring the agency's budget down to the size that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has requested, officials at the Administration for Children's Services have prepared to reduce preventive services, institute a 5 percent cut in fees to foster-care agencies that hold contracts with the city and lay off more than 550 of its more than 6,800 employees. 
 The cuts would be the largest since John B. Mattingly became commissioner of the agency in 2004, and among the most severe reductions since it was created as a stand-alone department in 1996. The city, meanwhile, is receiving a steadily increasing number of reports of abuse and neglect -- 65,856 in 2008, up from 63,434 the year before. 
 ''As the economic crisis worsens, there are probably going to be more families who need services,'' said Stephanie Gendell, an associate executive director of the Citizens' Committee for Children of New York, an advocacy group. ''It's not like A.C.S. has become less busy.'' 
 Jennifer Marino Rojas, the deputy director of the Children's Defense Fund-New York and a former associate commissioner at the Administration for Children's Services, said the cuts could not come at a worse moment. ''A.C.S. was just getting the resources it needed to better respond to the needs of children and families,'' she said. 
 ''And now to start chipping away at that again really does threaten the stability of the agency.''
 Perhaps the biggest fear is that the average caseload could balloon, after an intense effort to bring it to its current level, just under 12, from 21 three years ago. A children's services spokeswoman, Sharman Stein, said she could not say that child-protective workers, who investigate reports of abuse and neglect, would be spared from layoffs; Marc La Vorgna, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said, ''It's an issue we have to look at very carefully.''
 ''We have a goal of reducing costs while continuing the progress made in reducing caseloads,'' Mr. La Vorgna said. 
 In a statement sent by e-mail, Mr. Mattingly said he would try to keep caseloads at the current levels. 
 ''These manageable caseloads are a critical element in our ability to do strong, thorough protective investigations,'' he said. ''Children's services has committed to the children and families of this city that we will continue to strengthen and improve our child-protective work.'' The city budget process is still underway; Mr. Bloomberg is scheduled to present his proposal on Friday.
 The Administration for Children's Services was founded in 1996, after the much-publicized beating death of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo, who was killed by her mother. In response to the public outcry, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani removed child-welfare programs from the Human Resources Administration, then the umbrella agency for all city social services, and promised a renewed focus on protecting children. 
 After a string of high-profile deaths of children in 2006 -- including that of 7-year-old Nixzmary Brown, who was found abused and starved in her home -- Mr. Mattingly instituted a series of changes, beefing up child-protective services, vastly increasing the amount of money spent on family support programs, reducing caseloads and shifting more responsibility to foster-care agencies.
 But if Mr. Mattingly plans to prioritize child-protective caseloads, the proposed budget cuts would eliminate some preventive services and reduce others. These programs, which are administered through contracted agencies, address problems in families through parenting classes, housing advocacy or domestic violence counseling, for example, and can often keep children with their parents and out of foster care. Officials from the 36 foster-care agencies that hold contracts with the city have been told to prepare for a 5 percent cut in their fees, a reduction that many agency directors said could be devastating. 
 James F. Purcell, chief executive officer of the Council of Family and Child Caring Agencies, said that if there was less money to work with, ''kids are going to stay in foster care even longer, and they're already in care a very long time.'' Jeremy Kohomban, the president and chief executive of Children's Village, said he was planning to lay off several employees. Bill Baccaglini, the executive director of the New York Foundling, one of the city's oldest and largest foster-care agencies, said the cuts would mean a loss of roughly $500,000. 
 According to data compiled in Child Welfare Watch, a biannual report published by the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School, preventive programs were operating at full capacity through most of 2008.
 ''A.C.S. is relying a lot more heavily on preventive services than it did, say, six years ago, and this means the caseloads are probably going to go up,'' said Andrew White, the director of the center. ''And it means there won't be the kind of growth in family and children's services that we need to diffuse the kinds of crises that send kids into foster care.'' 
 Some of the layoffs within the city agency itself appear to be in line with Mr. Mattingly's goals under Improved Outcomes for Children, an initiative begun in 2007 to delegate more responsibility and decision-making to the outside foster-care agencies. Several directors of the agencies said they were not concerned that many of the city positions would be eliminated. 
 But many of the proposed cuts are of positions that provide support to child-protective workers, like administrative staff, computer technicians and drivers.
 In 2006, the agency began building a staff of 60 former police detectives who work as investigative consultants. Ten of those positions will be cut. 
 ''The burden will fall on the child-protective workers, because they won't have the supports that help them manage the cases and move the cases along,'' said Faye Moore, president of the Social Service Employees Union. 
 Some advocates predicted that the budget cuts were only the beginning. Even if the economy begins to recover, they said, another round of reductions was possible in the fall.
 ''We finally started to get it right after Nixzmary Brown,'' said Bill de Blasio, a city councilman from Brooklyn who is chairman of the General Welfare Committee. ''Now, by definition, it will be much harder to keep up with the cases, it'll be much harder to protect kids, and this level of cut at a single agency suggests that we are not making this agency a priority.''
