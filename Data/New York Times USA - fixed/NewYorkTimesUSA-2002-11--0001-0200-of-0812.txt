HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Art Fairs

"AFFORDABLE ART FAIR NEW YORK," Pier 92, 12th Avenue, at 50th Street, through Sunday. While granting that one person's affordable art is another's waste of money, this fledgling London art fair, which is making its first New York appearance, could be fun, especially for the young, novice collector of contemporary art. Nothing in its costs more than $5,000. Scheduled events include lectures about buying, maintaining and even making art -- and there is not a blue chip gallery in sight. But there are 20 serious New York galleries among the 80 participants from North America and Britain. The remaining names will be less familiar to denizens of New York art galleries, which means that this particular fair will be even more of a collision of different art worlds than usual. Hours: Today and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; tomorrow, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 65+; children under 6, free. Information: 1-800-594-8499 or www.affordableartfair.com (Roberta Smith).

Museums

"AN AMERICAN LEGACY, A GIFT TO NEW YORK," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Jan. 26). The Whitney trustees pooled their pennies, acquired $200 million worth of postwar American art and gave it all to the museum as a gift. The 87 works, dating from the 1940's through the 1990's, enhance and subtly reshape the museum's account of American modernism. And they are all temporarily on view in this showcase, which ranges from classic Abstract Expressionist painting (Kline, Pollock, Still) to early Pop (pre-silkscreen Warhol), with lots and lots of Jasper Johns. Most of of the choices are predictably canonical; the show perks up with odd-duck contributions by Jay DeFeo and Lucas Samaras. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8, students and 62+ (Holland Cotter).

* "RICHARD AVEDON: PORTRAITS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue, at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 5). Just eight years after the last Richard Avedon show, here's a survey of portraits. The fashion analogy is obvious: the repackaged product, a clever campaign to market the same old goods. But the show is gorgeous: a pitch-perfect mix of modest-size, big and unbelievably big prints, each an exquisitely made object. Whatever else the works might be, they are unforgettable. Celebrity only partly accounts for their status. Mr. Avedon brings other factors to bear: a sense of spectacle, clinical precision, energy, movement even in static head shots (the figures often seem so tense they look ready to jump out of the pictures) and an irrepressible attraction to power. His career dovetails with the era of the paparazzi, the tell-all media and the obligatory scandals and secret sufferings of the rich and fashionable. You might say he raised this cultural fixation to a neurotic art. The trade-off with him is always between style and substance. It's the conflict of our culture. No wonder his pictures are so embedded in our imagination. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $7 for students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman).

* JUDY CHICAGO: "THE DINNER PARTY," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Feb. 9). This exhibition welcomes back Ms. Chicago's extravagant installation banquet of ceramic plates and handmade table runners dedicated to 39 women. A feminist landmark, it is joining the permanent collection 22 years after its first appearance at the museum. It is amazing to see. Made with the help of hundreds of volunteers from 1975 to 1979, "The Dinner Party" sums up the first stage of feminist art, reflects the late 70's rematerialization of the art object and is startlingly prescient of the art of the late 80's and 90's in its ambition to be both aggressively visual and politically charged. Despite being almost as much a part of American culture as Norman Rockwell, Walt Disney, W.P.A. murals and the AIDS quilt, it retains much of its original revolutionary fervor. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Smith).

* "DRAWING NOW: EIGHT PROPOSITIONS," Museum of Modern Art, Queens, 45-20 33rd Street, at Queens Boulevard, Long Island City, (212) 708-9400 (through Jan. 6). This generous sampling of work by 26 young artists provides a sweeping, even opulent view of drawing at the threshold of the 21st century. The variety of techniques and materials, the mix of large-scale feats of draftsmanship with clusters of framed works, the broad spate of sources (from American quilt patterns to Japanese anime to 19th-century illustration) and the range of narrative ambition create an exhilarating sense of possibility. The division of the work into eight different approaches, or propositions, balances coherence with diversity. Some of the artists illustrate rather than fully embody the curators' categories, and there is an excess of fashionable, even overexposed artists from a handful of hot galleries. Nonetheless, "Drawing Now" is required viewing for anyone remotely interested in today's art. It sets a standard for future shows of its kind. Hours: Thursdays through Mondays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m; until 7:45 p.m. on Fridays. Admission: $12; $8.50 for students and 65+ (Smith).

* "FACING THE MASK" AND "RECENT ACQUISITIONS: SELECTIONS FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION," Museum for African Art, third floor, 36-01 43rd Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-7700 (through March 2). The Museum for African Art, formerly of SoHo, makes the leap to a new home in Long Island City with a very beautiful if surveyish show, "Facing the Mask," which happens to be all about moving. Some of the moving is physical, some psychological and spiritual, and it is embodied in more than 70 stunning masks, no two alike, from across sub-Saharan Africa. Some were used for popular entertainment; others were moral forces incarnate. Their purpose was transport, and they are supplemented by films of masquerades in action. Also on view is a selection of work from the museum's still small but growing permanent collection. Hours: Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $2.50 for students and 65+ (Cotter).

"ADOLPH GOTTLIEB: A SURVEY EXHIBITION," Jewish Museum, 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3271 (through March 2). Gottlieb's painting has not aged as well as that of his colleagues Pollock, Rothko and Newman. His journey leads from 1930's representational pictures that resemble those by his friend Milton Avery to the gridded pictographic works of the 40's to the iconic circle-and-burst paintings of the late 50's, which have been his most memorable works. In the 1960's his canvases expand and brighten under the influence of Color Field painting. This 31-painting exhibition casts an illuminating light on a period of tremendous creative ferment in Western art. Hours: Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Mondays through Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission: $8; $5.50 for students and 65+ (Ken Johnson).

"MOVING PICTURES," Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 12). This survey of photography with a small selection of video, film and installation art appended may be the largest exhibition of its kind in a major New York museum. Drawn almost entirely from the Guggenheim's permanent collection, it has a snappy yet unobtrusive design by Hani Rashid and ably surveys the expansion of contemporary art by camera-dependent media from the late 1960's to now. It begins with works by Nam June Paik, Bruce Nauman and Robert Smithson, then moves up the museum's ramp through photographs by Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and Andreas Gursky, concluding with video and film by artists like Stan Douglas, Shirin Neshat and Pierre Huyghe. An added attraction is the foam-lined, cavelike video galleries perched at the top of the spiral, which give the show a giddy, Hall of the Mountain King finale that seems to say, "Onward and upward with video." Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $9 for students and 65+ (Smith)

* "THE NATIVE BORN: CONTEMPORARY ABORIGINAL ART FROM RAMINGINING, AUSTRALIA," Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742 (through Jan. 5). Like other Aboriginals, the Yolngu people of Arnhem Land in northern Australia make images on rock and bark, and also make sculptures and weaving. Their cross-hatched paintings are less familiar yet every bit as lively and aesthetically inventive as the "dot and circle" work by the people of the central Australian desert, who are more widely associated with the term Aboriginal. Taking inspiration from ancestral myth and legend, as well as from the waterholes, beaches, forests, swamps, jungles and plains that surround them, the Yolngu produce stylized versions of saltwater crocodiles, lizards, birds, fish and vines. The more than 200 examples here -- including a ritual sand sculpture saluting the creation story about the two sisters who brought water to the land at its birth -- make a visual feast of remarkable freshness. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+ (Grace Glueck).

* "POUSSIN, CLAUDE AND THEIR WORLD: 17TH-CENTURY FRENCH DRAWINGS FROM THE ECOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS, PARIS," Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through Dec. 1). The Ecole des Beaux-Arts, the world's oldest surviving art school (founded in 1648), assembled an enormous collection of works to instruct its students in the discipline of drawing. Those from the 17th century, the great age of Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, are especially outstanding. The 71 here survey French drawing from 1620 to 1680, when classicism came to French art, aiming to restore High Renaissance ideals of clarity, order and balance, with the Italian painter Raphael as a revered model. The emphasis is on the works of Poussin (1594-1665) and Claude (1604-1682), a history painter and a landscapist. But lesser-known masters like Simon Vouet, Eustache Le Sueur and Charles Le Brun are also included. Wicked doings in the Bible, sex in mythology, the ordered schematics of French architecture and the pomp and circumstance of the French court are some of the subjects covered in the drawings, which should send any aficionado to the Frick on the run. Hours and admissions: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $5 for students; $8 for 62+ (Glueck).

"QUEENS INTERNATIONAL," Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700 (through Dec. 1). This selection of work by 40 artists, from 12 countries but all now living in Queens, includes paintings, videos, performance art, installations and other contemporary forms. The art reflects the globalization of postmodernist pluralism as much as -- if not more than -- cultural diversity. Highlights include intricately patterned, mandala-form collages by Marietta J. Ganapin; John L. Moore's dreamy, supplely painted abstractions; Larry Litt's politically provocative video "The Blame Show"; and James Johnson's full-scale copper-clad fantasy airplane, more offbeat labor of love than professional sculpture. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $2 for students and 55+ (Johnson).

LORNA SIMPSON, "31" and "Cameos and Appearances," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Jan. 26). The intricacies of being black and female in a Caucasian world are Ms. Simpson's continuing film subject. In "31," her latest, she records a month in the life of an anonymous black woman, presented in no particular sequence on a fast-moving grid of 31 small screens. Her mundane daily routine in an urban setting expresses the anomie and aloneness of one whose presence is not registered. The film lacks the depth charge of earlier Simpson films, like "Call Waiting," whose characters have more dimension. "Cameos and Appearances" carries on previous Simpson work, combining images with enigmatic texts that have an evocative relationship to the subject. The photographs are all inexpressive heads of anonymous blacks, mostly women but a few men, laid out in gridlike clusters. In characteristic Simpson fashion, they are turned away in silhouetted semi-profile, resolute in their ethnicity but refusing identification or empathy. Neither show represents Ms. Simpson's work at its best. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).

* "THE THAW COLLECTION: MASTER DRAWINGS AND OIL SKETCHES, ACQUISITIONS SINCE 1994," Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0008 (through Jan. 19). This selection of more than 100 European drawings and oil sketches is the latest update on a personal collection that Eugene V. Thaw and his wife, Clare, have been depositing at the Morgan in increments since 1975. The last such show, in 1994, left everyone a bit lightheaded it was so good. This one has a lot going for it, too, including work by Rembrandt, Ruisdael, Degas and the incomparable Samuel Palmer. A cluster of 19th-century German and Scandinavian works give the proceedings a piney, Romantic air. Nearly half the show is plein-air oil sketches, which the Thaws have recently been acquiring in depth. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, to 8 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6 for students and 65+ (Cotter).

* "BILL VIOLA: GOING FORTH BY DAY," Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 12). An ambitious meditation on the epic themes of human existence, this frescolike video installation consists of five panels, shot using the latest technology and projected simultaneously on the walls of one huge gallery. Each deals with a specific theme: rebirth, journey through life, disaster, death and resurrection. Inspired by the works of Renaissance painters like Giotto and Luca Signorelli, the show relates as much to still painting as it does to the moving images of cinema and television. Except for a few scenes, the action is almost in slow motion, suggesting the stasis of looking at paintings and allowing the viewer to shift attention from panel to panel without losing focus. The liveliest scene is "The Deluge," in which a series of ordinary street events occurs before the facade of a Classical-looking house. They are interrupted by a tumultuous flood pouring out of the building's apertures that sends people running for their lives. The work was mostly shot before the Sept. 11 disaster but is amazingly prophetic of it. If some of the imagery is corny, it is still a deeply felt and provocative piece of work. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).

* "WINOGRAND 1964," International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Dec. 1). In 1964 the photographer Garry Winogrand crisscrossed the United States in a slow, black 1957 two-door Ford Fairlaine, taking nearly 20,000 photographs along the way. Here are around 150 of them, most never shown before. Some are not terrific. Winogrand was a hit-and-miss artist, and the show could have been edited. But others are great, and together the images add up to a fresh, divinely eccentric portrait of America after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The resonance with 9/11, though obvious, goes unstated. A poor skeptic, Winogrand clearly saw the fragility and the preciousness of what binds people together. Many of the pictures seem fragile, too: they're fleeting stories sometimes so provisional as to be barely coherent, irreducible, like life, to a simple message. Winogrand captured how America once again transformed catastrophe into commerce, an inevitable but also strangely redemptive process. Hours and admission: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $9; $6, students and 62+ (Kimmelman).

Galleries: Uptown

MARKUS LUPERTZ, "Semiramis," Knoedler, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through Nov. 16). Titled after the Babylonian Queen Semiramis, creator of the legendary Hanging Gardens, Mr. Lupertz's paintings, in which rectangles of florid, clotted Abstract Expressionist painting are set off within internal borders, might be a meditation on beauty and decadence. Superficially, these medium-size canvases by the head of the Dusseldorf Academy of Art resemble the paintings of Howard Hodgkin, but they are animated more by oblique irony than by lyrical hedonism (Johnson).

DENNIS MASBACK, Berry-Hill, 11 East 70th Street, (212) 744-2300 (through Wednesday). Layering squares, rectangles and lines in slightly irregular grids, Mr. Masback creates catchy plaid paintings. The artist draws his inspiration from jazz, and that is evident in the syncopated rhythms of his pictures. They also have seductively smooth, slightly brushy surfaces and a softly glowing translucence (Johnson).

GYORGY ROMAN, "A Survey," Janos Gat, 1100 Madison Avenue, at 82nd Street, (212) 327-0441 (through Nov. 9). This Hungarian painter (1903-1981) had an incredibly adventurous life. Rendered deaf and mute by a childhood bout with meningitis, he went on to become a professional boxer, a candy-maker's apprentice, a world traveler and a novelist. An unpredictable mix of Expressionism, Primitivism, Symbolism and political allegory, his earthy paintings have one eye on war, pestilence and nostalgic memories, the other on the formal and material possibilities of painting itself (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

PHIL BINACO, "Maenads Paintings," Linda Durham, 210 11th Avenue, (212) 337-0025 (through Nov. 28). A friend and admirer of Agnes Martin, this Santa Fe resident creates off-white abstractions out of wax and resin. He meticulously inscribes the thick, smooth surfaces with fine parallel lines to create flickering textures and simple rectilinear compositions. These handsome material objects are animated by a hint of spiritual luminosity (Johnson).

LARRY BROWN, Sears-Peyton, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 966-7469 (through Nov. 16). Spheres, globes and molecular models drift and tumble through space in Mr. Brown's semi-abstract paintings. The artist, an erstwhile pure abstractionist, grounds his cosmic vision in glazed, sensuously painterly surfaces and contains it within compressive compositions (Johnson).

DAVID X. LEVINE, "Teenage Symphonies to God," Cynthia Broan, 423 West 14th Street, (212) 633-6525 (through Nov. 16). If a Tantric master were reborn as an American student of rock 'n' roll, he might make works like Mr. Levine's paintings on paper. The best are pulsating concentric rings of colored circles, like strings of beads, with hand-written words referring to the Velvet Underground, the Beach Boys and other classic groups. Slightly dirtied and roughed up, they look antique, as though they have been exhumed from some forgotten monastery (Johnson).

EDDA RENOUF, "Time Lines," Joseph Helman, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 929-1545 (through Nov. 16). Ms. Renouf, who started exhibiting her work in Europe in the early 70's, makes Minimalistic multipanel abstract paintings, in which rubbed-in shades of red, orange or blue create textures like worn denim. These fields are subtly activated by geometric designs made by selective removal of threads from the canvas. Ms. Renouf means her work to be about time, but its effect is more of elegant, dry formality (Johnson).

WILLIAM STEIGER, "Signal," Margaret Thatcher Projects, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 675-0222 (through Nov. 16). Updating the Precisionism of Modernists like Charles Sheeler and Charles Demuth, Mr. Steiger creates flattened, hard-edged, high-contrast paintings of grain elevators, railroad signals and amusement park rides. They have a fresh material immediacy and a cool nostalgia. The complex linear webs in shades of green or orange describing Ferris wheel-type structures are especially engaging (Johnson).

JUDITH WESTPHALEN, Jan Van der Donk, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 691-5973 (through Nov. 21). This Peruvian painter (1922-1976) was a participant in Latin American artistic and intellectual circles. A four-decade survey of works on paper reveals a sensibility of urbane delicacy. Throughout, the artist engages in a dialogue with Cubism and Constructivism, producing compact compositions of layered, translucent planes in muted hues, shot through with cool, spacey light (Johnson).

SCOTT WIXON; LILIAN VOORHEES, Andre Zarre, 515 West 20th Street, (212) 255-0202 (through Nov. 9) All kinds of abstract elements crowd Mr. Wixon's modestly sized canvases. Puzzling together biomorphic, expressionistic, geological, spacey and funky forms in confectionery colors, he creates dense, jazzy improvisations of infectiously playful freedom. On larger canvases and in muted colors, Ms. Voorhees works variations on a vocabulary of semi-sculptural botanical forms (Johnson).

Other Galleries

* "THE AGES OF MANKIND: TIME TO HOPE," Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue, at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 932-7347 (through Nov. 24; daily, 9:30 a.m. to noon and 1 to 5 p.m.). All but unheralded, this show seems to have dropped into New York like an unbidden gift, and what a gift: 100 superb examples of Spanish religious art, which is some of the most rapturous and wrenching religious art ever made, seen in a perfect setting. The works include Romanesque madonnas, Gothic crucifixions, paintings of saints by El Greco and Goya, and a handwritten letter by St. Teresa of Avila, all from churches, monasteries and museums in the Spanish provinces of Castile and Leon. The images, among them life-size polychrome sculptures, are sexy, gruesome and, above all, theatrical, projecting big, primary emotions. The effect is gloriously intense (Cotter).

* "BETWEEN WORD AND IMAGE: MODERN IRANIAN VISUAL CULTURE," Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780 (through Dec. 7). This no-frills exhibition is about the dynamics of cultural borrowing, the inseparability of art and politics and the interplay of modernism and Islamicism. It begins with painting and sculptures from the 1960's in which Western styles and Iranian themes merge. It continues with riveting photographs documenting the arrival of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. And it concludes with art that the revolution produced: political posters inspired by both the Western counterculture and militant Islamic ideology. Depending on the amount of reflective synthesis you're willing to do, the results can seem richly layered, or disjointed and undercooked. But the materials and the ideas on display are fascinating (Cotter).

ALEX GREY, Tibet House, 22 West 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212) 807-0563 (through Jan. 3). Mr. Grey's painting, with its tantric symbolism, medical-illustration finesse and New Age optimism, might be described as psychedelic realism. In it, the human figure is rendered with X-ray, or CAT scan, transparency, the way Aldous Huxley saw a leaf when he was on mescalin. Mr. Grey's images have been appropriated by a countercultural audience: they have shown up on promotional posters for rave events and on paper used for blotter-style LSD. But they look right at home at Tibet House, where contemporary versions of religious tankas, meant for esoteric instruction and meditation, often hang (Cotter).

Last Chance

GEORGE BASELITZ, "Paintings and Drawings From the 1960's," Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212) 517-8677 (through tomorrow). Before this German Neo-Expressionist started turning his canvases upside down, he made earthy, saturnine paintings and drawings right side up. His gnarly, muddy pictures from the 60's of people and animals have an evocative, primordial quality and sometimes, as in a small ink portrait of a bare-chested Antonin Artaud, a strange delicacy (Johnson).

MARIA ELENA GONZALEZ, the Project, 427 West 126th Street, Harlem, 212 662-8610 (through Sunday). In these photographs, drawings and sculptures the content is less overtly autobiographical than in the artist's earlier work, and more dramatic. The central image is an electrical tower, a structure that generates energy but also, potentially, radiation. Ms. Gonzalez makes it look at once fragile and ominous, and the mood of unease gains force in the upstairs gallery, where part of the floor seems to be swelling as if from built-up internal pressure (Cotter).

JITISH KALLAT, Bose Pacia Modern, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7074 (through tomorrow). This young Indian artist made his New York solo debut three years ago with work that looked so fully resolved it was hard to imagine where he might take it from there. An answer comes in the new paintings here, in which he has expanded his scale, clarified his compositions and varied his palette. As before, he addresses political subjects -- AIDS, poverty and sectarian violence -- that have a very specific meaning in India, but are also of urgent concern elsewhere (Cotter).

* BERTY SKUBER, Emily Harvey, 537 Broadway, at Spring Street, 212 925-7651 (through tomorrow). Although Ms. Skuber has exhibited almost yearly in Europe for three decades, this is her first New York solo show since 1979. The main work is a series of three dozen extraordinary fabric collages, or miniquilts, stitched from clothing labels. Ms. Skuber began by using labels from her own clothes, but most have been contributed by friends and strangers around the world who heard about her project. It is both an international collaboration and a labor-intensive species of concrete poetry, minutely composed but random, personal but unsentimental (Cotter).

"TRUE MEDIUMS," Cavin-Morris, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3768 (through tomorrow). This fine exhibition features works by psychic mediums who used drawings to materialize receptions from the great beyond. It's not otherworldly imagery so much as the drawing itself that fascinates. Included are ghostly faces drawn with extreme delicacy by Fernand Desmoulin; mandalas like stained-glass windows by Norma Oliver; colorful, stratified landscapes by Agatha Wojciechowsky; and calligraphic flowers penciled by Helen Butler Wells (Johnson).

PETER WAITE, Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-6565 (through tomorrow). Mr. Waite's moody photo-derived paintings of modest suburban houses are made with a nice, economical touch that simplifies detail and delicately outlines forms to slightly cartoonish effect. A touching nostalgia calls to mind Edward Hopper. There is an up-to-date conceptual program, too: each home displays an American flag, making the series a meditation on patriotic kitsch (Johnson).

KAY WALKINGSTICK, June Kelly, 591 Broadway, at Houston Street, 212 226-1660 (through tomorrow). Ms. WalkingStick's two-panel paintings of landscapes and figures have always operated on a push-pull between nature and culture, material and spirit. Recently the artist has been spending time in Italy, and the look of the work has changed. The dark colors she once favored have been replaced by lavenders, pinks and luminous browns. A judicious use of gilding links her diptych format up with altarpieces, a connection that was probably always there but has never been obvious until now (Cotter).

 BODY:
HUDSON is a diamond in the rough that's midway through polishing. You can find a lovely old house for well under $75,000, but the neighbors will expect you to plunge into a restoration that's likely to cost you more. The major commercial street has some of the best antiques shopping in the Northeast, but you'll have to drive out of town to get to the supermarket, and while some of the neighbors concentrate on new parks and paths, others are supporting an 1,800-acre cement plant proposed for the next town over. 
 Hudson, an old port town on the Hudson River, has fewer than 8,000 people, but it is the only city in Columbia County, as well as the county seat. Two decades ago, with many shipping and industrial jobs lost, its fine old houses in a variety of styles -- Federal, Greek Revival, Victorian, Italianate, Queen Anne -- were in disrepair, and downtown stores were boarded up. But then outsiders discovered Hudson's architecture and low prices and began moving in, setting up artists' studios and starting small businesses, including dozens of antiques shops, and fixing up the houses. 
 "The idea of owning one of these old houses and restoring it to its former glory is tremendously appealing," said Carole Osterink, president of Historic Hudson, a nonprofit preservation group. The renovation goes on: scaffolding, ladders and work crews are as much a part of the local landscape as a Hudson River sunset. 
On weekends antiques hunters converge on Warren Street, which now has more than 70 antiques shops as well as art galleries and restaurants. Celebrities, accompanied by their interior decorators, are sometimes in the crowds: Whoopi Goldberg, Meg Ryan, Richard Gere and Bette Midler have all been spotted, according to Tim Dunleavy, owner of Rural Residence, a home-furnishings store on Warren Street. 
Many longtime residents remain in Hudson, and there is a rich ethnic mix. Most of the newcomers who are transforming the downtown live in Hudson year round, sometimes telecommuting with the help of Mid-Hudson Cable, a high-speed cable service. But the second-home market is growing. 

The Scene
Hudson is bounded on three sides by Greenport and on the fourth by the Hudson River. Entering from the south, Route 9G passes rolling hills, woodlands and marshes, and the Hudson Correctional Facility. On the east side of town is Kaz, a maker of vaporizers and humidifiers and a prominent Hudson employer. Across the city line, in Greenport, is a sprawl of car dealerships, gas stations and fast-food outlets. 
Hudson proper was founded by settlers who arrived from Nantucket in 1784 and laid out the city grid: numbered streets -- First through Seventh -- run north to south and are bisected east to west by Allen, Union, Warren, Columbia and State Streets. In its early days the city was a bawdy whaling town (despite being on the river rather than directly on the ocean). The street signs have tiny whales imprinted on them as a tribute to the past. 
At the riverside, the just-opened Hudson Waterfront Park offers an expansive view, and in warm weather, boats and Jet Skis cruise to and from the busy adjacent marina. Nearby, the restored Victorian railroad station, now used by Amtrak, deposits commuters and visitors on Front Street. Plans include the renovation of Promenade Hill, a public walkway overlooking the Hudson.

Pros
If you want to own a second home in a place where you can make a difference, Hudson may be your town. A strong sense of civic activism runs through its core. People have an opportunity to get involved here, and many do, whether raising money for the public library or joining a committee to restore a historic building. Weekenders are more than welcome to participate. 
Cultural activities are abundant. You can attend plays at the Hudson River Theater; films at Time & Space Limited, a performing arts center; poetry readings at the Hudson Opera House; and classical music performances at the Pleshakov Music Center, a former bank building converted to a concert hall. 
Escaping to the country takes just minutes by car. Skiing is nearby, and Saratoga Springs, Tanglewood and the Berkshire foothills are all an hour or less away. 
The Hudson Power Boat Association, a private club along the river, has 100 members, mostly local motorboat enthusiasts, but weekenders can also join. 
The city has several good restaurants, including the vegetarian-friendly Earth Foods; Red Dot, a funky neighborhood bistro that serves globally accented comfort fare; and Paramount Grill, with a creative menu including cornmeal-crusted pan-fried catfish and Caribbean jerk chicken. 

Cons
Don't consider Hudson if you are not willing to invest time and money in restoration. Virtually all houses require some degree of work, and the cost in some cases runs into six figures. 
Though Hudson borders the river, there is limited access to the water. Most properties do not have a river view. While you can enjoy a close-up river view at the beautifully manicured Waterfront Park, swimming is strictly prohibited there because of its proximity to the train tracks and marina. 
There is a shortage of services like dry cleaners and cash machines, and supermarkets are across the city line in Greenport. 
Differences in social and economic status have resulted in a sometimes uneasy coexistence between longtime residents and recent newcomers. "There are native Hudsonians who feel left out of Hudson's transformation, resulting in a cultural gulf that has yet to be resolved," said Don Christensen, a freelance financial writer, who, with his wife, Jo Bredwell, a senior partner at J. Walter Thompson, bought a weekend house in Hudson in 1985. 
Though crimeslike robbery and assault, are not a major concern, there are some problems with drug dealing. Overall, weekenders and Manhattan transplants say they feel relatively safe. 
"Just realize this is definitely not the Hamptons," said Ulrik Trojaborg, who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and bought an 18th-century post-and-beam house off Union Street last summer with his partner. 
Adding to this simmering tension is a rift over the proposal by St. Lawrence Cement, a Canadian company, for an 1,800-acre complex in Greenport. Plans include a blasting quarry, 20-story towers, a 400-foot smokestack and a two-mile conveyor belt to the Hudson riverfront.
"Stop the Plant" signs tend to pop up in newcomers' front yards, while "Support the Plant" signs are often seen where longtime residents live.

The Market
In the past year and a half property values in Hudson have increased by at least 30 percent, said Kathleen Thorsey, a mortgage consultant for the Valley Mortgage Company in Hudson. 
Many New Yorkers have been buying property in Hudson this past year, said the Rev. Kim Singletary, the Hudson city assessor. 
Peggy Lampton, who owns Peggy Lampton Real Estate in Claverack, a few miles southeast of Hudson, also finds the Hudson market brisk. "I was amazed to find that 51 Hudson properties on our multiple listing are now under contract to sell," she said. "Buyers haven't entered any bidding wars yet, but the potential is definitely there." 
Second-home seekers will find prices as diverse as Hudson's architecture. Least available are buildings in move-in condition, with prices ranging from $85,000 to $150,000. Buyers can still get houses for $35,000 to $65,000 if they are willing to invest in restoration or consider buying in areas away from the center of the city's transformation, said Judy Meyer, an associate broker at Coldwell Banker Bartolotta Associates in Hudson (518-828-7111).
Coldwell Banker Bartolotta listings this week included a small farmhouse-style dwelling for $39,000 in a transitional neighborhood near the train station and a large fixer-upper Victorian, with high ceilings and the original woodwork, for $127,000. A three-floor post-and-beam house with a stone foundation on the waterfront end of Warren Street recently dropped from $179,900 to $170,000.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
Midcentury Italian Art That Still Eggs On the Irreverent

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA SMITH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 

 BODY:
Given that tall oaks from little acorns grow, it seems obvious that not all influential art is great art. The significance of an artwork can lie less in its objective presence than in its conceptual ripple effect, and what other artists get from it. Which is why we find ourselves still enduring some of the aftershocks of the art of the late 1960's and early 1970's, as silly, desultory, ephemeral and irritating, as it sometimes was. If Conceptual Art is by now a kind of folk art, whose most extreme states include television commercials and the anarchic feats of "Jackass the Movie," younger artists still build quite solidly on its innovations. 
 This is one of the impressions created by "Zero to Infinity: Arte Povera, 1962-72," an edifying if uneven survey at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden here. It was organized by Richard Flood, chief curator at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, and Francis Morris, senior curator at the Tate Modern in London, and coordinated by Phyllis Rosenzweig, the Hirshhorn's curator of works on paper. 
 The exhibition delves into the Conceptually based art of an irreverent band of Italian artists whose efforts are an important point of origin for much late-20th-century and early-21st-century art. Ranging from a curvaceous frost-covered ladder by Pier Paolo Calzolari to a blank piece of cardboard plopped on the floor according to Emilio Prini's instructions, the show exhibits more than 100 works by 14 artists -- with Jannis Kounellis, Aligierhi Boetti, Michelangelo Pistoletto and Gilberto Zorio providing most of the interest. It suffers from a kind of "my sister/my daughter" effect. 
The show sheds new light on the Italian avant-garde of the 1960's, which is not well enough known in the United States. So it provides a crucial backdrop against which to consider American Conceptualism as well as the subversiveness and questioning nature that are so endemic to art today.
Yet much of the work filling the Hirshhorn's second floor is more sophomoric than sublime, more irksome than genuinely radical; and not enough of it dates from before 1966 to quite justify the show's title. As for infinity, only a few of the artists here even reached triple digits. And by the way, none started from zero: their efforts are haunted by precedents.
These include the classical beauty of Renaissance art, the eerie juxtapositions of de Chirico and Magritte, and the reductivist tendencies of European and American artists in the 1950's. The Arte Poverachiks followed a decade in which Yves Klein exhibited an empty gallery as art, Piero Manzoni offered cans of his excrement as sculpture, Lucio Fontana made paintings by slashing or punching holes in the canvas and Robert Rauschenberg sent a telegram to his Paris art dealer, Iris Clert, announcing, "This is art if I say so." 
Building deliberately and sometimes inspiredly on precedents like these, the artists of Arte Povera waged an insinuating, provocative, usually elegant assault on art. They came together in one of the last consciously fomented art movements of the 20th century. The term, which means poor or impoverished art, was coined by the young art critic Germano Celant in 1967 in a catalog essay he wrote to accompany a show of seven young Italian artists that he organized in Genoa. The original seven grew to 14 artists whom Celant wrote about and exhibited under the Arte Povera banner until 1972, when he announced that it was time for the artists to pursue individual endeavors. 
They also participated in historic exhibitions like Harald Szeemann's "When Attitudes Become Form" at the Zurich Kunsthaus in 1969 and, in 1971, Kynaston McShine's "Information" at the Museum of Modern Art and Mr. Celant's "Conceptual Art, Arte Povera, Land Art" in Turin. These brought together international groupings, variously labeled Post-Minimalism (coined by the American critic Robert Pincus-Witten), Process Art, L'Art Informel, Antiform Art and Conceptual Art. Their common ground included a certain disregard for the finished art object; a preference for everyday, sometimes organic materials; the use of performance, language and photography; and an inclination to claim various social events as art.
Traceable, ultimately, to the work of Marcel Duchamp, such tendencies paralleled the social changes brought about by the student movement, feminism and opposition to the Vietnam War. The Arte Provera artists also reacted to the growing materialism of postwar Italy, whose economic recovery, called the Italian Miracle, had been begun by the Marshall Plan and then sustained by the innovations of Italian design, evident in cars, furnishings and fashion.
The stylistic and physical diversity of the work in this exhibition sometimes makes any notion of an art movement seem tenuous. Pistoletto's slick Photo-Realist images on mirrors are a far cry from Mr. Kounellis's loose assemblings of materials and objects. The gallery devoted to his work, which is the show's most impressive, includes burlap sacks filled with rice, beans and other staples and a series of scales piled with ground coffee. Yet both artists shared a desire to startle, involve and impinge on the viewer.
The show opens with a short scratchy video of one of Arte Povera's greatest moments of impingement: the opening of Mr. Kounellis's exhibition at the Galleria L'Attico in Rome in 1969. In a former parking garage with a floor of gleaming ceramic tile, he tethered a dozen horses to the walls. (I'm sure I'm not the only person who remembers poring over the spare, evocative image of this event in Mr. McShine's catalog to his 1971 "Information" show.) 
The Italians, especially, embraced instablity and natural forces as artistic elements. Giovanni Anselmo used lettuce, wire and granite to create a precarious sculptural arrangement that can survive only as long as the vegetable is regularly replaced. Mr. Kounellis grew cactus in long metal troughs, contrasting the bristling forms with smooth metal surfaces. And in an especially fierce piece, Mr. Zorio pounded rope, coiled to spell "odio" (hate), into a piece of lead, leaving enough to hang the work from the ceiling, as if to demonstrate the enduring strength of the emotion.
The exhibition reminds us that Boetti made paintings from camouflage in 1966, more than a decade before Andy Warhol turned to the motif. It includes startling revelations, like an opulent installation piece by Marisa Merz involving huge coils and tendrils of aluminum hanging from the ceiling (think of Nancy Rubins doing clouds instead of crashed planes). There are also little-known early pieces, like a tall cone that Mario Merz, Ms. Merz's husband, had a basketmaker weave, a predecessor to his more ingratiating glass igloos. There are also relative classics: Boetti's embroidered maps of the world; Mr. Pistoletto's big sphere of weathered newspapers, which seems to have rolled out of one of Kurt Schwitters's Merzbau environments or a painting by Miro; Mr. Kounellis's doorway filled with stones. 
I think reactions to this show can only be mixed. At times you may find yourself trying to stifle the impression that many of the artists are firstborn sons whose mothers viewed their every scribble as an act of genius. There is also the issue of an inescapable Italian elegance, the stylishness that infuses even the most modest or quirky materials; it often seems of a piece with, rather than a reaction against, the glamorous designs of the Italian Miracle. In the show's final gallery, Luciano Fabro's enormous birds' feet, made of carved-stone and silk, might almost be by Ettore Sottsass or Gaetano Pesce.
But the charm, ephemeral beauty and lightness of much of this work also reflects a conscious ambivalence about the act of making permanent art objects. And this ambivalence, transmitted to artists as varied as Sarah Lucas, Thomas Hirschhorn, Maurizio Catellan, Rirkrit Tiravanija and Felix Gonzalez-Torres, may be Arte Povera's greatest legacy.

"Zero to Infinity: Arte Povera, 1962-72" is at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Independence Avenue at Seventh Street SW, Washington, (202) 357-2700, through Jan. 20.

HEADLINE: Gloom Grows for Japan's Exporters 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
As the big Japanese brand-name manufacturers report their half-year earnings, it is becoming clear that they are bracing for a very tough holiday season.
 Sinking American consumer confidence, rumblings of war in the Middle East and the lingering threat of disruptions from a labor dispute in the ports of the American West Coast are worrying even the most robust of the companies, like Sony and Toyota Motor. Some of the manufacturers have already reduced their earnings expectations, while others are holding their breath. 
 Two of the biggest, Fuji Photo Film and Hitachi, said today that they were sharply lowering their forecasts for the full year despite a profitable showing in the six months ended Sept. 30. Like Sony and Matsushita Electric Industrial earlier this week, they also raised concerns about the faltering rate of growth in their most important foreign market, the United States, and about the cloudy prospects for technology spending. 
Their unease underscores the way much of the fate of Japan's economy rests on the shoulders of American shoppers. If Americans shrug off their losses in the stock market and keep buying video game consoles and minivans, Japan's economy will continue to grow, however limply. But if worries about jobs and battered retirement savings make Americans hesitant to splurge, Japanese exports to the United States will erode further, and the economy will contract.
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi is already under pressure to break his pledge to cap the growth of the national debt and agree to approve heavy deficit spending to stimulate the economy. A new recession would redouble that pressure. But even if Mr. Koizumi goes along, it may take months to assemble a big new package of spending, time the economy does not have.
Japan's trade surplus, which grew in the first half of 2002, has already reversed course and started to shrink. Exports had been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise dismal Japanese economy, and exports to America have been the main lifeline for manufacturers. But that rope is fraying, executives say.
"We started sensing something this summer," said Sony's chief financial officer, Teruhisa Tokunaka, "and our people in the U.S. felt that consumer demand would decline there." On Monday, Mr. Tokunaka said the company had cut 100 billion yen ($813 million) off its revenue target for the full fiscal year, which ends March 31. "I hope we don't have to downgrade our earnings again," he said. "It all depends on how we perform in the October-December quarter."
Japanese automakers and electronics manufacturers earn as much as four-fifths of their profits in North America. Some, like Honda Motor, have more sales in America than at home, where consumer spending remains weak.
With their lower forecasts today, Hitachi and Fuji Film joined a growing list of exporters that are scaling back expectations. Though Hitachi made money in the half-year ended Sept. 30 -- a big improvement on a disastrous 2001 -- it cut its forecast for net income in the fiscal year by 40 percent and made similar trims in its outlook for sales and operating profits.
Fuji Film said its profits fell 28 percent in the half-year in yen terms, mainly because of the yen's rise against the dollar over the period. Fuji, which makes about one-fifth of its sales in America, also reduced its profit forecast by 26 percent for the full year.
The drumbeat of downgrades is enervating an already shaky stock market. The main index fell 1.3 percent today and is close to a 19-year low.
Investors worried about economic weakness and unimpressed by the government's latest plan to deal with the country's bad bank loans bid up the prices for government bonds, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond below 1 percent for the first time in four years.
"Unfortunately, the probability is very high that exports will stop supporting the Japanese economy," said Akio Makabe, an economist at Mizuho Research Institute. "It all depends on the American situation. If the U.S. economy deteriorates, it will be a big problem for Japan."
Japanese companies with plants in the United States also face the job of getting their operations back to normal after West Coast ports were shut down in a labor dispute several weeks ago.
Toyota Motor said this week that the lockout at the ports would wind up costing the company about 10 billion yen ($81 million) this year. Mr. Tokunaka, of Sony, said his company had to resort to air shipments for some goods; he declined to give a figure for the added cost.
The recent weakening of the yen against the dollar -- it is down by almost 5 percent since early September -- helps manufacturers here a bit. But the trend may be halted and its effects neutralized by slowing demand in the United States, analysts said.
Manufacturers would prefer stronger demand to a weaker currency. "I am worried about consumer demand in the U.S. between Thanksgiving and Christmas," said Kunio Nakamura, president of Matsushita Electric, best known for its Panasonic brand. Noting that pressure to cut prices was intensifying, he said, "I wonder how this quarter will turn out."

HEADLINE: Phone I.P.O. Is Postponed In China 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
The China Telecom Corporation today abruptly postponed its $3.68 billion initial public offering, which was to have been Asia's biggest deal this year, in response to weak demand and a web of regulations that made it hard to lower the deal's price.
 At a time when telecommunications stocks around the world are trading for small fractions of what they commanded two years ago, it had seemed that China Telecom might become one of the few success stories. A state-owned enterprise, it is the main provider of fixed-line telephone service in some of the wealthiest provinces of China, which in turn is the world's fastest-growing large economy, expanding at 8 percent a year. 
 But instead of setting a price today for its shares, which were to start trading on Wednesday in New York and next Thursday here, the company's executives and investment bankers delayed the deal. They began looking at ways to rewrite the prospectus and to return checks to retail investors. 
"We will relaunch the deal no later than early next week," said a person close to the transaction.
The prospectus set a price range of 1.48 to 1.71 Hong Kong dollars (19 to 22 American cents). The retail portion of the transaction, just 5 percent of the shares, was fully subscribed, but the rest of the shares, for institutional investors, were not.
A complex interaction of Chinese and Hong Kong securities regulations prevented China Telecom from cutting the price below 1.48 Hong Kong dollars to make sure the offering went through, people close to the deal said.
Under rules designed to prevent fraud, China bars the sale of shares in state-owned enterprises for less than the net asset value per share. In the case of China Telecom, the net asset value for the deal as now structured is just under 1.47 Hong Kong dollars per share, leaving almost no room for further price reductions.
In some markets, companies would be able to get around this restriction by tweaking some terms of the deal, such as reducing the number of shares sold. But the Hong Kong Securities Futures Commission bars practically any change to the terms of a deal unless a new prospectus is issued.
Growing worries among many Americans about the health of the economy, as shown by consumer confidence data released on Tuesday, were the final blow to the deal's prospects, financial experts said today.
In a seemingly desperate bid to increase profits and impress investors, China Telecom abruptly declared late last week that it would increase eightfold the fees it charges to local phone companies in Hong Kong for accepting calls from them, beginning on Friday. Several Hong Kong phone companies announced on Wednesday that they would double or even triple their charges for calls to China to cover the extra charges.
The increase in call-completion charges, approved by Beijing, has outraged politicians and business executives here, who assert that the increase is inconsistent with China's strategy of developing Hong Kong as the financial and commercial hub of southern China.
The person close to the China Telecom transaction said the company and its advisers remained convinced that the deal could proceed with only modest adjustments. "We are at the stage where we have a doable transaction structure," the person said.
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and the China International & Capital Corporation have been advising China Telecom on the deal.
The Hang Seng Index of large stocks traded in Hong Kong dropped 1.25 percent today, partly in response to the deal's delay, but the mood was not entirely gloomy. In a separate offering, shares in Standard Chartered, a large bank based in London but with extensive operations in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia, began trading here this morning.
The shares rose 3.6 percent, to 87 Hong Kong dollars ($11.15) a share, practically the same price at which the stock trades in London. If a 15 percent overallotment is exercised, the offering could raise 2.94 billion Hong Kong dollars ($377 million) for the bank.

HEADLINE: Economy Grows At 3.1% Rate, But Shows Strain 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
The economy grew at a moderate 3.1 percent rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department estimated yesterday, but there were indications that growth may be slowing as the year comes to an end.
 Consumer spending accounted for virtually all the growth during the summer months. And though gains in personal income remain healthy, the capacity of households to spend is starting to show signs of strain. 
 "Consumer spending hit a brick wall in September," said Ethan S. Harris, one of two chief economists at Lehman Brothers. "If you took the first two months of the quarter, they're probably consistent with something like 4.5 percent growth. If you take the last month of the quarter, it's more like zero." 
The overall growth rate fell somewhat short of expectations. If today's employment report for October confirms that the economy is losing momentum, many analysts expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates when it meets on Wednesday, the day after the election.
Government spending and spending on housing, both of which helped prop up the economy late in 2001 and early this year, rose only slightly in the third quarter.
On the bright side, however, business investment in buildings, equipment and software increased 0.6 percent, reversing a steep downward trend that had run through seven consecutive quarters.
The trade deficit continued to hamper growth. It ballooned to $437.3 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, or 4.2 percent of the entire economy.
Forward-looking data hinted at slower growth. Initial claims for unemployment benefits stayed high last week, at 410,000. Wages rose by just 0.5 percent in the third quarter, compared with 1 percent in the second. And investors' forebodings deepened yesterday when the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago announced that its index of manufacturing activity, often a reliable predictor of nationwide figures, fell sharply in October.
Measures of consumer confidence by the University of Michigan and the Conference Board have also fallen sharply, according to reports published earlier this week.
The series of mildly disappointing reports could help pave the way for the Federal Reserve to lower short-term interest rates for the first time since last December. According to Bridgewater Associates, an investment manager, interest rates now imply that traders are giving the Federal Reserve a 90 percent chance of lowering the federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks to 1.5 percent from 1.75 percent next week. In the middle of October, the estimated probability was 23 percent.
Despite that, David Malpass, chief economist of Bear, Stearns, cautioned against reading too much into yesterday's report. "This report probably is a neutral for the Fed," he said, adding that today's report on employment from the Labor Department should have a stronger influence on the board.
Other economists predicted that the Fed would wait before lowering rates again. "My guess is that they'll probably stick to their guns, unless they know something we don't know," said Mark Gertler, a professor of economics at New York University. "They have to be vigilant, but the situation doesn't seem desperate."
Indeed, the rate of economic growth in the third quarter fell to a range that would have been considered quite healthy before the Internet boom of the late 1990's.
But despite strong improvements in crucial economic matters like productivity and corporate profits, worries about accounting scandals and a possible war with Iraq have eclipsed economic fundamentals in the minds of some consumers, Mr. Harris said. "This is nervousness well beyond what the official data on the economy suggests they should have," he said.
Mr. Harris added that the allure of interest-free financing for cars and other big-ticket items was beginning to fade. Detroit's Big Three offered those deals through the summer, and sales of cars, trucks and parts increased 10 percent. Now, Mr. Harris said, "they can't even get sales up to normal levels."
Many forecasters expected the economy to expand by 3.5 percent or 4 percent in the third quarter, far outpacing the second quarter's meager rate of 1.3 percent, before weakening in the fourth quarter. That said, the summer's lower-than-expected growth could suggest a slight lift for the future.
Mr. Malpass said that corporate inventories shrank by less than 0.1 percent after two quarters of strong gains. "The lowness of inventories coming out of the third quarter ends up being a timing shift," he said. "You subtract some from third quarter, and you add it to the fourth quarter." Mr. Malpass had expected growth of 3.7 percent in the third quarter.
It may take more than a small boost to loosen corporate purse strings, Mr. Harris said. "Every component of business behavior is slowing instead of accelerating. They're just saying: 'We don't want to buy. We don't want to get out there and hire.' "
Although overall business investment is no longer declining, investment in commercial buildings like factories, offices and warehouses fell 16 percent during the summer, the fourth consecutive double-digit quarterly decline.
Companies may be content to sit on their current assets, Professor Gertler suggested, so the lag before the recovery appears robust may be longer than those after previous recessions. In any case, he said, "it's way too early to panic."

Electronic Data Leads Technology Up, but Blue Chips Fall

BYLINE:  By Reuters

 BODY:
The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average slipped yesterday ahead of crucial economic data expected in the next few days, but technology shares received a lift from Electronic Data Systems.
 Unemployment figures from October are scheduled to be released today, and the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates is expected next week. Investors, who saw the Dow rack up its best month since 1987 with a 10.6 percent surge, were holding back until they see signs the economy is improving or whether the Fed cuts rates. 
 "You've had some great run-ups, and people don't know if it's for real or if they're going to get duped again," said Anthony Iuliano, head equity trader for the Glenmede Trust Company. "People don't want to commit." 
Investors are beginning to expect that the Fed will have to cut rates again to head off a possible slide back into recession after yesterday's data on economic growth and manufacturing suggested weakness.
Signs of possible corporate scandal also worried Wall Street after the hospital chain Tenet Healthcare said prosecutors in California were investigating accusations that one of its centers falsely billed for unnecessary procedures. The broader market, which had been flat for much of the session, slid sharply after Tenet's announcement.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.38 points, or 0.36 percent, to 8,397.03. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 4.95 points, or 0.56 percent, at 885.76. The technology-heavy Nasdaq was up 3.02 points, or 0.23 percent, at 1,329.75. 
Technology shares gained, lifting the Nasdaq, after Electronic Data Systems posted results that beat its lowered forecasts. Electronic Data jumped $1.31, or 9.5 percent, to $15.06. A rival, I.B.M., rose 27 cents, to $78.94.
Tenet Healthcare lost more than a quarter of its market value, falling $10.22, to $28.75, after the hospital chain said that prosecutors in California were investigating accusations of false billing. The company said in a release that it had "no reason to believe the allegations are true."
On a brighter note, PacifiCare Health Systems rose $5.14, or 21 percent, to $29.56 after the company, which is the largest Medicare health plan provider, posted quarterly profit that doubled and beat Wall Street forecasts as it kept premiums in line with medical costs. 
Among energy companies, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell and ChevronTexaco , three of the world's largest oil companies, reported lower results as troubled economies crippled the business of refining and selling fuels.
Still, investors said they were pleased that Royal Dutch's profits fell less than expected, and they sent its American-traded shares up $1.10, to $42.78. But Exxon Mobil fell 42 cents, to $33.66, while ChevronTexaco lost $3.77, to $67.63. 
The latest economic reports showed weaker-than-expected economic growth in the third quarter, and market watchers said the numbers pointed to weaker growth in the coming quarters.
Gross domestic product, which measures total output and is the broadest gauge of total economic performance, climbed at a 3.1 percent annual rate from July to September, well ahead of the preceding quarter's 1.3 percent rate, but less than the 3.6 percent growth forecast. 
Another report showed that manufacturing in the Midwest contracted for the second consecutive month in October, shrinking at a faster pace than in September, according to the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago. 
In the bond market, prices for Treasury notes increased as the equity markets slipped.
The price of the 10-year note increased 17/32 , to 103 28/32 , while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 3.90 percent from 3.96 percent on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond increased 19/32 , to 105 28/32 . The yield fell to 4.99 percent from 5.03 percent.

HEADLINE: Questions Are Raised on Finances of Marriott Hotel Unit 

BYLINE:  By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
Some investors are raising questions about Marriott International and are focusing on the financial state of an off-balance-sheet entity that contributes a significant part of its profits to the hotel-management company.
 The entity, CBM Joint Venture L.L.C., has caught the attention of investors because its largest unit, Courtyard by Marriott II L.P., said in a recent regulatory filing that it would not make cash payments for various fees to the owners of CBM -- which include Marriott -- for at least the fourth quarter. In addition, Courtyard by Marriott II said it might defer interest payments to Marriott on a $200 million loan made to CBM. 
 The moves are intended to help Courtyard by Marriott II save money in order to pay its nearly $436 million in debts. 
Marriott and Host Marriott, a separate, publicly traded hotel company, are partners in CBM, which includes 120 hotels catering to budget business travelers under the Courtyard name. Host owns the 120 hotels, and Marriott, based in Bethesda, Md., manages the properties. Courtyard by Marriott II is made up of 70 of the hotels. 
Host and Marriott share in any profits after Marriott's fees and the debt payments are paid. The joint venture's other unit, Courtyard by Marriott I L.P., does not have any public filings, and its financial condition is unclear.
About 25 percent of Marriott's interest income of $94 million in 2001 came from CBM. Marriott had net income of $236 million for 2001. Courtyard by Marriott II earned $1.4 million in the recent quarter, down from $4.5 million a year ago.
Some analysts and investors are concerned that financial problems at CBM and Courtyard by Marriott II could hurt Marriott. 
In a research note dated Oct. 21, Steven Kent, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, wrote that with CBM, Marriott may be setting itself up "to take a charge down the road." 
But Marriott's chief financial officer, Arne M. Sorenson, said yesterday that such concerns were exaggerated. When asked if Marriott might take a charge against CBM, he said, "No, the chances are nearly nil." Still, he said, the operating environment for hotels amid the weak economy and slumping travel sector was difficult.
According to the regulatory filing, payments to Marriott that Courtyard by Marriott II expects to halt include a part of the base management fee and all incentive and ground rent fees -- its core fees to Marriott. Last quarter, the fees totaled about $8.7 million, according to the regulatory filing. Courtyard by Marriott II is already $58.8 million behind in various fees to Marriott. 
Courtyard by Marriott II said in the filing that it would defer payment of the interest until it had more cash on hand. It had $2.6 million in operating cash on Sept. 6, when its third quarter ended.
Mr. Kent wrote in his Oct. 21 note that Marriott had declined to disclose how many hotels in its portfolio were not paying cash interest on Marriott loans. 
Mr. Sorenson said Courtyard by Marriott II would pay all but $1 million or $2 million of the interest due this quarter on the Marriott loan. To date, he said, CBM had made all of its loan interest payments to Marriott. 
The Courtyard by Marriott II filing also said CBM would have enough cash to meet its mortgage and senior debt payments, which are senior to the Marriott loan. 
Short sellers, who benefit from any bad news that hurts the prices of stocks they bet on, have pummeled Marriott shares in recent weeks, partly on concerns about CBM.
Shares of Marriott closed at $30.93 yesterday, down 33 cents. 
Kynikos Associates, a New York firm the specializes in short selling, has said that CBM accounted for 13 percent of Marriott's pretax income last year, excluding special charges, of $542 million, or $69 million. Marriott has contended that when other payments are figured in, the figure is 6 percent. 
Either way, Courtyard by Marriott II accounted for about 58 percent, or around $40 million, of the joint venture's total payments to Marriott last year, according to Marriott's 2001 annual filing.

HEADLINE: Big Three Carmakers Expect Sharp Drop in Monthly Sales 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Carmakers are expecting a sharp falloff when they report October sales on Friday, and some analysts fear that a second consecutive month of slumping results could indicate an end to boom times for auto sales. 
 Many analysts have been cutting back their expectations for October throughout the month, and J. D. Power & Associates is forecasting sales at the lowest monthly rate in four years. 
 To compensate for diminishing demand, General Motors and Ford Motor have gone to new lengths in their price war. G.M., which will announce a new incentive plan on Friday, has not only been offering buyers interest-free loans but is also allowing some customers to defer payments for 90 days. Ford has been extending the duration of its longest loan, traditionally five years, to six years on a few vehicles. 
Such deals have helped G.M. gain a small amount of market share this year while Ford's share has fallen considerably. The profits of both companies, however, have been relatively slight.
"The Big Three are throwing more and more at the market and getting less and less impact," said Stephen J. Girsky, an auto industry analyst at Morgan Stanley.
Economists are monitoring the car industry's health closely because buoyant consumer spending has kept the economy growing this year and strong auto sales have been a crucial factor. Most analysts expect a drop in year-over-year sales of 20 percent to 30 percent but are more concerned with the pattern of falling sales over the last couple months. 
Sales have been propelled by Detroit's free financing and other lavish incentives put in place after the Sept. 11 attacks. Last October, when G.M. spurred a price war with its Keep America Rolling interest-free financing deals, auto sales jumped to their highest monthly rate ever.
A year later, there is concern from Wall Street and some industry executives that consumers now think of the high level of incentives as the status quo. That could put continued pressure on the Big Three's profitability without bolstering their sales.
Manfred Gentz, the chief financial officer at DaimlerChrysler, parent of the Chrysler Group, said in a conference call last week that the price war was "destroying the structure of our earnings."
"It is deteriorating our bottom line, and it isn't sustainable," he said.
Mark Zandi, the chief economist at the research company Economy.com, said auto sales had been a crucial source of economic strength and "instrumental in pushing the economy into recovery this year." 
"Consumers really have only been buying homes and cars with any gusto, so continued strong car buying is key to keeping the recovery going," he said, adding, "The October numbers, if the warnings are proven correct, are disconcerting." 
Analysts generally expect this year's industry sales in the United States to be about 16.8 million cars and light trucks -- which include sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans -- making it one of the best years on record. But there is concern about next year, and many analysts think October's seasonally adjusted annual selling rate will be close to 16 million units and an indicator of things to come.
J. D. Power & Associates, which monitors sales data from more than 5,900 dealer franchises nationwide, is forecasting October sales at an annual rate of 15.5 million units, which would be the lowest rate in four years. 
Robert Schnorbus, chief economist for J. D. Power, said he thought the general uneasiness over economic uncertainties and a potential war in Iraq were catching up to car buyers. He also said he thought auto sales were suffering from the fact that many 2002 models were cleared out before October, when they were gift-wrapped with huge incentive deals like five-year interest-free loans. By comparison, three-year interest-free deals that remain on 2003 models might seem tame. 
"Consumers think it's a buyers' market," he said. "If you cut back incentives, consumers will wait you out. To some extent the less confident the consumer becomes the harder you have to work to overcome that and push on incentives."
Susan Jacobs, president of the research firm Jacobs & Associates, said: "My main concern is whether this kind of slump can be fixed with incentives as manufacturers did after the slump in the spring. The two-month decline, September and October, may indicate that the consumer actually has changed their attitude in a way that is catching up with all the negative news we've had in the past -- the drop in the market, the drop in consumer confidence, the weak job market."
David L. Littman, chief economist at Comerica Bank, said, "The months that are absolutely crucial in signifying next year are October and November."
"That tells you how well these new models are selling," he added, "and it looks like they'll be in the 16 to 16.5 million range instead of 16.5 to 17 million next year."
But such a falloff is hardly a dire one for the industry, he said, and he still expects stronger economic growth next year because other sectors that have been depressed should recover and compensate.
"Travel will pick up from these depressed levels," Mr. Littman said. "I think there has been improvement in PC's and electronic devices, and that will make up some of it and the home improvements will be strong, too."

HEADLINE: Scientists Say a Quest for Clean Energy Must Begin Now 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Meeting the world's rising energy needs without increasing global warming will require a research effort as ambitious as the Apollo project to put a man on the moon, a diverse group of scientists and engineers is reporting today.
 To supply energy needs 50 years from now without further influencing the climate, up to three times the total amount of energy now generated using coal, oil, and other fossil fuels will have to be produced using methods that generate no heat-trapping greenhouse gases, the scientists said in today's issue of the journal Science. In addition, they said, the use of fossil fuels will have to decline, and to achieve these goals research will have to begin immediately. 
 Without prompt action, the atmosphere's concentration of greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, is expected to double from pre-industrial levels by the end of this century, the scientists said. 
"A broad range of intensive research and development is urgently needed to produce technological options that can allow both climate stabilization and economic development,"the team said.
The researchers called for intensive new efforts to improve existing technologies and develop others like fusion reactors or space-based solar power plants. They did not estimate how much such a research effort would cost, but it is considered likely to run into tens of billions of dollars in government and private funds.
The researchers, a team of 18 scientists from an array of academic, federal, and private research centers, said many options should be explored because some were bound to fail and success, somewhere, was essential.
The researchers all work at institutions that might themselves benefit from increased energy research spending, but other experts not involved in the work said the new analysis was an important, and sobering, refinement of earlier projections. 
As they now exist, most energy technologies, the scientists said, "have severe deficiencies." Solar panels, new nuclear power options, windmills, filters for fossil fuel emissions and other options are either inadequate or require vastly more research and development than is currently planned in the United States or elsewhere, they said.
The assessment contrasts with an analysis of climate-friendly energy options made last year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international panel of experts that works under United Nations auspices. That analysis concluded that existing technologies, diligently applied, would solve much of the problem.
One author of the new analysis, Dr. Haroon S. Kheshgi, is a chemical engineer for Exxon Mobil, whose primary focus remains oil, which along with coal generates most of the carbon dioxide accumulating in the air from human activities.
Still, Dr. Kheshgi said on Thursday that "climate change is a serious risk" requiring a shift away from fossil fuels. "You need a quantum jump in technology," he said. "What we're talking about here is a 50- to 100-year time scale." 
Dr. Martin I. Hoffert, the lead author and a New York University physics professor, said he was convinced the technological hurdles could be overcome, but worried that the public and elected officials may not see the urgency. 
In interviews, several of the authors and other experts said there were few signs that major industrial nations were ready to engage in an ambitious quest for clean energy. 
Prof. Richard L. Schmalensee, a climate-policy expert and the dean of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, said the issue of climate change remained too complex and contentious to generate the requisite focus. "There is no substitute for political will," he said.
The Bush administration has resisted sharp shifts in energy policy while Europe and Japan have accepted a climate treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, that includes binding deadlines for modest cuts in gas emissions. At international climate talks that end today in New Delhi, leaders of developing countries rejected limits on their fast-growing use of fossil fuels, saying rich countries should act first. 
President Bush has called for more research, led by the Energy Department, on many of the technologies examined in the new analysis. But some energy and climate experts said the extent of the challenge would likely require far more focus and money than now exists.
Among the possibilities are space-based arrays of solar panels that might beam energy to earth using microwaves. The panel described various nuclear options, including the still-distant fusion option and new designs for fission-based power plants that might overcome limits on uranium and other fuels.
Planting forests, which absorb carbon dioxide, cannot possibly keep up with the anticipated growth in energy use as developing countries become industrialized and as global population rises toward nine billion or more, the panel said.
Some environmental campaigners criticized the study's focus on still-distant technologies, saying it could distract from the need to do what is possible now to reduce emissions of warming gases. 
"Techno-fixes are pipe dreams in many cases," said Kert Davies, research director for Greenpeace, which has been conducting a broad campaign against Exxon Mobil. "The real solution," he said, "is cutting the use of fossil fuels by any means necessary."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE HOUSE; 
More Than Own Re-election Is on Agenda for Gephardt

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W.Va., Oct. 29 

 BODY:
Representative Richard A. Gephardt was at his third Congressional rally of the day, nearly hoarse as he denounced Republican Congressional leaders as friends of "special interests" who had given the Democrats no voice in running the House.
 "If we win . . ." Mr. Gephardt shouted out across the crowd. 
 A man yelled a correction: "When we win."
Mr. Gephardt, the House minority leader, nodded and dutifully amended his remarks. 
Mr. Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, is on a complicated mission with perhaps competing objectives this fall.
He is on a campaign to put the Democrats in the majority in the House of Representatives, and make himself the speaker. At the same time he has embarked on what his advisers described as an all-but-certain campaign to win the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004.
But as his tentativeness at that rally suggested, he is far from certain that he will accomplish the first of those two goals -- and that could certainly make it more difficult to accomplish the second. 
Even as he expressed what appeared to be obligatory optimism that the Democrats would take back the House, Mr. Gephardt dwelled in an interview on the difficulty of recruiting potent candidates and seasoned campaign managers, and on how Republicans and "special interests" were outspending Democrats this year.
"You know, when I started this in '95, I thought I'll probably win the House back in one term; give me one term to win it back," Mr. Gephardt said in a subdued voice as his chartered jet bumped over thick rain clouds on one of his last campaign trips of the season. "It's a lot harder than that. It is really hard."
"I have never seen money like this," he said. "Never, never."
Mr. Gephardt's remarks today, though mixed with hopeful predictions that analysts would be proved wrong in predicting his party would not retake the House, captured the deflated sense among many Democrats in this final weekend of the campaign about their once-strong hopes of winning back the House.
But they also seemed an exercise in lowering expectations that this man who would be speaker (or president) would deliver for his party this time.
It was a notable contrast from other election years when Mr. Gephardt cheerfully -- and energetically -- predicted victory right up until defeat. As recently as last summer, when it appeared that corporate malfeasance and a declining economy could be the dominant issues of the campaign, he confidently forecast significant Democratic gains.
This year, a loss of Democratic House seats could raise questions about Mr. Gephardt's appeal and political skills, several Democrats said, and about whether he spent too much time this year tending to his own presidential ambitions.
A post-Election Day round of recriminations in the Democratic caucus would surely be unwelcome for Mr. Gephardt next week, as he prepares to make a series of critical decisions about how to proceed with a White House candidacy.
Aides said today that should Democrats fail to win control of the House, Mr. Gephardt was nearly certain to step down from his leadership post to devote all his energies on his second bid for president. If Democrats do take the House, they said, Mr. Gephardt, 61, will for the time being try to run for president from the elevated platform of speaker.
As of now, it seems possible that come Tuesday, the Democrats will have held or increased their margin in the Senate and won a few more governorships while losing seats in the House.
So Mr. Gephardt's trip today seemed designed to put to rest any question that he had not done enough for his troops. His aides made a point of encouraging reporters to hop aboard the small jet along with Mr. Gephardt, who, with his wife, Jane, traveled to Congressional districts in Kentucky, Maryland and West Virginia.
Mr. Gephardt smiled broadly when a television reporter asked him how many Congressional districts he has visited this year. "Fifty-eight," he said. (Actually, it was No. 59, an aide said.)
Mr. Gephardt picked up this theme in a later conversation. "I have been to 400-odd events," he said. "I have been relentless in trying to win the House back."
He said he had helped the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raise close to $95 million.
"The money has been hard because the economy has been down -- it has been like pulling teeth this time," he said. "A lot of our donors say, 'I'd love to give, but I'm out of money.' Ninety-five million is a lot of money. And I'm proud that we've done it."
Yet Mr. Gephardt repeatedly declined to discuss how his own political fate is tied to the outcome -- and how he has managed the conflicting demands of steering the Democrats into the majority of Congress, and setting the table for his presidential campaign.
"Well, I'm part of the team that's trying to do this, so everybody has to bear responsibility for what happens," he said.
In talking about President Bush's travels on behalf of Republican Congressional candidates, Mr. Gephardt said, "I'm not impressed with the ability of anybody to help anybody and have coattails."
Asked if he included himself on that list, he responded: "Absolutely. That includes me."
Mr. Gephardt's staff said he was directly involved in raising $30 million of the total $95 million budget he cited. By contrast, Mr. Gephardt raised $7 million for his own Congressional campaign and his political action committee, which includes money that could -- or would, as one aide said -- go to financing his presidential bid.
But that disparity may be slightly deceiving. Several Democrats questioned just how much time Mr. Gephardt was investing in helping elect a Democratic-controlled Congress as opposed to winning the presidency. There are no limits on the soft money contributions Mr. Gephardt could collect for the campaign committee, as compared to the limits on the money he raised for himself.
Mr. Gephardt is in a complicated situation. Presumably, several Democrats said, he would like to be perceived as doing enough to help Democrats win the House so he would not be blamed if they do not. But he does not want to be so closely identified with the effort that his rivals can portray a Democratic defeat as a defeat to Mr. Gephardt's presidential hopes.
The minority leader, in between bites of a turkey sandwich, insisted he was not thinking about the White House.
"In '91, nobody announced anything until after Labor Day," he said, referring to the 1992 presidential election. "So I just am not worried about it. I'm trying to win the House. I've been working on this for eight years."
In any event, no matter what Mr. Gephardt's aggressive travel schedule does for his caucus, it is clearly giving much of what will be a key audience in the Democratic primary process -- labor unions, party activists -- an early look one of the party's top candidates.
At stop after stop, he has hammered away at the Republican Party, with a volume and passion that suggests he has come a long way from 1988, when he was known as one of the more lackluster candidates in a very lackluster field.
Mr. Gephardt's aides encourage such comparisons, but the candidate, or the presumed one, does not.
"The future will take care of itself," he said. "I have no idea what's going to happen. I've always believed that it's a complete waste of time for me or my helpers or my staff to sit around and worry about 25 different hypothetical scenarios. It is what it is."

HEADLINE: For Orthodox Jews, an Experiment in Farming and Faith 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK

DATELINE: SUNDERLAND, Mass. 

 BODY:
The newest farmers in this quiet valley will not milk their cows on Saturdays. Every seventh year, they will let their land lie fallow. Following biblical injunctions, they will not pick fruit from their orchards for the first three years, or plant certain vegetables next to certain fruits. 
 If the men, with their wide-brimmed black hats and wiry beards, seem out of place tilling the land, that is understandable. This farm will apparently be a first, at least for the modern world: a kosher, organic, communal farm run by ultra-Orthodox Jews. 
 The project, the brainchild of a Lubavitcher rabbi, intends to meld the tenets of the Torah with a back-to-the-land ethos not usually associated with Hasidic Jews. It also aims to be a model, to be replicated elsewhere, a self-sufficient community with synagogue, Torah study center, schools and a ritual bath called a mikvah -- a place where Orthodox Jews grow their own food according to Torah and Talmud rules and educate outsiders about their beliefs. 
"We're starting off on a new plane from scratch, living communally, working with each other to perfect each other, living a Torah life, the most perfect community you could imagine," said Rabbi Chaim Adelman, who expects about 25 families to move to Eretz HaChaim, the Living Land, a 70-acre communal farm north of Amherst, an area of corn and cucumber growers and several universities. "In my vision, if it takes off, and I think it will, I wouldn't be surprised to see Eretz HaChaim 2 somewhere and Eretz HaChaim 3."
So far, seven families have joined, three from Crown Heights, and inquiries are coming from Florida, Arizona, New Jersey, even Israel.
Jewish scholars say that Eretz HaChaim, while apparently ground-breaking, seems to draw on aspects of Jewish history, like the shtetls of eastern Europe, and aspects of the Lubavitch movement, a Hasidic sect also called Chabad. 
"Hasidism has become a very, very urbanized community because that's where the economic opportunities are," said Shaul Magid, an associate professor of Jewish philosophy at the Jewish Theological Seminary. "This is kind of an attempt to recreate rural isolated communities as existed in eastern Europe, a place to live Judaism organically."
Samuel Heilman, a professor of sociology and Jewish studies at the City University of New York and author of "Defenders of the Faith," a study of Orthodox Judaism, said Eretz HaChaim had "potential for success," although few Hasidic Jews now have agrarian backgrounds.
"The early Zionists were Polish young people who decided they were going to move to Israel, and they didn't have much agricultural background either," Dr. Heilman said. Eretz HaChaim "won't have some of the problems they had: marauding Arabs, malaria, swamps, an unfamiliar environment." 
Beyond its self-reliant setup, Eretz HaChaim will also emphasize an important Lubavitch mission, to embrace others, particularly less religious or secular Jews, and introduce them to religious Judaism. Eretz HaChaim founders envision internships for college students, working weekends for city youngsters, even a bed and breakfast where urban families can experience a religious farm.
"They want to set up a model Hasidic community that people who are nonaffiliated, nonreligious Jews can have an affinity for," Dr. Magid said. "These people are not going to get turned on getting off the subway in Crown Heights. If you get out in a rural environment, you can have this experience that can't be matched in the urban world." 
While they prepare to build on the land, a former trout farm that they purchased this year, the group screens interested families with essay questions about their spiritual goals and how they resolve conflicts.
"I don't want people to move here and then all of a sudden find out this is too much for me and my family," said Chana Luba Ertel, one Eretz HaChaim member.
All members will work, at least part time, for the farm. They plan to grow produce, make maple syrup and raise sheep, goats, chickens and cows. (Cows will be milked by gentiles on Saturdays because the Talmud forbids Jews from milking on the Sabbath, but the Lubavitchers do not want unmilked cows to be in pain.)
Besides feeding themselves, they expect to sell products, including eggs and goat cheese. They might sell kosher organic chicken, which will not be fed grain during Passover, or use wool from kosher sheep for tzitzit, fringes Orthodox Jews attach to undershirts. "There is definitely a niche market for organic and kosher," said Yosef Lifchitz, a computer networker and Eretz HaChaim member.
Rabbi Adelman said he did not expect the venture to be very profitable, if at all, but he said, "We aren't opposed to money." 
Shmuel Simenowitz, 45, an former-New York City lawyer with a small kosher farm in Vermont who will let Eretz HaChaim use his draft horses and maple sugaring expertise, said the community was serious about mixing religious ideals with real-world applications.
"There's a story about a man who kept praying, 'God, let me win the Lotto. God, let me win the Lotto,' " said Mr. Simenowitz, who once dabbled in stand-up comedy. "And finally God says, 'It would help if you would buy a ticket.' We believe in divine providence, but that's no substitute for skills. God will give you the miracles, but he wants to see a business plan." 
Eretz HaChaim also has a charitable mission, following Torah rules that "the corners of the fields" should be left for the poor. The farm may let the needy pick from the corners of its fields, or may donate food from that land to food banks.
Word of Eretz HaChaim has caused barely a ripple here; the Lubavitchers say people mostly want to ensure that much of the land stays undeveloped.
Dana Kennan, Sunderland town administrator, said the academic community made the area fairly tolerant, and farmers would not oppose another farming venture.
Rabbi Adelman, 46, a chaplain at the University of Massachusetts, said the idea of Eretz HaChaim stemmed from his work as a mashgiach, someone supervising companies making kosher products. 
Since a mashgiach makes only periodic checks, Rabbi Adelman could not be sure everything was completely kosher, and decided that for such a guarantee Jews would have to grow the ingredients themselves.
The organic concept came when he realized that many Jews had a kind of Grape Nuts gestalt, attracted to what Yamiz Bouti, Eretz HaChaim's director of development, calls "an earthy-crunchy face of Judaism."
"The organic idea is an example of acculturation, the outside world bringing in a non-Lubavitch perspective," Dr. Heilman said. "This is not something you think of if you grew up in Crown Heights."
Indeed, several Eretz HaChaim members were not raised Lubavitch, but joined as young people. Most are young families with children, eager for a spiritual community with roomy homes, a nearby synagogue and religious schools, a pool (because the Talmud says children must be taught to swim) and baseball diamonds (although there is nothing in the Talmud about that).
The community bought the $620,000 property with a $220,000 down payment, much of it from Scott Nielsen, a real estate developer who comes from a Reconstructionist synagogue and who sees both admirable philosophical underpinnings and a potentially good investment.
The community is trying to raise money from private sources, but also through government grants for educational programs or experimental energy, like geothermal power. 
Leaders of the international Chabad Lubavitch organization said they would not consider Eretz HaChaim an official Chabad program until they see how it works out. 
Rabbi Yisrael Deren, the New England regional director for Chabad, said there was a danger that such a community would become divorced from the real world. But he said: "Can it work? I think it can. Will it work? I hope it will. Am I prepared to say that we will be using this model. I am still leery of it." 
But Eretz HaChaim families say they are determined to engage with the outside world. 
"Hasidism is like a coconut," Devorah Lifchitz said. "We're inside with the milk. The outside world comes up to the edge of the coconut and sees a hard shell and they get repelled. But once you hit it with a hammer, it's the most rich fruit and juice. I think with this farm people are going to see a crack in the shell."

HEADLINE: At Climate Meeting, Unlikely Ally for Have-Nots 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Friday, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
When India's prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, finished speaking at the international conference on climate here on Wednesday, the fissure between richer and poorer countries over how best to tackle global warming could no longer be papered over.
 In his speech, he argued that poorer countries could not be expected to invest money in tackling the causes of global warming. They bear little responsibility, he said, producing fewer greenhouse gases than industrialized countries, and yet have been hit harder by the natural calamities, from drought to floods, caused by climate changes. They have weaker economies, and with pressing needs in everything from health to education, can little afford to invest in clean-air technologies. 
 His speech articulated sentiments -- resentments, in some cases -- widely shared among developing nations. So while it produced little new of substance, the conference, the eighth since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was adopted in 1992, illuminated the challenges in crafting a global response to global warming. 
It highlighted a divide between north and south, between the industrialized and developing worlds, over who should bear the obligations and burdens of trying to reduce the emissions that cause global warming. 
But on several points, the south found itself with an unlikely ally: the United States, which under the Bush administration has also blanched at joining efforts to reduce emissions.
Instead, the United States joined India and other developing countries in encouraging a focus on developing the technology and finding the resources to adapt to climate change. 
India and others argued that developed countries should offer technical and financial assistance to help developing countries adapt. 
It was not clear whether the conference's final declaration, which was still being negotiated this morning, would contain a reference to the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 climate pact completed last year and endorsed by most of the world's countries. 
The Bush administration had rejected the pact, saying that fulfilling its requirements to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases could hurt America's economy. The United States is the largest producer of greenhouse gases, and many believe its rejection of the pact has undercut its potential effectiveness. 
A draft declaration drawn up earlier this week did not mention Kyoto at all. But the latest version included an innocuous reference that said that parties that have ratified the protocol should encourage those that have not to do so "in a timely manner."
The pact must be ratified by at least 55 countries and by the industrialized nations that emitted at least 55 percent of the industrialized world's carbon dioxide in 1990. With the United States out, that number can only be reached if Russia ratifies the treaty. At the conference, the Russian delegation indicated that ratification was eventually likely, but only after Parliament passed a law in favor of ratification.
If Russia has been hesitant about ratifying the Kyoto pact because of the withdrawal of the United States, India may have been emboldened by America's rejection of formal commitments to reduce emissions of warming gases. 
"We do not see targets and timetables as realistic for developing countries," the head of the American delegation, Paula Dobriansky, the under secretary of state for global affairs, said in an interview today. 
Instead, the American delegation here repeatedly sounded two themes: that adapting to climate change is as essential as preventing it, and that economic growth is the key to environmental progress. 
The European Union and Japan, accordingly, have been pressing developing nations to commit to reducing the emission of warming gases. 
But it was exactly such pressures that seem to have contributed to the estrangement between north and south. A member of the Indian delegation said that the pressure from the European Union and Japan had crossed the line from "persuasion" to "aggression." Mr. Vajpayee's speech was partly in response.

HEADLINE: The Indirect Approach to 2012; 
New York and San Francisco Make Olympic Pitches

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
In their pursuit to be elected the United States candidate for the host city of the 2012 Summer Olympics, New York and San Francisco have a problem that marketers of consumer products rarely encounter: they are not allowed to focus their pitches to the one audience that matters. In this case, that audience is the 123 board members of the United States Olympic Committee, who meet tomorrow in Colorado Springs to pick the winner.
 The cities' cheerleaders cannot invite the U.S.O.C. members anywhere and cannot travel to meet them. They cannot send them e-mail messages, call them or write them, with the exception of sending voluminous and official "bid books" describing the cities' strategies, facilities and finances. And so the bid committee members have worked tirelessly, indirectly yet directly -- staging rallies, mowing "2012" into the lawn of a New York City park and producing commercials, among other things, to carry their message, however indirectly, to the voters who matter. 
 The strict marketing rules were enacted as a result of the scandals associated with Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Olympics, when cash and gifts were given to members of the International Olympic Committee. 
The new rules created a new need for indirect marketing that was not necessary when the U.S.O.C. allowed direct lobbying of its members, as it did for the Salt Lake City bid.
"It's certainly not the most effective way to market," said Frank Vuono, the president of 16W Marketing, a sports marketing firm in Rutherford, N.J. "The most effective campaigns are more and more specific. With new technologies, you want to touch your target audience as much as possible and in as many ways as possible."
In the hope that their core messages will weave their way to U.S.O.C. members, the New York and San Francisco bidding groups have solicited testimonials from athletes and celebrities, brought Olympians into classrooms, plastered buses with placards and flashed messages on stadium scoreboards.
"We're trying to create Olympic fever in New York and to generate as much buzz as possible," said Amy Stanton, the marketing director for NYC2012. "We can't lobby the U.S.O.C. directly, but we can do as much as possible to show how excited New Yorkers are about hosting the Olympics, which, in turn, they'll overhear." 
Helen Mendel, the marketing director of San Francisco 2012, said that despite the restrictions on contacting U.S.O.C. members, the group believed its message was finding the intended audience. "It reaches the U.S.O.C.," she said. "We've been picked up by The Associated Press and the networks, and our local NBC affiliate has done a good job of being the Olympic partner." 
A recent opinion survey by the San Francisco 2012 bid committee found that 90 percent of northern Californians knew that San Francisco was in a race with New York. 
When the campaigning ends tomorrow with the U.S.O.C. choice, the winner moves on to compete to be the International Olympic Committee's final choice, to be made in 2005, going against cities like Paris, Moscow, Budapest, Rome, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid or Seville in Spain, and a city in Germany, possibly Berlin.
The formal ban on lobbying will be lifted tonight, when the two cities' bid committees will be allowed to meet with the U.S.O.C. members at hospitality suites at the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs. Tomorrow, in their final pitches, the cities' bid leaders will each deliver a 90-minute presentation to the United States committee and take part in a question-and-answer session. The vote is to follow in the afternoon.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, will speak on behalf of New York. So will former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Olympic long jumper Bob Beamon, the Olympic swimmer Dara Torres and the comedian-actor Billy Crystal.
The San Francisco contingent includes Anne W. Cribbs, the bidding group's chief executive, who swam in the 1960 Summer Olympics; the Olympic gold medalists Michael Johnson, Kerri Strug and Marion Jones; and Mayor Willie Brown.
Each city will show videos. Among New York's five short videos is one that depicts a staged Olympic torch run and ticker tape parade.
NYC2012 is not being presumptuous, Ms. Stanton said. "The intent was to give people a taste of how incredible it would be to have the torch relay in New York, and many New Yorkers came out to support it," she said. 
The bid group sought the participation of New Yorkers to line the streets by posting requests on its Web site and on fliers.
Although the marketing goals of the two cities are similar, in some instances, their tactics are different.
San Francisco's commercials are testimonials from athletes and celebrities. In one, the soccer player Brandi Chastain extols Spartan Stadium in nearby San Jose as "the soccer capital of the world," and the singer Huey Lewis praises the area's food, wine, sourdough bread and Fisherman's Wharf.
New York's commercials put athletic events into ordinary street scenes: two fencers, the Olympians Peter Westbrook and Akhnaten Spencer-El, thrust and parry for a taxicab; the hurdler Derrick Adkins races across Broadway when he sees the "Walk" sign light up; and the weight lifter Cheryl Haworth carries a cart of groceries up the staircase of a West Village brownstone.
The public service advertisements, which were created by the Kirshenbaum & Bond agency, "were true to New York and raised Olympians on a pedestal," Ms. Stanton said.
A bus advertising campaign from the San Francisco committee evokes athletes in a similar fashion: a kayaker crosses Lombard Street, a diver soars off the cranes at the neighboring Port of Oakland and hurdlers soar over Napa Valley grapevines.
New York has staged modest pep rallies at Grand Central Terminal and Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. San Francisco held larger rallies in Oakland, San Francisco and San Jose.
San Francisco worked with the artistic community to create a diverse series of posters by top Bay Area designers, which have been used to raise money for the bid.
In other components of the New York effort, a table tennis exhibition in support of the bid took place yesterday at the reopened Winter Garden in Lower Manhattan, and the NYC2012 logo was mowed into the lawn at Bryant Park in Midtown.
Each city's bid committee has had a presence at local sports events, including Knicks basketball and Jets football games in the New York area, and Giants baseball, Raiders football and Warriors basketball games in the Bay Area.
And Olympians like the gymnast Bart Conner and the figure skaters Elvis Stojko, Viktor Petrenko and Sasha Cohen helped open the fall season at the Rockefeller Center skating rink. Coincidentally, several U.S.O.C. members were in town for a dinner honoring women in sports, and happened to see the rink ceremony. Ms. Stanton did not name them, but not surprisingly, she said, "They were overwhelmed by this demonstration of New York's commitment to the bid."
Perhaps the battle between the cities will come down to nutritional marketing. When the lobbying starts tonight, the New York hospitality suite (or bid city office, as the U.S.O.C. prefers) will offer cold cuts from Katz's Deli and cheesecake from Junior's. 
That formidable pair will face Ghirardelli chocolates in San Francisco's suite. Sadly, sourdough bread, which the city is also known for, is not baked for longevity and would not have survived the trip.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING; 
Worker Dismissed As Inquiry Widens Into Big Racing Bet

BYLINE:  By JOE DRAPE 

 BODY:
As the authorities investigated whether an exotic bet worth $3 million on last Saturday's Breeders' Cup horse races was rigged, the company that processed the wager said yesterday that it had fired a "rogue software engineer" who exploited a weakness in its system.
 The company, Scientific Games Corporation of New York, said it had turned over the employee's name and evidence of potential wrongdoing to the state police and state wagering officials. 
 The employee attended Drexel University in Philadelphia with the winner of the bet, racing officials and a state investigator said.
The head of the company, Lorne Weil, said the worker had the access and know-how to breach the system run by the company's subsidiary Autotote, which processes 65 percent of racing wagers in North America. 
Industry and law enforcement officials said that the F.B.I. had joined the police and the New York State Racing and Wagering Board in the inquiry of the wager, known as a pick six, which requires bettors to pick winners in six straight races. Payoff on the bet, made through the Catskill Off-Track Betting hub by telephone from Baltimore, has been held up.
Investigators are also looking into whether there have been questionable payoffs at other tracks. "This goes beyond one afternoon and the East Coast," said an investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Though Mr. Weil tried to calm investors in his conference call yesterday, his disclosures pointed up the vulnerability of the $14.5 billion-a-year betting industry for which consumer confidence is crucial.
As racing has become more reliant on off-track and telephone betting, it is also depending more on a network of computers that link tracks and off-track sites. If the systems are proved flawed, or susceptible to manipulation, it could scare off bettors worried about the integrity of the process.
"There needs to be total review of the system so everyone can feel good and see that these things are not widespread," said Bill Nader, a New York Racing Association vice president. "Without integrity in the way a wager is processed, we don't have a sport."
The case in question involves the pick six bet on the last six races of the Breeders' Cup, horse racing's season-ending championship. The entire winning pool was held by Derrick Davis, a 29-year-old Maryland man who made the bets by phone.
Investigators are looking into whether the computer system was manipulated so that a bet made after several races had been run would appear to have been made beforehand.
Though Mr. Weil did not name the dismissed employee, the state investigator and racing officials identified him as Chris Harn, 29, who worked in Autotote's offices in Newark, Del.
Mr. Davis owns a Baltimore-based computer networking business, Utopian Networks Inc., but said yesterday that he was a knowledgeable bettor whose winning tickets were legitimate. "I didn't do anything wrong here," he said, refusing to elaborate and referring questions to his Baltimore lawyer, Steven A. Allen. Mr. Allen said his client was cooperating with the authorities and had nothing to hide.
"He is caught in the middle of a maelstrom," Mr. Allen said. "As far as he's concerned, he made a legitimate bet. The race was run, and he won, and he should have received his payoff. And that should have been the end of it. Now, instead, there's an investigation, people are making a variety of wild accusations, and his reputation is being sullied for no good reason."
Thomas Davis, Derrick's father, said his son grew up in Baltimore and attended engineering school in Pennsylvania, but would not be more specific. "I just think it's like the equivalent of his hitting the lottery," the father said. "I know in the bottom of my heart that it's a legitimate bet."
Stacy Clifford, a spokeswoman for the state wagering board, would not comment on the personnel involved in the investigation or its progress.
"The board routinely involves other organizations in its investigations and will involve law enforcement if it feels appropriate," she said. "They fired this person in connection with what happened Saturday, and since we're investigating what happened Saturday, we're certainly looking into it."
What started the investigation last Sunday was the configuration of the winning tickets and that they belonged to one bettor, Mr. Davis, who called his bets in by phone to the Catskill OTB hub, one of five regional corporations that, with New York City OTB, handle off-track bets in New York.
The winning tickets featured "singles," or races with only one horse selected, in the first four legs of the ticket, and then every horse in the final two races. On a $2 ticket, those combinations and strategy cost $192.
Mr. Davis bet a $12 pick-six ticket, or played that exact combination six separate times, costing him $1,152. It was a highly unusual strategy for betting the pick six -- horseplayers like to cover as many combinations as possible -- and the configuration raised suspicions of New York Racing Association officials, who alerted Breeders' Cup Ltd. and the state wagering board.
Mr. Davis had opened the Catskill OTB account within two weeks of the Breeders' Cup, had deposited money on five occasions -- four increments of $500 and one of $250 -- but had not made a bet until that pick six, according to investigative sources.
The six winning tickets were each worth $428,392. In addition, by including every horse in the last two races, the bettor collected 108 of the 186 consolation payoffs for hitting five of six winners; each consolation ticket was worth $4,606.20.
After an initial review on Monday, officials for Autotote and Catskill OTB said the tickets were recorded about 20 minutes before the first leg and appeared legitimate. But after further review, Mr. Weil said, the company determined that the fired employee had taken advantage of a weakness in the processing of bets.
While the tickets were logged and totaled at satellite sites such as Catskill OTB, they were not transferred to the host site, Arlington Park outside Chicago, until after the fifth race when the exact bets were verified. In this state of limbo, Mr. Weil said, the employee, who had the password to the data system, was able to alter the ticket after the results of the first four races of the pick six were known.
When Scientific Games announced the firing, trading in its stock was suspended on Nasdaq for more than 20 minutes. The stock closed at $7.62, down 57 cents. Mr. Weil maintained he was confident Autotote's systems were impenetrable to outside hackers.
"I think people see this for what it is -- a rogue individual bound and determined to exploit the only weak link we see in the system so far," he said.

How to Beat This Writer Across Town

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
FOR a personal challenge, nothing compares to the New York City Marathon. Take it from someone who has completed the 26.2-mile course several times. Grinding along the streets of the five boroughs requires reservoirs of endurance, discipline, patience, resourcefulness and good cheer.
 I really should try running it one of these days. 
 But it just seems like such a waste of heartbeats.
Instead, the preference here is to drive the marathon route, a ritual that was performed on Wednesday morning for the fourth time in the last eight autumns. As ever, the reason for schlepping through town in a rented car was to see if the mysteries of New York traffic had changed in any way, however subtly.
(If you are now thinking that this exercise was nothing but a newspaper gimmick, I have only one thing to say to you: you're right.)
Everybody knows that driving in the city ranks high on a scale of local horrors. While these things are hard to measure, it probably falls somewhere between listening to the Elmo taxi message and following the Knicks. All the same, it is an ordeal many working New Yorkers cannot avoid.
They will not be surprised, then, to hear that some of them might do better running the marathon than driving it.
It took me 2 hours and 44 minutes on Wednesday to get from the starting point, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, to the finish line at Tavern on the Green in Central Park. Records kept by New York Road Runners show that 195 men and women ran last year's marathon in faster time.
At 8 a.m., crossing downtown Brooklyn was a singular chore. Nor was there joy in getting onto and across the Queensboro Bridge headed toward Manhattan. It took 26 minutes, from 8:46 to 9:12.
The good news, if you can call it that, is that Wednesday's drive took 12 fewer minutes than the 2:56 recorded the last time out, two years ago. That's an improvement of nearly 7 percent. So it must mean that New York traffic is getting better, right?
Yeah, right (a rare example of two positives making a negative).
The sorry state of New York traffic is on many minds these days. One reason is the specter of tolls on the East River bridges. Another is a new experiment in mid-Manhattan, where traffic is often as congealed as a day-old lamb chop. Turns onto north-south avenues have been banned at certain times on 10 crosstown streets, the hope being that this will pick up the pace in Midtown, where vehicles were clocked last spring at an average speed of 4.8 miles per hour. Even Congress moves faster than that.
Thus far, the reaction to this plan is mixed, a polite way of saying that some New Yorkers think City Hall is making a mess of things. But it's too early to tell. Besides, if the experiment fails, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a pragmatist on most matters not involving tobacco, says so be it; he will just try something else.
ONE paradox is that traffic seems to be moving more slowly in the heart of town even though the number of cars is shrinking. In 2000, the most recent year with useful statistics, the city's Transportation Department found that an average of 967,803 vehicles entered Manhattan each day during the work week. That represented a 10.2 percent increase from 1994, a reflection of economic good times in the late 90's.
Since then, many people have lost their jobs and no longer drive into town. The vehicle count is now estimated at 950,000, said Tom Cocola, a Transportation Department spokesman. Focusing solely on Manhattan south of 60th Street, the city's business core, a group called the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council has tracked a comparable post-boom decline.
But having fewer cars is offset, and then some, by post-9/11 realities. Some streets, especially near the World Trade Center site, remain closed to vehicles. There are more police barricades around town than before the terrorist attack. Traffic patterns have not fully returned to normal on some bridges, tunnels and highways.
Add everything up and you get delays. And not everyone is ready to give up on the automobile, said Samuel I. Schwartz, a transportation consultant. "It may have gotten more unattractive to drive," he said, "but some people feel it's even more unattractive to take mass transit." Security fears being what they are, they feel more vulnerable in the subways.
Maybe it would be best if healthy New Yorkers simply ran to work. Even the slowest among them would have to do better than the 26 minutes it took to drive across that bridge.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate; 
Synagogue Looks Up, but Not as High

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Congregation Shearith Israel has the richest history of any synagogue in New York and one of the most glorious sanctuaries. But it has another extraordinary asset: unused development rights overlooking Central Park West.
 This month, almost two decades after it outraged neighbors by unsuccessfully proposing a 42-story, 488-foot apartment tower over its landmark synagogue, the congregation will return to the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Now it seeks to develop a 14-story, 157-foot building that would include the synagogue's community house at its base and 10 residential floors above. 
 The new building, designed by Platt Byard Dovell White, would rise next to the synagogue on 70th Street, taking the place of a vacant lot and the current four-story community house, which was built in 1954 and is not a landmark.
There would probably be no more than two apartments on each floor, perhaps only one. Even in a weakening economy, there will presumably always be a strong market for newly built apartments with broad windows facing Central Park, in part because so few become available.
Under the most likely plan, a developer would control the apartment floors as a condominium unit separate from the synagogue's space. The congregation would share in the proceeds from the apartments.
It is not possible now to estimate how much the sales would yield. But the congregation can use the money. It has just completed an $8 million restoration of the sanctuary designed by Stephen Tilly and sees much more work ahead.
"There is no limit to what we have to do, which is why the building project is so important," said Peter Neustadter, the parnas (or president) of the 348-year-old congregation, also known as the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue.
Besides the 19th-century neo-Classical sanctuary and adjoining parsonage, which is currently empty, the congregation must care for three small historic cemeteries in Manhattan, a chapel designed by Calvert Vaux in its cemetery on Cypress Hills Street in Queens and its own considerable archives.
Income from the development might be used to restore the Vaux chapel or the old cemeteries on Chatham Square, West 11th Street and West 21st Street, said Shelly S. Friedman of Friedman & Gotbaum, a lawyer for the synagogue.
But the most significant preservation benefit, he said, was that the proposal would pull the development away from the synagogue, in contrast to the tower proposed in 1983, which would have cantilevered over the landmark.
At a hearing on Nov. 26, the congregation will argue that the preservation benefits warrant support from the landmarks commission for the variance it needs to construct a 157-foot tower in a zoning district with a row house-scaled 75-foot height limit.
Because the site is in the Upper West Side-Central Park Historic District, the scale of the proposed building is already being criticized by preservationists as a destructive precedent citywide.
"The entire application is a way to create spot zoning that would compromise the contextual zoning district for midblocks," said Simeon Bankoff, executive director of the Historic Districts Council. "They're breaking the zone by proposing a new design that has twice the height of allowable buildings."
Landmark West, a local preservation group, is worried about the relation of the new building to the landmark and the possibility that the terms of the project will change once a developer is designated. It is also not persuaded that the project has a preservation purpose, as it must for the landmarks commission to endorse and join the application for a zoning change.
Norman Marcus, a former counsel to the City Planning Department, who lives next door to the synagogue, allowed that the new proposal was modest in comparison with the 1983 version. "On the other hand," he said, "it's still a very long stretch from a brownstone scale."
But it happens that Mr. Marcus's 16-story building at 91 Central Park West -- along with several other nearby structures of 9, 14 and 18 stories -- are cited by the congregation as the real context for its proposal, which Mr. Friedman described as "well suited to its neighbors."
In determining how large a building to propose, Mr. Friedman said, the congregation decided to forgo the use of about 50,000 square feet of development rights. "A building height of about 160 to 170 feet," he said, "seemed to be the most that was practical to ask for."

HEADLINE: The Pitt Principle 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
So Harvey Pitt decided not to tell other members of the Securities and Exchange Commission a small detail about the man he had chosen to head a crucial new accounting oversight board, after turning his back on a far more qualified candidate. William Webster, reports Stephen Labaton of The Times, headed the audit committee at U.S. Technologies. Now that company is being sued by investors who claim that management defrauded them of millions.
 And what did Mr. Webster's committee do after an outside auditor raised concerns about the company's financial controls? That's right: It fired the auditor. 
 Mr. Pitt's response when this story broke beats anything a satirist could have imagined. "Pitt seeks probe of himself," read one headline. Honest: Mr. Pitt's own agency will investigate how he chose Mr. Webster.
Meanwhile, what was Mr. Webster thinking? Nobody thinks he's corrupt; but having failed so spectacularly to police executives at a single, small company, how could he imagine himself qualified to enforce honest accounting for all of corporate America? 
Yet it's no accident that Mr. Pitt picked the wrong man. Mr. Webster was chosen over better candidates precisely because accounting industry lobbyists -- a group that clearly still includes Mr. Pitt -- believed he would be ineffectual.
Let's call it the Pitt Principle. The famous Peter Principle said that managers fail because they rise to their level of incompetence. The Pitt Principle tells us that sometimes incompetence is exactly what the people in charge want. 
In this particular case, ordinary investors demanded a crackdown on corporate malfeasance -- and Mr. Pitt pretended to comply. But this administration is run by and for people who have profited handsomely from their insider connections. (Remember Harken and Halliburton? And why won't the administration come clean about that energy task force?) So he picked someone with an impressive but irrelevant background, whom he could count on not to get the job done.
This principle explains a lot. For example, the Treasury secretary's job is to pursue sound fiscal and economic policies. So if you don't want that job done, you appoint a prominent manufacturing executive with little understanding either of federal budgets or of macroeconomics. He'll be just the man to preside over a lightning-fast transition from record budget surpluses to huge deficits. He'll even cheerily declare that "the latest indicators look good" just days before consumer confidence plunges to a nine-year low.
The attorney general's job is to uphold the Constitution and enforce the rule of law. So if you don't want that job done, you pick a former senator who doesn't have much respect either for the law or for the Constitution -- particularly silly stuff about due process, separation of church and state, and all that. He'll be just the man to respond to a national crisis by imprisoning more than 1,000 people without charges, while catching not a single person who has committed an act of terrorism -- not even the anthrax mailer. 
The same principle can be applied at lower levels. Intelligence and defense experts should realistically assess threats to national security, and the consequences of U.S. military action. So if you don't want that job done, you place it in the hands of prominent neoconservative intellectuals, with no real-world experience. They can be counted on to perceive terrorist links where the C.I.A. says they don't exist, and to offer blithe assurances about fighting a war in a densely populated urban area when the military itself is very nervous.
But the most important application of the Pitt Principle comes at the top. The president's job is to unify the nation, and lead it through difficult times. If you don't want that job done, you appoint an affable fellow from a famous family who has led a charmed business and political life thanks to his insider advantage. He'll be the kind of guy who sees nothing wrong in seeking partisan advantage from a national crisis, even going so far as to declare that members of the other party don't care about the nation's security. 
That way, a great surge of national unity and good feeling can be converted, in little more than a year, into a growing sense of dismay, with more and more Americans saying that the country is going in the wrong direction.

2 Big Advertisers Made Account Changes

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

 BODY:
Two big advertisers are making changes to their accounts.
 Verizon Communications, in a potentially serious blow to Lowe & Partners Worldwide in New York, named McGarry Bowen in New York to handle corporate brand and image advertising, duties that had been Lowe's domain. 
 Verizon first used McGarry Bowen to create a commercial remembering the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that ran in September. 
John Bonomo, a spokesman for Verizon in New York, confirmed reports of the change in Adweek. While Lowe, part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, will continue to work on the Verizon account, the relationship will "evolve," he said, adding that negotiations are under way. 
"Lowe is currently working on key product assignments for Verizon and looks forward to contributing to their future success," said Hollie Geren, a spokeswoman for Lowe. Lowe landed the account, with billings estimated at more than $100 million, in 2001.
Also, American Isuzu Motors, part of Isuzu Motors, named Malone Advertising in Akron, Ohio, to handle creative duties on its account, which had been handled for 11 years by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of the Omnicom Group. 
Spending on the account at one time was estimated at as much as $100 million, but fell to $50 million last year and $16 million for the first half of this year, according to CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres. Isuzu has struggled to sell its sport utility vehicles in a booming but competitive market, and there had been speculation that Isuzu and Goodby would part ways.
Chip Letzgus, a spokesman for Isuzu in Cerritos, Calif., confirmed a report of the shift, which came without a review, in the online edition of Adweek. "Our focus needs to be on our retail marketing effort, so we've gone to an agency that specializes in building retail traffic," he said.
Even with the loss of Isuzu, Goodby will continue to work in the auto sector. It won the Saturn account at General Motors, with spending estimated at $350 million, in February.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE ECONOMY; 
Democrats' Mixed Message Reflects Tax-Cut Divisions

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: OVERLAND PARK, Kan., Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Democrats are offering a scrambled message on the economy in the closing days of the midterm election, reflecting their deep divisions over the tax cut that President Bush pushed through Congress last year as the centerpiece of his economic strategy, candidates and strategists in both parties say.
 With no big surge this year in unemployment -- the most compelling indicator of economic distress -- and with the nation's attention largely focused on terrorism and the confrontation with Iraq, it was always expected to be hard for Democrats to turn the election into a referendum on Mr. Bush's economic record, Democrats and Republicans said. 
 But the fractured Democratic message on the tax cut is making it especially difficult for Democrats to present a united critique of Mr. Bush's stewardship. Moreover, some Democrats say, their divisions have inhibited their ability to draw clear distinctions with Republicans on major issues like the re-emergence of the federal budget deficit and the balance between tax breaks for the wealthy and more help for lower- and middle-income people. 
In Montana, a state Mr. Bush carried easily in 2000, Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat, is highlighting his role in passing the $1.35 trillion 10-year tax cut and calling for it to be made permanent. In the race for an open House seat in Colorado, the Democratic candidate, Mike Feeley, is attacking the tax cut as larded with provisions that benefit only the very wealthiest Americans at a time when working families need help. 
Representative Charlie W. Stenholm of Texas, a fiscally conservative Democrat, says the tax cut is largely to blame for the swing from budget surpluses to deficits. Here in a Republican-leaning district in and around Kansas City, Representative Dennis Moore, a Democrat in a tight re-election race, trumpets his vote in favor of the tax cut but says that right now the government cannot afford to extend it beyond 10 years.
The scattered Democratic message is the legacy of Mr. Bush's success in not only winning passage of his tax cut last year, but also in shattering the united front that Democrats had put forward on fiscal policy during the Clinton years. Not only did 12 Democratic senators and 28 Democratic House members vote for the measure, but others have been wary of making it an issue in their campaigns, making it hard for Democratic leaders to develop alternative proposals the party can rally around.
"The consequence of taking the tax cut off the table is that you decline to attack the heart of the Bush economic policy," said Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster. "So it's become difficult to tie the president to the current economic difficulties."
Democrats still see some hope that the economy will play a determining role in the elections. 
The up and down stock market has become an economic EKG that has left many voters worried, and the plunge this week in consumer confidence is evidence of the fragility of the economic outlook. Should the unemployment rate for October rise when the figures are announced on Friday, as many economists expect, it could give Democrats a last chance to focus attention on economic issues.
But many Democrats say the party's compelling case on the economy has been muddled by the divisions over the tax cut.
"There's a series of mixed messages," said Leon E. Panetta, who was budget director and chief of staff in the Clinton White House. "What they're failing to do is what Democrats have always been pretty good at, which is to present a vision of what they would do to counter Bush."
Robert B. Reich, who was labor secretary in the Clinton administration and ran unsuccessfully this year for the Democratic nomination for governor in Massachusetts, said his party was at risk of squandering what should be a natural advantage on the economy this year.
"There's no coherent critique," Mr. Reich said. "There's no coherent solution."
But to Democrats who are more concerned with re-election than broad concerns about the party's direction, running as supporters of the tax cut is a way to insulate themselves against the political power of a popular president who talks about his tax cut and the need to make it permanent at nearly every campaign stop.
Mr. Baucus, who helped write the tax-cutting legislation, said he had shaped the bill to help his constituents more than Mr. Bush's original proposal would have, and that the tax cut had helped the national economy at a difficult time.
"You got to do what you got to do," Mr. Baucus said. "I'm proud to be a Democrat, but Montana comes first." 
For other Democrats in competitive races, opposing the tax cut is a way to appeal to lower- and middle-class families by emphasizing that many of its provisions -- especially those that have yet to take effect -- largely or solely benefit people in the upper-income brackets.
"The richest 1 percent are doing just fine," said Mr. Feeley, whose race in Colorado is rated a tossup. "I want to work for the other 99 percent."
But even in races where the Democrat has tried to build tax-cutting credentials, like in Missouri, where Senator Jean Carnahan has campaigned on her support for the legislation, taxes remain a central focus. 
In South Dakota, Representative John Thune, a Republican, is trying to unseat Senator Tim Johnson, one of the 12 Senate Democrats who voted for the tax cut. Despite his vote, Mr. Johnson has at times been on the defensive over taxes. Faced with Republican commercials that said he had voted to raise taxes 141 times, Mr. Johnson responded with a commercial citing a letter Mr. Bush wrote praising Mr. Johnson's vote.
But Republicans in South Dakota said the important thing was that Democrats were being forced to talk about tax cuts -- an issue on which Republicans said voters trust them more.
"What we're seeing here is the quintessential election year conversion," Christine Iverson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Thune, said of Mr. Johnson's tax-cutting record. 
Mr. Moore, who just eked out a victory two years ago, casts himself as squarely with the president on taxes and national security. But, reflecting his district's fiscal conservatism, he also says he will not support making Mr. Bush's tax cut permanent unless the economy and the budget surplus come roaring back.
His Republican challenger, Adam Taff, said Mr. Moore was a reluctant convert to the tax cut. As a result, Mr. Taff said, Mr. Moore's claim to be a bona fide tax cutter would ring hollow with voters.

HEADLINE: Revlon Has 16th-Straight Quarterly Loss 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Revlon posted its 16th-straight quarterly loss yesterday and said it had spent more on marketing. The company also said it might not meet a bank-loan requirement for the current quarter. 
 The third-quarter net loss narrowed to $22.1 million, or 42 cents a share, from $22.9 million, or 44 cents, a year earlier, according to Revlon, the cosmetics maker controlled by the financier Ronald O. Perelman. Sales rose less than 1 percent, to $323.2 million. 
 Revlon, which also makes Almay and Ultima II products, may not meet a condition of a $250 million loan as the company increases advertising and promotions to attract customers amid a slowdown in consumer spending, the chief financial officer, Douglas H. Greeff, told investors on a conference call. The chief executive, Jack L. Stahl, said he was in talks with Revlon's banks and confident of their support. 
Revlon's cash fell to $59.2 million from $103.3 million on Dec. 31. Mr. Perelman, who owns about 83 percent of the company's common stock, has agreed to put up $40 million if necessary, Revlon officials said in the call. 
The company, which is based in New York, had $2 billion in long-term debt and other liabilities at the end of last quarter, most of that from Mr. Perelman's 1985 takeover. Revlon has a $250 million loan and credit line that was arranged by J. P. Morgan Chase last November.
Mr. Stahl said the company would not reduce spending, which he said had helped stabilize Revlon's share of the cosmetics market in its competition with Procter & Gamble's Cover Girl products and L'Oreal.

HEADLINE: Latin American Countries Skeptical of U.S. Trade Agreement 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
The United States, trying to shore up support for a pan-American free-trade zone while many Latin American countries are in economic turmoil, began an energetic effort here today to persuade leaders that a deal would be to their advantage.
 On the eve of talks involving 34 countries, President Bush signed a proclamation that would expand the number of products that Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru and Colombia can export to the United States without paying tariffs. 
 The administration also smoothed over a tax dispute between Ecuador and Occidental Petroleum in an effort to soothe critics who argue that a free-trade deal will simply give American oil corporations more opportunities to run roughshod over Amazon rain forests. 
The United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, announced plans to seek up to $140 million from Congress to help countries defray administrative costs of a trade deal.
"We have to keep our eye on the big picture," Mr. Zoellick said. "This is not just about completing an agreement, or even about expanding trade. It is about creating more opportunities and more jobs."
But neither the enticements nor the comforting talk could dispel skepticism about American intentions. The talks here are occurring while at least three countries are in political and economic convulsions. Argentina, still trying to recover from its financial collapse, is struggling to avoid default on loans from the World Bank and is preparing for spring elections.
In Brazil, the president-elect, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has in the past denounced a "free-trade agreement for the Americas" as tantamount to the "annexation" of Brazil by the United States. 
And here in Ecuador, though the government generally supports a free-trade deal, its leaders know the idea is largely unpopular.
"I am an eternal optimist, but I have to share the concerns that have been raised by some or even all of the other countries in Latin America," said Heinz Moeller, Ecuador's foreign minister. "The crucial issue for us is agricultural protectionism in the United States, which is something we will all have to resolve together."
Many larger countries, especially Brazil, have insisted that they will not accept an agreement that does not also include big reductions in American tariffs and subsidies for cash crops like sugar and soybeans. 
The United States wants to deal with those issues outside the framework of a pan-American deal, in global trade negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organization that are to occur more or less simultaneously with those on a "Free Trade Agreement of the Americas."
"Everything needs to be on the table," said Carlos Ruckkauf, Argentina's foreign minister. "To have a valid free-trade agreement for all the Americas, we cannot have negotiations where we divide into two groups."
On Friday, trade ministers will try to agree on a schedule and outline for negotiations over the next two years. The meetings will not determine the fate of a hemispheric agreement, but they will signalwhether a consensus is possible.
Uneasiness about a free-trade agreement is widespread in many countries. In contrast to most Americans, who have paid little attention it, the issue has aroused adamant opposition here from groups worried about losing control over their land, as well as farmers and small business people.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ASSASSINATION; 
Jordan, Between Iraq and U.S., Worries About War

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
A recent political cartoon compared the current mood in Jordan toward waging war against Saddam Hussein of Iraq with feelings in 1990.
 The first panel shows two Jordanians gleefully dancing in the streets at the prospect of Iraqi missiles falling on Israel, with one man chanting, "With chemicals, Oh Saddam! With chemicals, Oh Saddam!" 
 The second panel, labeled 2002, shows the same two men transfixed in front of their television set, wearing gas masks as one yells, "With diplomacy, Oh Saddam! With diplomacy, Oh Saddam!" 
A certain anxiety pervades Jordan over the potential fallout from warfare erupting on yet another border, anxiety that deepened this week with the shooting death of a senior American diplomat outside his home. 
People look at events like that assassination, or the violent demonstrations that rocked Amman last spring when Israeli forces moved into the West Bank, and wonder about the stability of Jordan and the region at large in the face of another war. 
"The potential for the escalation of violence is real if war happens," said Naser M. Tahboub, a former political science professor whose company now undertakes risk analysis. "Emotions will flare. People will see this war as unjust." 
Given its links to its neighbors, Jordan is considered more vulnerable than any other country. Concerns about stability are likely to be strongest in the royal diwan, the offices of King Abdullah II. 
In 1990, King Hussein urged the world to grant the Iraqi leader more time to withdraw voluntarily from Kuwait. While not condoning the Iraqi invasion, he did not join the American-led coalition either, satisfying public opinion while antagonizing Washington and the rich Gulf Arab states. 
Abdullah, who became king after his father's death in 1999, finds himself in a similar position, caught between the demands of a powerful neighbor, a powerful patron and Jordanian public opinion. 
"Being Jordan is like being married to three husbands," Mr. Tahboub said.
Iraq provided Jordan with subsidized oil worth some $500 million last year. Openly embracing Washington might prompt Baghdad to end the arrangement, a loss that could hurt virtually every Jordanian household. 
Washington has provided military and economic aid to Jordan amounting to more than $400 million for 2002.
The Jordanian public, disgusted at what it sees as the failure of the United States to rein in the violence Israel inflicts on the Palestinians, could not stomach being closely allied with Washington against an Arab state. 
The young king is trying to alienate no one while signaling to the public that Jordan is likely to be best served by keeping its head down. Abdullah, ever the fan of snappy, Western-style advertising campaigns to sell policy, is pushing the slogan, "Jordan First." 
The slogan is plastered on billboards around town, but so far has left Jordanians either perplexed or hostile. The Palestinians, who form the bulk of the 5.1 million population, read it as a vague slur that the country should favor its native Jordanians. 
In 1990, Saddam Hussein captured public opinion by proclaiming that the road to liberating Jerusalem ran through Kuwait, and that Arab oil would be used to serve Arab causes. Rumors that his face had been spotted on the moon sent Jordanians into the streets to witness this auspicious omen. Few now believe his pronouncements about pursuing pan-Arab goals, but the sentiment lingers. 
"Some people are ideologues and Arab nationalists and Islamists who believe the U.S. is the enemy and we should support our Arab brethren regardless of what the circumstances are," said George Hawatmeh, editor of the daily Al Rai. "Plus some people think we cannot possibly side with the Americans when Saddam is giving us preferential treatment." 
The decision that Abdullah faces in positioning Jordan differs in some aspects from his father's in 1990. First, Jordan's intelligence agency has proved instrumental in tracking militant extremists, especially after Sept. 11, raising the country's stock in Washington. The military also sent a field hospital to Afghanistan during the war there. 
Second, in 1994, King Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel. The treaty never gained much resonance in Jordan because it failed to win the Palestinians a state. But it lends the monarchy some measure of insurance that Washington will help Jordan maintain stability at home. 
King Abdullah has postponed parliamentary elections twice and unleashed ferocious riot policemen to suppress anti-Israeli and anti-American demonstrations that erupted in April. 
Three months ago, Jordan also shuttered the bureau of Al Jazeera satellite television -- the police carting off its computer equipment. Journalists and human rights organizations critical of the government have found themselves questioned by ever more prevalent security forces. 
The government contends that political freedoms can thrive only in the wake of economic improvements, which are inching upward but are not widely felt.
Jordanians in downtown Amman grumble that Saddam Hussein deserves support as the only regional leader who is not a Western puppet. 
"Jordan is now an ally of the United States," said Amjad Awadi, a 40-year-old government employee. "This is the biggest mistake we can make as an Arab nation." 
Also of concern is the possible reaction from Iraq. Worst-case scenarios -- as in the cartoon -- envision Iraqi missiles targeting Jordan. Many Jordanians saw the recent assassination of the American diplomat, Laurence Foley, as the work of Iraqi agents, meant as a warning against an American attack. 
At present, downtown Amman seems not too distant from the long arm of Iraq's security forces. Squatting in shadow of a Roman theater, an Iraqi woman shrouded in black and selling cigarettes for 70 cents apiece predicts that Iraqis will fight for President Hussein because he never left them wanting. 
"Then why are you selling cigarettes?" 
"I came here for tourism, I swear," the woman responded. 
Another Iraqi, a rail thin, 35-year-old physicist, is less enthusiastic about the Iraqi leader. "All Iraqis are victims of the government," he said. "The Iraqi people would welcome any change and would be happy to bear the consequences." 
A friend interrupted to ask if the Americans would really attack, but both men froze when another Iraqi who had been praising Mr. Hussein moments earlier snapped their picture. "Did you see that?" the physicist asked, running off in fruitless pursuit.

HEADLINE: Distant Neighbors, Again 

 BODY:
Within a month of taking office, President Bush flew off to Vicente Fox's ranch in Guanajuato and met the Mexican president's mother. It was that kind of a relationship. The two plain-spoken conservatives had become fast friends. Their personal bond, and the end to 71 years of rule by the Party of the Institutional Revolution, augured well for closer ties. When Mr. Bush played host to Mr. Fox at his first state dinner, he said that no relationship was more important to the United States. 
 That was early in September 2001. As the Bush administration has realigned its priorities to combat terrorism, there has been an alarming deterioration in the relationship. At last weekend's meeting of Pacific Rim leaders held in Mexico, the jovial backslapping was replaced by a tense politeness. Mr. Bush reportedly balked at an invitation to make a state visit to Mexico next year. 
 Washington is rightly focused on terrorism and Iraq, but a superpower should be able to simultaneously address global threats and tend to its neighborhood. The administration does not seem to appreciate just how radical Mr. Fox's enthusiastic embrace of the United States was in the context of Mexican politics. He has paid a heavy price for being the most pro-United States president in modern Mexican history and having little to show for it.
An ambitious immigration reform beneficial to both nations was to have been the centerpiece of the new relationship, and Mr. Fox is frustrated that the effort was effectively derailed by Al Qaeda. Mexico has now retreated to a more traditionally neutral foreign policy. Mr. Fox canceled a scheduled visit to Mr. Bush's ranch in August to protest the execution of a Mexican national, and pulled out of a symbolic hemispheric military alliance. Mexico has also backed French attempts to dilute the proposed Anglo-American resolution on Iraq in the U.N. Security Council. 
Both nations must reverse the poisonous trend. It is time to restart talks toward an expanded temporary-worker program and clarification of the status of the more than three million undocumented Mexicans in this country. Such a deal would advance not only the United States' economic interests but its national security. Tolerating a huge shadow economy, with its millions of undocumented foreigners, isn't prudent homeland security.

HEADLINE: Cautious Pragmatism of McCall Has Left Little Voter Recognition 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN and RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
As H. Carl McCall runs for governor, he misses no opportunity to recite his resume: state senator, United Nations diplomat, Citibank executive, president of the New York City school board and, for the last nine years, state comptroller.
 The list itself is presented as an accomplishment. The details of what he did in those positions are mostly left out. Mr. McCall's aides have often insisted that voters already know his record. 
 But despite 30 years on the political scene, Mr. McCall, 67, the Democratic candidate, is barely known by voters, who, according to polls, may recognize his name but do not have an impression of him. 
A look at the record shows that Mr. McCall has long stood apart from controversy. As the president of the Board of Education in the early 1990's -- a period he speaks little about -- he was a pragmatic diplomat who pushed his own agenda, like hiring minority teachers, in a manner designed not to upset a board already at the boiling point.
He pushed for liberal policies, but in a tempered way, saying, for example, that he could endorse a school focusing primarily, but not exclusively, on black male students "as a concept" as long as "it has high standards." 
Such reserve served him well in the fiscal role of comptroller, the position that he held the longest and that yielded what he calls his most significant achievements, including securing a cost-of-living increase for pensioners and making the auditing of local government less punitive and more instructional.
"He's not an extrovert and doesn't go out on a limb," Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, Mr. McCall's chief political patron, said. "He doesn't knock people over to get to cameras and he doesn't talk unless there is something to say. He just does the job and gets it done." 
Mr. Rangel continued, "I act like a politician and talk like a politician, but Carl is something else."
Grandstanding seems ill suited to Mr. McCall, whose success has been groomed by people like Mr. Rangel. Mr. McCall sees no problem with his cautious style, saying, "When I do come out of the gate I think I come out with sound solutions rather than just coming out because it's the popular thing to do."

Education
Mr. McCall was president of the Board of Education from July 1991 to April 1993 -- turbulent times in which the school system was inundated with new students, coping with an influx of recent immigrants and besieged by the violence spilling in from the streets.
The city was in such a severe budget crisis that the schools lost $444 million in the first year of Mr. McCall's tenure, according to figures from the Education Priorities Panel, a coalition of civic groups.
Also roiling the system were headline-making social policies advocated by Joseph A. Fernandez, the schools chancellor. They included an AIDS prevention program with condom distribution and, initially, discussions about anal sex, and the "rainbow curriculum," which agitated many parents when its message of tolerance embraced books like "Heather Has Two Mommies."
Those issues were difficult to navigate on a deeply and publicly divided board with a four-member conservative majority, one of whom was the campaign director for Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was mounting a challenge to Mayor David N. Dinkins.
The Pataki campaign has complained that under Mr. McCall's tenure, class size increased, albeit marginally; the percentage of money spent in the classroom shrank from 79 to 77 percent; a smaller percentage of graduates went to college (79 versus 85 percent previously); and test scores in math and reading dropped.
Those statistics do not tell the whole story. Average class size shrank in the lower grades, where experts say small classes matter more; more students got diplomas; math and reading scores dropped in some grades but rose in others; and the math test was changed, making it difficult to measure improvement. 
Further, education experts say it is the chancellor who typically has an impact on such matters as test scores and class size, not the board president.
"He had as much to do with reading instruction in the schools as my grandfather," said Seymour Fliegel, a former deputy superintendent who is now president of the Center for Educational Innovation-Public Education Association.
Still, according to one person who was a high-ranking school official at the time, Mr. McCall, who had briefly worked as a teacher in Boston, was able to push through some improvements. He helped persuade Albany to reimburse districts not just for new construction, but for rented facilities, a crucial benefit for New York City. 
"We had no good pipeline into the Dinkins administration before," the official said. "We had much better access in Albany. We had much better communication with the board itself."
Mr. McCall was seen as an advocate for Mr. Fernandez, but in fact he did not always side with him. Though appointed by Mayor Dinkins, an old friend from the Harlem Democratic clubhouse, he at times used that relationship to extract concessions -- in 1991 threatening to sue the city for violating a law that required it to spend a certain percentage of its budget on education. Mr. Dinkins came up with an extra $32 million. 
Mr. McCall also sued Albany, accusing the state of inequitable school funding, while the Legislature was considering him for the post of state comptroller after Edward V. Regan resigned. That was the precursor to the lawsuit cited so often in the campaign in which an appellate court ruled that an eighth grade education is enough.
Mr. McCall also used his presidency as a bully pulpit, calling for the hiring of more minority teachers and getting the School Construction Authority to diversify its work force by apprenticing high school students and recent graduates. 
But the social controversies were more obstinate.
Before his appointment, the board had approved the distribution of condoms in high schools, but soon after he began, the issue came up again with the idea that parents should be allowed to opt out. Although Mr. McCall had said he would have voted against making condoms available in the first place, he also voted against the opt-out provision, saying he just wanted to move past the rancorous debate.
He voted against proposals to require AIDS educators to stress abstinence in every lesson. But Mr. McCall also voted to reverse the suspension of a Queens school board that would not carry out Mr. Fernandez's multicultural curriculum, saying he was trying "to bring all parties together."
Less attention was paid to programs that had perhaps a more lasting impact. Mr. McCall marshaled the votes to support Mr. Fernandez's push to start 37 small high schools with themes like economics or the city's museums; many of those schools are rated among the city's best today.
But in the end he could not save the chancellor, who was seen by his enemies as having misjudged the moral pulse of the city and as having failed to be conciliatory.
"Good luck, God bless you; maybe we didn't deserve you," Mr. McCall said after the 4-to-3 vote to oust Mr. Fernandez in February 1993. Soon, Mr. McCall was on his way out, too, to Albany as comptroller.

Legislature
Mr. Pataki's campaign, citing Mr. McCall's Senate record, has tried to brand Mr. McCall a liberal on taxes for voting for several tax increases. But the Senate was controlled by Republicans, and many of the bills were aimed at pulling New York City out of the fiscal bog.
Mr. McCall served three terms, from 1975 to 1979, in a State Senate seat representing Harlem and the Upper West Side of Manhattan, at a time when New York City teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. 
"Those were all tax increases that were negotiated by the Republican leadership, with the governor, with the mayor and supported by the Republicans," said Manfred Ohrenstein, the Democratic minority leader at the time. "Without them, the city would have gone under."
It was nearly impossible for a Democrat like Mr. McCall to get any of his own legislation through. Steven Greenberg, Mr. McCall's campaign spokesman, said Mr. McCall focused instead on helping his constituents. He also frequently spoke on issues affecting blacks.
Mr. McCall left the Senate in 1979 to be alternative representative for special affairs at the United States Mission to the United Nations. In 1981, he served briefly as New York's human rights commissioner.
There is little record of his service in these jobs, and no sense he made any memorable impact.
Through a friend, Mr. McCall met John Reed, the chairman of Citibank, which led to a job as a vice president. Mr. McCall stayed at Citibank from 1985 to 1993, but he was never, technically, a banker. He worked as a supervisor in the bank's system of branches, then spent most of his time hiring and overseeing lobbyists in about 30 states.

Comptroller
Mr. McCall was appointed state comptroller in 1993 by the Legislature to fill a vacancy, then was elected twice. He oversees the $105 billion State Pension Fund, the second largest in the country after California's. Independent fiscal analysts have given it high marks for its management and growth, though, like other pension funds, it has suffered in the sinking stock market.
Mr. Pataki's campaign has criticized Mr. McCall, however, for the way he has handled some of the investing. They say he has put a smaller percentage of the pension fund's investments in state businesses than his predecessor. Mr. McCall's campaign counters that the overall dollar value of New York investments, including stocks, has grown to $24 billion from $14 billion since 1993.
Much of Mr. Pataki's criticism focuses on the state's $250 million Venture Capital Investment Program, authorized by the Legislature in 1999. Mr. McCall hired four investment managers and promised them $115 million, but only $14 million has been invested in companies, half to firms outside of New York. Mr. McCall's aides said they have been prudently cautious, searching for qualified businesses with a track record. 
Mr. McCall said that one of his proudest achievements was increasing the benefits of the fund's 307,000 retirees so they now get an annual cost-of-living raise in their pensions. Public employees with 10 years on the job no longer have to contribute 3 percent of their salaries to the fund because of legislation he backed.
Some independent analysts say paying the cost-of-living increase could damage the fund in the future because even when the stock market is performing poorly, decreasing the fund's value, it will still have to pay the additional money.

Ethics
In 1989, a 10-year-old plan to build an international trade center in Harlem moved forward with the naming of a development team. But the project, envisioned as a hotel and office tower financed with more than $40 million from the Port Authority and nearly as much in state construction loan guarantees, did not get much farther than that.
Instead, it became what the Pataki administration called a patronage mill, with Mr. McCall as the chairman. A 1992 audit by the New York State Urban Development Corporation cites examples of no-bid contracts and contracts that ballooned far beyond their original amount. Mr. McCall billed the trade center for a dinner with his wife, Dr. Joyce Brown, and Mr. Rangel; a $15,000 trip to Africa; a trip to the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta, a car rental during a vacation to Martha's Vineyard; and nearly $8,000 for car services at other times. Mr. McCall later reimbursed the trade center more than $2,200 for some of the billing, which his spokesman said was inadvertent.
The center itself was never built. Ultimately, Governor Pataki took back the remaining money.
Issues have arisen around campaign contributions, although Mr. Pataki has received far more than Mr. McCall from companies that do business with the state. In the last three years, Mr. McCall's campaign has received at least $800,000 from equity managers, lawyers and real estate companies that do business with the pension fund. 
Mr. Greenberg points out that hundreds of companies benefiting from the pension fund do not give money to Mr. McCall. 
Other issues have arisen over suits that Mr. McCall, as comptroller, has filed on behalf of shareholders against various corporations whose stocks are included in the state pension fund. One suit, against the Cendant Corporation, which owns brand names like Avis and Howard Johnson and whose market value plunged by $14.4 billion in 1998 when it was accused of accounting irregularities, produced the largest class-action shareholders settlement in history.
Campaign money has come to Mr. McCall from the law firms and an accounting firm he chose to represent Cendant shareholders. In that case, a judge awarded two of the firms fees amounting to more than $10,000 an hour. Mr. McCall refused to join the City of New York, also a plaintiff, in appealing the fees. The courts struck down the fees, calling them "staggering." The final fees have not yet been set.
Mr. McCall said in a recent debate that the law firms were awarded the fees under a contract. 
Most recently, The New York Post revealed that Mr. McCall had written a handful of letters pitching the resumes of his wife, daughter, cousin and nephew on official state stationery. In one, for his daughter, he mentioned the number of shares that the pension fund owned. 
Though mentioning the shares was widely considered to reflect poor judgment, government monitors said such letters do not appear to violate any laws, and other lawmakers said such letters are common.

HEADLINE: Can This Marriage Be Saved? 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
While in Saudi Arabia recently, I sat down at a computer terminal to see how the Internet works there.
 I typed in the address women.org, not knowing what it was but figuring that it might sound subversive to Saudi ears. (It turns out to be a women's empowerment site.) Sure enough, a message flashed on my screen that the site was blocked. 
 Then I tried religioustolerance.org ("promoting religious tolerance as a human right"), and that was blocked as well. So were informational pages on Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Hinduism, as well as sites calling for love and respect among faiths.
A Harvard report on Saudi cyber-censorship was available (http:// cyber.law.harvard.edu/filtering/saudiarabia/). But blocked sites included skirtmag.com (a women's magazine), rollingstone.com, blue skyswimwear.com and human rights sites. Saudi Arabia even bans the home page for the Anne Frank House.
As I argued recently, the current fad of demonizing Saudi Arabia is vastly overdrawn. The kingdom is not an enemy and is not a terrorist state. But as the Saudi Internet shows, we and Saudi Arabia have few values in common.
So after 60 years of common-law marriage, it's time to arrange a separation. We'll both be better off if we pull U.S. troops out of the kingdom.
We hooked up because we wanted its oil and it wanted our technology and protection. It wasn't mutual love, but mutual exploitation.
The rumors are that Crown Prince Abdullah, the Saudi leader, frets that American bases are undermining Saudi security (by inflaming fundamentalists) more than bolstering it. And the bases are of dubious value to the United States because the Saudis tightly restrict how we use them.
Moreover, the bases have forced us to compromise our own values. Until this year we required servicewomen leaving the base to wear the black cloaks called abayas; since a lawsuit, we simply "strongly encourage" servicewomen to wear abayas.
Let's hope we don't station troops in Sudan; if we do, the Pentagon may encourage Americans to observe local mores like owning slaves and mutilating female genitals.
We need bases in the gulf. But they'll be more useful to us -- and less likely to provoke unrest -- in Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain.
Saudi Arabia was once seen as the center of the Arab world. But lower oil prices pushed per capita income down from $28,600 in current dollars in 1981 to $7,230 in 2000. The economic excitement in the region is in Dubai, and the political innovation in Bahrain. As a senior Kuwaiti official told me as I was about to leave for Riyadh, "Set your watch back 100 years."
Take the Saudi pettifoggery that forbids the practice of faiths other than Islam. Foreigners are not supposed to wear crosses, and Bibles are banned. (I smuggled in a Bible to see what the customs officials would say, but they didn't inspect my bags.) 
One reason for optimism about Saudi Arabia is its hypocrisy: Saudi Arabians are more open-minded than their country. Nobody minds that foreigners discreetly attend religious services in embassies. And while alcohol is strictly forbidden, I attended a dinner party where everybody was gulping Scotch or vodka. (I had Scotch in hopes I would be caught and flogged, which would have made a great column!)
Unfortunately, since 1979, when Saudi Arabia was shaken by the seizure of Mecca's Grand Mosque by religious extremists, the royal family has tried to minimize the fundamentalist threat -- on some issues -- by meeting the extremists part way.
King Abdel Aziz, Abdullah's father and the founder of Saudi Arabia, was not so timid. When fundamentalists opposed cars, radio and the telegraph as non-Islamic, he fought back. He showed that the radio could be used to broadcast the Koran, that the telegraph could transmit it. He dared tug his country toward modernity. 
There are hopeful signs that Prince Abdullah could have some of his father's mettle. He is revising school curriculums, condemning Islamic extremism and easing restrictions on the press. If Abdullah was only bold enough to take steps that reformers are urging, such as allowing women to drive, introducing elections for the National Advisory Council and promoting a tolerant and pluralist vision of Islam that would not be threatened by Bibles or by Anne Frank, then he could rescue the Saudi-American relationship -- and his own country as well.

HEADLINE: Job Losses Continued In October 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The economy lost jobs in October for the second consecutive month, the government said yesterday, in a sign that economic growth, after accelerating over the summer, has recently slowed to a crawl.
 The unemployment rate rose slightly last month to 5.7 percent, and the nation's payrolls shrunk by 5,000 jobs, largely because of layoffs in manufacturing and construction. Companies also cut their workers' hours for the first time since July, suggesting that large-scale hiring is unlikely in the immediate future. 
 The report, released just days before the midterm election, provided evidence of the worst job losses in the economy during a two-year Congressional cycle since 1981-82, when Republicans lost ground on Capitol Hill two years after the Reagan landslide. 
Coming after several weeks of discouraging economic signs, the Labor Department report also led most economists to predict that the Federal Reserve would cut its benchmark interest rate when it meets on Wednesday, probably by a quarter point but perhaps by as much as a half percentage point.
Last year, the Fed reduced the rate -- currently at 1.75 percent -- 11 times to lower the cost of borrowing and encourage new spending by businesses and consumers. The Fed has kept the rate steady this year in the hope, now fading, that the economy was solidly recovering from last year's recession.
Hoping to make the kind of gains opposition parties often do during economic slowdowns, Democrats used yesterday's report to criticize President Bush's economic leadership. Republicans responded that they could best improve job growth by capturing control of the Senate as well as the House, enabling them to pass a new round of tax cuts.
With terrorism and a possible war in Iraq occupying much of the political debate, however, the economy might not prove to be as important an issue as it has in the past, members of both parties said.
"It hasn't gotten to that kind of red-hot issue yet, but the mood is one of foreboding," said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island.
R. Glenn Hubbard, a top economic adviser to Mr. Bush, commented: "Things aren't getting worse, but they aren't getting noticeably better."
Adding to the concerns, weekly earnings fell in October for the first time since July and only the second time in the last year. Consumer spending already dropped 0.4 percent in September, the Commerce Department said yesterday, and many companies, worried that spending may slow further, have cut production recently.
Last month, manufacturers eliminated 49,000 jobs, the 27th straight monthly cut by the sector, which now employs fewer workers than it has at any point since 1961. Reinforcing a sense that the industrial sector is suffering more than it was during the summer, a survey of supply-chain managers released yesterday indicated that manufacturing activity fell in October for the second month in a row.
"The economy has lost considerable momentum," said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm in St. Louis. "It's clearly taking longer for it to rebound than a lot of people had thought initially."
Still, the addition of 70,000 workers across the broad service sector last month helped keep the nation's payrolls nearly flat and suggested that the economy, while weak, did not appear headed for a new recession. Hospitals, hotels, law firms, mortgage brokers and restaurants all added workers in October, the Labor Department said. Government agencies helped, too, adding 24,000 employees.
Also, the Labor Department's regular data revisions showed that the economy had created more jobs in August and eliminated fewer in September than previously reported.
"It's still hard to find jobs," said Richard D. Rippe, the chief economist at Prudential Securities, "but we haven't seen a collapse in the labor market."
Stocks rose yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average up more than 120 points, or 1.44 percent, to close at 8,517.64. Investors seemed to take the poor job performance and the rise in the jobless rate, which had been 5.6 percent in September, as an indication that the economy was weak enough to encourage the Fed to reduce interest rates, but not so weak as to harm corporate profits severely.
Some analysts argue that the Fed should act more aggressively and cut rates by a half-point next week, rather than taking small steps that might fail to jump-start the economy. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and many of his colleagues have been reluctant to act again, believing that last year's cuts will continue to help growth in coming months.
Since the beginning of last year, the economy has lost 1.7 million jobs, or about 1 percent of the nation's total, according to the Labor Department. In the last 60 years, only the Congressional elections of 1954, 1958 and 1982 came after a two-year period with larger job losses, relative to the size of the labor force.
Those three elections happened in the middle of a Republican president's term, as is the case this year, and Democrats gained even more seats in those elections than is typical for the opposition party in a midterm election.
Yesterday's jobs report offered them one more opportunity to fault Mr. Bush for this job downturn.
"The administration tends to ignore these economic issues," said Mr. Reed, the senior Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee. "The same effort and imagination he applies to other areas should be applied to the economy."
Representative John M. Spratt Jr., Democrat of South Carolina, said the party would extend unemployment insurance and consider cutting taxes and increasing public works spending if it gained control of the House and kept control of the Senate. Most Republicans oppose new spending, including the extension of jobless benefits.
Mr. Hubbard said the president was responsible for the two most significant pieces of economic legislation during the last two years: last year's tax cut and the stimulus package early this year. A Republican-controlled Congress could create jobs by passing more tax cuts and a terrorism-insurance bill, he said.
Either way, however, "we are in for a bumpy next few months," Mr. Hubbard said.
Beyond the overall numbers, the jobs report was filled with evidence of the economy's deterioration since the summer.
The average weekly earnings of hourly workers, who make up about 80 percent of the work force, fell 46 cents, to $507.75, according to the Labor Department, which adjusts the numbers to account for normal seasonal variations. The number of people who said they could find only part-time work increased to 4.3 million, from 3.9 million in June. More of the unemployed last month were people who had lost their jobs, and fewer were people entering the labor force.
Employment at temporary-help firms also fell by 56,000, the biggest drop in a year. Before companies begin hiring large numbers of permanent workers, they often add to their temporary work force.
"There's no indication the economy is getting liftoff speed," said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs.

HEADLINE: Detroit's Hottest Item Is Its Biggest Gas Guzzler 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Detroit can't seem to sell enough cars or trucks these days without piling on rebates and free financing. With one exception.
 Three months into an experiment to bring a smaller and cheaper version of the militaristic Hummer vehicle to a broad audience, General Motors has struck a chord. Put aside the difficulty of selling a $50,000 sport utility vehicle in a bear market and stagnant economy, or of marketing an automobile that gets about 11 miles a gallon when there is renewed focus on oil consumption. 
 Dealers say they are selling as many of these vehicles as they can get. G.M.'s supply is only six days ahead of demand -- automakers prefer 10 times that amount. And Hummer is the only Big Three brand selling largely without any national incentives. 
Many buyers of this low-end Hummer, called the H2, sound like evangelists and speak of other modern sport utilities as the vehicle of soccer moms -- tame family haulers little different from zoo-bound wildlife too long in captivity. To them, Hummer represents what Ford's Bronco II or Jeep did before sport utilities overran the highways.
"You can't believe the attention it gets," said Robert Fishelson, 65, whose family runs a wholesale liquor company in Fond du Lac, Wis. Mr. Fishelson has outfitted his H2 with lights on top, a winch and his ham radio. "It's like I'm a movie star," he added. "I have young girls, teeny-boppers, yelling out their windows at me."
Mr. Fishelson, who has owned 15 Corvettes at various points of his life, still says that the H2 is by far his most-noticed automobile. 
Environmentalists are incensed that G.M. is building up a new brand that will probably be the industry's most fuel-inefficient mass market vehicle line, producing higher emissions of smog-causing pollutants and greenhouse gases than do cars and many sport utility vehicles. Not to mention the annoyance to other drivers: the H2, at more than three tons, weighs a ton more than the Ford Explorer and twice what a Ford Taurus weighs and is one of the tallest and widest passenger vehicles on the road.
It is difficult to pinpoint the gas mileage of Hummers because both the original Hummer, a diesel, and the gasoline-fed H2 are so heavy that they do not fall under normal federal fuel economy regulations that govern cars, S.U.V.'s and most pickups. As a result, the Hummer's fuel economy does not have to be reported to the government. 
The Sierra Club is planning a campaign against the Hummer, along the lines of its effort against the huge Ford Excursion, which the environmental group dubbed the Valdez after the oil tanker that ran aground in Alaska. Ford recently discontinued the Excursion.
"We're going to try to do to the Hummer what we did to the Valdez," said Daniel Becker, the Sierra Club's top energy expert. "Kill it." 
But H2 buyers, asked whether gasoline consumption was any consideration, generally assume the question is whether they can afford to fill up the 32-gallon gas tank so often.
"If you can afford to buy an H2, if you get 10 miles to the gallon you're not going to care," said Bill Kramer, a 51-year-old computer programmer from Long Island whose H2 actually gets about 9 miles a gallon around town. "If gas went up to $3 per gallon, then maybe."
Mr. Kramer said his H2 "looks like what an S.U.V. should be."
"People who like to buy the Hummer like to stand out," he added. "I've had an Escalade, a Mercedes, a Jaguar. This Hummer H2 draws more looks and questions than any other vehicle I've owned."
Trying to broaden the H2's appeal, G.M. has begun customizing advertisements for different markets, seeking like-minded souls among readers of magazines from Road & Track to Vanity Fair. A recent pullout in The New Yorker included a cartoon depicting frightened cabbies shrinking from an H2 muscling its way down a Manhattan avenue.
H2 is often presented in G.M. ads as perfect for those who shop at Restoration Hardware but fancy themselves "rugged individualists," as the company's executives put it.
Many ads suggest it as a fortress apart from the peopled world. In one TV spot, shot in Iceland and scored with trance-like techno music, a couple who seem to have stepped out of a Banana Republic catalog peacefully navigate hemorrhaging oceans, slate-colored terrain and khaki beaches. He wears a $4,000 watch; she gazes beatifically heavenward. 
"Need," the ad instructs, "is a very subjective word." Then the scene pulls back to depict a glistening blue planet. 
The Hummer and the H2 are descended from the Humvee, the military transport used in the Persian Gulf war and still in use. G.M. has sold the Hummer for several years, at about $100,000. Through a national network of dealerships, G.M. plans to sell 100,000 Hummers within five years. In just three months 7,500 H2's have been sold; among its biggest markets are Los Angeles, Miami and Texas. G.M. hopes to sell as many as 40,000 next year -- nearly double the number of Porsches Americans bought last year.
Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, founder of the consulting firm Archetype Discoveries, on which the Big Three rely for information about their customers, said Hummer was an S.U.V. unfettered from the blandness that had overtaken the category. He interviewed potential buyers on behalf of G.M. and found a sentiment among buyers that "the S.U.V. is the new minivan."
With the Hummer, Dr. Rapaille said: "People told me, 'I can protect my family. If someone bumps into me, they're dead.' People love this feeling." One female H2 buyer told him: "I have three kids in the car with me and no one is going to look at me as a soccer mom."
A male customer in the construction business said he needed the H2's off-road capability for work, but Dr. Rapaille called that explanation an alibi.
"He could have had a Jeep or another S.U.V., but the reality is you want to show strength," he said, adding that after the Sept. 11 attacks "we feel we are at war and people feel the need to be protected."
"It's like putting on a Superman outfit," said Rick Schmidt, founder of the Detroit-based I.H.O.G., the International Hummer Owners Group. Mr. Schmidt, 49, owns an original Hummer and is thinking about trading in his Jeep Grand Cherokee for an H2.
"You want something you know can respond to the way you feel when you want to get someplace, even if it's up a mountainside," he said. Mr. Schmidt has climbed Kilimanjaro.
For its part, G.M. is facing slim profits, stiff overseas competition and industry sales beginning to slump. The company says that it thinks that it may have the beginnings of a brand that people will buy on its own merits and plans to turn Hummer into a postmodern version of Jeep. A pickup H2 is scheduled for next year and a smaller, cheaper Hummer S.U.V. is being considered for 2005. Dealers will be required to build new showrooms that resemble military barracks with plenty of brushed steel and exposed bolts inside. A prototype in Milwaukee, Bergstrom Hummer, sports a 35-foot-high "H" out front.
"The people that buy this product, they're daring," said Michael DiGiovanni, Hummer's general manager, who divides customers into those who "want to do off-roading in Moab and then do Italian for dinner" and those who are daring in more mundane ways but want a car to match their persona. John Bruno Jr., sales manager at Hummer of Manhattan, called it "an expression of a personality."
"There is no typical Hummer buyer," he said. "I am seeing a lot of the style leaders. It's a sophisticated vehicle."

HEADLINE: U.S. May Abandon Support Of U.N. Population Accord 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, embroiling itself in a new fight at the United Nations, has threatened to withdraw its support for a landmark family planning agreement that the United States helped write eight years ago.
 The reason for the threat is contained in two terms that the administration contends can be construed as promoting abortion. 
 The terms -- reproductive health services and reproductive rights -- figure in the final declaration of the United Nations population conference in 1994 in Cairo, which embraced a new concept of population policy based on improving the legal rights and economic status of women. The declaration has since been endorsed by 179 nations. 
But during a population and development conference in Bangkok this week, the American delegation announced that Washington would not reaffirm its support for the Cairo "program of action" unless the disputed words were changed or removed, United States and United Nations officials said. 
The threat startled members of other delegations attending the Asian and Pacific Population Conference and drew immediate criticism from Chinese, Indian and Indonesian officials, who argued that the American position would undermine a global consensus on population policy, according to United Nations officials.
The threat has also elicited a sharp response from some Europeans. 
"I think it is disappointing and incredible," said Agnes van Ardenne, the Dutch minister for development cooperation. "Poverty reduction will not be successful without reproductive health and without women being able to make their own choices."
Congressional Democrats and United Nations officials underscored these concerns today, saying that a decision by the administration to withdraw support for the Cairo program would undermine the efforts of family planning officials in countries that have looked to the United States to take the lead in checking population growth.
"The impact of these public statements is devastating and could undermine 10 years of work," Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York, said in a draft letter to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that she began circulating on Capitol Hill today. "It is likely that repressive countries will follow the U.S. in its decision and the progress that has been made will cease."
The State Department declined to comment on the dispute today. But administration officials acknowledged that the United States might not reaffirm its support for the Cairo program unless the disputed phrases were withdrawn or modified. 
The 1994 conference was widely considered a watershed event because it moved away from traditional ideas of family planning and embraced the idea that giving women more control over their lives would provide a check against explosive population growth. 
The program of action called for stabilizing the world's population at no more than 9.8 billion by 2050 and it urged countries to make health care widely accessible, reduce maternal mortality, provide universal access to primary education and stem the spread of H.I.V. and AIDS. The program also suggested that where abortion is legal, it should be made safe.
The program's acknowledgment that legal abortion could be part of health care has drawn objections from the Vatican and several Muslim and Latin American countries. But over the years, the United States has consistently reaffirmed the Cairo principles. 
One of the Vatican's chief negotiators in Cairo, John Klink, was an adviser to the United States delegation in Bangkok, United Nations officials said.
Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee, praised the Bush administration's stand.
"We certainly approve of any effort by the administration to make it clear that abortion is not an acceptable method of family planning," Mr. Johnson said. "There is a sort of code used in some of these U.N. documents, and groups that advocate expanded access to abortion do construe these phrases to include abortion."
The dispute over the Cairo program is only the most recent example of administration efforts to withdraw American support from United Nations programs that it contends promote abortion. 
In July, the administration decided to withhold $34 million in previously approved aid to the United Nations Population Fund, contending that the agency helps Chinese government agencies that force women to have abortions.
In May, during the United Nations General Assembly's special session on children, the Bush administration, the Vatican and some Muslim countries unsuccessfully pushed for a policy to prevent teenagers from getting abortions. The group also sought to make abstinence the centerpiece of sex education for unmarried teenagers. 
Timothy E. Wirth, the under secretary of state for global affairs in 1994, said he expected the Bush administration to reaffirm the Cairo program eventually. If it does not, he said, the United States might alienate important allies just as it is trying to build international support for its Iraq policies.
"The reaction would be very negative," Mr. Wirth added, "at a time when the administration is trying to put together international coalitions on various efforts."

HEADLINE: Longing for a Sept. 10 Skyline; 
Some Vocal Groups Call for Restoring the Twin Towers

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
On Lafayette Street in SoHo, a little more than a mile from ground zero, the World Trade Center soars resplendently on a billboard that cries, "Rebuild the Towers, Bigger and Better Than Before."
 Across the street, at the firehouse for Ladder 20, which lost seven firefighters on Sept. 11 and also houses the Fire Department's mental-health counseling services, a darker view of the billboard prevails. "Tasteless," said one firefighter as he stood on the sidewalk one morning. 
 The emotions conjured by the image of rebuilt twin towers are as raw today as they were a year ago, both for friends and family members of the victims and for the people who would have the towers rebuilt. 
Politicians and planners have repeatedly dismissed the idea of rebuilding the towers, saying it is not economically feasible because few people want to work 100 stories above ground, especially at ground zero. 
But a few vocal groups of tower supporters insist that a large segment of the public is on their side. These small groups, which say they have gathered thousands of names on petitions in support of their goal, have continued to put up billboards, manage Web sites, speak and pass out leaflets at public hearings, often generating enthusiastic responses. 
"The public generally supports the towers, and we're trying to make sure they are heard by the bureaucrats," said Louis Epstein, the founder of the World Trade Center Restoration Movement, a group of local residents that is planning a rally at 11 a.m. today at City Hall Park.
It is not entirely clear whether the tower advocates have directly influenced the debate in ways they have not been given credit for, or whether they simply represent a strain of thought shared by some of the public, but certainly not everyone.
But Mr. Epstein said the groups were part of the clamor that has already changed the course of the rebuilding once, in the rejection of the six original designs for the trade center site, and he maintains they could do so again.
The claims of widespread support may not be as far-fetched as some have portrayed them. At a July 20 public hearing at the Javits Convention Center, the 4,500 participants were asked to name the features that they most liked and disliked about the six original designs. The No. 1 response among disliked features stated, "Schemes are not ambitious enough -- buildings are too short."
Ever since, tower supporters have complained that the result has been wrongly described. Joe Wright, a member of the restoration movement, said that opponents have molded that response into a claim that the public felt the original plans were too dense. In fact, that was the third most popular complaint, drawing only half as much support as the idea that the buildings were too short.
Mr. Epstein, an Internet service provider in Putnam County, N.Y., and Mr. Wright, an independent designer of telephone voice response systems, are characteristic of many of the tower advocates: male, highly educated, computer-savvy iconoclasts. Coincidentally, few of those interviewed for this article have worked or lived on a high floor of a high-rise building.
What the tower advocates want, generally, is something based on the original design by Minoru Yamasaki: two towers, 110 stories or higher, not necessarily identical but substantially the same. They generally recognize the need for a memorial, and many agree that the footprints of the original towers should be used for one.
Not giving in to the terrorists is their dominant theme, but supporters also talk of how cities in Japan, Germany and England rebuilt after World War II, how there has been no apparent rush to vacate the Empire State Building or the Sears Tower, and how no one at the Pentagon would have contemplated not rebuilding after Sept. 11.
"We feel there is a silent majority that wants the twin towers rebuilt," said Randy Warner, a television production company executive raised in Queens who works in Los Angeles and helped found Team Twin Towers, one of the most vocal groups.
As for who would be willing to work at such a height, fans of the towers start with themselves, but they maintain there are plenty of other people. When members of the restoration movement are campaigning near ground zero, Mr. Wright said, they quickly run out of the stickers that read, "Yes I'd work on the 110th floor!"
The billboard on Lafayette Street says it was "paid for by an asset management firm which would be honored to relocate into the new buildings." The owner of the billboard, Van Wagner Communications, refused to reveal the advertiser.
A New York Times/CBS News Poll conducted in late August found considerably less desire to work high in a rebuilt tower. Of 1,008 New Yorkers surveyed, 53 percent said they would be unwilling to work in one of the higher floors of a new building at the World Trade Center site. While 53 percent said they might visit a high floor to eat at a restaurant or visit an observation deck, a greater percentage, 59 percent, said that whatever is built at the site, it should not be as tall as what was there before. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
Rebuilding officials, who initially insisted that nothing would rise to a height of 100 stories, have since instructed their architects to design something to restore a striking element to the downtown skyline. But they continue to dismiss the idea of rebuilding the twin towers.
"I don't believe a developer would be interested in rebuilding a 100-story tower because I don't believe that many people would want to work up there," said John C. Whitehead, chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is overseeing the rebuilding.
Officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the site, echo Mr. Whitehead's feelings. "As you can imagine, since it was our home for 30 years, we certainly understand the emotional attraction of rebuilding the twin towers," said Michael A. Petralia, who oversees public and governmental affairs at the authority. "But from a practical standpoint, I don't think it's something we're pursuing at all."
Even Mr. Whitehead, however, said he had altered his thinking about the skyline.
"I probably changed my mind a little bit when I realized, particularly at the July 20 meeting, how strong the feeling was that the skyline be restored," Mr. Whitehead said. Now, he said, he might favor "an office building of more modest height with the possibility of a superstructure on top of it," an idea first sketched out by architects working for Larry A. Silverstein, who holds the lease to the trade center property.
Mr. Silverstein said that he would soon release his own design, including an unoccupied superstructure, for the site. 
"Emotionally, I can relate to the thought of replacing the twin towers with two identical towers, to re-establish the skyline of New York to what it was and as a show of defiance to terrorists that they did not and could not stop us," he said. "But if you look at the pragmatics, you'll probably see that people are feeling more comfortable with floor heights not necessarily up to 110 stories," he said, but closer to 50 to 75 stories. 
Tower advocates said that while the superstructure idea was a step in the right direction, it fell short.
While almost no constituency is unanimous in its feeling, one important group -- family members of those killed on Sept. 11 -- generally, and strongly, opposes the idea of rebuilding the towers. 
"There shouldn't be occupied towers of 112 stories," said Christy Ferer, whose husband, Neil D. Levin, the executive director of the Port Authority, was killed on Sept. 11. "I think we should try to replicate their grandeur, but with a soaring piece of sculpture."
Mr. Epstein demurred. "With all due respect to the family members of victims of the attacks, they're clouding the issue," he said. "In 50 years what will be more important down there, a soaring memorial or a place to do business?"

HEADLINE: Chasing Dream of Olympics, Stadium and All, for New York 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

DATELINE: COLORADO SPRINGS, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Daniel L. Doctoroff paced nervously across the elegant dining room of the Broadmoor Hotel like an Olympic sprinter ready to drop into the starting blocks. He has been training for six years, not to win a single medal but to capture the entire event itself, to bring the Summer Olympics to New York City in 2012.
 On Saturday afternoon, the 123 directors of the United States Olympic Committee gathered here will choose between New York and San Francisco as the United States candidate for host city of the 2012 Games. Mr. Doctoroff, an investment banker turned New York City deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, has led the charge in getting New York's bid for the Olympics. Now, it is nearly game time. 
 "I slept fitfully last night," said Mr. Doctoroff, who was wearing a new, blue NYC2012 blazer from Brooks Brothers. "I'm confident we'll put our best foot forward. But this is like a political campaign in which you can't do any polling and you have no contact with the voters." 
U.S.O.C. rules prohibited the bid committees from lobbying the directors until this evening, the day before the two cities' final pitches to the committee members. New York won a coin toss today and elected to make its presentation after the San Francisco 2012 committee makes its pitch. The city that wins Saturday afternoon's vote will then have to compete with foreign cities in the coming years to be the International Olympic Committee's final choice as the 2012 host city.
It has been a long journey for Mr. Doctoroff, 44, a millionaire Midwesterner who initially hated the thought of living in New York. He said the idea of bringing the Olympics to New York struck him in 1994 as he watched a World Cup soccer game in New Jersey. His passion for the idea grew, and by now he has persuaded even some of the most cynical corporate executives to contribute to the $13 million effort to get here. His brash, lone-wolf style has alienated some people inside and outside the Bloomberg administration, but most agree New York would not have gotten this far without him.
"I knew Dan had a vision and a passion," said Steven M. Gluckstern, founder of Azimuth Alternative Assets, who has negotiated business deals with Mr. Doctoroff and supported the Olympic bid early on. "But I didn't know if he could do it. There are few people who are as persuasive as he is."
Mr. Doctoroff can go on at length about the glories of athletic competition, or what he calls the billion dollars worth of parks and athletic sites that would remain as a legacy from the Games. But mostly he talks about using the Games as a tool to help the city complete $5 billion worth of transportation and development projects on the West Side of Manhattan, which might not ordinarily get done. 
Of course, not everyone on the West Side is thrilled with the prospect of a billion-dollar Olympic stadium in the neighborhood. The opposition trailed Mr. Doctoroff to Colorado Springs, sending a "contra-bid report" to the U.S.O.C. directors. Beyond that, some urban planners question the wisdom of spending scarce public dollars on the Olympics. But Mr. Doctoroff persists. "I think this is an opportunity and we have to seize it," he said.
At first glance, Mr. Doctoroff is an unlikely Olympian pied piper. The leader of the San Francisco bid committee, Anne W. Cribbs, was an Olympic swimmer, but Mr. Doctoroff had a sports career that ended in the ninth grade. He broke both thumbs during a Friday afternoon football game, and the following Monday he broke his collarbone at practice. After six weeks of recuperation, he went back on the football field and broke his arm. 
"That essentially ended my sports career," he said.
Of course, Mrs. Cribbs is not a deputy mayor. Mr. Doctoroff's title enables him to assert that the 2012 bid committee will build nearly $1 billion in Olympic sites, while government and private developers will construct $5 billion in subways, stadiums and housing. 
Still, is this something you would expect from an investment banker, who before becoming deputy mayor was a managing partner of Oak Hill Capital Management?
"This was a bug that bit Dan," said Richard D. Parsons, chairman of AOL Time Warner and an early supporter of Mr. Doctoroff's effort. "Dan had made his money, and I think he wanted to make a contribution on a broader stage."
But while Mr. Doctoroff has managed to collect support from the business aristocracy, the average New Yorker may just be beginning to focus on the Olympics in the city.
Mr. Doctoroff grew up in a suburb of Detroit. His father was a state appeals court judge and his mother was a psychologist. He attended Harvard College and spent two years at the University of Chicago Law School, before finishing up at New York University. He never practiced law, choosing investment banking instead. He worked at Lehman Brothers for three years before joining the Texan Robert Bass's private investment company, and he made his fortune at an early age.
In 1997, Mr. Doctoroff was part of a group that bought and later sold the New York Islanders hockey team. He owns a tiny, passive interest in five buildings in or near the West Side of Manhattan, although his assets were placed in a blind trust when he became deputy mayor last January.
Eight years ago, Mr. Doctoroff attended his first soccer game, a World Cup match at Giants Stadium between Italy and Bulgaria, and was floored by the fervor of the fans.
"The thing that's so amazing is that any two teams in the world could play here, and you'd still fill the stands with fans, and the same intensity would be there," he said. "I left the stadium with the notion that New York ought to host the Olympics."
He spent the next 18 months learning about the Games. In 1996, he opened a campaign for New York to have the 2008 Olympics. He quickly picked up support from New Yorkers on Wall Street and in real estate.
"Our first impression was that he was clearly gung-ho, committed and knowledgeable," said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, whose members have contributed millions to NYC2012. "He kept talking and talking about it. It was all very interesting, but we only had an hour and a half." 
Mr. Doctoroff's pitch turned executives who started out rolling their eyes into true believers. But he suffered a setback a year later when the U.S.O.C. decided not to pursue the 2008 Games, which went to Beijing. It was more than a year before he renewed the idea, this time aiming for 2012. Once again, he talked to anyone who would listen.
Mr. Gluckstern said Mr. Doctoroff's ability to focus serves him well in business and in his chase of the Olympics. "I've been in lots of negotiations with Dan," he said. "I've rarely seen someone as disciplined as this guy."
Mr. Doctoroff's single-minded focus has offended some at City Hall and, they say, has made it hard for him to practice the political art of compromise. But for now Mr. Doctoroff certainly has the support of his boss, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. 
At a City Hall news conference on Wednesday, Mayor Bloomberg advised that it would be a joyous flight back to New York if they won Saturday's vote at the U.S.O.C. meeting. "If we get selected," the mayor said, "Dan can come back inside the cabin, as opposed to being strapped on the outside."

HEADLINE: Critics Take Aim at Guidelines On Standards for Food Safety 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Consumer advocates and union officials called on Agriculture Secretary Ann M. Veneman on Thursday to disavow instructions given to meat inspectors in Kansas that critics and inspectors said encouraged the relaxation of food-safety standards to keep production moving at slaughterhouses, even amid concerns about fecal contamination.
 In guidelines issued in May, the inspectors were told that they could be held accountable for lost production if they failed to justify slowing production, whether to examine what appeared to be traces of feces or to wash their hands. 
 "This is unheard of, the idea that you can't shut down the line when there's a problem," said an inspector who was at the May meetings.
Agriculture Department officials said they could not confirm that the instructions were part of an official document. A spokeswoman said they were not issued from headquarters here. 
"Whether this is an official document or not, we have not changed our policy of zero tolerance," said the spokeswoman, Alisa Harrison. 
Ms. Harrison said the protesting consumer groups "could be using this document for political purposes."
Dr. Garry L. McKee, administrator of the Food Safety and Inspection Service in the department, issued a statement saying meat-safety standards had not been relaxed.
"F.S.I.S. has not changed its zero tolerance policy and has no plans to do so," Dr. McKee said. 
The instruction memorandum became public weeks after the largest meat recall. Pilgrim's Pride asked for the recall of 27.4 million pounds of cooked turkey and chicken products on Oct. 13, after listeria bacteria had been found in its plant in Franconia, Pa., and tied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to a listeriosis outbreak that caused seven deaths in seven Northeastern states this year.
Earlier, ConAgra had asked for the recall of 19 million pounds of ground beef that might be tainted by E. coli. That has become the third largest meat recall.
"This directive puts a straitjacket on inspectors and clearly transforms F.S.I.S.'s mission from that of protecting public health to protecting the economic health of the meat industry," said a letter signed by representatives of three advocacy groups, the Community Nutrition Institute, the Government Accountability Project and Public Citizen.
The memo, "General Information and Conduct" for new meat inspectors, was distributed from May 8 to 24 inspectors at the Farmland National Beef Packing Company in Liberal, Kan., by two Agriculture Department veterinarians, according to the inspector who attended the meeting. The memo was made public this week by the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, a union that represents meat inspectors and that is part of the American Federation of Government Employees.
In a section on fecal contamination, the inspectors were warned, "YOU are accountable for this very serious responsibility of stopping the company's production for the benefit of food safety."
They are told the limits of what is considered feces. "That is appalling," Carol Tucker Foreman of the Consumer Federation of America said. "Poop is poop. I can't think of any circumstance where it is tolerable to have fecal material on any meat coming off the line."
Paul D. Johnson, acting chairman of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, said the memo showed that in the Kansas plant, at least, inspectors were unable to do a thorough job inspecting meat.
"Inspectors," Mr. Johnson said, "know that a small smear of feces can have deadly consequences just as easily as an amount large enough to have 'a fibrous nature,' yet the U.S.D.A. prohibits us from taking action that could protect consumers." 
In his statement, Dr. McKee said the department insisted that inspectors were required to remove "contamination on that portion of the product they are responsible for inspecting."
The consumer groups and inspectors' union said they were concerned that the memo repeatedly pointed out that inspectors could be held accountable for lost production if they stopped operations to examine possible contamination and failed to find problems.

HEADLINE: Sales Drop 30% in October At Big Three Automakers 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Carmakers limped into November after an October that was the weakest month for industry sales in four years. Sales at each of the Big Three fell more than 30 percent from a year earlier. Over all, the industry's light-vehicle sales fell 27 percent. 
 Wall Street and Detroit were expecting a bad comparison with sales figures from last year, when a free financing blitz that started after the Sept. 11 attacks made October the biggest month in the industry's history. Now, though, analysts fear that a continuing raft of lavish incentives are continuing to cut into profits while having only a modest effect on sales. 
 Since September sales were anemic, too, there is worry about how the trends bode for next year. 
"It's a pretty dismal picture," said Ronald Tadross, an analyst at Bank of America. "No one expected the numbers to come in that low." 
He was most surprised by the weakness of sales by the usually stalwart foreign brands like Toyota and Honda. Though the strike by California dockworkers had an impact on sales of foreign brands, Mr. Tadross did not believe that alone explained the declines. 
Sales at Toyota fell 20.6 percent from a year ago; its Lexus brand, the top-selling luxury brand, fell 22 percent. Honda sales, including its Acura division, fell 5.6 percent. Nissan sales fell 12.6 percent. Hyundai sales were off 25.6 percent. 
"The last 12 months, and especially last October, were an anomaly for industry sales," said James. E. Press, the executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Still, he added: "The tailwind we've all enjoyed is dissipating. The industry is beginning to settle into business as usual."
Business as usual could prove difficult for the industry in an uncertain economy. Strong auto sales this year have been a key contributor in propping up consumer spending, which in turn has been the main impetus of economic growth. But officials at G.M. and Ford said today that they believed fears about a steep drop ahead in sales were overblown.
"There's still an assessment by consumers that their overall personal situations are fairly good," said Paul Ballew, G.M.'s chief industry sales analyst. "All roads are pointing to sluggish growth but positive growth next year."
General Motors announced a new incentive plan today. It will continue to offer interest-free financing on three-year loans, but it will offer bigger cash rebates in lieu of free financing on four-year and five-year loans. The company said its costs for the incentives -- which some analysts have estimated at more than $3,500 per vehicle, far more than foreign competitors' -- would be roughly unchanged.
David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities, attributed the weak October sales performance to several factors. He cited the overhang from high sales volumes in previous months, consumers' nervousness about things like the prospect of war in Iraq and depressed sales in the Washington area, where few people wanted to venture onto car lots before the sniper suspects were apprehended.
"I think November will be better," he said, "but October was a pretty weak month, weaker than I expected." 
George Pipas, the manager of industry sales analysis at Ford Motor, said he thought worries about sales in the months ahead were exaggerated. But he conceded that October had been a frightening month. 
"Last night I got home early enough to greet the last group of trick-or-treaters," he said. "One little guy was masquerading as October auto sales. You better believe it freaked me out."

HEADLINE: Shares in H & R Block Drop Over PendingSuits 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Shares of H & R Block, the nation's largest income tax preparer, fell 8 percent yesterday after rumors swept the market that short sellers were moving on the company because of pending trials in Texas. 
 Trading in Block shares was delayed for more than four hours yesterday until Block, in a statement, said that it had no concerns that the lawsuits would have a material effect on its earnings. The lawsuits accuse Block of cheating 500,000 customers who took out high-interest loans secured by tax refunds. 
 Block closed at $40.95, down $3.43. 
For a decade Block has made short-term loans to customers that are repaid with their income tax refunds, a practice that has drawn criticism from consumer advocates because of high fees. Frank Salizzoni, the former chief executive, has testified that the fees can equal, on an annual basis, hundreds of percent in interest.
Linda McDougall, Block's senior spokeswoman, said the company believed that short sellers, whom she did not name and who profit when a company's stock drops, were trying to manipulate Block shares by inflating its potential liability in the Texas cases. There the company is accused of violating a commercial bribery statute under which it could be forced to disgorge all the fees it charged and pay punitive damages.
The Avalon Research Group, an independent firm, reported yesterday that the Texas suits were not disclosed in Securities and Exchange Commission filings, according to Bloomberg News.
While Block assured shareholders that management had no concerns, a position Ms. McDougall reiterated in an interview, a federal judge earlier this year said that in Texas alone Block faced a liability that ranged from zero to $2 billion. Ms. McDougall dismissed the remark yesterday, saying that the judge simply repeated an inflated assertion fabricated by the Texas lawyers to leverage a settlement from Block.
Block is accused in Texas of violating a duty of loyalty to its customers under that state's commercial bribery law by not telling them that it received a fee of several dollars for each loan it arranged for its banking partner, a fee that the Texas lawyers called a kickback. Block also owned 49.9 percent of the loans. 
Block has already agreed that if it violated the commercial bribery law, it must disgorge $74.9 million in fees. A trial is to begin Dec. 2 in that case, in which punitive damages are also being sought.
Judge Manuel Banales held a hearing Thursday in Kingsville, Tex., during which he asked tough questions about Block's disclosures. He may rule before the trial on whether Block violated the bribery law. If he finds the law was violated, the trial would examine only punitive damages, said Robert Hilliard of Hilliard & Munoz, a Corpus Christi, Tex., law firm representing Block customers.
Block had successfully held off a number of class-action cases for years until it suffered reversals in courts in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Texas. 
Then Block and one of its banking partners, Beneficial Finance, agreed to settle all the class-action cases with four small Chicago law firms for a maximum of $15 per client. A federal judge approved the settlement over objections from lawyers who had pursued Block for years. They called it a sweetheart deal and noted that Beneficial even gave the law firms an edited copy of the lawsuit it wanted filed against it.
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit later criticized Judge William B. Zagel for his handling of the case and assigned a new judge.
Last month, Block lost an effort to stop the Texas cases from going forward while it continued efforts to have the Chicago settlement approved. 
"I actually think it may be a good thing" if the Texas cases proceed to trial, said Judge Elaine E. Bucklo of the United States District Court in Chicago, who is now overseeing the Chicago case.
Judge Bucklo said that in view of Block's position that it owed nothing because it did nothing wrong, she had trouble understanding its willingness to settle in her court, until she focused on one issue: the Texas litigation.
"The only thing I can figure that's driving this settlement is the Texas case," Judge Bucklo said.
Addressing N. Louise Ellingsworth, the Block lawyer who for years held off all the class-action cases brought against her client, the judge said, "You must have thought that you had a pretty good chance of prevailing ultimately on the legal issue in the case" in Chicago.
"If so," she continued, "I suppose the question is, why are you willing to put out, whether it's $15 million or $30 million? Maybe it's not an awful lot" of money (half is paid by Beneficial), "but most shareholders would like to think somebody just didn't write a check for no reason."
Ms. Ellingsworth suggested that the costs of litigation alone were behind the Chicago settlement.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
ABB Proposes a Settlement For All Asbestos Lawsuits

BYLINE:  By ALISON LANGLEY 

DATELINE: ZURICH, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Seeking to put behind it the swelling asbestos-liability problems that have pummeled its stock price, the Swiss heavy-machinery maker ABB said today that it was negotiating with claimants over a settlement that would pay them up to $1.1 billion.
 Most of the money would come from an American subsidiary, Combustion Engineering, which would file a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization plan that has been approved by most creditors in advance. 
 ABB sold the operations of Combustion Engineering in 2000 but retained liability for the asbestos that the unit used in boiler-building long before ABB bought it in 1990.
All of Combustion Engineering's remaining assets, which are estimated to be about $812 million, would be used to pay the 111,000 claims pending and any future claims; so would a contribution of up to about $300 million from the parent company. 
Lawyers for ABB said that a provision of United States bankruptcy law known as Section 524-G would immunize ABB from any further liability in the cases.
If the plan succeeds, it would be a first step back toward financial health for a company that has many more problems than just asbestos. The core businesses of ABB -- building and equipping operations like factories, refineries and power plants -- have suffered in the global economic slowdown. 
ABB has heavy debts, and has been embarrassed by revelations about hugely generous retirement payments to former top executives. Once hailed as Europe's answer to General Electric, ABB has had to sell assets this year to raise cash, and its stock price has fallen by 96 percent since January 2001.
Peter Voser, ABB's chief financial officer, said today that because the prepackaged Chapter 11 filing would need approval from at least 75 percent of the asbestos plaintiffs, it "can therefore provide a relatively swift reorganization, potentially reducing costs and consequently generating more money for the settlements."
The total payout of about $1.1 billion is toward the low end of analysts' expectations about what it would cost to rid ABB of its asbestos problems.
Before the settlement proposal was announced this evening in Switzerland, the credit-rating agency Moody's Investors Service downgraded ABB's $8.4 billion in bond debt to Ba2, two notches below investment grade.
Moody's said putting Combustion Engineering into Chapter 11 carried "significant uncertainties and execution risk."
"There is still considerable uncertainty as to the ability of ABB to obtain a settlement and at what cost," the agency said in a statement. 
"In a scenario where a settlement would not be reached, ABB is likely to face attempts to pierce its corporate veil with execution into the group's U.S. and perhaps international assets," the agency said. 
But David M. Bernick of Kirkland & Ellis, the Chicago law firm representing ABB in the asbestos litigation, said in a telephone interview that the parent company would be safe from such claims.
"The only company with asbestos liabilities is C.E.," not the parent, Mr. Bernick said. "This arrangement gives all assets of Combustion Engineering plus some more. The additional $300 million would provide the company with total closure." 
From 1990 to the end of 2001, Combustion Engineering settled a total of 204,326 asbestos cases, paying a total of $865 million. Some of the cases were settled with no payment.
More claims keep coming in: the total outstanding rose by 5 percent in the third quarter of 2002. Last month, ABB said that the cost of settling them all on the kinds of terms it had been following so far would probably exceed Combustion Engineering's remaining assets. 
Mr. Bernick said that he was in talks with lawyers representing more than 75 percent of the asbestos claimants -- mainly people who installed, repaired or worked around Combustion Engineering boilers but were not employees of the company, who would be covered by workers' compensation.
He said he expected to secure an agreement with them by the end of the year. 
Mr. Voser estimated that it would take four to six months to complete the prepackaged Chapter 11 filing.
ABB reported last week that it had lost $183 million in the third quarter, and that new orders had fallen 13 percent from the comparable period a year earlier.
Its new chief executive, Jurgen Dormann, is trying to turn its fortunes around with a restructuring plan that would eliminate thousands of jobs, reduce costs by $800 million and reshuffle the company into two main businesses -- power systems and industrial automation. 
The oil, gas and petrochemical services businesses of ABB would be sold.

Judge Backs Settlement In Microsoft Antitrust Case
A federal judge approved Microsoft's antitrust settlement with the Justice Department and rejected virtually all of the stiffer sanctions sought by a coalition of state attorneys general. The ruling brought at least a temporary close to the landmark case filed nearly five years ago.
 Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court in Washington did impose some new obligations on Microsoft that were not included in the settlement last November, requiring the company to disclose more information to competitors about its Windows operating system and to set up a compliance committee of corporate board members.

HEADLINE: 'The Godfather, Part IV' 

 BODY:
Monday is the deadline for proposals for a new installment of "The Godfather," the Corleone family saga, written by the late Mario Puzo and immortalized in three films directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Random House, which plans to publish the new book, sent a message to agents last month seeking an author "who writes in a commanding and darkly comic omniscient voice." The Op-Ed page asked several writers to try their hand at starting the new novel.

The Don and the Despot
 The black Lincoln Town Car slowed as it approached the rain-soaked curb. The headlights illuminated the face of the man standing there. 
 Don Michael Corleone, sitting in the car's back seat, looked out through the window and saw the recognizable features beneath the homburg hat: the thick mustache and eyebrows, the cruel eyes. The man was holding his trademark rifle, firing it aimlessly into the air as the car pulled up. Just as well, Michael thought, that it was late and there were no pedestrians.
Michael opened the door. Saddam Hussein got in.
They drove north in silence, up the West Side Highway toward the George Washington Bridge.
The low-yield thermonuclear device that the C.I.A. "technical services" department had given Michael to put in Saddam's penne arrabbiata felt hot and uncomfortable inside his Jockey shorts. He prayed that it would not leak radiation and render him impotent. He wanted more sons, though Kay was as usual being difficult.
Michael leaned forward and spoke to the man in the front passenger seat. "I'm going to talk Arabic with Saddam," he said. Kofi Annan, the elegant secretary general of the United Nations, nodded and went back to reading his copy of Foreign Affairs.
A second later, Michael's driver violently turned the wheel. The car jumped the median, narrowly missing an oncoming van carrying antiwar demonstrators.
"I thought we were going to New Jersey," Saddam said, firing his rifle through the sun roof. "Don Soprano guaranteed my safety."
Michael Corleone bit off the end of his Montecristo No. 3 cigar and spat it through the shattered sun roof.
"Soprano is finished," he said. "He couldn't guarantee a garbage pickup in Parsippany." Christopher Buckley, author of "No Way to Treat a First Lady."

Partners in Crime
On the day of Angelina Corleone's commitment ceremony to her longtime life partner, film producer Heather Lippi, her father, Don Vincent Corleone, accepted an embrace and a thick envelope of cash from his consigliere, Tom Hagen III. Hagen pulled a list of names from his jacket pocket and handed it to Corleone. The people on the list had requested private meetings with the Don, taking advantage of the old custom that no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter's civil union day. The two men watched the widow Neri blush as the usher asked her, "Bride's side or bride's side?"
Corleone shrugged at Hagen, then winked, whispering, "Hey, it could be worse. At least my daughter's marrying an Italian." Sarah Vowell, author of "Take the Cannoli."

A Humble Pensioner
Michael Corleone stretched his legs and gazed out his bedroom window at the Florida surf. After faking his own death so many years before, he could finally live in peace, except for his guilt about the murders of his two brothers, his daughter and the only woman he'd ever truly loved.
He took a sip of brandy.
The phone rang.
It was Michael's son, Anthony Corleone, the president of the United States.
"Dad, I need you," Anthony said. "We've received word that at midnight Eastern Time, terrorists are going to blow up Nobu, Knott's Berry Farm, the offices of The New Republic and all the dolphins in Vegas."
"So what's it to me?" Michael said. "I'm a humble retired pensioner."
"Please. You're the only man I know who can stage four assassinations in four different cities simultaneously."
"Not anymore."
"You don't understand," said Anthony. "They're holding your grandchildren hostage."
Michael brooded briefly. Then his eyes blazed with tragic rage. An aria began to play. From his sock drawer, he took a stiletto, a pistol and a fingerprint-obscuring handkerchief. This time, he would do the job himself.
For his family. Neal Pollack, author of "The Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature."

The Family Man
Pipo Corleone gazed into his glass of Barolo, lost in its ruby deeps. As the last remaining grand-nephew of Connie Corleone, he could feel the awful burden of family pressing on his chest, like a monstrous cappuccino machine. His brooding, Tom-Cruise-like face winced at the flashback-like images: Moe Green getting shot in the glasses, then all that blood glooping out; Don Altobello, brought down by poisoned cannolis, when so many assassins had failed; that poor horse, who had his head cut off, and then barely survived the operation to reattach it.
And now in this, the newest of millenniums, Pipo's own had tasted tragedy. His wife's dream, the dancing school, lay in ashes. Not literally ashes: A water pipe had burst and buckled the floorboards. And on a Sunday -- God's day. (Unless you're Jewish, which Pipo was not.)
But the saga was just beginning for this hot-blooded renegade, the most electrifying Corleone ever. For Pipo would soon embark on the most challenging case of his detective career! George Meyer, writer for "The Simpsons."

In Really Cold Blood
Mobopolis, the most popular new attraction at Epcot Center, features a false-fronted Mulberry Street, including a glass-enclosed reconstruction of the old Gambino Family hangout, the Ravenite Social Club. Here, actual Cosa Nostra dons and underbosses, driven to seek alternate employment by a faltering economy, are paid to engage in the interminable kibitzing, coffee-drinking and card-playing that characterize a typical mobster's day.
In a bank of specially outfitted vans parked outside the diorama, kids don headphones and listen to the conversations picked up from eavesdropping devices hidden within the mob redoubt. Among the listeners is a 10-year-old Inuit boy on a class trip from Rankin Inlet on the shores of Hudson Bay. Like a baseball fan visiting Cooperstown for the first time, the boy's eyes widen as he takes in the thick baritone colloquy, rendered almost incomprehensible by fractured syntax, antecedent-less pronouns and a stream of expletives.
From this moment will be born an arctic crime lord, whose dominion will span from Nunavut to Greenland. Someday, this raven-haired child in a Mickey Mouse cap will achieve a stranglehold on seal-fur products, meat processing and the lucrative soapstone sculpture business. Someday, his life will be chronicled by Zacharias Kunuk, director of "The Fast Runner," whose epic "The Godfather IV: Black Snow" will post the biggest opening-weekend box office in history. Mark Leyner, author of "The Tetherballs of Bougainville."

Classical Corleone
"Listen," the old Don said, "when your father went away to avenge your uncle after your aunt Helen was stolen by the nutso Trojans, this other guy fell in love with your mom, and when your dad came back, this guy was waiting and he killed your dad and your mom cut your dad's head off with an axe, and then she and the guy got married, O.K.?" He looked away toward his grape vines and the pool and the two men standing by the gate. "I want you to go whack that guy, Orestes."
"I was talking to an oracle today. She said it won't be easy."
"Sacrifices will have to be made," the Don said in a commanding and omniscient voice, popping a grape into his mouth, thinking darkly comic thoughts. Garrison Keillor, host of "Prairie Home Companion."

HEADLINE: Hemisphere Free Trade Pact Inches Forward 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Trade ministers from the United States and almost every other country in the Western Hemisphere agreed today on a blueprint for negotiating a free-trade zone that would reach from Canada to the southern tip of Argentina.
 If the plan is successful, it will set the stage for a vast expansion of the free trade agreement that now covers Canada, the United States and Mexico. 
 The goal is to negotiate an agreement by January 2005 and for every country to make its opening proposals by next February. Beyond eliminating tariffs and other import restrictions, the treaty would also lay ground rules for doing business in the hemisphere. 
Up for negotiation are health and sanitary regulations on food imports; enforcement of labor and environmental laws; legal rights for foreign investors; and the rules for allowing greater competition in services like telecommunications and health care.
But the chances of actually agreeing on a "Free Trade Area of the Americas" are, at best, even. With Latin American countries reeling from the global economic downturn, a financial meltdown in Argentina and distress in Brazil, disillusionment with free trade is running high in many quarters. 
Indeed, there were signs here that Latin America might be breaking up into ideological blocs. 
Chile and Central American countries like El Salvador and Costa Rica are staunch believers in more open trade. But Venezuela's left-wing government under Hugo Chavez is openly hostile to the idea and today refused to commit itself by 2005.
Brazil, which accounts for 40 percent of South America's economy, is the biggest question mark. The president-elect, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has in the past denounced the idea of a free trade pact as "tantamount to the annexation of Brazil by the United States."
Argentina, a major agricultural exporter, remains bogged down in its own financial and political crisis. The country is struggling to recover after defaulting on $140 billion in bonds, and it faces elections next spring. 
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, acknowledged the difficulties today. "I recognize that this is a time of economic and political uncertainty in this region," he said. 
The blueprint today failed to resolve some conspicuously sensitive issues that could paralyze the effort.
One of the biggest is the billions of dollars in domestic subsidies that the United States pays to farmers of cotton, soybeans and other cash crops. Brazil and Argentina, which argue the subsidies have depressed prices and made it difficult to sell in the American market, wanted the United States to agree to negotiate reductions as part of any hemispheric pact.
But the United States insisted on dealing with farm subsidies in separate global trade talks at the World Trade Organization. 
The marching orders agreed to today merely call for "discipline" on subsidies and note that a country can reject the proposed free trade deal if it believes that other countries have not done enough.
Another sore spot was the issue of antidumping penalties, which American steel producers have used to block foreign imports on the grounds that foreign rivals were selling at below-market prices.
"This issue is really not being addressed," said Alicia Frohmann, a Chilean negotiator. "Chile believes that in a free trade area, antidumping penalties make no sense."
The Bush administration, which won a battle in Congress last summer to obtain greater authority to negotiate trade deals, is now pushing bilateral agreements with Chile, Singapore and Central America.
But Mr. Zoellick faces formidable opposition in Congress to concessions on issues like anti-dumping laws and farm barriers.
Despite a cloud of uncertainty over the talks here, some Latin American diplomats insisted that an ambitious deal is still possible. Alberto Trejos, Costa Rica's foreign trade minister, noted that countries across the hemisphere were already hammering out free trade deals.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE ACCUSATIONS; 
Tight and Heated Race Rages in Massachusetts

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
This week, the talk of the razor-close Massachusetts governor's race has been a single word.
 It is the word "unbecoming," which Mitt Romney, the venture capitalist and Republican nominee, used in a debate on Tuesday to describe what he saw as the aggressive demeanor of his Democratic opponent, State Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien. 
 Ms. O'Brien and the large number of women who support her quickly called Mr. Romney's choice of language sexist and demeaning. "I certainly think that he wouldn't use the term 'unbecoming' if he were talking to a man," Ms. O'Brien told reporters. 
Mr. Romney has responded with a tortuous defense. First he said in a telephone interview that "unbecoming" could be used for either sex. Then he called back with more explanations. "The most familiar usage of that term is 'conduct unbecoming an officer,' which is a military term and in that context it is overwhelmingly male," Mr. Romney said. He said that at Harvard, where he went to law and business school (Ms. O'Brien graduated from Yale), " 'conduct unbecoming' is a term that's used for disciplinary cases."
Finally, Mr. Romney said, "I realize it's not a word that's frequently used, but I was an English major and occasionally I will use words that are not that common."
A lot of energy to expend on an adjective, it seems. But this is a tooth-and-nail fight, a sharp-elbowed campaign in which each candidate accuses the other of distortion and fakery.
A Romney commercial shows a dull-eyed basset hound representing Ms. O'Brien sitting idly while men in suits loot cash from the treasury and pile it into a van labeled "Enron." (Ms. O'Brien's husband, R. Emmet Hayes, lobbied for Enron while Ms. O'Brien was treasurer, although, the advertisement fails to note, not when state pension funds were invested in the energy company).
An O'Brien commercial shows a steelworker who lost his job at a Kansas City plant after Bain Capital, an investment firm where Mr. Romney was an executive, bought the company and closed the plant (although Mr. Romney says that when the plant was closed, he had essentially left his job at Bain).
Polls have been yo-yoing since the campaign began.
"If you look at the polls, it's like a scissors, it goes up, down, up, down," said David A. Paleologos, adjunct professor of politics at Suffolk University here. "And it could change two more times before the election."
The most recent poll, published today in The Boston Globe, found 41 percent for Ms. O'Brien and 40 percent for Mr. Romney.
Mr. Romney, 55, a son of George Romney, former Michigan governor as well as a former presidential candidate, failed in a bruising campaign to unseat Senator Edward M. Kennedy in 1994. Most recently, he headed the Salt Lake City Olympics and was credited with burnishing the Olympics' hobbled image.
Mr. Romney bounded into the election in March after Jane M. Swift, the Republican acting governor, was elbowed out by Republicans concerned about her baggage from political missteps and the state's flagging economy.
Democrats tried unsuccessfully to get Mr. Romney off the ballot, contending that his tax records showed he was legally a resident of Utah.
Mr. Romney, named one of People magazine's "50 Beautiful People," has run on a common-man approach, staging "work days" in which he hauled garbage, drove a tractor, cleaned fish and slung sausages outside Fenway Park.
An advertisement hailing the work days fell flat, and so did a syrupy commercial in which Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, describe their first date and Mr. Romney, shirtless and in swim trunks, tosses his five sons into a lake.
Mr. Romney has promoted his business experience and tried to paint Ms. O'Brien as the consummate insider who allowed the state pension fund to lose money, lobbied for a pay increase for state employees, including herself, and would provide no counterweight to the overwhelmingly Democratic Legislature.
Ms. O'Brien, 43, from generations of politically influential O'Briens, talks about how she became treasurer after a corruption scandal in that office, helping clean things up and expose cost overruns in the Big Dig, Boston's mammoth highway construction project. "People recognize that I don't need on-the-job training," Ms. O'Brien said.
Ms. O'Brien bested three men in the primary, lightly touching the gender issue with a Western-themed commercial asserting that her opponents were attacking her and saying, "Whoa, boys."
Now she seeks to be the first woman elected governor here and the first Democrat in 12 years, ending a Republican reign that has been an anomaly in Massachusetts, where all other top elected officials are Democrats.
Ms. O'Brien comes across as a tireless campaigner, tough, calm, always on message.
"She's been a status candidate," said Lou DiNatale, a political analyst at the University of Massachusetts in Boston. "You vote for her because she's the Romney killer, because she's from western Massachusetts, because she's a woman, because she's Irish. But her failure to further define herself put the race back in play, and that's where we are today."
The biggest election issue is the state's budget shortfall of $1 billion to $2 billion. Mr. Romney says he will not raise taxes in the first year and proposes savings by cutting patronage positions and consolidating government agencies.
Ms. O'Brien says Mr. Romney's numbers are phony and will result in cutting needed programs. She says only she has a real cost-cutting plan, one she hopes to achieve without raising taxes.
The candidates also differ on issues like bilingual education, which Ms. O'Brien supports, and capital punishment, which Mr. Romney supports.
In a state with 13 percent registered Republicans and 36 percent registered Democrats, independent voters are key. Opinions are in flux, and analysts are stumped over the outcome of the race.

HEADLINE: Sharon Offers Foreign Ministry to Political Rival Netanyahu 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon today offered his political rival, Benjamin Netanyahu, the post of foreign minister, seeking to shore up his coalition with the articulate, rightist former prime minister after the defection of the Labor Party this week.
 The two men agreed to meet again on Sunday. Despite some reservations, Mr. Netanyahu -- the foremost challenger to Mr. Sharon for leadership of their Likud Party -- appeared to be leaning toward accepting the offer, Israeli officials said. 
 Their meeting, at Mr. Sharon's ranch in the Negev, lasted for more than a hour, at the start of the Jewish Sabbath, which finally brought a pause to the week's political tumult.
Mr. Sharon has recruited as his defense minister another formidable hawk, Shaul Mofaz, a former armed forces chief of staff.
Under Israel's parliamentary system, the resignations of Labor's ministers, submitted on Wednesday over a budget dispute, took effect this evening, making final the divorce of the unity government. That coalition endured for 19 months, usually presenting a solid front in the conflict with the Palestinians.
During that period Mr. Sharon proved adept at balancing the demands of left and right within his government. Now, with a minority of 55 seats in the 120-seat Parliament, he must perform a balancing act of a different sort, between international pressures and domestic political realities.
In an effort to reassure the Bush administration, Mr. Sharon's allies said his new government would not deviate from his old government's principles.
"That Israel is going to have a government driven by right-wing extremists, that's nonsense," said a senior official in Mr. Sharon's office. "The prime minister is intent on continuing the same course he has pursued the last two years."
The official said Mr. Sharon would keep all of his commitments to President Bush, including a pledge not to harm Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
The White House recently presented Israel and the Palestinians with a proposed "road map" for achieving peace and a Palestinian state in three years. Although he has criticized that plan, Mr. Sharon has said he accepts the idea of an eventual Palestinian state.
To safeguard his coalition, though, Mr. Sharon must woo the hard right. On Sunday he is to begin bargaining with leaders of a faction, National Union-Yisrael Beiteinu, that opposes the Oslo accords and rejects any Palestinian state in the West Bank. The faction controls seven seats in Parliament, which would give Mr. Sharon a slender majority of 62 votes.
Without a majority, he will be vulnerable to a vote of no confidence by Parliament, which would force him to call elections in 90 days.
But Yuri Shtern, the chairman of National Union-Yisrael Beiteinu, said in an interview here that as the price of joining the government, he intended to demand that it strike from its official guidelines any acceptance of Oslo and declare clear opposition to Palestinian statehood. The Oslo agreements of 1993 and 1995 established a framework for Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Dr. Shtern, an economist, said that President Bush's road map would reward Palestinian terrorism and that Mr. Sharon lacked a strategy for confronting the violence. "We are obliged to win this war by crushing the motivation of Palestinians to attack us," he said. "We have to be committed to victory."
It is perhaps an index of Mr. Sharon's political skill that he remains politically popular despite conflicting suspicions on the right and the left over what he stands for.
Mr. Sharon's opposition to the Oslo accords has raised suspicions on the left that he harbors a secret plan to destroy them, and with them the possibility of a Palestinian state.
He is suspected by the right of having gone soft since his days as a general and defense minister. According to that theory, he embraced Labor to gain the political leverage to resist his own rightist base.
Mr. Netanyahu compromised with the Palestinians as prime minister in the late 1990's and, unlike Mr. Sharon, even shook Mr. Arafat's hand. But having repeatedly criticized Mr. Sharon as not doing enough to destroy Mr. Arafat's governing Palestinian Authority, he has become the favorite of the hard right within Likud.
If Mr. Sharon's coalition falls and elections are called, Mr. Netanyahu may be able to beat him in a primary. But turning down the post of foreign minister would carry some political risk, since he may be seen as serving his own ambition rather than the country in a time of crisis.
Likud politicians speculated that the two men had discussed some arrangement under which Mr. Sharon would eventually step aside in Mr. Netanyahu's favor.
On his last day as Mr. Sharon's defense minister, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, the Labor chairman, today kept up his criticism of the government, declaring that it was time for Israel to press diplomacy with the Palestinians.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT; 
Excerpts From Judge's Ruling in Microsoft Antitrust Settlement

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the summary of the ruling yesterday by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court in Washington on the settlement by the Justice Department and Microsoft:

New Technologies
 Plaintiffs have identified certain technologies which, prior to this remedy proceeding, had not been addressed by the district and appellate courts in detail in conjunction with this case. Plaintiffs identify these technologies as the new frontier in middlewareplatform threats and, therefore, seek to include these technologies in the definition of middleware and related definitions. The court examined four categories of technologies in order to determine if plaintiffs' proposal to encompass these technologies within the remedy is appropriate: (1) network and server-based applications; (2) interactive television middleware and set-top boxes; (3) hand-held devices; and (4) Web services. 
 The court concludes that server/network computing has the capacity to function in a role akin to middleware, and therefore, over Microsoft's objection, the court addresses this technology in a portion of the remedy.
The potential threat posed by interactive television software is almost entirely hypothetical. However, the court notes that, if interactive television software is proven, in the future, to have been ported from TV set-top boxes to run on a Microsoft PC operating system and expose a range of functionality to I.S.V.'s independent software vendors through published A.P.I.'s application program interfaces , such technology would be included automatically in a number of the court's remedy provisions.
Plaintiffs advance four theories pursuant to which hand-held devices pose a platform threat to the Windows operating system. The court rejects each of these theories as either logically flawed or unsupported by the evidence. In short, the technology associated with hand-held devices has not been shown to have the potential to function in a manner similar to middleware consistent with the liability phase.
Plaintiffs argue that Web services, which are entirely distinct from Web browsing, carry the potential to decrease reliance upon personal computers while increasing reliance upon other computing devices, emphasizing that a number of non-PC devices will have the capacity to access Web services. The court rejects this argument on the grounds that plaintiffs have not explained how the increase in the use of non-PC devices in conjunction with Web services will reduce Microsoft's monopoly in the market for PC operating systems.
The court's rejection of plaintiffs' inclusion in the remedy of hand-held devices and Web services is based, in part, upon the conclusion that mere reduction in the popularity of the PC and the ensuing reduction in the absolute demand for Microsoft's Windows operating system does not necessarily pry open to competition the market for PC operating systems.
. . .

Alleged Bad Acts by Microsoft
Throughout this phase of the proceeding, plaintiffs have recited for the court's benefit countless findings of fact entered by Judge Jackson during the liability phase regarding actions taken by Microsoft. These findings recount various actions taken by Microsoft which can be characterized as improper or unsavory in one respect or another and, at the very least, harmful to its competitors.
Significantly however, many of these findings were ultimately not relied upon by the district and appellate court in conjunction with the imposition of liability for violation of S$ 2 of the Sherman Act
As the appellate court observed, even an act of pure malice by one business competitor against another does not, without more, state a claim under the federal antitrust laws. . . . The federal antitrust laws do not create a federal law of unfair competition or "purport to afford remedies for all torts committed by or against persons engaged in interstate commerce." Harm to one or more competitors, however severe, is not condemned by the Sherman Act in the absence of harm to the competitive process and thereby harm to consumers.
Because no court has yet found that the acts identified in Judge Jackson's Findings of Fact, but not relied upon for the imposition of liability, visited any harm upon competition, let alone a harm which was not outweighed by the simultaneous procompetitive effect, this court cannot presume that each of the acts identified in the Findings of Fact merits consideration equal with those acts which were found to be anticompetitive, nor that these acts merit any special weight.
The parties have agreed throughout this proceeding that it would be inappropriate now, during the remedy phase of this proceeding, for the court to consider and evaluate for anticompetitive effect new allegations against Microsoft.
Nevertheless, plaintiffs identify a number of new and, for lack of a better term, allegedly bad acts, relating predominantly to interoperability, taken by Microsoft both prior and subsequent to the imposition of liability. Upon review of plaintiffs' allegations of bad conduct by Microsoft relating to interoperability and the liability findings in this case, the court concludes that plaintiffs' allegations in this area bear only a remote relationship to the liability findings. In this regard, the court has rejected plaintiffs' suggestion that the imposition of liability, in any way, condemns decisions to depart from industry standards or to utilize a proprietary standard in the absence of deception regarding the departure.
In fact, Microsoft's alteration or proprietary extension of industry standards more closely resembles conduct for which Microsoft was absolved of liability; the appellate court absolved Microsoft of liability for its development of a Java implementation incompatible with Sun's Java Implementation.
Moreover, despite plaintiffs' protestations to the contrary, the court finds that plaintiffs' allegations with regard to Microsoft's conduct in the area of interoperability are, at their core, new allegations of anticompetitive conduct. As a result, plaintiffs' reliance upon this series of allegedly new bad acts by Microsoft carries little weight, if any, in the court's determination of the appropriate remedy in this case. 
. . .

Compliance and Enforcement Provisions
The scheme envisioned by plaintiffs for enforcing the injunctive decree entered as the remedy in this case is marked by its reliance upon a special master. In light of the applicable law, the court harbors serious concerns as to the propriety of plaintiffs' proposed use of a special master. Even if the court were confident that plaintiffs' proposed use of a special master was legally sound, such a conclusion would not allay the court's remaining concerns with regard to the logistical difficulties in plaintiffs' special master proposal. Accordingly, the court declines to appoint a special master at this time.
The remedy in this case will charge plaintiffs with the obligation of monitoring Microsoft's compliance. While plaintiffs may rely upon the views of third parties to guide them in this task, the duty of enforcement belongs to plaintiffs. To ease the burden on the court and on Microsoft in addressing plaintiffs' concerns, the court will require plaintiffs to form a committee to coordinate enforcement of the remedial decree. Such a committee will serve to minimize duplication of enforcement activities and requests of the court and Microsoft.
Plaintiffs have been unwaveringly critical of Microsoft's proposal for a technical committee. As the technical committee provision exists largely to assist plaintiffs in enforcing the provisions of the final judgment in this case, if plaintiffs do not want to rely upon a technical committee, the court will not require them to do so.
The court adopts plaintiffs' proposal for selecting a compliance officer who serves as a high-level Microsoft employee, but retains a significant amount of autonomy and independence from the corporation.
The court adopts Microsoft's proposal that the compliance officer distribute the decree and obtain a certification of understanding and compliance only from Microsoft's officers and directors.
The remedy adopted by the court will provide plaintiffs, acting only after consultation with their enforcement committee, reasonable access to Microsoft's source code, books, ledgers, accounts, correspondence, memoranda, and other correspondence, access to Microsoft employees for interview, and the right to request and receive written reports from Microsoft on any matter contained in the court's remedial decree. 
. . .
The court's remedial decree shall persist for five years from its effective date.
As an incentive for Microsoft to comply with the terms of the decree, however, the court specifically reserves the right to extend the term of the decree for up to two years upon a finding that Microsoft has engaged in a pattern of willful and systemic violation of the court's decree.
Following are excerpts from the ruling yesterday by Judge Kollar-Kotelly in New York, et al., v. the Microsoft Corporation requesting additional remedies on Microsoft:
Recognizing, as they must, the confluence of the rapid pace of change in the software industry and the delays inherent in antitrust litigation, plaintiffs sought to gather all existing complaints regarding Microsoft's business practices and bring them before the court at this late stage in the case. In doing so, plaintiffs attempted to circumvent the arduous process which necessarily precedes the imposition of antitrust liability and, instead, proceeded directly to seek a remedy for the readily identifiable aspects of Microsoft's business conduct that other industry participants find objectionable. Though an appropriate remedy may be forward-looking and address conduct beyond the specific acts found to be anticompetitive, plaintiffs are mistaken in thinking that the imposition of . . . liability under the Sherman Act for unlawful monopoly maintenance in the market for Intel-compatible PC operating systems permits the court to impose a remedy in areas unrelated to the monopoly market. This suit, however remarkable, is not the vehicle through which plaintiffs can resolve all existing allegations of anticompetitive conduct which have not been proven or for which liability has not been ascribed.
The appellate court could not have been clearer in its admonition that this court's decree should be "tailored to fit the wrong creating the occasion for the remedy." Yet despite this admonition, in their request for relief, plaintiffs have shown little respect for the parameters of liability that were so precisely delineated by the appellate court. In many instances, therefore, this court has had little choice but to reject plaintiffs' remedial suggestions on the grounds that they are unjustifiably in conflict with the imposition as well as the rejection of liability in this case.
Additionally, the court observes that a number of the remedial provisions proposed by plaintiffs would require drastic alterations to Microsoft's products, as well as to aspects of its business model which do not involve illegal conduct. Plaintiffs present little, if any, legitimate justification for these remedies, and in most instances, these proposals are not supported by any economic analysis. Instead, it appears that these types of remedial provisions seek to convert certain legitimate aspects of Microsoft's business model and/or product design into a model which resembles that of other industry participants simply for the sake of changing the status quo. Certain of Microsoft's competitors appear to be those who most desire these provisions and, concomitantly, are the likely beneficiaries of these provisions, while other competitors in the relevant market would not necessarily benefit. In bringing these types of proposals before the court, plaintiffs again misunderstand the task presently before the court to remedy Microsoft's antitrust violations. General changes to the lawful aspects of Microsoft's business model or product design of the type proposed by plaintiffs do not themselves provide a remedy, nor have plaintiffs established that such changes are required, or even appropriate, in conjunction with a remedy. Accordingly, the court has rejected those aspects of plaintiffs' remedy proposal which would impose such changes.
Instead, the appropriate remedy . . . is carefully tailored to fit the wrong creating the occasion for the remedy. The court's remedy exceeds a mere proscription of the precise conduct found to be anticompetitive and is forward-looking in the parameters of the relief provided. Moreover, the remedy imposed by the court is crafted to foster competition in the monopolized market in a manner consistent with the theory of liability in this case.
In particular, the court's remedy addresses, to the extent appropriate, plaintiffs' desire that Microsoft disclose technical information to foster interoperation between Microsoft's PC operating system software and third-party products, as well as between Microsoft's PC operating system products and server operating systems. The mandatory disclosures between Microsoft's monopoly product and server operating systems acknowledge the competitive significance of server/network computing as the most significant "platform threat" to Microsoft's dominance in the relevant market. . . . 
Likewise, the court's remedy satisfies plaintiffs' demand for remedial provisions which address O.E.M. original equipment manufacturer flexibility in the configuration of Microsoft's operating system products, but is tempered by the necessary respect for Microsoft's intellectual property rights. In this regard, the court has largely rejected Microsoft's paternalistic view that it can determine what is best for consumers with regard to the configuration of the Windows operating system. In rejecting this view, the court's remedy affords O.E.M.'s the freedom to configure Microsoft's operating system products in a manner which promotes third-party middleware through the prominent display of icons, shortcuts, and menu entries, and such configuration will be protected against automatic alteration resulting from Microsoft's product design. In addition, O.E.M.'s will have the freedom to remove all prominent means of end-user access to portions of middleware functionality integrated into Microsoft's operating system so as to encourage the installation of third-party middleware. The court's remedial decree also ensures that O.E.M.'s may introduce subscription services during the boot sequence without restriction by unjustified Microsoft technical requirements. Further secured by the terms of the court's decree is the automatic launching of innovative software programs limited only by the requirement that the programs not drastically alter the Windows user interface.
In its order of remedy, the court has heeded plaintiffs' call for broad protection for O.E.M.'s, I.S.V.'s, and I.H.V.'s independent hardware vendors against retaliation and threats of retaliation by Microsoft for the support of products that compete with Microsoft's monopoly product. The court's remedy further curtails Microsoft's ability to enter into agreements that have the effect of excluding competitors from the marketplace. The court's prohibition on exclusionary contracts is carefully drawn, however, so as to foster, rather than prohibit, procompetitive joint ventures, work-for-hire agreements, and intellectual property licenses. . . . 
The defined terms in the court's order are appropriately grounded in the theory of liability and the treatment of middleware platform threats during the liability phase, while simultaneously prescient in that they are not confined to technology which exists today. Most notable is the scope of the term "Non-Microsoft Middleware," which captures a wide array of existing platform technology, as well as technology not yet developed. In this regard, even the technologies which plaintiffs have identified as future potential platform threats . . . will be addressed by the court's remedial order, provided the aspirations of these technologies become reality.
Plaintiffs are correct that Microsoft has a tendency to minimize the effects of its illegal conduct. Yet this minimization, however frustrating, does not require a remedy which prodigiously exceeds even an expansive view of the illegal conduct. The remedy in this case addresses the conduct found by the district and appellate courts to violate the antitrust laws and is imposed without regard to Microsoft's minimalist view of its own illegal conduct. More importantly, the behavioral remedy imposed by this court neither bends nor softens simply because Microsoft refuses to acknowledge the extent of its own wrongdoing.
During this litigation, promises have been made on behalf of Microsoft that the company will change its predatory practices which have been part of its competitive strategy in order to comply with the remedial decree. The court will hold Microsoft's directors, particularly those who testified before this court, responsible for implementing each provision of this remedial decree. Let it not be said of Microsoft that "a prince never lacks legitimate reasons to break his promise," for this court will exercise its full panoply of powers to ensure that the letter and spirit of this remedial decree are carried out.

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT: THE OVERVIEW; 
JUDGE BACKS TERMS OF U.S. SETTLEMENT IN MICROSOFT CASE

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
In a hard-fought victory for Microsoft, a federal judge yesterday approved the company's antitrust settlement with the Justice Department and rejected virtually all of the stiffer sanctions sought by a coalition of state attorneys general. The ruling brought at least a temporary close to the landmark case filed nearly five years ago.
 "While putting new responsibilities on Microsoft, this settlement also gives us the freedom to keep innovating for our customers," Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, said at a news conference at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. "We're pleased to put another step of this case behind us." 
 Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court in Washington did impose some new obligations on Microsoft that were not included in the settlement last November, requiring the software maker to disclose more information to competitors about its Windows operating system and to install a compliance committee made up of Microsoft board members. 
But taking a narrow view of the case, the judge imposed few new restrictions that would slow Microsoft's aggressive push into new markets. News analysis, Page C1. 
She largely dismissed the contention by nine states that broader restrictions on Microsoft were necessary to restore competition in the computer software industry. Instead, Judge Kollar-Kotelly criticized the states for suggesting that Microsoft should be punished for actions beyond those a federal appeals court found it liable for last year.
"This suit, however remarkable, is not the vehicle through which plaintiffs can resolve all existing allegations of anticompetitive conduct which have not been proved or for which liability has not been ascribed," Judge Kollar-Kotelly wrote. Excerpts, Page C4. 
The Justice Department, which along with nine other states settled the case last November, hailed the decision as a victory for consumers. Attorney General John Ashcroft said the ruling "will allow the approved settlement to provide certainty and stability in a vital sector of America's economy."
But for many of the economists, legal scholars and rival software developers who have been involved in the long-running case, the judge's decision falls far short of preventing Microsoft from abusing its market power in the future.
"We urged the court to look ahead, to expand the doctrine into new business areas," said Bill Lockyer, the California state attorney general who helped lead and finance the states' challenge after the federal settlement. "The court said, 'I can't do that, if you want that you need to file a new lawsuit.' That obviously remains an option."
The long-anticipated ruling on how the court would restrict Microsoft's behavior comes more than a year after a federal appeals court found that Microsoft had repeatedly violated antitrust laws. The case has been widely viewed as the most important antitrust action since the government's attack on Standard Oil at the turn of the last century.
When it was announced last November, the Bush administration's consent decree in a case that it inherited from its predecessor was widely viewed by competitors and antitrust scholars as an ineffective slap on the wrist. The settlement gives computer makers greater freedom to feature rival software on their machines and prohibits Microsoft from retaliating against those who choose non-Microsoft products.
In a nod to the dissenting states, Judge Kollar-Kotelly ordered Microsoft to refrain from "threatening" retaliation as well. And in what could be a significant step, she allowed that the restrictions on Microsoft should apply to the server operating systems that are central to most business networks, in addition to personal computer operating systems.
Still, she granted almost none of the core proposals the states raised during an eight-week trial last spring. 
"I'm sort of stunned by it," said Andrew Gavil, an antitrust law professor at Howard University who has been critical of the Justice Department settlement. "I can't imagine a more sweeping victory for the approach that the government and Microsoft took and the states couldn't get less out of it than they did."
Microsoft has long argued that it needs to be free to construct its software however it sees fit," Mr. Gavil said. "She bought into Microsoft's longstanding argument that there was very little relation between Microsoft's anticompetitive acts and their dominant position." 
He said there was not much room for an appeal, and that it would be "very difficult to convince the court of appeals that she abused her discretion."
The dissenting states had argued that the court should impose sanctions that would prevent the company from abusing its market power in new areas of technology as well as blocking the specific illegal practices identified by the appeals court.
They asked for greater disclosure of Microsoft's code to allow rival software to work better with Windows. They also wanted Microsoft to provide a pared-down version of Windows that would make it easier for competitors to supply programs like Internet browsers and e-mail software. And they asked for the company to publish the source code for its Internet Explorer browser, which zoomed ahead of Netscape's onetime dominant Navigator browser partly as a result of Microsoft's illegal acts.
The federal appeals court found that Microsoft had illegally maintained its monopoly on Windows through a series of acts that thwarted Netscape and Java, a programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. Together, the court said, they could have evolved into a threat to Microsoft's operating system because software developers could write applications to run on them as a "platform" much in the same way that they do for Windows.
That was the basis for one of the states' key proposals: that Microsoft deliver a stripped-down version of its software with some features removed. But the judge said that Microsoft only needed to remove the icon that users see on their computer screen, rather than the underlying computer code that software developers write to. The states had argued that the field would not be any more level for competitors unless the code itself were removed.
The states advocating tougher penalties are California, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, West Virginia and Utah, along with the District of Columbia.
But at least one Microsoft competitor voiced enthusiasm for Judge Kollar-Kotelly's decision. RealNetworks said the judge's requirement that Microsoft allow competing programs to start automatically when a computer is booted up could be a useful edge for the company's audio and video playback software. That obligation goes beyond what was required of the company in the settlement.
After the ruling was announced, Microsoft shares rose $3.33, to $56.33, in after-hours trading.
The proceedings before Judge Kollar-Kotelly were set in motion when the appeals court threw out the decision by the lower court judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, to break the company in two. The court also removed Judge Jackson, who had made public comments on the case that the appeals court judges found inappropriate.
Judge Kollar-Kotelly was assigned to carry out the strict instructions laid out in the appeals court decision. Microsoft, the court said, should be punished for illegally using its monopoly on the PC operating system to crush threats from Netscape Communications' Web browser and Sun Microsystems' Java programming language.
The judge was to fashion a remedy that would prevent Microsoft from repeating the violations, deprive it of the fruits of its misdeeds, and foster competition in the market for personal computer operating systems. Some legal scholars said the carefully crafted appeals court decision directed the judge to take a narrow view of how to restrain Microsoft. "The remedy the plaintiffs were seeking went beyond what was shown and adjudicated at trial," said Alan Meese, a law professor at the College of William and Mary specializing in antitrust. "She said, 'I'm not going to use this as an occasion to set up the court as a micromanager of Microsoft's business practices,' and given the law I think that was the right thing."
Judge Kollar-Kotelly did note that Microsoft "has a tendency to minimize the effects of its illegal conduct" and had showed a "paternalistic view" toward consumers. But the judge agreed with Microsoft that most of the states' proposals went beyond the company's misdeeds, and that they would mostly benefit Microsoft competitors.
Microsoft also faces lawsuits by AOL Time Warner and Sun and an antitrust inquiry by the European Union, which is expected to issue a preliminary ruling soon.
The states said their efforts had strengthened the accord, most notably by forcing Microsoft to appoint three members if its board -- not former employees of the company -- to oversee the company's implementation of the settlement.
"We have taken the settlement to a higher and better level," said the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal. "We can be very proud of improving the settlement in ways that that protect the public interest."
The judge also gave herself a prominent role in continuing to oversee the company's compliance with the settlement.
Quoting Machiavelli's "The Prince," the judge said, "Let it not be said of Microsoft that 'a prince never lacks legitimate reasons to break his promise,' for this court will exercise its full panoply of powers to ensure that the letter and spirit of this remedial decree are carried out."

HEADLINE: U.S. VS. MICROSOFT:NEWS ANALYSIS; 
For Microsoft, Ruling Will Sting But Not Really Hurt

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
When the federal government and 20 states filed their sweeping antitrust suit against Microsoft in May 1998, the company dominated the personal computer business and was aggressively moving into the markets for software for hand-held computers, cellphones, television set-top boxes and data-serving computers.
 More than four years later, little has changed. And there is little in yesterday's ruling on sanctions in the case by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of Federal District Court in Washington that will slow down the big software maker. 
 By endorsing most of the Bush administration's settlement with Microsoft, reached last year, the judge adopted a fairly narrow view of the case and showed a reluctance to meddle in Microsoft's business practices and product designs. She rejected calls by nine dissenting states seeking tougher measures, like requiring Microsoft to offer a stripped-down version of its Windows operating system or to publish freely the programming code for its Internet browser. 
In doing so, Judge Kollar-Kotelly chided the plaintiff states, writing that some of the proposed remedies appeared to be intended "simply for the sake of changing the status quo." In a passage that echoed Microsoft's complaint that its legal problems were the work of its rivals, she wrote: "Certain of Microsoft's competitors appear to be those who most desire these provisions."
Yet the ruling does not mean Microsoft is untouched. A federal appeals court last year found that Microsoft was a monopolist in the personal computer operating system market, and that it had repeatedly abused its monopoly power to thwart competition and stymie innovation. That means Microsoft is a court-decreed monopoly that is in the process of becoming regulated. 
But based on Judge Kollar-Kotelly's ruling, that regulation will be done with a light touch. "It shows a great reluctance to go down the regulatory path," said Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford, who has done consulting work for Microsoft.
Her reluctance, Judge Kollar-Kotelly noted, was grounded in the appeals court's ruling of June 2001. It upheld the monopoly ruling of the district court and several of its findings against Microsoft, but it also narrowed the scope of Microsoft's liability and brushed aside the lower court's order to break the company in two.
Judge Kollar-Kotelly did try to strengthen the controls in the Justice Department's settlement, which was joined by nine other states, in a couple of areas. In what she termed the "most forward-looking" portion of her ruling, she required Microsoft to share more technical information with rivals like I.B.M., Sun Microsystems and others who make server computers, which act as the data-serving hubs of computer networks.
In taking up server software, she rejected Microsoft's objections, a rare setback in the ruling for the company. By singling out server software, she implicitly recognized the emerging threat to Microsoft from Linux, an increasingly popular operating system that is distributed free and updated by a community of volunteer programmers.
The judge's order requires Microsoft to disclose the communications protocols in its Windows desktop PC software, so that competitors' server software can work as smoothly with Windows as the server operating systems sold by Microsoft do.
"That is a real effort to do something procompetitive," said Timothy Bresnahan, a Stanford professor who served as chief economist in the Justice Department during the Clinton administration.
But Mr. Bresnahan worried that Microsoft might well find ways around the requirement, since it only applied to Microsoft operating systems and not to all Microsoft programs.
More broadly, Mr. Bresnahan says that the conservative regulatory approach -- instead of the break-up proposal championed by the Clinton administration -- leaves Microsoft too many ways around the ruling. So, he contends, the policy goals of antitrust enforcement -- curbing a monopolist so competitive alternatives and new ideas can flourish -- have been badly undermined.
"There was a fabulous opportunity to free up innovation and choice in the PC and online world," Mr. Bresnahan said. "We got about 1 percent or so of that value."
In the markets it has earmarked for aggressive expansion -- from servers to cellphones to online services -- there is no assurance that Microsoft will succeed. It continues to struggle to gain ground in some areas, like cellphone and TV set-top box software.
But Microsoft has seemingly limitless financial resources and enormous influence on the computer industry thanks to its lucrative hold on the PC software market. Windows has roughly 95 percent of the desktop operating systems market and Microsoft's word-processing and other office programs have a similar market share.
So Microsoft can trail in a market for years and still spend heavily to catch up, giving it time to steadily improve its products and fine-tune its marketing.
The company's MSN online service has long lagged well behind America Online, but MSN is starting to close the gap since AOL became embroiled by distractions arising from its merger with Time Warner. To exploit the opportunity, Microsoft recently began a new $300 million marketing campaign.
Last month, in the middle of a severe slump in the technology industry, Microsoft reported that its quarterly profit rose 40 percent and its sales increased 26 percent. Part of the surge was attributable to a new pricing plan that raised charges for many purchasers and brought a chorus of protests from corporate customers. But nearly all of them paid up and went along.
"Microsoft may be a little bit more restrained and a little bit less aggressive because of the antitrust case," said David B. Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard Business School. "But not much. Microsoft's market power has been unimpeded by the case."
Still, as some analysts note, the company's corporate culture does seem to have been altered by the long litigation.
It seems to have been, they say, a hard-learned lesson in humility. "Internally, within Microsoft, I think the company is very different," said Michael Cusumano, a professor the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Business. "I think they are less aggressive with customers and partners than they were, and more respectful of the law."
But, Mr. Cusumano said, "Not much has changed in the marketplace."

What the Settlement Said

Main points of the antitrust settlement reached last November between Microsoft and the Justice Department that were endorsed by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly yesterday.

Microsoft can add anything it wants to its monopoly product, the Windows operating system.

Microsoft cannot restrict the freedom of PC makers to install non-Microsoft software, and is prohibited from retaliating against PC makers for shipping machines with competing software.

Microsoft must sell Windows under the same terms to all PC makers, though it can offer discounts for volume purchase agreements. Its pricing terms must be published on a Web site accessible by PC makers and the government.

Microsoft must disclose technical information to software rivals so that their products run smoothly on Windows. But sharing the information gives the companies no rights to Microsofts intellectual property.

Microsoft cannot retaliate against any software or hardware company for developing software that competes with Microsoft.

Microsoft will appoint an internal compliance officer. This person will make sure that all Microsoft officers and board members have read the settlement.

The conditions of the settlement will be in place for five years. If Microsoft is found to willfully and systematically violate the agreement, the settlement terms will remain in force for an additional two years.

HEADLINE: Under the Political Radar 

 BODY:
Environmental issues are not resonating with voters in this midterm election the way they usually do. This is as much a rebuke to the Democrats as it is a tribute to the administration's ability to hide its assault on the rules protecting the nation's natural resources under the political radar.
 According to the polls, the environment commands voter interest about on a par with taxes, above crime and corporate malfeasance but below the economy, education and health care. Environmental issues could yet make the difference in several tight races, Colorado and New Hampshire among them. But its national impact is not nearly what it was in 1996, when voters hammered Newt Gingrich and his Contract With America Republicans for similar transgressions -- even though Mr. Bush's indifference to the environment is every bit as worrisome as Mr. Gingrich's. 
 There are several reasons for this. One, of course, is the talk of war with Iraq, which has taken the wind out of nearly everything. A second is the miserable failure of the Democrats to take a stand on the issue, as Bill Clinton alertly did in 1996. One hears periodic complaints about Mr. Bush from important members of the Senate committee on the environment like James Jeffords and Joseph Lieberman, but there has been nothing resembling a sustained Democratic counterattack.
Another reason is the clever way Mr. Bush has pursued his anti-environmental agenda. Except on the matter of global warming, when he stood up and openly repudiated the Kyoto Protocol, the president has stayed in the shadows -- leaving it to his cabinet officers to chip away, administratively and in the courts, at the various rules and regulations that his allies and political contributors in the oil, gas, mining, timber and other extractive industries find so annoying.
These sorties have done real damage. The Interior Department, for example, continues its relentless search for oil and gas in places like Utah and Wyoming without regard to the fragility of the landscape or the niceties of the law. The same department has reversed Clinton-era regulations imposing stricter standards on mining operations. The Corps of Engineers has weakened protections for streams and wetlands. Most of President Clinton's forest protection program is now at risk -- including his plans to protect 60 million roadless acres from commercial activity, to enlarge protections for old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska's Tongass National Forest, and to manage forest lands in ways that give greater weight to environmental values.
Collectively, however, these actions -- scattered across government, hidden in obscure courtrooms -- have not coalesced into a decisive political issue. There is no time to make them one before Election Day. Still, there's a lesson here for Democrats. Unless they start challenging Mr. Bush's agenda in a serious, coordinated fashion, his policies will sail on with minimum resistance.

HEADLINE: A Nuclear Yugoslavia 

BYLINE:  By Robert D. Kaplan; Robert D. Kaplan, a correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly, is the author of "Soldiers of God: With Islamic Warriors in Afghanistan and Pakistan."

 BODY:
 PAKISTAN
Eye of the Storm.
By Owen Bennett Jones.
Illustrated. 328 pp. New Haven:

PAKISTAN
In the Shadow of Jihad and Afghanistan.
By Mary Anne Weaver.

 The central drama affecting the future of South Asia is not the hunt for remaining elements of Al Qaeda or even the struggle over the fate of Kashmir, it is the continuing institutional decline of Pakistan, the world's seventh most populous country and a potential nuclear version of Yugoslavia. Islam in Pakistan has had no more success in quelling ethnic and tribal animosities than Communism had in Yugoslavia. The Punjabis, through the military and the civil service, run the other provinces in imperial fashion much as the Serbs ran other parts of what was once Yugoslavia.
In "Pakistan: Eye of the Storm," Owen Bennett Jones, a BBC correspondent formerly stationed there, writes: "No elected government has ever completed its term in office. It has had three wars with India and has lost around half of its territory. Its economy has never flourished. Nearly half its vast population is illiterate and 20 percent is undernourished." In "Pakistan: In the Shadow of Jihad and Afghanistan," Mary Anne Weaver, a correspondent for The New Yorker, observes that this vast and arid frontier zone of the Indian subcontinent is where "angry students cling to a vision of an Islamist utopia, and equally angry mullahs chant prayers from the country's countless mosques." There is so little sense of authentic nationhood that when the Baluchi inhabitants of the country's southwestern desert venture elsewhere in Pakistan, they say they are going to "Hindustan," which for most people means India. As a consequence, Weaver says, Pakistan's ruling aristocracy -- once a triumvirate of military officers, tribal chiefs and the feudal landowners who bankroll the political parties -- clings to the British legacy of empire as the only available defense against anarchy. Since independence, the only addition to this triumvirate has been the Islamic clerics.
Though Weaver and Bennett Jones are both journalists, Weaver presents more of a descriptive, traveler's-eye view, exploring subjects like falconry and desert fortresses in addition to politics, while Bennett Jones has produced a more comprehensive, scholarly work, in which everything from the Seraiki national movement in southern Punjab to Pakistani nuclear doctrine is covered. Both books, however -- each the product of impressive expertise -- agree on a fundamental point: the differences between democratically elected leaders and military dictators in Pakistan may be less than the differences between one military leader and another, and prodding Pakistan toward stability and individual freedom is less a matter of the immediate return of democracy than of a sustained and nuanced American commitment to the country.
Together, these books provide an excruciatingly precise account of how in October 1999, Pakistan's last democratically elected leader, Nawas Sharif -- a Punjabi religious conservative who through the bribing of parliamentarians and the intimidation of judges and journalists was erecting a theocratic dictatorship under the guise of democracy -- denied landing rights to a civilian airliner packed with schoolchildren, in order to kill one of the passengers. The passenger was Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the military chief of staff. Musharraf's fellow officers removed Sharif from power literally minutes before the plane's fuel ran out, and installed Musharraf as the country's new leader. Musharraf is described by both Weaver and Bennett Jones as the country's last credible Westernizer: a man who admits to a penchant for whiskey and casinos, and whose greatest concern is that "75 percent of my officers have never been out of Pakistan." 
Musharraf emerges in these books as the philosophical opposite of another Pakistani general, Mohammed Zia ul-Haq. According to Bennett Jones, Zia is "perhaps the only one of Pakistan's four military rulers to deserve the epithet 'dictator.' " Zia took power in a coup in 1977 and ruled until 1988, when he was killed in a still unexplained plane crash. He was a courteous middle-class man with a common touch, but uncomfortable as a public speaker and lacking the charisma of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the civilian politician he had toppled. Weak politically, Zia aligned himself with Muslim extremists, institutionalizing radical Islam in almost every branch of the state. Zia's democratic successors, Bennett Jones notes, "did little to dismantle his legacy."
Undoing Zia's Islamization program has proved a thankless task for Musharraf, who despite his failure thus far has at least tried: challenging the clerics by denouncing religious practices like "honor killings" and blasphemy laws, and speaking out in support of human rights in a way that previous Pakistani leaders rarely did. As Bennett Jones asserts, Musharraf, unlike his democratic predecessors, "does at least have an agenda. . . . He wants a modernist, liberal Pakistan in which there is religious tolerance and respect for the law." Musharraf, a dashing former commando with tons of the self-confidence that Zia lacked, reversed Pakistan's longstanding policy of support for the Taliban, and has assisted the United States in hunting down Al Qaeda to a degree that would have been inconceivable for any previous government. "It is impossible to avoid the conclusion," Bennett Jones writes, "that the military stand a much better chance of delivering radical change in Pakistan than the civilians."
The reality is that Pakistan's experience with democracy has so far been unfortunate, beginning in essence with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a slick demagogue who in 1965 played a leading role in instigating Pakistan's disastrous war with India and later, as prime minister in the 1970's, imposed a ban on drinking, gambling and nightclubs even though he was a regular drinker himself. "He repeatedly pandered to the Islamic radicals in the hope of securing short-term political advantage," Bennett Jones reports. Weaver writes of how, in an effort to subdue Baluchi separatism, Bhutto "bombed and strafed" the Baluchi "at random"; 3,300 Pakistani soldiers and over 6,000 Baloch died. It was only after Bhutto's 1977 re-election was marred by fraud and riots broke out that the military, under Zia, took power.
Bhutto's daughter, Benazir, ruled twice, in the late 1980's and 90's, after Zia's death returned the country to democracy. In an affecting profile, Weaver shows how a hostile military and a feudal party apparatus were partly responsible for the gross mismanagement and disastrous decisions that characterized her first turn as prime minister. But, Weaver goes on, when Bhutto returned to power in 1993 and the country began to fall apart, "she had only herself to blame." She and Asif Ali Zardari, her husband as well as the investment minister, ran Pakistan as though it were a "commercial enterprise." 
As in Turkey, the military has periodically rescued Pakistan from political anarchy. But the Pakistani military, by constituting a state within a state, is itself a fundamental part of the problem, Bennett Jones concludes. Turkey has functioned reasonably well in recent decades because of an implicit division of power between the generals and the civilian leadership. The former, through a national security council, make the key decisions in security and foreign affairs, while the prime minister and parliament are sovereign domestically. One closes these two books thinking that if it is not to go on oscillating between military tyranny and democratic anarchy, Pakistan desperately needs a hybrid regime akin to the Turkish model.
Although the sheer variety of social and economic problems in the world cannot always be solved simply by instituting Western-style democracy, international elites have persistently demanded that Musharraf hold elections. So he did. Last month, Pakistan held its first nationwide election in seven years. With the reported connivance of the military, there were major gains for the hard-line religious parties and other opponents of working with the United States in the fight against terrorism. In two provinces bordering Afghanistan, crucial to American military operations, the religious parties are now dominant. 
Near the end of her book, Weaver quotes Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, the former commander in chief of Central Command, the headquarters for Middle East operations, who tells her: "It's so important that we work with Musharraf: not so much because of what Musharraf is or is not, but because what would come after him would be a disaster." Sadly, Zinni may still be right.

HEADLINE: Killing Your Friends 

BYLINE:  By Mark Levine; Mark Levine last wrote for the magazine about Bryan Buckley, a director of TV commercials.

 BODY:
To get a primer on endings -- happy endings, wistful endings, big-money endings, long-drawn-out-tear-stained endings -- it might be advisable to stroll right on past Central Perk, the most lucrative fantasy coffee bar in the imaginary West Village, where the ratty velour sofa is always weighted with perky idlers and the latte is poured, heedless of charge, in tureen-size Fiestaware. Because it's clear that, while the end is coming to Central Perk, waiting to be served up in some indeterminate blend of whimpering and banging one Thursday night in the not-too-distant future, those whose job it is to close the shutters from the inside are elsewhere. They -- a team of hard-working, well-paid, stressed-out writers -- are sequestered in a Warner Brothers office building in Burbank, Calif., in a bland conference room whose secrets are guarded with the zeal of national security matters. There they grapple with the question of how, after nine years of pratfalls and clever repartee, the quirky, sexually active, emotionally arrested friends of "Friends," NBC's pre-eminent pop-cultural franchise, are to be frozen into eternal postures of camaraderie or enmity. 
 On the specifics of exit strategy, these writers are mum. They have their reasons. Personally and professionally, they are in no great hurry to skip ahead to this particular finish line, beyond which lies the uncertain and ill-protected lot of ex-employees of a hit show. They may not yet have even determined -- let alone committed to paper -- what lies in store for Central Perk's forever-young clientele. Instead, the writers are standing by while the forces of marketing and promotion whip up a state of sweet and highly rated anticipation. Of course, they are shrewd enough to realize that in their realm there are no endings for the victors, but only a splendidly compensated afterlife in the heights of syndication, en route to a flickering and contented Nick at Nite of the soul. 
 Television, after all, is a world of make-believe contingencies, where meaningful outcomes to life's little crises -- the kinds of outcomes that are notably hard to come by off-screen -- are scripted by committee. It may be that in the instantly recognizable homeroom of youthful loitering that is Central Perk, loopy folk singing is encouraged, and the bonds of quasi kinship can withstand prolonged romantic tribulation, and the regulars are charged with no task more arduous than merely hanging out year after year without any thought of moving on. But in a parallel universe not far away, the clock is ticking -- thumping, practically. 
It's there, on the other side of the set, that Kevin Bright, one fabricator of the soon-to-be-dismantled tableau of friendship-at-all-costs, greets you with a quote. "This is the end -- my only friend, the end,"' he says. "Jim Morrison had it down." Bright, one of three top producers of "Friends," is eating slices of raw halibut from a foam container. It's an hour before "Friends" will begin to tape its 198th, or 20th-to-last, episode, which was shown Oct. 17. The episode count is a significant detail. Syndication deals -- which represent, for Bright and his producing colleagues, the gift that keeps giving -- are usually done in packages of 80 to 100 episodes. And because stations that run loops of old installments rarely purchase more than 200 episodes, it becomes far more difficult for the show that makes more than that number to recoup its production costs. This is a problem for "Friends," with its $7-million-per-episode budget -- $6 million for the salaries of the central cast members -- and it is a predominant, though rarely mentioned, reason that the show is planning to close shop. 
Bright, 47, has been with "Friends" from the outset in 1994. He edits the show and helped design its hip, cluttered look, and he oversees its direction. He has also directed some 40 episodes. Next spring, he will direct its one-hour finale, a show that is likely to be the most-hyped and widely viewed nonsports program of the year. "For a variety of reasons," he claims, somewhat halfheartedly, "it's the right time to end this. As a matter of economics, the show has gotten so expensive to produce that it's not feasible for the network or the studio to keep bringing it back. The cast members want to move on and do something different. And somehow, after Sept. 11 last year, it felt as if an era had ended. It was time for the six friends to grow up out of the age of innocence."
At this point in the season, he is trying hard not to dwell on the ending. He likens the feeling now to the beginning of the last year of high school, and he notes, "I'd be lying if I didn't admit to being scared about what comes next," and when he proposes that "we don't want to tie the show's loose ends up into a tidy package, but we want people to think that the characters will be O.K.," it's hard not to get the sense he might be talking about his own future. 
Most television endings, he reflects, are ignominious affairs, typically imposed on shows with cruel suddenness by failing ratings. This is clearly not the case for "Friends," which finished last season as television's top-rated series. The show's popularity, Bright knows, increases the pressure for a standout ending. By contrast, when he worked on "Veronica's Closet," a middling sitcom with Kirstie Alley that was canceled after three seasons, "nobody really cared what the ending was," Bright says. He was fond of "the idea that for the last episode we would put Veronica and the other main characters on an elevator, have the cable break and plunge them down the shaft. The elevator door would open onto a strange empty space where a bunch of actors from old sitcoms -- Gary Coleman, people like that -- are seated around a card table. The old actors would say to our characters: 'This is the place where we go when it's time. Pull up a seat.'
"Naturally," Bright says, "we didn't do that ending." How did "Veronica's Closet" end?
"I don't remember," he admits.
In the beginning there was a pilot, and it featured these six: Ross, a sensitive-guy paleontologist who has been ditched by his pregnant lesbian wife; his sister, Monica, a fastidious chef who, all appearances to the contrary, is said to have suffered an unsvelte adolescence; Monica's rich-girl high-school pal, Rachel, who dashes into Central Perk in a wedding gown, having fled her appointment at the altar with an orthodontist; Monica's neighbor Joey, a vapid, hunky, aspiring actor; Chandler, Joey's smart-aleck roommate, who works as a data-processing drone; and Phoebe, the dippy vegetarian twin of a character on "Mad About You." The friends were plucked from the chipper, optimistic wing of Gen X: they were as loyal and attractive and well heeled as they were aimless, solipsistic and irony-drenched. 
The series was an instant hit. A long line of television-averse stars, from Susan Sarandon to Brad Pitt, put in guest-starring appearances over the years, but "Friends" never strayed far from its half-dozen core slackers, for whom the writers manufactured enough plot convolutions to exhaust a troupe of roving Shakespearean comedians. The show's most enduring feature has been the wrung-out coupling and uncoupling of Ross and Rachel. Last year's season was driven by the discovery that Ross had impregnated Rachel during a night of wine-sotted nostalgia. Ross and Rachel agreed to a platonic co-parenting arrangement, opening the way for Joey to nurture his own furtive passion for his best friend's lover. Hey, it happens. This year's final season, then, is primarily faced with settling the issue of Rachel's ideal suitor. In addition, it promises to address itself to a crisis of fertility -- that most venerable engine of narrative -- since Monica and Chandler have set themselves to the challenge of conceiving a child of their own, a task they first undertook in a hospital broom closet while waiting for Rachel to deliver.
The "Friends" staff of 13 writers -- eight men, five women, most of them a touch younger than the 30-something characters they write lines for -- showed up for work on the show's final season in mid-June. The grand finale was on everyone's mind. Marta Kauffman and David Crane, who created the series and who remain its lead writers, initiated a discussion of "where we'd like the characters to land," as Kauffman puts it. In short order, an amicable dispute over how to drop the curtain divided the room. "Should they stay in the coffeehouse and be friends forever?" muses Shana Goldberg-Meehan, a 29-year-old executive producer who is in her seventh year of writing for the show, recounting the discussion. "If they keep meeting at Central Perk, won't the audience feel that there's more fun to be had, but that they're missing out on it?" Goldberg-Meehan's boyfriend, Scott Silveri, whom she met when the two were students at Harvard and who is 30 and also an executive producer, counters: "If everybody moves away, it'll be too sad. People will think, This thing we love is totally over. Whatever else it does, the ending has to be funny." The twin perils of sentimentality and incomplete resolution were already apparent. "Viewers are emotionally invested in these characters," Goldberg-Meehan says. "The ending has got to be a little sad." She glances at Silveri, who shakes his shoulder-length hair. "If the final episode is a sobfest, with everybody hugging and saying, 'Oh, my God, I'll miss you so much,' it'll be pretty sickening. We've been funny all these years. We can't just toss it away." 
Kauffman is adamant about one thing: "I want the characters to grow up and be happy. I need to know that they're going to be O.K." Although the writers tend to regard the fictional friends as real people, Kauffman says, no consideration would be given to subjecting them to the kinds of endings that real people regularly experience -- changes that would make for an emphatic and attention-getting, if sour, farewell. "There was a rumor circulating last year that we were going to kill Rachel in childbirth," Goldberg-Meehan recalls. "We got letters from viewers pleading that that not happen. But we'd never do such a thing!" 
So there will be no cancers or bouts of mental illness or stumbles onto the subway tracks or heartbreaking O. Henry reversals of fortune. While the writers value the comic and dramatic possibilities of surprise, they feel their compact with the show's 30 million dedicated fans requires their charmed friends to remain immune from peril. "It would be surprising," Silveri agrees, "to have Monica take a pregnancy test, and the toilet explodes, and she dies. But that's not what we're going for." Crane doesn't even like to joke about such things. "I don't think we want to see the coffeehouse burn down," he tells me, pointedly. "I don't even think we want to see everybody move away." Unlike their counterparts in comic books, the friends will be allowed to grow up; unlike their counterparts in reality, the friends will drift into perpetuity in a manner that will soothe the anxieties of engaged viewers. "It would be depressing to think that they're still acting out the same silly dating stories in their 40's," says Andrew Reich, a 34-year-old executive producer. "But it would also be a bummer to think that they're not going to be friends anymore."
The two looming questions -- Ross and Rachel's relationship, Monica and Chandler's efforts at pregnancy -- await a splashy resolution in the finale. Since the writers know there is overwhelming popular interest in resolving those questions affirmatively, the major challenge they face, as Goldberg-Meehan says, "is to give people what they want, but in a way they don't see coming."
After a day or two back on the job, the writers shifted their attention from endings to the nuts-and-bolts work of writing the season-opening episodes. Endings were allowed to remain an abstraction for the moment. Writing good jokes was a more immediate problem. They filled a board with lists of ideas for plots and subplots, sent off six groups of writers to hammer out drafts of the opening episodes and left the big questions for later. "We don't yet know what the precise ending is going to be," Kauffman says. "I'm not trying to be cagey. We're trying to avoid the ending as long as we can. It's too terrifying." Besides, Kauffman maintains, "I'm not sure I believe in closure -- that everything can be neatly rounded off. Life doesn't work like that. Goodbyes aren't always satisfying. Sometimes you just can't accept loss. Sometimes you've got to go out kicking and screaming. Now," she says, as we part ways, "I've got to go home and cry."
Literary endings offer the exhilaration of a fictional world abiding by orderly rules. A good traditional ending offers symmetry and the consoling thought that the meandering journey has, after all, had a destination. Not least, such an ending provides a model for coping with messy real-life endings. Conversely, an ending that frustrates the desire for closure can seem intolerable, and not just in literature: when this year's All-Star baseball game ended in a 7-7 tie, fans were outraged, and the outcome was cited as evidence of the sport's contempt for its followers. Endings invite an almost ritualistic participation in their heightened emotional states. Non-football fans watch the Super Bowl, and spectators who nap through an opera will stick around for curtain calls, and the final episode of "Friends" can be expected to draw most of its audience from those who are not devotees of the show. NBC, at least, will be counting on a huge turnout, which will generate huge advertising revenues. (The season finale will be an hourlong episode; the network has yet to decide what it will show in the preceding hour.) In 1983, the two-and-a-half-hour final episode of "M*A*S*H," ending on a shot of the main character, Hawkeye Pierce, looking down from a helicopter at rocks arrayed on the ground to spell "Goodbye," was the most-watched show in television history and helped to create the television phenomenon of the highly promoted adieu. It's not mere coincidence that endings are called "payoffs." 
Television shows, though, face particular burdens in bringing themselves to an end. Unlike movies or novels, television series begin with no end in sight and are rarely driven toward a culminating moment. Movies and novels compress the passage of time into packages of consumable length; television series tend to deny the passage of time. The viewer of "Friends" may find himself 100 hours of viewing removed from the show's debut and half a generation older than when Central Perk first opened, but the friends themselves are remarkably the same as they have always been. It turns out that television has a good deal in common with ordinary life: a lot happens, but little changes. 
As a result, most shows that are afforded the opportunity to write their own endings do so in ways that are resoundingly artificial. Some enact the farewell between the series and its viewers: the characters on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" inch across the show's newsroom in a group hug before Mary turns off the lights; Ted Danson's character in "Cheers" throws the barroom set into darkness. Other series force their audiences to wake up to the fact that their experience has been a dream. Did "St. Elsewhere" unfold in the mind of the autistic child of one of the characters? Apparently so. The entire final season of "Roseanne" turned out to be a fiction written by the main character; her husband was actually dead the whole time. Bob Newhart's innkeeper was knocked unconscious and came to in the arms of Suzanne Pleshette, who played the wife in his previous series. "Mad About You" and "The Wonder Years" employed a time-honored escape strategy, offering snapshot glimpses of their characters' futures. Of notable television endings, only "Seinfeld" notoriously refused to give its viewers a dose of nostalgia-producing comfort; the 1998 finale put Jerry and his cronies on trial for bad behavior and brought back a parade of former characters to act as witnesses. Jerry, George, Elaine and Kramer were last seen bickering in a jail cell. 
"Seinfeld" is a cautionary example to the writers of "Friends," who are determined to remain squarely within the bounds of feel-good territory. "The ending of 'Seinfeld' was an insult to the audience," Reich says. "It wasn't funny. 'Friends' would never go for such a self-conscious ending." Adds Ted Cohen, 34, another executive producer, "It tried so hard to defy conventions that it didn't feel like the show." Instead, expect "Friends" to give audiences what Marianna Torgovnick, a professor of English at Duke University and author of "Closure in the Novel," says they most yearn for from endings: "Weddings. Births. Big communal ritualized events. Transition from one stage of life to another. These events correspond to what people do in real life -- they come together at a wedding or a funeral, and then they separate." 
And yet, as Reich acknowledges, television endings, for all their hype, are ephemeral even by the standards of the medium. In the endless replay of syndication, where time is cyclic, not linear, sequence no longer matters. Even if final episodes break into the syndication lineup, the next night, in the drowsy hour after your late local news has ended, you will always find your favorite old shows in media res. "When I get too freaked out about the pressure of writing the finale," Reich says, "I take some comfort from the fact that even if it's not the greatest thing in the world, people will forget about the ending soon enough and still remember the show fondly, as I still think of 'Seinfeld' as an amazing, great show."
The writers are huddled en masse at the foot of the set for the taping of the fourth episode of the final season of "Friends," titled "The One With the Shark." They confer after every take. David Crane tells me, "I try not to play the game of, 'Oh, God, this is the last time we'll do a fourth episode,' but all of us are aware of the emotional ramifications of what it will mean to have no more 'Friends' in our lives."
Like most segments of the show, this one follows three interweaving plots, one of which has Monica paying a surprise visit to Tulsa, where Chandler has been reassigned by his employer. She walks in on him while he is watching pornography and masturbating, and he quickly changes the channel to a nature show. Monica sees this as evidence that Chandler is aroused by sharks. As such, Monica has plenty of opportunity to display the upright indignation that Courteney Cox Arquette has honed over the years. "I caught him molesting himself," she shouts at Rachel. "He was getting off to a shark-attack show." Later she asks Joey, "You don't think sharks are sexy, do you?" Joey dismisses the notion, then pauses and asks, "What was the little mermaid?"
The shark routine nods at the source of television's favorite current in-joke, the Web site called Jump the Shark, which is dedicated to chronicling the downward spiral of once-popular shows. (For the origin of the phrase "jump the shark," see On Language, Page 34.) Most series are in creative death throes for so long, according to Jon Hein, the site's creator, that final episodes tend to be merciful and anticlimactic formalities. "Friends' jumped the shark long ago," he says, "when Ross and Rachel broke up for the third time." (Indeed, on Sept. 22, when "Friends" finally won its first Emmy as Outstanding Comedy Series -- after years of being eclipsed by the more adventuresome "Ally McBeal," the racier "Sex and the City" and the golden-child "Frasier" -- the award had about it the air of a valedictory kiss goodbye to a stalwart, offered in gratitude for longevity and for the economic boost it has given the industry.)
To judge by the reaction of the 300-strong studio audience at the taping, though, there's little evidence that "Friends" is in decline. The audience laps up the snappy dialogue, laughing in all the right places, take after take, and expelling an affectionate sigh when Phoebe is kissed by her guy. I find myself joining in their pleasure -- the pleasure not of ending, but of ongoingness. How, I wonder, can a sitcom possibly come up with a satisfying ending when the best shows are built on familiarity and repetition -- elements that want to deny that endings are the horizon of experience? 
It's comforting to see the actors step into their characters' mannerisms -- to see Ross's hangdog expression and to hear his plaintive tones of appeasement; to see Chandler's self-mocking scowl and Phoebe's spaced-out head-wagging and Joey's puffed-up swagger and the rest. Up close, Central Perk looks exactly as it is supposed to, and its denizens act exactly as they always have, and therein lies the regressive pleasure of visiting an intact universe of likable people exempt from the laws of change. NBC, whose president, Jeff Zucker, has hinted at his interest in prolonging the life of "Friends," will rue the passing of the show, but the network knows that Thursday nights are forever, while first-run sitcoms have mortal life spans; the cast, most of whom have said that they find the subject of endings too much of a downer to talk about, have made it clear that they are eager to pursue careers in film, though surely they know that for every John Travolta, rising to stardom from "Welcome Back, Kotter," there are dozens doomed to linger in uneasy obscure fame as Arnold Horshack or Epstein; and while the creators of "Friends" have made it clear that they are spinoff- and reunion-averse for now, they know too that their moment will be hard to let go of. It doesn't matter how good or bad, funny or sad, poignant or absurd the final episode turns out to be. For an hour in May 2003, it will seem as if all of us are watching it, and immediately afterward we will turn our attention elsewhere. "It's just a TV show," says Matt LeBlanc, who plays Joey, as he pauses between scenes. His tone grows philosophical as he adds, "It'll be sad when it's over, but you gotta move on."
So I try not to read too much into the fact that the episode I'm watching suggests that Phoebe is headed toward a companionable future; or that Joey has returned to his Lothario-like self after last season's wooing of Rachel; or that Monica and Chandler may be Oklahoma-bound. All I can make of the Ross-and-Rachel intrigue is that it has, for this episode at least, been tactfully delayed. (Indeed, the first month of the season has teased viewers with the possibility that Ross and Rachel will not ride off together into the cathode-ray-streaked sunset, after all.) Much to the audience's disappointment, in fact, Jennifer Aniston does not even appear on the set. She's off filming a movie with Jim Carrey, and her few lines are read by a stand-in. Friends, it seems, grow up and move away.

 BODY:
The movie industry, and the movie audience along with it, began this year in a state of post-9/11 jumpiness. Release dates were postponed, shots of the Manhattan skyline were digitally reconfigured and studio executives scrambled to anticipate the entertainment needs of a traumatized public. Would we be drawn to war pictures or to romantic comedies? Would we want movies that confronted the unnerving state of the world or movies that helped us to escape it? As it turns out, the answer is yes, and no, and all of the above: we just want to go to the movies. 
 In the midst of geopolitical instability and general economic trouble, the box office has once again demolished previous records, by wider margins than ever, racking up increases of 10, 15, 30 percent each weekend over the same weekend the year before and shattering records we never knew existed. ("Sweet Home Alabama," a gauzy vehicle for Reese Witherspoon, was the highest September opening ever, taking in more than $37 million its first weekend out.) But as the studios have flourished, their sometimes rivalrous corporate siblings, the record labels and television networks, have been floundering, throwing good money after bad in a battle for audience shares that seem to be inexorably splintering and diminishing. The recording industry's scramble to protect its copyrights from digital piracy (i.e., from music fans) coincides with a period of creative stagnation as well as financial contraction, prompting every desperate trick in the playbook. And the networks have suffered a similar slackness, rallying behind each flimsy trend only to skittishly abandon it moments later, all the while defending their fragile oligopoly against TiVo and the expansion of original programming on cable. 
 The impulse to go to the movies is at once simpler and more complicated than anyone could predict. Going to the movies is an act that takes many forms. We go to the movies in adolescent packs, on timid first dates, with minivan-loads of children or busloads of friends from the senior center and also alone, on foot, in the middle of the day. We talk back to the characters on the screen, or shush the people behind us who are doing it; we walk out in disgust, or come back the next night, or buy each successive DVD release of something we didn't much care for in the first place. We weep, we rage, we snore, we aspirate our popcorn in bursts of helpless laughter. The varieties of cinematic experience -- the means by which we sate our apparently limitless appetite for narrative, sensation, color, feeling, sound -- are in a way more lasting, more definitive and always more unpredictable than anything we see on the screen. Sometimes, after all, the most relentless hype fails to excite the audience and the surest publicity calculations go awry. Sometimes pictures succeed financially without generating enthusiasm, and we line up out of a mixture of weary habit and bored curiosity. Sometimes movies are loved not widely but intensely, so that devotion to them seems like a secret password offering entry into an exalted coterie. Sometimes we can't remember the end of a movie 20 minutes after leaving it; sometimes it troubles our sleep for weeks afterward. Regardless, we keep going. Why?
The simplest answer may be that a movie ticket remains a bargain, at least relative to other entertainment options, so that habitual moviegoing can be sustained by allowances and minimum-wage summer jobs. But the inexpensiveness of the movies is, more deeply, the symbol of their accessibility, of their unique promise to be available to everyone -- to effect the distillation of reality into image and the transubstantiation of fantasy into fact. And this promise, like everything else about the movies, is double-edged -- offering an image of utopian communal pleasure and, at the same time, of atomization and disaffection. The essential paradox of moviegoing is that it is at once collective and radically solitary, an amalgam of the cohesive social ritual of theatergoing and the individualist reverie of novel-reading. The movies offer visions of a better world even as they are symptoms of everything wrong with this one. As such, moviegoing is perhaps still, in spite of the competing claims of newer media, the exemplary modern cultural activity. It splices together individualism and mass culture -- the insistence on the particularity of identity and the standardization of experience, the line at the box office and the solitary dreaming in the dark -- like a serendipitous art-house double feature programmed by a deity with perverse tastes and an odd sense of humor.
The conventional wisdom of the past decade has been that we are becoming a republic of niche markets and specialized tastes. For Webby utopians this cultural fracturing represented a kind of liberation -- the rise of decentralized, willed microcommunities that would bind the like-minded together in defiance of the boundaries of region, class or background. But at the same time, worriers of various ideological colorations have lamented the loss of common cultural reference points and experiences. The movies, it is true, have not entirely escaped this Balkanization, but they supply the most cogent available evidence that it has been overstated and misconstrued. It is not just that more people are going to the movies more frequently and that there are more movies to see (somewhere around 400 will open commercially in New York by the end of this year) -- but also that, much of the time, we are all going to the same movie. With some regularity, viewers emerge from their subcultural niches to converge on a picture that somehow transcends the differences that otherwise preoccupy them. Sometimes this convergence is almost entirely predictable, as in the case of "Spider-Man" or "Austin Powers in Goldmember," and sometimes entirely unexpected, like the runaway success of "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." Sometimes the movies in question are terrible, sometimes they're not bad and occasionally they're even really good. 
The past year has witnessed the emergence of a new critical parlor game, devoted to determining not the best movie of all time, but the best movie year of all time. This is a curious pursuit, since the year of a picture's release usually represents an accident of the calendar rather than the mystical intentions of the zeitgeist. The longtime consensus best year ever, 1939, gave us "The Wizard of Oz," "Ninotchka," "Gone With the Wind." Among the leading revisionist candidates are 1962 ("Lawrence of Arabia," "The Manchurian Candidate," "Knife in the Water") and 1971 ("The Last Picture Show," "Murmur of the Heart," "McCabe and Mrs. Miller"). The purpose of the arguments, in any case, is to diminish the present by comparison with the past and make us feel bad about the sorry state of current movie culture.
Needless to say, there is always plenty to feel bad about. If we like, we can choose to remember this year as the year of "Men in Black II," "Scooby-Doo" and "Attack of the Clones" -- some of the worst movies ever, and symptoms of the hype, cynicism and planned obsolescence that rule American commercial cinema. It will also, however, be the year of "The Fast Runner" ("Atanarjuat"), "About Schmidt," "Talk to Her," "Far From Heaven" and a dozen more -- many of them products of that same infernal studio machinery -- that may well, in the long run, be some of the best. A year, in other words, pretty much like any other, and of course completely without precedent or portent.
Which should come as no surprise. The history of the movies is a saga of wild, headlong innovation and expansion -- from arcade amusement to global empire, from a silent train lurching into a monochromatic station to Dolby-enhanced, computer-generated spaceship battles, all in the space of little more than a century -- and also, simultaneously, a chronicle of dwindling and decline. Among modern art forms, perhaps only the novel has enjoyed so long and fruitful a death as the movies, whose every golden age has been shadowed by catastrophe. To hear some purists tell it, the first disaster was the advent of sound, which forever destroyed the aesthetic purity of the image. Soon thereafter, in 1934, the adoption of the censorious Production Code squelched the emerging daring and vitality of American cinema. The code's repeal, more than three decades later, would in turn strip Hollywood of the decorum and sophistication that had defined its classic era and deliver it up to the corrosive energies of nihilism, vulgarity and literal-mindedness. The studio system sacrificed the vision of directors and the liberty of stars to the vulgar whims of moguls -- until the system's collapse made matters worse. In the meantime, the movies had been beset by plagues and scourges -- by the Justice Department, whose antitrust division helped wreck the studio system with the Paramount consent decree of 1948, by McCarthyism and worst of all, by television. Then, in the 70's and after, came the swallowing up of the old studios into conglomerates, the rise of the blockbuster mentality, the home-video revolution, the Internet. . . . There has scarcely been a moment of film history not tinged by nostalgia and regret, by a sense of lost possibility and squandered magic.
But alongside this dark, Spenglerian narrative is a bright, triumphalist saga, a fitting succession of happy endings and new beginnings. In the depths of the Depression, the medium established itself as the exemplary democratic amusement, and in every succeeding era it has found new ways of living up to its promise and expanding its domain. After heroic service during wartime, both in and out of uniform, Hollywood, bolstered by an infusion of emigre talent, answered the confusing postwar reality with the giddy splash of Technicolor musicals and the anxious shadows of film noir. At around the same time, American audiences became aware of the rejuvenation of European and Asian national cinemas (and of their tantalizing exemption from the prudish code). And television, cinema's vulgar stepchild, proved to be a training ground for new talent, starting the careers of Robert Altman, Clint Eastwood and Sidney Lumet, among others. Critics, first in France and then in the United States, discovered that those taken-for-granted society comedies, horse operas, crime stories and tear-jerkers were works of art after all, and a newly refined (if at times also snooty) film culture took root in American cities and college towns. It would blossom in the New Hollywood of the 70's, an era of visionary artistry and social engagement, as well as of drugs, sexual promiscuity and wild budgetary excess. The lions of that age -- Coppola, Altman, Scorsese, Woody Allen -- inspired the indie boom of the 1990's, when every film-school dropout with a credit card was suddenly an auteur in the making.
Recently, the cycles of this contradictory history have been replicated in microcosm each year. In the late spring and early summer, if you listen carefully, you can hear the critics grumbling that this is the worst year ever, that even last year at this time there was at least "Erin Brockovich" or "Bridget Jones's Diary" to make their (our) dreary lives more bearable. And then, six months later, as the deadlines for 10-best lists and awards ballots draw near and the studios clog the marketplace with their top-shelf Oscar-worthy goods, the same critics marvel at all the quality and variety on display.
Even the more sober assessments of the business pages yield their share of confusion. Not long ago -- last year or thereabouts -- motion pictures seemed to be nearing the brink of terminal irrelevance. Exhibitors toppled into bankruptcy, labor trouble threatened, production and publicity costs spiraled out of control. The impending conversion to digital technology, moreover, was about to relegate cinema -- along with print, comic opera and fresco painting -- to a state of quaint obsolescence, a hobby for antiquarians. At about the same time, of course, an epidemic of mergers heralded a glittering new age of synergy, in which the studios would serve as the principal content factories in vast and vari-egated networks of distribution, and movies would remain standard-bearers in the global media empire. Every year, meanwhile, the box-office take grows fatter. To paraphrase something Ronald Colman might have said back in 1935 (unless it was Dirk Bogarde in the 1958 remake): it's always the best of times and the worst of times.
The only way to understand the present moment would be to catapult ourselves, with the help of Michael J. Fox's DeLorean (or Haley Joel Osment's robot submarine) into the future we are now blindly constructing. The portents are not easy to read, partly because movies, driven like the rest of the capitalist economy by the twin imperatives of relentless technological innovation and market expansion, are constantly changing, with the goal of producing more of the same. The pictures get bigger and bigger, but also smaller and smaller. The more expensive their production and marketing become, the more safe and trivial they seem to be. It seems inarguable that large-scale commercial filmmaking has on the whole abandoned the craft of storytelling or the discipline of realism in favor of formula, fantasy and therapy -- well-designed, disposable consumer goods that can be shipped and sold around the globe. It will continue to do so and reap very happy returns. 
The standoff between cynicism and idealism -- Is the consent of the audience manufactured or freely given? Are we prisoners of Hollywood or its eager constituents? -- resembles a medieval theological dispute about predestination and free will. Neither position, by itself, offers a satisfying account of why we go to the movies, or of how they work their magic on us. The most alarmist view of the current state of movies is a variant of antiglobalist ideology: the hegemony of Hollywood is a baleful force, wiping out local traditions and absorbing everyone in a standardized, soulless universalism. But to emphasize only this aspect of the current situation is to miss the abundant signs of a contrary trend -- the flowering, around the world (including Hollywood), of a cinema that is full of surprise, provocation and insight, even if it often announces itself modestly in the midst of the surrounding noise. The same movements of capital that have threatened, and in some cases crushed, state-supported national film industries have also opened new possibilities for financing production. Money flows from the countries of the European Union, and from the Hollywood studios themselves, to support filmmakers in Iran, Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. The idea that Hollywood's drive to hegemony is implacable and inevitable -- a constant worry in Paris and Rome -- might be met with raised eyebrows in Bombay or Seoul. Globalization, in other words, has two faces -- or rather, as many faces as can fit on the screen, and there are more screens than ever before.
A few years ago, around the time my own moviegoing became a full-time job, two giant multiplexes, with a mind-boggling total of 38 screens, opened on opposite sides of 42nd Street. The larger of the two, the AMC Empire 25, turns out to be part of a vast indoor leisure complex. You enter, in the usual way, via marquee and velvet ropes, but leave on a system of escalators that deposit you in the middle of a food court, surrounded by chain restaurants offering a panoply of mediocrity analogous to what often plays on the screens. Descending toward the sidewalk into the twilight, overhearing the idle, occasionally heated postmovie chatter, you feel you could be anywhere: like airports, modern movie theaters provide atmospheres of bland indistinguishability at once reassuring and profoundly alienating.
But you are, nonetheless, in Times Square, an undesignated landmark in the history of American moviegoing. Once you could have prowled the grind houses and discovered the as yet unrecognized masterpieces of the old studio system and the rough gems of Italian neorealism, as well as a cornucopia of cheap, flavorsome trash (some of which, in hindsight, would turn out to be art). And as you wander past Madame Tussaud's wax museum, with its movie-star replicas in the window, toward the ad-saturated 3-D science-fiction video game at the meeting point of Broadway and Seventh, you may feel a twinge of nostalgia for the old days -- for the smoky black-and-white world that still flickers occasionally on television and at Film Forum downtown. You are in a thoroughly branded environment, a dystopian corporate sublime rather like the shopping mall Tom Cruise hurtles through in "Minority Report." The billboards and plasma-screen building facades don't read your mind so much as empty it out, alienating you from your most basic sense of time, space and self. But there is nonetheless some pleasure in being swallowed up in these images, and also some pleasure in resisting them -- pleasures not unlike those you seek out at the multiplex. You look around, at the crowds hurrying past to line up for the 8 o'clock show, and you realize that your thoughts are a voice-over and that your mental lens has zoomed upward in a dizzying crane shot, to take in the milling, oblivious mob, in which you are at once a tiny speck and the center of attention -- camera, star and audience, just like in the movies.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Long Island; 
Helping Workers Make Down Payments on Homes

BYLINE:  By CAROLE PAQUETTE 

 BODY:
FOR more than three years, Pamela and Bartholomew Isaac and their three young children lived in a cramped apartment in Amityville not far from Our Lady of Consolation Geriatric Care Center in West Islip, where Mrs. Isaac works as a dietary aide. 
 Last year, the Isaacs began looking to buy a house in the vicinity, but one of their main concerns was that they would not have enough money for a down payment. 
 Shortly after they began their search, however, Mrs. Isaac found that the geriatric center had just started a program, in partnership with federal and state agencies, that would assist employees with a down payment. Mrs. Isaac applied for financing through the program, and it provided her with most of the $10,000 down payment needed to buy a two-story, four-bedroom Cape Cod house in Amityville for $150,000. 
Monthly payments on the 30-year mortgage on the 1,303-square-foot house, including insurance and $5,348 in annual taxes, will be approximately $900, only about $50 a month more than the rent the family had been paying for three years.
The Isaacs are one of the first families on Long Island to benefit from the employer-assisted housing program -- called the Long Island Home Works Partnership -- whose goal is to help companies recruit and keep high-quality employees. Under the initial phase of the program, public money has been set aside that is expected to help in the sale of more than 50 houses. 
Before receiving assistance through the program, employees must meet certain criteria, including income ceilings, and attend counseling sessions "to help them know what they can afford and to protect them from going to predatory lenders," said Peter J. Elkowitz Jr., executive vice president of the Long Island Housing Partnership.
Fannie Mae, which is the nation's largest source of financing for home mortgages, introduced the program to Long Island three years ago and offers the technical advice and legal documents necessary to help the employers set up their loans.
"The program was set up to address the major barriers to affordable housing on Long Island:" down payment costs and a lack of knowledge about financial management, said Jacqueline O'Garrow, a senior deputy director at Fannie Mae's New York office. "If you can combine amassing funds and education through counseling, you can create a nice benefit that will attract employees."
More such programs are needed, said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, a Commack-based business group. "Once the national economy gains momentum, we won't be able to achieve our potential in terms of future growth unless we keep our homegrown workers and attract those from the outside," she said. "This program will at least help those who have limited funds for a down payment."
The partnership currently includes 18 employers; Nassau and Suffolk Counties; the towns of Islip, Babylon and Huntington; the Suffolk County Community Development Consortium; the Long Island Association; Fannie Mae; the Long Island Housing Partnership; and the New York State Affordable Housing Corporation.
Banks that work with the program, which often involves lower down payments than are generally required, include Citibank, Astoria Federal Savings, HSBC, Fleet, J. P. Morgan Chase and the Bank of New York. 
Under the program, state and federal agencies match the funds of a participating employer toward the employee's down payment. The match may be as much as $3,000 from each government. The employee pays the balance of the down payment after the employer and the other agencies have made their loans. 
In addition, the state, whose program applies only to previously owned houses, provides up to $7,000 more for necessary repairs.
The towns and counties administer the federal money, and the Long Island Housing Partnership, which offers counseling to the prospective home buyers, administers the state funds.
The Isaacs provided more than $2,500 for their down payment from their own funds. They received $2,500 each from Mrs. Isaac's employer, the federal government and the state, which also provided $6,950 for repairs.
J. P. Morgan Chase, which holds the Isaacs' mortgage, provided $4,000 toward the closing through its closing cost assistance program, said Wesley A. Wainwright, a senior vice president for Chase's community development group. The program absorbs up to $4,000 to be used either for a down payment or closing costs. 
"We have found that people are asset-starved although they may have the income that could hold a mortgage," Mr. Wainwright said.
The state has $500,000 set aside for the program, according to Stephen J. Hunt, president of the Affordable Housing Corporation. The money is to go toward 30 homes in Suffolk and 20 in Nassau. 
Currently, there are five employers in Nassau and 13 in Suffolk participating in the program, according to Carol J. Woods, a project manager for the Long Island Housing Partnership. These include the Bay Shore School District, five facilities in the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System and seven under Catholic Health Services of Long Island, a nonprofit health service Computer Associates was a major employer instrumental in starting the program, she said.
Seventeen families have received federal funds through the program since it began, according to Joseph Sanseverino, Suffolk's community development director. State funds just recently became available, and the Isaacs are the first to get money from both public sources.
"We are so pleased that the Isaacs had the opportunity to buy their first home and be able to raise their family on Long Island," said Sister Audrey Harsen, president of Our Lady of Consolation, which is a member of Catholic Health Services. The geriatric center has pledged $10,000 annually to the program, she said.
According to Charles N. Guder, Catholic Health Services' director of benefits, the member organizations have agreed to "put out $2,000 to $3,000 for each grant to an employee in good standing that agrees to stay with the system for four years." 
To receive public funds, employees must agree to receive financial counseling, purchase a home within Nassau or Suffolk and secure a mortgage from a recognized lending institution. 
THE state and federal payments are considered deferred-payment interest-free loans that are to be repaid only if the home is sold within a certain period of time -- 5 years for the federal loan and 10 for the state. The loans are forgiven if the homeowner remains in the house for the prescribed period.
The appraised value of the house to be purchased can range as high as $259,350. 
There are two income categories for participating families. Under the first, a family of four whose income is no more than $66,400, which is 80 percent of the median income in Nassau and Suffolk, may apply for both state and federal funds. 
A second category, for those making 100 percent of the median income, applies only to state aid. The second category was set up "because many employees were over the 80 percent criteria yet were not wealthy enough to go out and buy a home," Mr. Elkowitz said.
"The main profession that the housing partnership assists with is the medical profession, such as nursing assistants, dietitians and custodians," Mr. Elkowitz said. Therefore, the majority of the housing required is in the vicinity of major hospitals, he said, as in Port Jefferson, a village with two hospitals and only eight miles away from Stony Brook University Hospital. 
Relatively modest houses with three bedrooms in the vicinity of the three hospitals range from $219,990 to $489,990 in Port Jefferson Station and average about $300,000 in Stony Brook, according to Ray Manzoni, of Manzoni Real Estate in Mount Sinai.
Theresa Sabatino, Babylon's director of community development, said many of the town's residents, like Mrs. Isaac, work at one of the three hospitals or numerous nursing homes in that South Shore area. 
The health industry is the fastest growing on Long Island, Dr. Kamer said. According to statistics by the State Labor Department for the 12 months that ended in September, Long Island had a net gain of only 600 jobs, she said. "In looking at the configuration, 2,600 of those jobs were in the health industry and 2,500 in social services, both of which offset the losses in manufacturing, transportation, communications and wholesale trade."
Examples of annual salaries in these industries are $31,601 for a mental health counselor, $17,466 for a home health aide and $31,423 for a dietetic technician.

HEADLINE: HOLIDAY MOVIES; 
Santa, James Bond and Other Old Friends

BYLINE:  By ANITA GATES (Compiled with the assistance of SUZANNE O'CONNOR) 

 BODY:
 November

BESOTTED -- Holly Angell Hardman wrote, directed and stars in a fantasy about a sorceress who arrives in a Cape Cod fishing hamlet intending to cast love spells on the villagers. The ensemble cast includes Amy Wright, Liam Waite, Susan Gibney, Jim Chiros and Richard Cox. Opened Friday.

DAUGHTER FROM DANANG -- In 1975, when Operation Babylift transported Vietnamese and Amerasian children from Saigon to families in the United States, one little girl separated from her mother was Mai Thi Hiep. A little more than 20 years later, the filmmakers introduce Heidi Bub, a young wife and mother who lives in Pulaski, Tenn. She is Mai Thi Hiep, and she has decided to return to Vietnam to see her mother. It's not exactly the joyous reunion she'd hoped for. The filmmakers, Gail Dolgin and Vicente Franco, won the grand jury prize for documentaries at the Sundance Film Festival. Opened Friday.

I SPY -- It doesn't have much to do with the old television series with Bill Cosby and Robert Culp. But like their predecessors, Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson are a black man and a white man playing partners in espionage, and they use a similar cover story when they're making their clandestine international trips: Mr. Murphy is a professional boxer and Mr. Wilson poses as his agent. (Mr. Culp and Mr. Cosby were tennis champion and trainer.) Their assignment in this film is to find a missing stealth fighter. Betty Thomas, who's done a little of everything in the last few years ("28 Days," "The Brady Bunch Movie," "Dr. Dolittle"), directed. Opened Friday.

LOVE IN THE TIME OF MONEY -- "La Ronde" set in the 90's. Nine New Yorkers, including a prostitute, a bisexual art collector, a lovesick student and a lonely telephone psychic, are unknowingly linked -- despite supposed class barriers -- by love, business or both. The stars include Steve Buscemi, Jill Hennessy, Malcolm Gets, Carol Kane and Rosario Dawson. Written and directed by Peter Mattei, who was a writer for the children's series "Clarissa Explains It All." Opened Friday.

THE SANTA CLAUSE 2 -- Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) has been on the job as Santa for eight Christmases now, and he's doing a bang-up job, but this year his own son has turned up on the "naughty list." Not only that, but Scott has to marry soon. Action must be taken. In the process, there are lots of elves and general holiday magic. Eric Lloyd returns as Scott's son, Wendy Crewson as Scott's ex-wife and Judge Reinhold as her new husband. Michael Lembeck, who has not done a feature film before but directed on almost every sitcom in the 90's, directed. Opened Friday.

SANTA VS. THE SNOWMAN -- It's animated, it's 3-D and it's on giant Imax screens. John A. Davis, who did "Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius," directed this story of a lonely snowman who builds up a lot of resentment toward Santa Claus (voice of Jonathan Winters) and decides to do something about it. He declares war. But surely he'll learn some important lessons about self-esteem by the end. Ben Stein does the voice of the tour guide elf and Victoria Jackson the communications elf. Opened Friday.

TULLY -- Good brother, bad brother, imperfect dad. The theme of Hillary Birmingham's first film echoes films like "East of Eden," "A River Runs Through It" and "Hud." The older son, Tully, is played by Anson Mount, whom New York theatergoers may remember as Joshua, the Jesus figure, in Terrence McNally's much-talked-about "Corpus Christi." Bob Burrus plays the father; Glenn Fitzgerald is Earl, the shy brother; and Julianne Nicholson is Earl's friend. But Tully likes her too. Opened Friday.

THE WEIGHT OF WATER -- Josh Lucas has been pretty irresistible on screen lately (see his scenes with Reese Witherspoon in "Sweet Home Alabama"), and it's happening again in this parallel-centuries drama based on Anita Shreve's novel of the same name. A photographer (Catherine McCormack) and her husband (Sean Penn), a poet, travel to New Hampshire, where she's investigating a double ax murder from 1873. She begins to suspect that her husband is having an affair with the girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) of his brother (Mr. Lucas). Directed by Kathryn Bigelow, whose past work includes "Strange Days" and "K-19: The Widowmaker." Opened Friday.

FEMME FATALE -- Brian De Palma's latest is the story of a jewel thief (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who gives up her life of crime and reinvents herself as a respectable married lady. (Well, more than respectable. She's an ambassador's wife.) Then a former paparazzo (Antonio Banderas) blows her cover, which means it's time to move on to another identity. With Peter Coyote, Gregg Henry and Rie Rasmussen. Wednesday. A related article is on Page 13.

ONE GIRL AGAINST THE MAFIA -- An hourlong 1998 documentary about an Italian teenager who, after her father, a Mafioso, was killed, tossed aside the mob's code of silence and gave evidence to a judge. Directed by Marco Amenta. Shown with "Strange Fruit" (below). Wednesday.

SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER -- It has been 25 years since 23-year-old John Travolta strutted down the streets of Bay Ridge and instantly turned into the movie sex symbol of the disco era. There's a new print for this anniversary release, all the better to see those dance floor moves. The film was based on a New York magazine article by Nik Cohn about generally aimless young people whose lives revolved around Saturday nights at the club, which offered them their only chance for recognition. They do it all to the tune of Bee Gees songs like "How Deep Is Your Love?" With Karen Lynn Gorney and Donna Pescow. Directed by John Badham. Wednesday.

STRANGE FRUIT -- An hourlong film about the anti-lynching song that Billie Holiday made famous. Directed by Joel Katz. Shown with "One Girl Against the Mafia." Wednesday.

8 MILE -- Eminem makes his feature-film debut in just the sort of role you'd expect. He's a white teenager living on the poor side of Detroit with minimal prospects and hip-hop dreams. Kim Basinger plays his mother. The cast also includes Brittany Murphy, Mekhi Phifer, Eugene Byrd and Taryn Manning. Directed by Curtis Hanson, who's had some major successes in recent years ("Wonder Boys," "L.A. Confidential"). Friday.

ETOILES: DANCERS OF THE PARIS OPERA BALLET -- From Nils Tavernier (the 37-year-old son of Bertrand Tavernier), a backstage documentary about one corps de ballet. The film includes conversations with teachers, students, managers and stars; performance clips; and still photographs by Vincent Tessler. Variety called it "a touching group portrait of very dedicated, essentially lonely people." Friday.

FAR FROM HEAVEN -- The first time Todd Haynes directed Julianne Moore, they gave us "Safe" (1995), the story of a fragile California woman who seemed to be allergic to life. In this new film, Ms. Moore plays a buttoned-up 1950's Connecticut housewife whose husband is going through something he won't share with her. Ms. Moore won the best actress award for this role at the Venice International Film Festival last August. Dennis Quaid plays the troubled husband, and Dennis Haysbert is the gardener, to whom Ms. Moore's character turns for more than sympathy. The film is Mr. Haynes's tribute to Douglas Sirk, who did glamorous tear-jerkers like "Imitation of Life" and "Written on the Wind. Friday. A related article is on Page 22.

GOD IS GREAT, I'M NOT -- A romantic comedy starring Audrey Tautou, of "Amelie," as a fashion model looking for meaning in her life. She meets a nice Jewish man and decides she should convert to Judaism. Friday.

HUSH -- A contemporary Japanese comedy about a homosexual couple and the lonely young woman who tries to become a part of their lives. From the director Hashiguchi Ryosuke ("Like Grains of Sand"). Friday.

INTERVIEW WITH THE ASSASSIN -- Talk about a scoop. An unemployed news cameraman glimpses journalistic heaven when his older neighbor confesses that he has a secret: he was the gunman on the grassy knoll. Raymond J. Barry and Dylan Haggerty star. Neil Burger, whose resume until now consisted of a Yale degree and some one-minute spots for MTV, directed. Friday.

THE PHANTOM OF LIBERTY -- A new print of Luis Bunuel's outrageous 1974 collection of comedy vignettes, including one in which parents discuss their concern about their missing child, who is sitting right in front of them. Vincent Canby's review in The New York Times called the film brilliant, anarchic and "surrealism at its best." With Michel Piccoli, Monica Vitti and Jean-Claude Brialy. Friday.

THE RISING PLACE -- It's hard to decide which is the more dangerous idea for a young white woman in the Mississippi Delta in 1940 -- to have a soldier's child out of wedlock or to have a black best friend. Emily (Laurel Holloman) goes for broke and does both. The cast includes Elise Neal (as the best friend), Frances Fisher, Frances Sternhagen, Billy Campbell, S. Epatha Merkerson, Gary Cole, Alice Drummond and Tess Harper. Written and directed by Tom Rice. Friday.

ARARAT -- Charles Aznavour, Eric Bogosian, Christopher Plummer, Brent Carver and David Alpay in the story of an American family getting in touch with its Turkish past. The film within a film is a drama about the Armenian holocaust in the 1920's. Directed by Atom Egoyan, whose most recent works include "The Sweet Hereafter" and "Felicia's Journey." Nov. 15.

EL CRIMEN DEL PADRE AMARO -- Shades of "The Thorn Birds." In this drama, which has become the biggest box office hit in the history of Mexican film (not to mention the subject of serious controversy), a handsome, highly temptable young priest moves to a new post, encounters a teenage girl who develops a mad crush on him and soon has to admit the feeling is mutual. Then he's made aware of the power that the Roman Catholic Church can offer him. Gael Garcia Bernal ("Y Tu Mama Tambien") stars as the priest, with Ana Claudia Talancon as his love interest. Sancho Gracia plays an older priest who has drug connections and is having a longterm romantic affair of his own. Directed by Carlos Carrera. Nov. 15.

HALF PAST DEAD -- In Steven Seagal's newest action thriller, a criminal tries to get inside a prison rather than out of one. It seems a death row inmate buried about $200 million worth of gold on the inside. The cast also includes Ja Rule, Nia Peeples and Morris Chestnut. Directed by Don Michael Paul. Nov. 15.

HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS -- Last November, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" earned more than $90 million on its opening weekend. So naturally everyone is back for the second Potter movie. That includes the director, Chris Columbus; the screenwriter, Steven Kloves; and the distinguished cast headed by Richard Harris (who died Oct. 25), Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, the cutest school-age wizard in modern literature. There's a major new character, too: the Hogwarts school's new professor of defense against the dark arts (Kenneth Branagh). It's time for fall semester at Hogwarts, but someone doesn't want Harry to go back to school and has been keeping his friends' letters from him all summer. It is highly likely that new terrors await Harry and friends. Nov. 15.

HELL HOUSE -- For those who find standard Halloween behavior (pumpkin carving, trick or treat, dressing up like movie monsters and superheroes) too tame, there is George Ratliff's documentary about an unusual Pentecostal church in Texas. The church's annual haunted house doesn't bother with ghosts and witches and skeletons; it sets out to scare young people with the horrors of AIDS, abortion and school shootings. Nov. 15.

REVOLUTION NO. 9 -- A disturbed young man (Michael Risley) believes he's receiving messages from a commercial for a perfume called Rev 9. With Spalding Gray as a television director and Adrienne Shelly as the director's fiancee. Directed by Tim McCann, whose first film was "Desolation Angels," a drama about date-rape revenge. Nov. 15.

SINGIN' IN THE RAIN -- A half-century has passed since moviegoers first saw Gene Kelly ecstatically dancing down a Hollywood backlot version of a New York street in a downpour. The film is about a silent-movie studio in the 20's trying to make the transition to talkies. Debbie Reynolds, who was 20 at the time, is the aspiring, fresh-faced young actress who gets her big break. Kelly is her leading man, and Donald O'Connor is his partner and pal. Betty Comden and Adolph Green (who died Oct. 24) wrote the screenplay. Kelly and the great Stanley Donen were co-directors. There's a new print and the film is being screened in Dolby Digital Stereo for the first time. Nov. 15. A related article is on Page 11.

STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF MOTOWN -- All about the Funk Brothers. They may not be world famous, but they have reportedly been heard on more No. 1 records than any other group, including the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The Funks were sidemen to the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and other Motown stars. Paul Justman directed. Nov. 15.

THE WAY HOME -- From Korea, the story of an obnoxious 7-year-old boy (Yoo Seung Ho) from the city who's sent to live with his grandmother (Kim Eul Boon) in a village far from everything. He's disrespectful and selfish, he throws food, and he steals his grandmother's things to buy batteries for his Game Boy. But there's a good chance Granny will be able to turn him around. Lee Jeong Hyang, whose earlier films included "Art Museum by the Zoo" and "A Place for Eve," directed. Nov. 15.

THE BURNING WALL -- German politics and the role of dissidents worldwide in the 20th century. Hava Kohav Beller directed. Nov. 20.

GOOD HOUSEKEEPING -- The filmmakers are promoting this comic drama as "the white-trash 'War of the Roses.' " It's the story of Don (Bob Jay Mills), a downscale, beer-guzzling husband who collects action figures, and Donatella (Petra Western), his Italian immigrant wife, who is having a nervous breakdown. Even her lover (Tacey Adams) doesn't understand her. Things get really ugly when Don divides the house in two by building a wall. Frank Novak, a first-timer, directed. Nov. 20.

BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS -- Call it a cult film or the nightmare that won't go away for Roger Ebert, the film critic, who wrote the screenplay. There's no real connection between this 1970 film and "Valley of the Dolls" -- either the novel or the 1967 movie -- except that women become addicted to liquor, drugs and sex. This is the story of an all-women pop group who move to Hollywood for fame and find substance abuse. The film was directed by Russ Meyer, the soft-pornography mogul who also did "Vixen!," "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" and "Mondo Topless." Nov. 22.

DIE ANOTHER DAY -- Forty years have passed since James Bond, secret agent 007, made his first appearance on a movie screen. The actor was the innately debonair Sean Connery and the film was "Dr. No." This is already Pierce Brosnan's fourth outing as Bond, and all the usual elements are in place. The luckiest, for the filmmakers, is that this is Halle Berry's first film since she won the best actress Oscar for "Monster's Ball." It seems unlikely that this Bond girl will take a lot of guff. The villain is a megalomaniac environmentalist (Toby Stephens, who was in "Possession" and "Space Cowboys"). The primary glamorous locales are Korea, Hong Kong, England and Cuba. There's a high-speed hovercraft chase through a minefield in the DMZ. Directed by Lee Tamahori, the New Zealand-born filmmaker who did "Once Were Warriors." With Judi Dench, Rick Yune and John Cleese. Nov. 22.

THE EMPEROR'S CLUB -- Kevin Kline stars as a dedicated classics teacher at a boy's prep school. Emile Hirsch, of "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys," plays an arrogant United States senator's son who is trouble from the day he walks in. His influence turns his serious, well-behaved classmates into a herd of hooligans -- until the teacher finally gets through to him. This is a lot less like "Dead Poets Society" than it sounds. The film, based on Ethan Canin's short story "The Palace Thief" and directed by Michael Hoffman, is about the question of who molds a young person's character and whether some people are moldable at all. Edward Herrmann plays the headmaster and Rob Morrow is a fellow teacher with something up his sleeve. Nov. 22.

FRIDAY AFTER NEXT -- The sequel to "Friday" and "Next Friday" stars Ice Cube and Mike Epps. Marcus Raboy is the new director. Our heroes are back in the old neighborhood, working as security guards. It's Christmas, and a ghetto Santa steals all the presents. Nov. 22.

O FANTASMA -- A young trash collector in Lisbon with a varied sex life meets the macho motorcyclist of his dreams. The rest of the film is about his obsession with him. Joao Pedro Rodrigues is the first-time director. Nov. 22.

PERSONAL VELOCITY -- Rebecca Miller (daughter of Arthur Miller) directed and wrote this three-vignette film, based on her own short stories. All three heroines are trying to escape from controlling men in their lives. Kyra Sedgwick takes her three children and runs away from her abusive husband. Parker Posey is an adulterous cookbook editor. Fairuza Balk has a near-death experience and, on her way home to Mom, picks up a hitchhiker who's been beaten. The film won a cinematography award (for Ellen Kuras) at the Sundance Film Festival, a neat feat since it was done in digital video. Nov. 22.

POWER AND TERROR: NOAM CHOMSKY IN OUR TIMES -- America doesn't have many celebrity intellectuals, so Mr. Chomsky, 73, linguist, political philosopher and general dissident, certainly deserves a documentary. This one is based on a series of talks in California and New York last spring and a long interview at his office in Cambridge, Mass. If one particular message comes across, it is Mr. Chomsky's call for the United States not to operate with a double standard globally, to hold ourselves to the moral standards we demand in others and to a single definition of what constitutes terrorism. The film, produced in Japan, was directed by John Junkerman. Nov. 22.

THE QUIET AMERICAN -- They loved it at the Toronto Film Festival, but are most moviegoers in 2002 open to a drama with such unpleasant things to say about American foreign policy? Graham Greene's novel was published in 1955, just a few years after the French Indochinese War in which it was set. Joseph L. Mankiewicz made a 1958 film of it, with Audie Murphy and Michael Redgrave. Now Michael Caine takes on the role of the British journalist working in Saigon and Brendan Fraser plays the title role, a young idealist (but not innocent) abroad. Phillip Noyce, who must have felt like a change of pace after "The Bone Collector," directed. Nov. 22.

SMOKERS ONLY -- An Argentine film about a suicidal woman and a male prostitute who meet at an A.T.M. Cecilia Bengolea and Leonardo Brezicki star. Veronica Chen wrote and directed. Nov. 22.

TALK TO HER -- Elvis Mitchell, a New York Times film critic, could barely stop praising Pedro Almodovar's new picture when it was the closing-night feature at the New York Film Festival last month. Mr. Mitchell called it "a tragic comedy about need, its liberating and shackling power" and observed that everything in the film "falls into place with almost surreal delicacy." Two men meet at a clinic and become close friends, possibly because they are caring for their respective loves, both of whom are in comas. Nov. 22.

ADAM SANDLER'S EIGHT CRAZY NIGHTS -- Some people already think of Adam Sandler as a cartoon, so there's a certain logic to his doing an animated film. And he did write and perform "The Hannukah Song," so it seems appropriate that he has done what must be one of the few movies billed as a Hanukkah musical. Mr. Sandler does the voices of an elderly basketball coach and a marketing man for the New York Knicks, who strike up an unusual partnership. Other celebrity voices include those of Tyra Banks, Jon Lovitz, Kevin Nealon and Rob Schneider. Directed by Seth Kearsley, whose resume includes the animated sitcom "Dilbert." Nov. 27.

EXTREME OPS -- You never know what's going to happen when you fly off to a glamorous film shoot in the Austrian Alps. One group of daredevil extreme skiers accidentally photographs a Serbian war criminal (Klaus Lowitsch) hiding in the mountains, and he's not happy about it. Luckily the heroes are in excellent shape to ski and snowboard for their lives. The cast includes Devon Sawa, Bridgette Wilson-Sampras, Rupert Graves and Rufus Sewell. Directed by Christian Duguay, who did the 1999 television movie "Joan of Arc." Nov. 27.

SOLARIS -- George Clooney in outer space. Steven Soderbergh, who has been on a roll ("Ocean's Eleven," "Traffic," "Erin Brockovich") if you don't count the baffled reactions to "Full Frontal," wrote and directed this sci-fi drama about a space-station crew reacting strangely to a nearby planet. It is based on the novel by Stanislaw Lem, as was the 1972 film of the same name by Andrei Tarkovsky. Among other things, they're seeing dead people -- but usually dead people they like. Mr. Clooney's co-stars include Natascha McElhone and Jeremy Davies. Nov. 27.

TREASURE PLANET -- Disney in outer space. The studio turns Robert Louis Stevenson's classic novel "Treasure Island" into an animated film set on a spaceship. Jim Hawkins is still a cabin boy, but Long John Silver is a cyborg. The ship's adventures include encounters with supernovas and black holes. Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker. With the voices of Martin Short, David Hyde Pierce, Emma Thompson, Brian Murray and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Nov. 27.

WES CRAVEN PRESENTS: THEY -- When a movie starts out with a perfectly happy young woman like Julia (Laura Regan), something is sure to go seriously, quickly wrong. For Julia, it's the return of the night terrors she experienced as a child. Now they're back, other people are getting them and -- gasp! -- they could be real. Luckily, Julia is studying psychology. Ms. Regan's co-stars include Marc Blucas and Ethan Embry. The film was written by Brendan William Hood and directed by Robert Harmon. Wes who? Nov. 27.

DEAD OR ALIVE: FINAL -- The year is 2346, and in Yokohama humans and androids live peacefully side by side. But this is a dictatorship, and humans are forced to use birth control. Someone has to do something to bring down Woo (Richard Cheung), and luckily there are a couple of action heroes (Riki Takeuchi and Show Aikawa) available. Directed by the veteran filmmaker Takashi Miike. Nov. 29.

RABBIT-PROOF FENCE -- Phillip Noyce again, this time directing a drama based on a real program that was in effect in Australia for decades. Beginning in 1905, Aboriginal girls were taken from their homes and families in the outback, shipped to faraway Australian cities and trained to be servants. This is the story, based on Doris Pilkington Garimara's book, of three girls who fought back and set out to escape, walking the 1,500 miles home. Kenneth Branagh stars, along with Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan. The government-sanctioned kidnappings continued until 1971. Nov. 29.

INTERSTATE 60 -- Bob Gale's film, about two friends on a strange road trip, is a blend of comedy, drama and adventure with just a touch of sci-fi. The only problem is that the guys' chosen route, Interstate 60, doesn't exist. But it's rife with social symbolism. Gary Oldman, Kurt Russell, Michael J. Fox, Chris Cooper and James Marsden star. Mr. Gale, whose past films include "Back to the Future" and "Bordello of Blood," was, for years, Robert Zemeckis's writing partner. November.

December

MASSOUD, THE AFGHAN -- Ahmed Shah Massoud, a charming 48-year-old ex-architect who turned his attentions to politics and war, was the leader of the Northern Alliance, the Afghan opposition to the Taliban. He was assassinated, by killers masquerading as journalists, two days before Sept. 11, 2001. Christophe de Ponfilly, a French journalist, had been working on this biographical documentary for some 16 years. Dec. 4.

ADAPTATION -- Nothing makes most writers happier than writing about themselves. Charlie Kaufman is a successful screenwriter whose other new film is "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind." Susan Orlean is a successful author whose books include "The Orchid Thief," a nonfiction best seller. This film, which is about Mr. Kaufman's attempts to adapt Ms. Orlean's book for the screen, is written by Mr. Kaufman. Nicolas Cage stars as Mr. Kaufman (most writers also enjoy being played by movie stars) and the incomparable Meryl Streep as Ms. Orlean. It's probably an excellent sign that the director is Spike Jonze, who also directed Mr. Kaufman's "Being John Malkovich." Chris Cooper plays the book's title character. John Cusack, Catherine Keener and the director David O. Russell make appearances as themselves. Dec. 6.

ANALYZE THAT -- A lot has happened since Paul Vitti and Dr. Ben Sobel last met (three years ago, in "Analyze This"). Vitti (Robert De Niro), the mob boss, appears to have gone insane in Sing-Sing. He needs his old psychiatrist, Dr. Sobel (Billy Crystal), and the F.B.I. wouldn't mind if Sobel could tell them whether Vitti is faking it. So they release Vitti into Sobel's custody -- as patient and house guest. You can imagine how the good doctor's wife (Lisa Kudrow) feels about that. Harold Ramis is back as director, but his team of screenwriters for the original film included the playwright Kenneth Lonergan. This time Mr. Ramis and Peter Steinfeld did the honors. Dec. 6. A related article is on Page 3.

BLACKBOARDS -- This is a drama about two unemployed teachers traveling along the Iran-Iraq border, with blackboards strapped to their backs, hoping to find students. If the students can't pay, they'll accept food and shelter instead. Unfortunately, very few people are interested in learning to read or write. But the blackboards come in very handy as stretchers. Directed by Samira Makhmalbaf ("The Apple"), daughter of one of Iran's best-known directors, Mohsen Makhmalbaf ("Kandahar"). Dec. 6.

EMPIRE -- John Leguizamo stars as a drug dealer determined to go straight. So he leaves the South Bronx for Wall Street, but soon learns that his new career has its ugly side too. Directed by Franc. Reyes, a former musician and choreographer. Dec. 6.

EQUILIBRIUM -- Christian Bale and Emily Watson star in a futuristic drama set in a world where the penalty for emotion is death. The benefit of this is that there's no more war. The problem is that all things that might evoke emotion -- including art, music and poetry -- are forbidden. But one day the man in charge (Mr. Bale) misses his dose of Prozium, gets a taste of feelings and decides to change the world. With Angus MacFadyen and Taye Diggs. Written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, who was also a co-writer of "The Recruit." Dec. 6.

KAANTE -- A Hindi film inspired by Quentin Tarantino's "Reservoir Dogs" and made with an American crew. Amitabh Bachchan, the Paul Newman of Bollywood, stars as one of six complete strangers who team up to commit the perfect crime. When it turns out that one of the six is an undercover cop, things get ugly. The cast also includes Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Shetty and Kumar Gaurav. Sanjay Gupta directed. Dec. 6.

RUSSIAN ARK -- An unusual tour of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia, with a 19th-century diplomat as guide -- through the museum and through Russian and European history. The gimmick (or technological tour de force, depending on how you look at it) is that the whole thing was filmed in one uninterrupted shot. Alexander Sokurov directed. Dec. 6. A related article is on Page 6.

ABOUT SCHMIDT -- Maybe Jack Nicholson isn't the first actor you'd think of to play a retired, widowed insurance man from Omaha whose idea of a wild adventure is to get into the Winnebago and drive to his daughter's wedding. But Mr. Nicholson has pulled it off. When this drama had its premiere as the opening-night selection of the New York Film Festival in September, Stephen Holden, writing in The New York Times, called the role "this great actor's least flamboyant performance," one that expressed "a sorrowful awareness of human complexity whose emotional depth matches anything he has done in the movies before." This bittersweet film, based on a novel by Louis Begley, is directed by Alexander Payne, whose earlier, highly distinctive films were "Citizen Ruth" and "Election." Hope Davis plays Mr. Nicholson's daughter and Dermot Mulroney her fiance. Kathy Bates is the fiance's oversexed mother, who really enjoys her hot tub. Dec. 13.

EVELYN -- Desmond Doyle is nothing like James Bond. Pierce Brosnan plays Desmond, an Irish father of three whose cheating wife has just abandoned the whole family. Because Desmond is unemployed, his children are taken away from him, and this drama, set in the 1950's, is about his struggle to get them back. His co-stars include Alan Bates (as his lawyer), Julianna Margulies, Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea and Sophie Vavasseur (as the title character, Desmond's daughter). Directed by Bruce Beresford, who is best known for "Driving Miss Daisy" and "Breaker Morant." Dec. 13.

THE HOT CHICK -- The latest body-swapping comedy. A mean but popular high school girl -- the head cheerleader, in fact -- wakes up in the body of a 30-year-old man (Rob Schneider). Chances are she'll learn to be kinder to her fellow humans. With Anna Faris, Matthew Lawrence, Rachel McAdams and Eric Christian Olsen. Mr. Schneider's most recent starring roles were in "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo" and "The Animal." Directed by Tom Brady, who directed "The Animal" and has a real guy's-guy TV resume ("Men Behaving Badly," "Home Improvement," "Sports Night"). Dec. 13.

INTACTO -- Some people have all the luck. And in the world of this Spanish thriller directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, that's literally true. Which wouldn't be so terrible except, as it turns out, the lucky ones stay that way by stealing other people's good fortune. Finally one of the hard-luck cases decides to fight back and chooses as his target a man who just survived a plane crash in which everybody else died. The imposing Max von Sydow stars, with Leonardo Sbaraglia and Eusebio Poncela. Dec. 13.

MAID IN MANHATTAN -- Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez in a romance that's part "My Fair Lady," part "Pretty Woman." He's a golden-boy politician staying at a very nice hotel. She's a maid at the hotel, a single mom from the Bronx, but he mistakes her for a rich guest and asks her out. This relationship can't go beyond tonight, she tells him. He gives her that sexy Fiennes smile and explains, "Then you should have worn a different dress." Wayne Wang ("Smoke," "The Joy Luck Club," "Anywhere but Here") directed. Dec. 13. A related article is on Page 1.

STAR TREK NEMESIS -- Data, the android, has a twin and Captain Picard, the human, has a clone, which needs his blood. The cast of television's "Star Trek: The Next Generation" is together again, for the fourth time on the big screen, on a diplomatic mission to the Romulans' planet. Earth is on the verge of being destroyed, but then isn't it always? With Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden and Marina Sirtis. Directed by Stuart Baird, who began his career as an editor on films like "Superman," "Maverick," "Lethal Weapon" and "Tommy." Dec. 13.

DEVILS ON THE DOORSTEP -- A wartime comedy about two Japanese prisoners in a tiny Chinese village. Directed by Jiang Wen, who also did "In the Heat of the Sun." Dec. 18.

THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS -- Back to Middle-earth, for the second film of Peter Jackson's Tolkien trilogy. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still on the road to Mordor, on their way to destroy the one true ring. It goes without saying that the whole cast is back, because Mr. Jackson just went ahead and made all three films at once. It was a bit of a risk, but the first part, "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings," made a bundle of money, and this one probably will too. With Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Cate Blanchett as queen of the elves. Dec. 18.

ANTWONE FISHER -- It's the sort of thing you wouldn't believe if you saw it in a TV movie. A security guard who works at a movie studio writes a screenplay and asks a big star to look at it. And the movie actually gets made. It happened to Antwone Fisher with a screenplay about his past as a sailor with a violence problem trying to overcome a brutal childhood. Denzel Washington directed the film and appears in it. Mr. Fisher is played by Derek Luke. Dec. 20. A related article is on Page 13.

GANGS OF NEW YORK -- Leonardo DiCaprio, directed by Martin Scorsese. Mr. DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, a hoodlum in mid-19th-century New York. And that was not a tranquil time: the usual corruption and turmoil were stirred further by war. (Historians say the 1863 Civil War draft riots were the largest uprising in the city's history.) Vallon is fresh out of prison and eager to get even with his father's killer, Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis). This all takes place in Five Points, the city's most dangerous neighborhood at the time. The screenwriting team is first-rate: Steven Zaillian, Kenneth Lonergan and Jay Cocks. The cast also includes Cameron Diaz, John C. Reilly and Jim Broadbent (as Boss Tweed). Moviegoers have been waiting for this one a long time, and Miramax rescheduled it again recently to avoid conflict with Mr. DiCaprio's other holiday film, DreamWorks' "Catch Me if You Can." Dec. 20.

MORVERN CALLAR -- It all starts when a supermarket clerk (Samantha Morton) wakes up Christmas morning to find that her boyfriend has committed suicide. Showing resiliency and a talent for opportunism, she takes his A.T.M. card and his unpublished novel (after putting her name on it) and goes to Spain. It's a drama from the young Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay, known for her film "Ratcatcher," about coming of age during a garbage strike in Glasgow. Ms. Ramsay has also won two jury prizes at Cannes for her short films. Dec. 20.

NARC -- When it was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in January, Elvis Mitchell, writing in The New York Times, described it as a compelling police thriller with "the velocity of a hot slug from the barrel of a gun." The film, written and directed by Joe Carnahan ("Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane"), is heavily influenced by Quentin Tarantino, particularly his "Reservoir Dogs." Ray Liotta stars as a cop investigating his ex-partner's death, and Jason Patric is a suspended narcotics officer. With Busta Rhymes and Chi McBride. Dec. 20.

THE 25TH HOUR -- Spike Lee's latest stars Edward Norton as a drug dealer during his last two days of freedom before going to prison for seven years. Mr. Lee's last feature film was about a modern-day minstrel show ("Bamboozled"). With Philip Seymour Hoffman, Rosario Dawson and Anna Paquin. Based on a novel by the screenwriter, David Benioff. Dec. 20.

TWO WEEKS NOTICE -- Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock in a romantic comedy is a screen partnership that has to be given a try. It could be a delightful trip back to 1930's screwball comedy. Or a visit to perkiness hell. Mr. Grant plays a multimillionaire and Ms. Bullock is his lawyer, but he's so helpless he asks her to pick out his neckties. Finally she's had enough and quits, but agrees to find her replacement (Alicia Witt, who was the younger daughter on the sitcom "Cybill"). Mark Feuerstein is Ms. Bullock's character's boyfriend. Written and directed by Marc Lawrence, whose last two screenplays were less than stellar ("Miss Congeniality" and the Steve Martin-Goldie Hawn remake of "The Out-of-Towners"). This is Mr. Lawrence's directorial debut. Dec. 20. A related article is on Page 14.

THE WILD THORNBERRYS MOVIE -- Eliza Thornberry, an animated 12-year-old who can talk to and understand animals, has been the star of her own Nickelodeon series since 1998. This is her first big-screen appearance, although "Rugrats Meets the Thornberrys" is already scheduled for 2003. Eliza (the voice of Lacey Chabert from "Party of Five"); her parents, who are nature-documentary filmmakers; and her best friend, Darwin the chimpanzee, have to deal with poachers in the African jungle. Other celebrity voices include those of Rupert Everett, Marisa Tomei, Tim Curry, Brenda Blethyn, Lynn Redgrave and Obba Babatunde. Directed by Jeff McGrath and Cathy Malkasian. Dec. 20.

BLIND SPOT: HITLER'S SECRETARY -- It isn't every day you hear from someone who was with Hitler in his bunker at the end. In 1942, Traudl Junge was a young German woman looking for work when she was offered employment as one of the Fuhrer's secretaries. She was just too curious to refuse, she tells this documentary's directors, Andre Heller and Othmar Schmiderer. When the film was shown at the New York Film Festival this year, no one mistook it for a technical marvel, but critics acknowledged its enormous power. Elvis Mitchell, writing in The New York Times, said that its strength was Ms. Junge's "plain-spoken quality about being so close to ultimate evil." And it's true, she says, that Hitler was crazy about his dog. (Ms. Junge died earlier this year at 82 after a long battle with cancer.) Dec. 25.

CATCH ME IF YOU CAN -- Steven Spielberg directs Leonardo DiCaprio. And it's a true story about a remarkable con man. If you had seen Frank Abagnale Jr. at an airport back in the Sinatra-Playboy-swinging-bachelor days, handsome and authoritative in his pilot's uniform, surrounded by pretty young flight attendants, you might have felt a pang of envy. But Mr. Abagnale wasn't a pilot. He wasn't a doctor either, or a college professor, but he managed to pass himself off in both those professions, too, while writing $2.5 million worth of bad checks. Actually, Frank was a high school student. Tom Hanks is the F.B.I. agent determined to apprehend him. Christopher Walken is Frank's supportive father. The real Mr. Abagnale recently wrote his second book. Dec. 25.

THE LION KING -- Same lions, same story, bigger screen. When this Disney animated film had its premiere in 1994, Janet Maslin, writing in The New York Times, described it as "visually enchanting." She also wrote that it had "the feeling of a clever, predictable product." Well, it sold. Now the story of a royal lion cub who runs away from his homeland after his father's death is being released in a large-screen format. With the voices of James Earl Jones (the king), Jeremy Irons (the king's evil brother), Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Matthew Broderick (Simba, the heir apparent), Nathan Lane as a smart-aleck meerkat and Ernie Sabella as the warthog. Dec. 25.

PINOCCHIO -- Four years have passed since American moviegoers discovered Roberto Benigni in his Oscar-winning film, "Life Is Beautiful," a comedy about a World War II death camp. Now he turns to a less sensitive subject, Carlo Collodi's fairy tale about the little wooden puppet who longs to become a real boy. The problem is that Pinocchio is a chronic liar and falls in with bad companions (donkey boys). Mr. Benigni directed, wrote the script (with Vincenzo Cerami) and stars as Pinocchio. (He cast adults in all the other children's roles, just for balance.) Carlo Giuffre plays Geppetto, the lonely old puppet maker who would love to be a single dad. Nicoletta Braschi, Mr. Benigni's wife (and his co-star in "Life Is Beautiful"), plays the Blue Fairy. We can only hope she'll come through earlier than she did for Haley Joel Osment in "A.I." Dec. 25. A related article is on Page 3.

CHICAGO -- So Bebe Neuwirth and Ann Reinking aren't good enough for Hollywood? They knocked the socks off the theater critics and audiences six years ago in the Broadway revival of the deliciously dark Kander and Ebb musical about women behind bars and the tabloids that write about them. Now Catherine Zeta-Jones is Velma Kelley and Renee Zellweger is Roxie Hart, murderers competing for all that tabloid publicity. James Naughton's role as Billy Flynn, a slick lawyer who knows a thing or two about razzle-dazzle, has gone to Richard Gere. Queen Latifah plays the gruff prison matron, John C. Reilly is Roxie's meek husband and Christine Baranski is the newspaperwoman Mary Sunshine (a role played onstage by a large man in drag). Rob Marshall, who did the inspired 1999 television version of "Annie," directed. Dec 27.

CONFESSIONS OF A DANGEROUS MIND -- The bizarre story of Chuck Barris, former producer of "The Dating Game" and producer and host of "The Gong Show." Sam Rockwell plays Mr. Barris, who declared in a 1984 memoir that he had lived a double life as a C.I.A. agent. George Clooney makes his directorial debut and also plays a C.I.A. recruiter. With Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts. Written by Charlie Kaufman. Dec. 27.

THE HOURS -- Finally, Michael Cunningham's breathtaking Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about Virginia Woolf and two women who identify with her comes to the screen. Meryl Streep stars as a contemporary New Yorker watching a close friend (Ed Harris) die of AIDS, Julianne Moore is a 1950's wife and mother who isn't sure she's in the right job, and Nicole Kidman is Woolf herself, working on her novel "Mrs. Dalloway." Stephen Daldry, who did 'Billy Elliot," directed. The screenplay is by the playwright David Hare. The cast also includes Claire Danes, Toni Collette, Jeff Daniels, Stephen Dillane, Eileen Atkins, Allison Janney, Miranda Richardson and John C. Reilly. Dec. 27. A related article is on Page 1.

MAX -- Max Rothman (John Cusack) was an artist before the Great War. Now, in 1918, he's back in Munich and he has lost an arm, so he has to devise a new career. At a gallery he opens, he meets another aspiring artist suffering from what-do-I-do-with-my-life anxiety. His name is Adolf Hitler, and he's played by Noah Taylor, who made such an impression six years ago as the young David Helfgott in "Shine." The brave director, daring to suggest that Hitler may not have always been a complete monster, is Menno Meyjes, the Dutch screenwriter who wrote "The Color Purple." Molly Parker plays the title character's wife; Leelee Sobieski is his mistress. Dec. 27.

NICHOLAS NICKLEBY -- Douglas McGrath, who gave us the elegant 1996 film of Jane Austen's "Emma," with Gwyneth Paltrow, turns his attentions to Dickens. The title character (Charlie Hunnam, currently stalking Katie Holmes in Stephen Gaghan's "Abandon") is a boy forced into reduced circumstances after his father's death. His mother takes the family to London to seek help, but Nicholas is sent away to Dotheboys Hall, a school that's more like a prison run by Wackford Squeers (Jim Broadbent), a headmaster who's more like a warden. Luckily, Nicholas finds a friend. The impressive supporting cast includes Christopher Plummer, Jamie Bell, Tom Courtenay, Timothy Spall, Anne Hathaway, Nathan Lane, Barry Humphries (in Dame Edna mode) and Alan Cumming. Dec. 27.

THE PIANIST -- Roman Polanski is back in a big way. He returned to his native Poland to make this very personal Holocaust drama, and it won the top prize, the Palme d'Or, at the Cannes Film Festival this year. He has already called it "the most important film in my career." Adrien Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a musician who managed to survive World War II by hiding in and around the Warsaw ghetto. Mr. Polanski himself escaped the Kracow ghetto at the age of 7. Ronald Harwood ("One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich") wrote the screenplay, based on Szpilman's book. With Thomas Kretschmann, Frank Finlay and Maureen Lipman. Dec. 27. A related article is on Page 6.

SONNY -- Nicolas Cage makes his directorial debut in a drama set in 1980's New Orleans. James Franco (who was so great at playing James Dean on TNT that he may be typecast forever) stars as a young man home after his military service and determined not to fall back into his old life. That consisted of being the star attraction at his mother's brothel. With Brenda Blethyn, Harry Dean Stanton and Mena Suvari. Dec. 27.

LOVE, LIZA -- Gordy Hoffman wrote this screenplay for Philip Seymour Hoffman, his brother, and it won the Waldo Salt screenwriting award at the Sundance Film Festival. Mr. Hoffman, the actor, stars as a man whose wife has committed suicide; he deals with it by developing an addiction to sniffing gasoline. He turns to his mother-in-law (Kathy Bates) for support, but nothing can make him open and read his wife's suicide note. Directed by Todd Louiso. Dec. 30.

January

BLUE COLLAR COMEDY TOUR -- Jeff Foxworthy, who made his name by telling audiences "You might be a redneck if" you had certain habits, like putting the new television set on top of the old one, is probably the best-known comedian in this concert film. Other working-class stand-ups on the tour include Bill Engvall, Ron White and Larry the Cable Guy. C. B. Harding directed. Jan. 10.

DRUMLINE -- Nick Cannon, who has his own Nickelodeon television series, stars as a Harlem drummer who finds himself in a marching band at a Southern university. With Orlando Jones as his teacher and Zoe Saldana as his girlfriend. Charles Stone directed. Jan. 10.

P.S. YOUR CAT IS DEAD -- It's about time somebody made a film of James Kirkwood's very black comedy about a man whose life is falling apart. His career is crashing, his girlfriend is leaving him, his cat is in the hospital and he's alone on New Year's Eve. Then a gay burglar pays a visit. Steve Guttenberg directed and stars as the unlucky protagonist. Lombardo Boyar, a newcomer, plays the burglar. The cast also includes Shirley Knight, Tom Wright, Cynthia Watros and A. J. Benza. The novel was published in 1972 and turned into a play that ran both on and off Broadway. Kirkwood died in 1989, best known at that point for having been co-writer of the book for "A Chorus Line." Jan. 10.

THE SETTLERS -- From Israel, a documentary about seven Jewish families in Tel Rumeida, a hillside settlement in Hebron. Mostly they go about their daily lives, trying to pretend their Arab neighbors aren't really there and trying to ignore the military presence that is all around them. Directed by Ruth Walk. Jan. 15.

CITY OF GOD -- This drama was a huge hit in Brazil when it opened in late summer. It's the story of two boys growing up in the dangerous Ciudade de Deus housing project in Rio de Janeiro. One overcomes his background and becomes a photographer. The other doesn't and becomes a drug dealer. With Matheus Nachtergaele, Alexandre Rodrigues and Seu Jorge. Directed by Katia Lund and Fernando Meirelles. Jan. 17.

DIVINE INTERVENTION -- Israeli soldiers doing Busby Berkeley dance routines? A Palestinian turning herself into Wonder Woman? Elia Suleiman's unexpected comedy about the struggle in the occupied territories offers those sights and other examples of absurdity and surrealism in the middle of bitter reality. It won the jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Jan. 17.

A GUY THING -- Let's say an engaged young man (Jason Lee) wakes up the morning after his bachelor party to find himself in bed with a beautiful stranger (Julia Stiles). Well, he vaguely remembers she was one of the party's dancing girls, wearing a grass skirt and a floral-lei bra. She also turns out to be the cousin of his fiancee (Selma Blair). His desperate attempts to keep the secret (although, as the audience learns, "nothing happened") constitute the plot of this romantic comedy, directed by Chris Koch, who did the egregious "Snow Day." One of the screenwriters is Greg Glienna, who was a co-writer of "Meet the Parents." With James Brolin and Julie Hagerty. Jan. 17.

KANGAROO JACK -- Two Brooklyn pals take on the job of delivering some mob money to Australia. Unfortunately a kangaroo runs away with it. Jerry O'Connell and Anthony Anderson star as the inept deliverymen; David McNally directed. The cast also includes Christopher Walken and Dyan Cannon. Jan. 17.

KIRA'S REASON: A LOVE STORY -- When this Danish film was shown at the New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art earlier this year, Stephen Holden, writing in The New York Times, called it "a disturbing, somewhat repellent portrait" of an unhappy young wife who suffers from extreme mood swings. Kira (Stine Stengade) comes home after a stay at a mental institution early in the film, and she and her husband (Lars Mikkelsen), a successful builder, try to reconstruct their life. Directed by Ole Christian Madsen. Jan. 17.

NATIONAL SECURITY -- Martin Lawrence plays a hostile security guard and Steve Zahn plays a cop who's done him wrong. Directed by Dennis Dugan, who did "Happy Gilmore," "Big Daddy" and "Saving Silverman." Jan. 17.

SIN EATER -- Heath Ledger as a conflicted young priest who travels to Rome to investigate the death of his mentor. The strange thing is that the body was covered in arcane religious symbols. The likeliest suspect is a "sin eater," an ancient figure who absolves unforgivable sins, killing the sinner in the process and handily allowing great evil to go unpunished. (That would explain a lot.) Written and directed by Brian Helgeland, a co-writer of "L.A. Confidential," who also directed Mr. Ledger in "A Knight's Tale." With Mark Addy, Shannyn Sossamon (who was also in "A Knight's Tale") and Peter Weller. Jan 17. A related article is on Page 14.

CHAOS -- Coline Serreau, who directed the original, Cesar-winning "Three Men and a Cradle," gives us a mix of melodrama and screwball comedy. Catherine Frot and Vincent Lindon play a Parisian couple who, on their way to a dinner party, see a young prostitute (Rachida Brakni) being beaten by three men. When the men actually smash the young woman's face into the couple's windshield, the husband rolls up the windows and drives away. The wife, who doesn't think that was very nice, locates the prostitute, nurses her back to health and re-evaluates her own life. Meanwhile, back home, both the husband and their teenage son (Aurelien Wiik) are behaving badly. In France, the film made an overnight star of Ms. Brakni, 25, who won the Cesar for best young actress. Jan 29.

GARAGE DAYS -- The hopes and dreams of a garage band in Australia. With Kick Gurry and Maya Stange. Directed by Alex Proyas, who has gone for darker topics in the past ("The Crow," for instance). Jan. 29.

I'LL BE THERE -- A burned-out 80's rock star gets a chance for a fresh start when he learns he has a teenage daughter from a long-ago fling. The musician is played by Craig Ferguson, who also directed. The daughter is played by Charlotte Church (yes, the young soprano). Jan. 31.

LAWLESS HEART -- A gay restaurateur's death affects a whole circle of people. Bill Nighy and Douglas Henshall star. Written and directed by Neil Hunter and Tom Hunsinger, whose first film project was "Boyfriends," about seven gay men on a weekend at the beach. Jan. 31.

LOST IN LA MANCHA -- This probably would have been just another "Making of" documentary -- if Terry Gilliam's $32 million "Adventures of Don Quixote," with Johnny Depp as the windmill-tilting protagonist, had ever made it to the screen. Instead the production, based in Madrid, was one of those ill-fated projects in which everything went wrong, from interpersonal relationships to the weather. Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe directed. Their previous collaboration, also about the making of a Gilliam film, was "The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of 12 Monkeys." Jan. 31.

THE RECRUIT -- Colin Farrell as a C.I.A. agent whose mentor (Al Pacino) tells him there is a mole in the agency and assigns him the job of discovering who it is. Directed by Roger Donaldson, who did "Thirteen Days" and "No Way Out." Jan. 31.

AMEN -- Costa-Gavras's first film in five years is the story of German Christians' efforts to expose Hitler and his "final solution" genocide. The film focuses on one real man, Kurt Gerstein (played by Ulrich Tukur), a chemist who is horrified to learn that the gas he helped create as a disinfectant is being put to more sinister use. Mathieu Kassovitz plays a fictional Jesuit who lends a helping hand. Pope Pius XII does not come off well here. Mr. Costa-Gavras, who directed "Z" and "Missing," is not one for avoiding difficult political issues. January.

BETTER LUCK TOMORROW -- Ben and Virgil have a real scam going. They're honor students and model teenagers, so their parents reward them with total freedom, and maybe they shouldn't. Parry Shen and Jason Tobin play the bright but far from perfect young men in this dark suburban coming-of-age comedy. Directed by Justin Lin, whose first film was "Shopping for Fangs," the story of a budding werewolf. With Sung Kang, Roger Fan, John Cho and Karin Anna Cheung. January.

BIKER BOYZ -- The milieu is the world of underground motorcycle clubs. Laurence Fishburne stars as Smoke, an undefeated racer. Derek Luke, who also plays the title role in "The Antwone Fisher Story," plays the prodigy who could end Smoke's string of championships. With Eriq La Salle, Kid Rock, Kadeem Hardison and Lisa Bonet. January.

COWBOY BEBOP: THE MOVIE -- Mars in the year 2071, and the outer-space bounty hunters Spike Siegel and Jet Black are on the job. They're looking for the bad guys responsible for a huge tanker explosion, partly because there's an equally huge reward. These are the animated lead characters of "Cowboy Bebop," a Japanese anime series on the Cartoon Network, where it's scheduled at night for grown-up viewers. It's a little bit western, a little bit samurai and a little bit "Jetsons" all at the same time. Directed by Shinichiro Watanabe. January.

All dates are subject to change.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
An Enduring Elitist and His Popular Museum

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
HIS image is a cliche by now: the sonorous, accented baritone on the audioguides, the imperial director in the impeccable suits. The Sun King of Fifth Avenue. He has occasionally felt compelled to make disparaging remarks about contemporary art, increasing the reactionary image. The other day I heard a grumpy art history professor in Illinois, a self-described child of the 1960's, call from the stage of a lecture hall for a weekly denouncement of him and his museum in the press.
 At least people still care. 
 At 66, Philippe de Montebello is celebrating his 25th anniversary as director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- probably the longest tenure by any major American museum director -- having taken over from Thomas Hoving. Mr. Hoving the populist, Mr. de Montebello the elitist. That's the familiar chestnut, even though the label of staunch conservative attached to the latter is a bit misleading.
The cover story of a recent Harvard Magazine cited Paul Sachs, the legendary Harvard museum director and teacher, who almost a century ago predicted "ideological dilemmas" that every American director today knows about. "Entitlement versus access," Sachs said, "excellence versus equality, private revelation versus public instruction." 
You could put this more simply: people can agree about two things when it comes to art museums now, that they're popular, notwithstanding post-9/11 blues, and that they are suffering an identity crisis.
Their popularity has come at the cost of obscuring, or at least complicating, their fundamental mission. As J. Carter Brown, the former director of the National Gallery in Washington, put it shortly before he died this summer, museums "are hugged so tight by the great bear of the public that they are gasping for breath."
They're elitist to some. They're shopping malls to others. They should reach out more. They pander. It depends on whom you ask. It used to be that everyone simply regarded them as places to see art. That was enough. Plenty, in fact. Now, as an American Association of Museums report some years ago dictated, they must "help nurture a humane citizenry equipped to make informed choices in a democracy and to address the challenges and opportunities of an increasingly global society."
Mr. de Montebello has been around long enough to have seen the former museum era give way to the present one. In the process, he has become a de facto standard bearer for traditional values and a lightning rod within the rarefied confines of art professionals and academics. Partly the lightning rod role is a result of his public manner, which puts some people off. Partly it is that everybody who cares about art cares about the Met, which is embodied by Mr. de Montebello. But it's also that he says, straight out, what museums can and can't do, which other directors often won't. 
A director's job today is not what it used to be. The quaint age of gentlemen collectors like Sachs inviting aspiring connoisseurs to his home to fondle Trecento ivories and Persian miniatures so that they, too, might become museum directors, are gone. Fund-raising, politicking, administration and construction are areas of expertise that directors must master now: many museum directors spend more time with contractors, publicists and accountants than with artists and sometimes even with their own curators. They must market the commodity of the art museum. Museums, created to save great art -- as institutions of permanence -- having now joined themselves to the broader entertainment business, are beholden economically to the cult of novelty: new buildings, new exhibitions, whatever will attract the attention of new audiences. These are the priorities.
"One should be practical and not too pious," Mr. de Montebello cautioned a conference of art historians several years ago. "Commercialism and development activities do help pay the bills." But museums that merely market themselves as another brand of entertainment, like movies or baseball games, are committing virtual suicide, he said. "In an increasingly prosaic and materialistic world where the factitious holds sway, especially with the growth of the new electronic media, it is the mystery, the wonder, the presence of the real that is our singular distinction and that we should proudly, joyfully proclaim." 
The museum exists to provide an experience unlike any other in life, Mr. de Montebello thereby reminded his colleagues; it exists to give people something they can't get elsewhere. Of course art is elitist. The glory of the art museum is that anyone who walks through the door becomes an elitist, too. Museums don't make people into better citizens. Hermann Goring was a connoisseur. Museums show people what beauty looks like -- or what tastemakers at a given moment decide is beautiful -- and through this encounter, people may or may not gain a larger, more humane view of civilization.
But pragmatism, even more than ideology, is the crux of Mr. de Montebello's approach, and pragmatism, for an administrator of a large cultural institution, is never as straightforward as it may sound. For one thing, it entails diplomacy. Several times a year, curators at the Met meet, as they've been doing since Mr. Hoving was director. Back then, the idea was strength in numbers. It was them against him.
Nowadays, Mr. de Montebello is occasionally asked to these meetings. If you want to see how the atmosphere has changed inside the museum, administratively, since he took over, that obscure little detail is not a bad place to look. Curators seem to trust him. Trustees trust him. He has learned to defer to experts who know more than he does about art -- and when to defer -- which he did not always know how to do gracefully when he began. 
Hoving was publicly a populist, privately autocratic. Mr. de Montebello is closer to the reverse. Everyone languished in Mr. Hoving's shadow. He made the Met over in his own outsize image, transforming a sleepy giant into a rich public spectacle, sometimes thrilling, often exasperating, richocheting from crisis to crisis, permanently in turmoil, frequently in the headlines. Art museums in the United States lurched into the modern era thanks significantly to him -- they became mass entertainment palaces, targets of social, civic and racial debate.
And not incidentally, the Met also bought some great art, an activity that Mr. Hoving treated almost as sport. He was a big game hunter, bagging a Velazquez. But Mr. de Montebello has pushed many of Mr. Hoving's ideas forward more forcefully than Mr. Hoving ever dreamed of. This is the paradox of his supposed conservatism. But he has done so without the chaos and distress, by changing the operational ethos within the Met to match more closely his own personality: a little hoity-toity on the outside, but more adaptable in private.
Under him, the museum -- its collections, particularly of Asian and modern art, its galleries, its exhibition schedule, its attendance, its shops, educational programs, conservation studios and endowment, not to mention all the things that go along with running an increasingly vast institution, meaning the teams of lawyers, publicists, fund-raisers and volunteers -- everything has grown, to a point where Mr. de Montebello now sometimes wonders aloud, and with reason, whether the place has become too big.
There have been bad shows along the way, some of them done to pay the bills; and much of the renovation and expansion of the building has been disappointing, banal, even shoddy. That is Mr. de Montebello's most significant failure. His exhibitions of contemporary art have been few and clearly an afterthought, which might be acceptable in a city with so many other museums devoted to what's new, except that it is a lost opportunity to mix new and old in a way that only the Met could do. This relative neglect of the new is also a sign of indifference toward the museum's important, devoted audience of artists, for many of whom the place is almost like a second home.
But at the same time the museum has stuck pretty well to the core principle that art museums, as opposed to universities or department stores or history museums, present and preserve great art -- that's their job. They have a mission that is special and inseparable from the dispensing of aesthetic pleasure. Other museums sometimes forget this or feel obliged to adapt themselves to outside pressures with other interests. Money has given the Met the ability to be independent, and to his credit, Mr. de Montebello does not confuse independence with personal privilege.
Take modern art, again. The department, under its chairman, William S. Lieberman, is knocked regularly not just for its contemporary shows but also for its oddball acquisitions and warren of architecturally infelicitous galleries. But Mr. de Montebello's private antipathy for much modernism notwithstanding, he has made sure that the Met has accumulated a collection of art into the 1950's, anyway, that is excellent, through major donations that Mr. Lieberman has tirelessly cultivated. Someday, should someone separate wheat from chaff, the strengths of this collection will become more obvious.
"It's not my field, but I do try to follow modern art, strangely enough," Mr. de Montebello says. "I acquired Bill Lieberman to acquire the collections. I'm a very institutional person at heart. I believe in the Met as a great encyclopedia. So it's irrelevant whether something is to my taste. Modern art was an institutional gap. It would be foolish not to collect it." 
The other day, when asked to define his own legacy, Mr. de Montebello drummed his fingers on his desk. "I calmed the storm," he said. After Mr. Hoving, he explained, that was his challenge. "Putting in the right structures, staffing, healing the rift between staff and administration," he continued, as if he were a middle manager of a division of a widget company. "That's what I'm most proud of. I've been pretty good at avoiding public crises. I've done more shows in one year than Tom ever dreamed of doing. I've surprised myself how enterprising I have been, which I don't think would have been the case if he had not opened the door for me.
"If I had succeeded his predecessor, Jim Rorimer, I would probably have been more like Rorimer. He was a micromanager. You couldn't paint a wall without his approval. He directed a museum half the size of the one I direct today."
Mr. de Montebello's accomplishment, you might say, has been to combine Rorimer's circumspection with Mr. Hoving's open-door expansionism, providing a useful model for museum directors today who feel pressure to broaden their programs but not lose touch with what museums traditionally do best. 
"Change is a commodity I believe art museums should use with the utmost circumspection" is how Mr. Montebello puts it. The result, and despite the museum's inevitable, obvious flaws, is that he has been in charge of one of the few reliable cultural monuments of global reach.
He now plans to stay at least another four years, he hopes through the completion of the renovations to the Greek and Roman galleries, the construction of a new restaurant and other changes to the building. After that, he'll be 70 and see whether the trustees still want him. Comfortable in the job, he has no desire to give it up now, and perhaps he knows that whoever succeeds him will not have the authority or experience to stand up to the challenges of commercialization and compromise that threaten every other museum director in America and can only increase at the Met. Apres lui, le deluge, perhaps. 
Meanwhile, he says: "Either you become more autocratic or you relax. I'm much less imperious now. I know pretty much what I'm doing. I have nothing to prove to my staff anymore. That's the virtue of longevity."

HEADLINE: What Saved Collingswood? Teamwork 

BYLINE:  By DEBRA NUSSBAUM 

DATELINE: COLLINGSWOOD 

 BODY:
IT'S Saturday night and Haddon Avenue, the main drag is this South Jersey town, is hopping. The line of customers is out the door waiting for tables at Tortilla Press. Over at Purple Iris, shoppers are browsing through bins of pricey garden tools and lawn decorations. A younger and hipper crowd wanders into Grooveground to listen to a band and sip espresso.
 Only five or six years ago, it was a very different scene in Collingswood, a town of 14,000 wedged in between impoverished Camden and affluent Haddonfield. The downtown area was declining, losing a battle with the shopping malls, with as many as 30 to 40 percent of storefronts vacant. The best restaurant in town was a tiny luncheonette, and thrift stores were the most common enterprises. One of the most prominent structures in town was the old brick Collingswood elementary school, a boarded-up eyesore. 
 Now, though, there are no unoccupied spaces for rent downtown. The school, its windows restored, has been reborn as the home of Kitchen & Associates Architectural Services. Thirty new businesses opened in the town last year, and 15 more will open by the end of this year. Residential real estate values have recovered, too, and this little town is once again a desirable place to live. Mayor James Maley Jr. is fielding phone calls from more businesses that want to move in and from other Jersey towns that want to copy the Collingswood success story.
That story concerns one dying town that managed to recover from a bad case of the blahs and inject new life into its commercial district.
How did it happen?
Mayor Maley's summation of the story sounds much like a line from a hit movie of a few years ago.
"If you get good stores and businesses, the people will come," he said.
In fact, Collingswood's success owes to aggressive hard work by local officials and merchants and, perhaps even more, to state legislation that provides for the creation of special improvement districts. 
The legislation, enacted in 1984, allows towns to assess commercial property owners an additional tax, based on property evaluation, and to use the proceeds to create a management corporation for the town and for community development like security, lighting, sidewalk repair, building renovation, recruiting new businesses and promotion. Collingswood is one of 53 towns in the state, including Red Bank, Atlantic City, Elizabeth, Cranford, Clifton and Freehold, that have designated special improvement districts. Collingswood raises about $200,000 a year through its assessment, which business property owners seem largely grateful to pay.
And the town is still going out wooing other businesses.
"We learned how to recruit businesses to come in to the community," Mayor Maley said. "We put a team together, and we work. The way it works is personal contacts, personal contacts, personal contacts. We have people meet with government. We work on deals, and the business people in town make themselves available. We are constantly working."
Volunteer groups pitched in, too, behind the goal of bringing the town back from empty storefronts and sliding property values. Volunteers will paint and clean up the facade of a building if the business owner provides the materials.
Through grants and low-interest bank loans, the town has improved lighting and renovated buildings. It also began to promote weekend events to draw more people into its center, closing 10 to 12 blocks to hold fairs and festivals with foods, arts and crafts. 
"I've seen the renaissance in Collingswood first-hand, and it is just amazing," said Susan Bass Levin, the state's commissioner for the Department of Community Affairs and a former mayor of nearby Cherry Hill who often shops in Collingswood. "It's all about putting a package together. It starts with a mayor who says, 'I want to build a coalition.' "
Collingswood's downward slope began in the late 60's. Jerry Chambers, a native who has worked on Haddon Avenue for 38 years and now owns Eck's Jewelers there, remembers a bustling array of restaurants, drugstores with soda fountains and other busy stores as well as neighborhoods filled with large, middle-class families. About 60 children lived on his block.
"The downtown at one point was incredible," he said. "But it really suffered through the 70's."
Soon, many homes were sold to absentee owners who converted them into apartments and duplexes and then neglected them. Businesses went belly up when they could not compete with the Cherry Hill Mall, which opened in October 1961, and other neighboring malls. The thrift shops moved in along with other businesses that quickly failed. The real alarm went off for Mr. Chambers, he said, when his parents said they were thinking of leaving the community.
As it happens, they stayed. About 20 years ago, others who had stayed, business people like Mr. Chambers and John Gagliardi, who has owned a hair salon on the avenue for 32 years, began meeting to lay the ground work for the big changes that came over the last five years. They took on projects as simple as planting trees downtown and began lobbying people to the way of thinking that downtown could not continue to drift. Something had to be done.
"They realized that and a lot of other suburban towns did not," said Mr. Maley, a lawyer who has lived in Collingswood since 1982. He still has the advertisement for the three-bedroom Dutch colonial with the finished basement that he and his wife bought for $72,500. Mr. Maley, one of three town commissioners since 1989 and the mayor since 1997, is credited by many town residents as the engine that drove Collingswood to much of its current success.
What the commissioners eventually decided had to be done was the creation of the special improvement district, in 1999.
Not every town has embraced the concept and its extra tax on business property owners. Bound Brook, for example, tried it but did away with it. A proposal was defeated in Haddonfield in the mid-1990's. And in Haddon Township, where an assessment was approved last spring, resistance is still evident, as in a "No SID" sign posted on one merchant's door.
But for the most part towns have benefited from it. In Red Bank, the state's sterling example, the business vacancy rate has rebounded to less than 1 percent today from 37 percent 12 years ago, said Mayor Edward J. McKenna Jr. In Red Bank and well as in Atlantic City, which started a special improvement district in 1993, recruiting is seen as a big part of the package.
The money from the assessments helps, according to Ms. Bass Levin, but the more important aspect is the uniting of the town for the purpose of rebuilding.
"Once a town makes the commitment, it works," she said. "The hurdle is getting everyone to agree that you need to take action. It has to be everyone in this together."
Everyone in Collingswood seemed to realize that town residents could not be the only shoppers. They knew they had to lure people from nearby suburbs and even Philadelphia, which is about eight miles away. One of the biggest worries now is that success will escalate rents for commercial space.
When Mark Smith and Lydia Cipriani were looking for a place to open Tortilla Press, a 46-seat Mexican restaurant, they were impressed with the efforts to draw them to town. They opened on Haddon Avenue at the end of July in the space formerly occupied by the luncheonette.
"The main decision-making factor was the way the business community and the commissioners sold us on coming to Collingswood," Mr. Smith said. "They have a really good vision. They are positive and upbeat about the area. They were incredibly supportive in making the deal happen. Having seen Collingswood 10 years ago and seeing it now is amazing. It blows me away."
Other newcomers include Eat Your Peas, a children's clothing boutique, and HALO, a funky gift store. Villa Barone, a popular Italian bistro, moved into space formerly occupied by an appliance store. Merchandise & Hardware, which sells fashionable hardware and furniture, was a pet store. A gas station is being removed to make way for Bobby Chez, a gourmet takeout specializing in crab cakes.
As another sign of success in the community, the publisher David Hunter, who puts out a community newspaper called What's On in Haddonfield and a South Jersey arts paper, started What's On in Collingswood in mid-October. 
Mr. Hunter said he had been looking for another South Jersey town and decided that Collingswood, with so many new businesses, was the most promising.
"When five or six new restaurants open, something is going on," he said.
Another thing going on is an upswing in the housing market.
Philadelphia Magazine noted in a September column that Collingswood was the "new spot for shops" and that 30-somethings from Center City Philadelphia were crossing the river and heading to Collingswood to raise their families.
Silvia Hatzell, of Main Street Realty in Collingswood, says friends who used to tease her for living in Collingswood are now moving in, themselves.
"It was tougher to sell houses here six years ago," Ms. Hatzell said. "Everyone wants to live here now."
These days the town is being compared to other hot spots.
Robert Sanabria, who owns a California-style restaurant in Marlton called Food for Thought and plans to open Word of Mouth in Collingswood in early November, said: "At first I was apprehensive because it is next to Camden. but I saw it was an up-and-coming town" that now reminds him of Manayunk, a resuscitated neighborhood in Philadelphia, or New Hope, the big antique, restaurant and tourist mecca in Bucks County, Pa.
Valerie Boothroyd, a Haddon Avenue renaissance pioneer, opened her furniture restoration business, The Painted Cottage, six years ago, before it became apparent that the avenue would become so tony.
People used to ask her why she chose Collingswood rather than a town like New Hope. But she sensed the potential here, she said. And now, what with her love for Collingswood, its Saturday farmers market and its community spirit, her point of comparison is even farther afield.
"It's so Paris here," Mrs. Boothroyd said.

HEADLINE: A Change in Chairman for the Pequots 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
AS a boy, Michael J. Thomas couldn't wait to turn 16 so he could leave his home at the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation in eastern Connecticut. But 18 years later as the Mashantuckets prepare to elect a new leader today, Mr. Thomas is the heir designate of the current chairman of the Tribal Council and only announced candidate for the position.
 Mr. Thomas said his chief priority as leader would be to build housing for some of the Mashantuckets who want to move onto the reservation, where the tribe operates the Foxwoods Resort Casino, which makes an estimated $1 billion a year. But he said also high on his list is better relations with the tribe's neighbors, who have opposed expansion of the casino and the reservation. 
 "There is no need for us to be as insular as we have been historically," Mr. Thomas said. "There is a tone that I would set a chairman that is more open and more based on communications, and more focused on moving past points of disagreement towards areas of potential agreement."
He said he hopes to reach a point where, even if the tribe and the neighbors cannot agree on something, they would "be able to disagree without being disagreeable."
In the past the tribe has been accused of being guarded, even furtive about its plans for development of the reservation, although the current chairman has been moving more in the direction that Mr. Thomas laid out. Kenneth M. Reels, who took office four years ago, has held a series of public meetings to explain the Mashantuckets' positions on various issues and has worked closely with local elected officials. 
Local officials said it was encouraging even that Mr. Reels announced he was stepping down, and Mr. Thomas announced he would run for the office.
"The tribe has always been very secretive about its elections, so Michael's press conference was a real step out of the normal for them," said Preston First Selectman Robert Congdon. "I think it's a good sign."
Mr. Congdon said he will work closely with whomever is elected, and he does not want to appear to be taking sides in an internal matter such as an election, particularly since there have been reports that Richard A. (Skip) Hayward, a former chairman, might also seek the seat. Mr. Hayward declined requests for an interview.
"But I agree we need to work together more than we have in the past," Mr. Congdon said. "I think we're getting some encouraging signals."
Mr. Congdon also noted that the Mohegan Tribe, which operates the nearby Mohegan Sun casino, has had a different relationship with its neighboring towns from the start. He noted, for example, that the Mohegans are in the middle of building a water line that will not only serve the casino, but also other local towns.
"They're really going out of their way to be good citizens," Mr. Congdon said. "That kind of model is sitting seven miles away, and I think the Mashantuckets, as well as the towns of Preston, Ledyard and Stonington, need to learn from it."
Mr. Reels, who is still seeking re-election to the council, said it was a difficult decision not to run for a third term as chairman.
"I've always tried to put the tribe first, and I think we've empowered the next generation to the point where there's a younger council member who can do a better job, and knowing that I felt it was time to step down," Mr. Reels said. "I think I still have a lot to offer, but I feel that we can move forward with Michael Thomas as chairman."
Mr. Reels is 42, while Mr. Thomas, who was the youngest tribal member ever elected to the council nine years ago, is 34.
Mr. Reels said the finances of the tribe are also in better shape than they were four years ago, which has made him feel more comfortable turning over the reins. He said that when he took over, the tribe was considering a major redevelopment project in nearby Norwich, and it ran a shipyard in New London, but it had no business plan for either undertaking, and the shipyard had lost about $70 million over the few years it operated.
"There was a lot of good publicity from the shipyard, but was that publicity worth $70 million?" Mr. Reels said. "And now we have a project in Norwich that's not so ambitious, with the state and the city contributing about $7 million. The tribe is stronger financially than it has ever been, and we've paid down about a quarter-billion dollars of debt."
But it has not been completely a period of retrenchment. Under Mr. Reels, the tribe has started construction of a $9 million office and warehouse complex in Stonington, two golf courses near the casino, and a huge commercial laundry operation in the Norwich Industrial Park.
"When people come into a lot of money they tend to waste a lot of money," Mr. Reels said. "We've been there, we've gotten through that period, and now we're focused on producing wealth and taking care of our assets. We've put things on a sound financial footing."
Mr. Reels said he also believed in term limits, and while that is not the rule among the Mashantuckets, "I like to lead by example, and if I feel that way, I have to act that way."
Mr. Reels said he was appointed to the tribe's Economic Development Committee this year and will be active as the tribe continues to develop businesses.
"We're talking to some big companies about potential partnerships, and that's where I would like to put my time," Mr. Reels said. "I want to make sure that as we build out the resort, we don't waste any money."
The tribe is considering a $700 million expansion project that will include "Pequot Island," a water-themed resort on the reservation. He would not reveal more details of the plan, but said many projects were approved in the past based on simple artist renderings, but the tribe wanted more information this time.
"The membership is beyond pretty pictures," Mr. Reels said. "We want to see the financial impact it will have on the tribe if we borrow money: What's the interest rate, what kind of return can we expect, that sort of thing."
Mr. Thomas said, historically, gambling has been a cyclical business, and the tribe must develop Foxwoods as a true resort, with attractions that will bring people to Mashantucket even if the interest in gaming wanes. But he said that as the tribe moves forward it must focus more than ever on what will yield the greatest return on investment, and what will have the longest life span as an attraction.
"There is the potential for more growth," Mr. Thomas said. "But we also understand the need for the tribe's finances to be stable if we are going to take care of our citizens."

U.S. Savings Bonds at a High Point

BYLINE:  By KARL RUSSELL 

 BODY:
Suddenly, United States savings bonds are looking very good.
 While many investors continue to lose money in the stock market, owners of savings bonds are seeing some attractive yields. 
 The yield on the most widely held savings bond -- the EE series, the kind people used to give as gifts -- is currently 3.25 percent. That's far above the average yield on a one-year certificate of deposit, now 1.73 percent, and much better than rates on money market or savings accounts. 
Downturns in the stock market generally bolster bond sales, as investors flee to safety. But the Treasury Department has also made it easier to buy savings bonds by offering them online, at www.treasurydirect.gov. It has also tried to make the bonds more appealing by inscribing "patriot bond" on some of them. KARL RUSSELL

HEADLINE: The View From/New Canaan; 
Stepping Into a Role Without Missing a Beat

BYLINE:  By LEAH NATHANS SPIRO 

 BODY:
IT was only his ninth day on the job, but already there was a crisis. Curt R. Welling, the new chief executive of AmeriCares, an international relief organization, was reading a morning paper in his office in downtown New Canaan when he came across a banner headline on Oct. 17 that read: "North Korea Says It Has a Program on Nuclear Arms."
 Mr. Welling immediately knew that an AmeriCares mission to deliver aid to North Korea in several weeks was in jeopardy. 
 "It certainly puts our mission up in the air," Mr. Welling said as he scrambled to consult with his staff and the State Department.
But as the day of departure neared, AmeriCares decided that the mission, scheduled for next Saturday, would proceed.
AmeriCares, founded in 1982 by Robert Macauley, has airlifted and shipped medicine, medical supplies and food to more than 137 countries around the world. North Korea has been receiving shipments since 1997.
But North Korea is not the only country preoccupying Mr. Welling and the organization these days. Southern Africa is another of his concerns. After a fact-finding mission in September, the organization learned that the AIDS epidemic and famine are devastating countries from Malawi to Zambia.
Mr. Welling is worried that the world does not know the extent of the problem.
"The combination of the magnitude of the disease profile there and the magnitude of this famine has the potential to create a crisis of absolutely horrific proportion," he said. 
Worrying about famine and the AIDS epidemic in Africa seems light years away from the time Mr. Welling spent agonizing over his next deal on Wall Street, where he worked for 23 years.
Mr. Welling, 53, was an investment banker with First Boston Corporation and with Bear Stearns & Company. He was also the chief executive of SG Cowen Securities, a division of a French bank.
His earlier offices boasted stunning bouquets of fresh flowers, plush carpeting and magnificent views of Manhattan. Today, he is getting by with nicked metal filing cabinets, a 1960's era wooden desk and a window office overlooking a parking lot.
"There were no people more self-important than investment bankers, including me," he said.
Yet, Mr. Welling has hit the ground running. With a staff in New Canaan of about 60, and with hundreds of volunteers, he has already scoured Fairfield County for a new headquarters building that will be able to absorb roughly a dozen new employees and perhaps AmeriCares huge warehouse in Milford.
Mr. Welling has started a regular Monday morning staff meeting and he is also in the midst of a careful examination of the basic mission and management of the organization.
"The few changes he has made have made a big difference," said Elizabeth Griffin, AmeriCares' director of communications. "He's re-examining every facet of how we operate."
For Mr. Welling, a 22-year resident of Wilton, the change from investment banker to nonprofit chief executive did not seem unusual. He was the president of the board of Spence Chapin Services, an adoption and child services group, and chairman of the Wilton Board of Finance. He is still involved with the Adirondack Council, a wilderness preservation group in upstate New York where he grew up.
Landing at AmeriCares, which has an annual budget of $450 million, was both serendipitous and providential, he said.
After stepping down as chief executive of Princeton eCom, an electronic bill payment service in Princeton, N.J., a friend called and asked him to send a resume, which was then forwarded to an AmeriCares board member.
Meanwhile, AmeriCares was in dire need of finding a new leader to carry forward the mission of Mr. Macauley, a former entrepreneurial paper broker.
Even before he started AmeriCares 20 years ago, Mr. Macauley was involved in relief missions. During the finals days of the Viet Nam War, he was moved by a tragedy. On April 4, 1975, a United States military plane carrying Vietnamese orphans to the United States to be adopted crashed in the jungle in Viet Nam.
With little hope of the survivors being immediately rescued, Mr. Macauley chartered a Boeing 747 with a personal check for $10,000 to pick up the children and fly them to San Francisco, where their adoptive parents were waiting. By then, his check had bounced and he had to mortgage his home several times to pay the balance of $241,000.
Several years later, in 1981, Pope John Paul II called Mr. Macauley to Rome and asked him to get medical supplies into his home country of Poland, which was under martial law. Mr. Macauley, who is not Catholic, completed the mission.
Today, at age 78, he is still the chairman, but he is in declining health.
Mr. Welling did not know much about AmeriCares, except through his church, where he had participated in one of AmeriCares domestic programs called Homefront Day, which attracts some 9,000 local volunteers who help elderly and economically strapped residents fix up their homes. Despite stiff competition, the AmeriCares board chose him.
In the Macauley tradition, the main focus of AmeriCares is responding quickly to international emergency medical emergencies around the world by airlifting and shipping medicine, medical supplies and nutritional items that include vitamins, powdered milk and infant formula.
Domestically, AmeriCares focuses mainly on the local community. Besides Homefront Day, AmeriCares runs free clinics in Danbury, Norwalk and is opening one in Bridgeport. The organization also runs Camp AmeriKids in upstate New York for children from the tristate area with AIDS.
The organization responded on Sept. 11. Within 24 hours of the attacks on the World Trade Center, AmeriCares had four Sikorsky Black Hawk helicopters ferrying rescue teams and materials to the area. The organization also raised $9 million, which it promptly spent on the rescue effort.
For Mr. Welling, one of his biggest challenges will be fund-raising. Mr. Macauley's connections will certainly help. For one, he went to kindergarten in Greenwich with George Bush Sr., and Barbara Bush is the AmeriCares ambassador-at-large.
Mr. Macauley has perfected a way of thanking his corporate donors, whose contributions of medicine and medical supplies are the backbone of the organization. Every year the organization holds a hangar party at the Westchester County Airport.
After an evening of dinner and dancing, the guests change into jeans and board a plane for a whirlwind tour of some of the clinics and orphanages the organization has helped.
Since the hangar, beverages and air travel are donated or discounted, the party helped to raise $15,000 this year, Ms. Griffin said.
After only a few weeks on the job, Mr. Welling received a welcome surprise. The Chronicle of Philanthropy, a trade publication, raised AmeriCares' ranking from 20th on its list of top 400 philanthropies to 12th.
The list ranks charities based on how much money and donated products they raised from private, non-governmental sources, which include individuals, foundations and corporations. AmeriCares raised $463 million.
"It's a remarkable accomplishment," said Stacy Palmer, editor of the Chronicle of Philanthropy. "It was a very hard year."

A Surge of Home Buying on Monmouth's Seashore

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
A COUPLE of years ago, just as the stock market was cresting and before it came crashing down in successive waves, Lynn Wyckoff and her husband, Robert, decided to use their retirement savings to buy a house by the sea.
 At the time, Mrs. Wyckoff recalled, it seemed quite daring to invest in Monmouth County real estate, rather than, say, a "nice mutual fund." For one thing, the couple was selling the family home in East Brunswick to move into an eight-bedroom 1906 structure needing major renovation and restoration. For another, the new house was in Asbury Park -- a town with so many boarded-up buildings and problems that sharp-tongued shore regulars sometimes referred it to as "Beirut by the sea." 
 "But my husband knew the area from years ago, when his family summered in Neptune," Mrs. Wyckoff said. "I fell in love with this town, its historic buildings on the ocean, its beautiful white boardwalk."
A redevelopment plan for Asbury Park's beachfront area was being readied, and there were already lots of pioneers looking to renovate and revive the hard-luck town responsible for some of Bruce Springsteen's rough edges. The first wavelet of New Yorkers, many of them gays, had begun buying beat-up beach houses to rehab as second homes, a pattern of improvement that has been continuing for about five years now, according to local real estate agents. 
"When we decided to buy down here, we told our friends they should join us," Mrs. Wyckoff said. "They come to visit and they love it, but none of them actually bought houses."
Now, Mrs. Wyckoff is reveling in her almost fully restored brick manse with its grand staircase and its crystal chandelier from Czechoslovakia and its wraparound porch that catches the ocean breeze -- and sighing over the plight of pals. "One couple we know invested their money at the same time we did, but they went with the stock market," she said. "They lost over $200,000."
The Wyckoffs paid $190,000 for their house and roughly the same amount to restore it. When work on the home is complete, it will be worth more than $800,000, local market experts say.
Rosemarie Villanova, a Coldwell Banker agent in Ocean Township, said she has had at least a dozen clients buying homes or second homes in the past year who told her they were getting their money out of stocks and putting it into real estate on the shore.
"People investing now are a little bit late," said Donna Fahey-Waters, Ms. Villanova's colleague at Coldwell Banker. "Prices have taken off, in every price range of house and condo. There is no such thing anymore as somebody being able to say, 'Get me a little condo for $100,000.' "
FOR Monmouth County, the average price per transaction is 18 percent higher this year than last year, said James R. Johnson Jr., manager of Weichert Realtors' office in Sea Girt. Spurred by this, Weichert plans to open new offices in up-and-coming Brielle and in Spring Lake, where the median sales price is currently $1.7 million, and where one property sold for close to $12 million earlier this year, Mr. Johnson said.
In Spring Lake this year, there have been several cases in which homes were purchased for $400,000 to $700,000 and then the new owners knocked them down and built big new houses on the property, according to Mr. Johnson.
Despite the rising prices, there are still deals to be had, sales agents agreed. And Monmouth County is still in the process of being discovered.
"I sold a house in Monmouth Beach to a couple from New York," said Ms. Fahey-Waters, "and they just had their wedding in Rumson last month. There were a number of people there who had never seen the area -- many from New York -- and people were saying, 'This is New Jersey?'
"It's getting so we're almost not trying to tout it any more," Ms. Fahey-Waters said. "O.K., not really, but things have absolutely taken off."
In Spring Lake, Mr. Johnson of Weichert said he sensed the market might be beginning to cool. "There are suddenly more properties on the market -- a total of 61 right now -- with prices ranging from $539,000 to just shy of $5 million," he said.
But the market in most towns -- Belmar, Sea Girt, Cedar Lake, Wall, Manasquan -- is steadily warming, agents say. 
Ms. Villanova cited the Shark River Hills section of Neptune as being exceptionally hot right now. The town has smaller homes, and even waterfront properties are affordable -- $379,000 to $400,000 -- she said. Also, West Allenhurst and Ocean Township, which share borders with Asbury Park, are in this category, she said.
Ms. Villanova said she was seeing three types of customers: "There are the people from outside the area, who come to the area in the summer and then discover it is a year-round community. They start coming here in the fall, and then spending most of their weekends here, and then they decide this is where they want to be. 
S OME people want to move out of northern New Jersey. They may be downsizing -- not retired, but selling homes because their children are grown, and maybe preparing for retirement. They want to buy a home or second home before prices go any higher.
"The third type of buyer is an investor looking for deals. There are places in Bradley Beach, the northern end of Belmar, Neptune, Asbury Park, where it's possible to pick up summer homes at affordable prices."
Some are making over unheated beach houses for themselves; others are engaged in "flipping," Ms. Villanova said -- buying houses that need work, often doing the work themselves, and then reselling.
Ms. Villanova said she recently had a client who bought a bungalow in Neptune 10 blocks from the water for $78,000. "You walked in and could see right through the roof -- pick out the stars in the sky," she said. The buyer has redone the interior and installed heat and central air, and it is now on the market for $180,000."
In the summer of 2000, Stuart Z. Koperweis bid on a boarded-up Asbury Park house that was in foreclosure. "You know, this town is interesting," he had said to his wife. "It reminds me of Jersey City, but on the shore." At the time, Mr. Koperweis was the president of the Economic Development Corporation in Jersey City. He is currently a development consultant and is employed as president of the Greater Asbury Park Chamber of Commerce.
Mr. Koperweis paid $151,000 for the 3,200-square-foot structure on Seventh Avenue, five blocks from the ocean, which had been converted into a three-family home. He reconverted the house to a single-family, and appraisers now estimate its value at close to $450,000, Mr. Koperweis said. "The house across the street just sold for $490,000," he said, "and it needs work. And a house a block away sold last summer for $600,000."
Mr. Koperweis, however, sees his house as a place to stay for a long time. "After college, it could be my kids' summer house," he said, "or our retirement home, or theirs."

HEADLINE: POLITICS; 
In Bids for Governor, Final Stumping in Pivotal Westchester

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
AS Westchester County goes, so goes the state. As a political adage, it lacks the rhythm and renown of the old saw about Maine and the nation. But in local circles, it has been just as reliable a prediction formula. 
 Watchers of statewide elections say that Westchester has long been considered the most accurate bellwether county in New York. Its demographics are strongly representative of the state. Westchester is favored by pollsters in predicting statewide reaction to candidates and issues, and political strategists scrutinize voter trends in the county to determine campaign strategies. Campaigns regularly conduct focus groups to study voter attitudes. Westchester is said to be the most pivotal of the state's suburban areas, and probably the single most strategic territory in statewide elections. 
 "It is literally the swing county," said Brian J. Nickerson, a political science professor and director of the Michaelian Institute of Public Policy at Pace University in White Plains.
Westchester mirrors the state's proportion of upstate, suburbs and city. Politicos break the state down into three main voting blocks. Upstate traditionally votes Republican; New York City traditionally votes Democratic. The suburbs are often politically divided -- "swing" territory -- and can be the most intense political battleground.
"It's become a cliche now: Westchester as a bellwether because the electorate reflects the state's diversity," said George S. Latimer, a Democratic county legislator from Rye and chairman of the county's Democratic Committee. 
"You have people who work on Wall Street on the same block as people who work right in town," said Mr. Latimer, who traversed the state and county for months during his unsuccessful campaign for lieutenant governor earlier this year. "If your message resonates here, it generally reflects how it's going to do statewide."
So, with Election Day on Tuesday, a last big push for campaigns is taking place this weekend throughout Westchester. Ground operations are in full effect this weekend for the three main gubernatorial candidates: Gov. George E. Pataki, the Republican incumbent; H. Carl McCall, the Democratic challenger; and the billionaire businessman Tom Golisano, the Independence Party candidate. There are commercials on television, literature in the mail, campaigners at train stations and supermarkets, and foot soldiers going door to door. 
Volunteers for Mr. Pataki will be looking for converts in solidly Democratic areas like Mamaroneck, Scarsdale and Mount Vernon. Mr. McCall will concentrate on Republican strongholds like Mount Pleasant, Eastchester, Harrison and Peekskill. And Mr. Golisano will try to pick off disaffected voters in Yonkers, a city with a mostly Democratic enrollment but where voters tend to elect Republicans.
Westchester can often be tricky for political strategists to predict. It was long Republican-dominated, but in recent years Democrats have outnumbered Republicans almost 3 to 2. Still, voters do not blindly vote the party line. They are known for being familiar with the issues and tend to put issues before a party. For example, many Irish and Italian people who migrated to Westchester after World War II remain Democrats, but vote conservatively on issues and could favor Republicans.
Kieran Mahoney, a Republican political strategist, noted that Westchester has a large number of voters who do not declare a political party, so the county becomes a petri dish for determining which issues are important to voters.
Michael R. Edelman, a Republican political consultant in Westchester for 25 years, said, "If you take Westchester, you're going to take the state." Geographically and politically, he said, the county sits between the liberal city and the conservative upstate.
Mr. Mahoney posits that a Republican cannot win in the state without winning Westchester. He has worked each of Mr. Pataki's gubernatorial campaigns. In 1998, Mr. Pataki won 53 percent of the statewide vote, compared to 32 percent for Peter F. Vallone, a Democrat and the former New York City council speaker. In Westchester, Mr. Pataki won 59 percent to 33 percent. In 1994, Mr. Pataki beat Mario M. Cuomo by getting 49 percent of the vote, to Mr. Cuomo's 45 percent. In Westchester, the count was 50 percent to 47 percent.
Mr. Mahoney attributed much of Mr. Pataki's success to his familiarity with the suburbs, particularly Westchester. Mr. Pataki remains active in Westchester Republican circles. He is from Garrison, in lower Putnam County, and was Peekskill mayor and became a state senator from the area.
"Part of the reason he does well in the suburbs is that he understands Westchester, and that's knowledge he can export when he's trying to win other suburbs," Mr. Mahoney said. 
The importance of winning Westchester is not lost on Mr. McCall's campaign. Steven A. Greenberg, a campaign spokesman, said Westchester is considered crucial to winning. He said that when Mr. McCall was elected state comptroller in 1994, he won only seven of the state's 62 counties: four in the city, two upstate and Westchester.
"He lost 55 counties, but he carried the city and Westchester, so he carried the state," Mr. Greenberg said.
CANDIDATES conduct polls to determine which parts of their platform to emphasize to particular voting blocs. They are likely to emphasize different issues to urban dwellers just north of the Bronx than to apple-growers in northern Westchester. Urban voters are generally concerned with social services and financing for mass transit, while suburban dwellers focus on property taxes, education and the environment.
Mr. Pataki has been visiting the county recently, most notably courting county leaders on a tour of the Hudson River. Mr. McCall, whose political stronghold is New York City, has an active campaign office in White Plains but has not made very many personal appearances. But his running mate, for lieutenant governor, is Dennis Mehiel, a former chairman of the Westchester County Democratic committee.
Mr. McCall has called for closing the Indian Point nuclear power plant, which appeals to many local voters. Mr. Pataki has not called for a shutdown but has largely managed to avoid major criticism. He has also avoided blame for economic and budget woes, despite Westchester County Executive Andrew J. Spano, a Democrat, attributing the county's $1 billion budget deficit to Albany. Mr. Spano has angered some Democrats by appearing with Mr. Golisano at a recent public event.
"You have some city, some suburb and some rural," said Richard Berman, Manhattanville College president, who runs the college's poll, which canvasses Westchester. "It's a rich county, but there are large lower-income cities. You have the poorest of poor and richest of rich, and all the ethnic groups. You have every kind of demographic here, by income, religion, race, gender, political party and education level."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
Service Upgrade By N.J. Transit Fuels Gains Around Stations

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR, N.J. 

 BODY:
MARGOT SAGE-EL, the owner of Watchung Booksellers here, said she has noticed an increase in the numbers of visitors to her store since the Manhattan Direct trains began running on Sept. 30.
 "There is a buzz; it's like we are more connected to the city," she said. "It is bringing people in during the day, including kids getting off the train. It used to be four trains in the morning, four in the evening and nothing else." 
 There are in fact 59 trains a day stopping at the station a few minutes' walk from her bookstore, compared with 26 before the development of the new service. Trains run approximately hourly in each direction during the day, with additional trains during morning and evening rush hours. 
Ms. Sage-El's store is adjacent to the Watchung Avenue station, one of six in this suburban township where new electric trains whisk riders into New York's Pennsylvania Station in about a half hour. 
Officials and real estate executives in Montclair and other towns on the rail line say the new service has helped to increase housing prices by attracting people who want the advantages of suburban living without a punishing commute into Manhattan. It has also stimulated commercial development -- an estimated $200 worth has taken place in Morristown since the train service began there in 1996 -- with new stores and office conversions opening near train stations. This has raised the hopes of local officials trying to revive downtown shopping areas that grew up around the train stations about a century and a half ago.
New apartment-style housing projects are under way in several towns. And one developer, Cary Heller, has hitched his activities to the rail revival with stores in the South Orange train station and building conversions in Maplewood and Montclair.
Unlike some later suburban developments, which simply sprawled housing across former farm fields without much focus or sense of community, the towns along rail lines tend to have distinct personalities and distinctive shopping areas. In addition to commercial developments, these towns are including cultural facilities, like live stages, in their renewal plans.
Because the roads in the region are choked with traffic much of the time, the value of rapid rail travel and proximity to stations has grown. 
"A lot of people say they want to be within walking distance to a train station," said Joyce Slous, a saleswoman at the Burgdorff residential real estate agency, which has an office in the Watchung Plaza, near the station. "The values are higher closer to the train."
Before the development of the Midtown Direct trains, New York bound commuters could stay on the trains only as far east as Hoboken. There they had to transfer to the underground PATH trains, or more recently ferries, for the remainder of the trip. Since the schedules of the surface trains and the PATH lines did not seem to be coordinated, commuters wasted time standing around the PATH station at Hoboken. And since the attacks of Sept. 11 drove many jobs that were formerly downtown to Midtown, the PATH trains have been unusually crowded.
The effects of the new rail service are most apparent in such towns as South Orange, Maplewood and Morristown, which are on the main branch of New Jersey Transit's Morris and Essex line and have had Midtown Direct since 1996. Dingy areas in and near the train stations have been replaced with lively stores selling food and drink, which are flanked by sidewalks with tables and chairs where people gather.
"We knew the new service was going to be a boost for the community," said William R. Calabrese, president of the Board of Trustees of the Village of South Orange, effectively its mayor. "The town grew around the train station, and we knew we had to rebuild around the station."
In addition to the new station stores, which face the main downtown shopping area, plans are well under way for a new arts center on the other side of the station on a space once occupied by a lumberyard and fuel oil delivery company, Mr. Calabrese said. The center would include five movie screens, a live stage and banquet facilities.
In addition, he said, a new supermarket is planned on the site of a former ShopRite market, along with 80 apartment units. Another 12,000 square feet of new retail space and 60 more apartments are planned where an automobile dealership was once located. All are within a minute or two from the train station on foot and, Mr. Calabrese said, have financing and have been approved by the Board of Trustees. 
In Maplewood, one stop to the west, property values have increased as the improved train service has attracted buyers, and many existing residents have been prompted to improve their properties, said Victor DeLuca, the mayor. "Having the train and its connection to New York is like boarding a subway in one of the city's boroughs," he said.
The downtown shopping district is attracting new types of stores, particularly restaurants. "People get off the train and meet someone for dinner," he said.
Since the downtown district is full, there is little opportunity for development, Mr. DeLuca said. For that reason, he said, town officials are trying to move the local post office out of downtown so the site can be used for more small businesses eager to have a presence in the area.
The Maplewood Concierge Company at the train station handles such things as dry cleaning, film developing and grocery purchases for harried commuters, who drop off their orders in the morning and pick up the goods in the evening. Like several other towns along the train line, Maplewood operates a jitney service for residents living too far away to walk to the train.
Maplewood has long had groups vigorously promoting community harmony and fighting racial tipping. Ellen Greenfield, a Maplewood resident who is a member of the South Orange-Maplewood Community Coalition on Race, said South Orange and Maplewood, which share a high school and have similar housing stock, are tolerant of alternate lifestyles. "We have nontraditional families here, including mixed-race couples and gay couples," she said. "The idea is to make everybody comfortable." 
Tolerance has had a financial payoff, said Barbara Heisler-Williams, executive director of the coalition. She said the assessed value of houses in Maplewood increased 19.4 percent from 1999 and 2000, while the value in South Orange went up 22.7 percent. She said that was a larger increase than in places like Chatham Borough and Chatham Township, traditionally considered more prestigious areas to live.
In Morristown, "everybody wants to be near the train station," said Jay Delaney, the mayor of the municipality that was a summer country retreat for New York's wealthy in the Gilded Age. Now, he said town houses priced close to $1 million each are being built near the Morristown station, from which a trip into New York takes about 60 minutes.
ALTHOUGH new housing is the most obvious impact of the new service, commercial developments are another spinoff, as demand rises for space for stores and other services, said Michael Fabrizio, executive director of the Morristown Partnership, a business development group.
He said there has been $200 million in private development in the town since the Midtown Direct trains started running and more projects are in the planning stages. He noted that the old Macy's store on the town's central square, about a half mile from the train station, sat idle for eight years before reopening last year as a Century 21 store.
The town is working with the state's Transportation Department to build a "transit village" on a parking lot adjacent to the train station. In place of a surface lot with 300 spaces, the development is to have 8,000 square feet of retail space, 200 units of housing and a parking deck that can accommodate 400 cars.
"Parking lots are almost by definition underutilized," Mr. Fabrizio said. "Now we will have a new ratable for the town and a model for New Jersey Transit in other places." He said approval by the planning board was expected before the end of the year, with construction expected to commence in the spring.
To the north and east in Montclair, trains began operating on the Montclair Connection a few weeks ago after decades of wrangling. According to local lore, the first suggestion of linking the two once-independent railroad lines, which were about one-third of a mile apart at their closest point, was made by planners in the late 1920's. The actual connection finally opened on Sept. 30.
Montclair's official history notes that the town was developed around rail lines. The railroad first arrived in 1856 and within a few years commuters could board a train in an area now known as Lackawanna Plaza, change trains in Newark, board a ferry in Hoboken and be in Manhattan in an hour and 20 minutes.
But this line did not serve the northern part of the town, known as Upper Montclair, so in 1873 a separate railroad was built with five stations in what had become the township of Montclair.
Over time the original line was electrified and became the Montclair branch of the Morris and Essex line, with one station in the township. The other line, known as the Boonton line, was used by diesel locomotives. Trips on both lines ended in Hoboken.
As plans were made to provide direct service into Manhattan, the logic of having a connection in Montclair for the two lines, both now operated by New Jersey Transit, became more powerful. The five stations in the township that had been served by diesel trains were electrified, a new station was built at Bay Street and the tracks of the Boonton line were connected to the end of the Montclair branch. The remainder of the Boonton tracks and several stations along the line are now unused.
Part of the reason for the long delay is that the connection had to run through one of the few areas of low-income housing in a generally prosperous region. Some of those in the neighborhood, which includes many minority residents, were displaced by demolition and others now face rapidly rising rents as well-off commuters seek housing near the Bay Street station.
"We fought the connection," said Robert Russo, mayor of the township, which has a population of about 36,000. "We don't have one central station like South Orange or Maplewood. We are the only town with tracks running through it and six stations. The impact is going to be enormous."
Development in nearby Bloomfield, which describes itself as a "working class" township, unlike some of its wealthier neighbors, is also being affected by the new train service. Plans are under way for a $160 million mixed residential and retail development centered on the Bloomfield train station. 
MR. HELLER, the principal of Sym Heller Development and Management, has made a business of following the improvement in rail service. He developed the new stores in the South Orange station, converted a printing building in Maplewood to office use and redeveloped an old supermarket about two blocks from the Bay Street station in Montclair to multiple retail use.
Currently, he is converting an old General Motors auto dealership building in Montclair's down-at-the-heels automotive row just east of Bloomfield Avenue, a major road in the area. Opened as Whitbeck Motor Sales in 1913, the dealership sold Buicks, Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs until being adversely impacted by the development of the Lackawanna Plaza shopping center in the mid-1980's.
That development took away the dealership's surface parking and blocked many of its showroom windows, according to Mr. Heller, making it difficult to attract customers to buy or service cars. 
He has removed many of the renovations done to the building, exposing brick structural piers and massive wooden trusses supporting the roof. He is converting it to office space and notes that it is a short walk from the Bay Street train station. Part of the space is already leased, he said.
Mr. Heller said the developments in the older suburbs along the railroad line are an extension of what has been happening in cities along the Hudson River. "Jersey City and Hoboken started as transportation hubs and became places to live and commute into New York," he said.
Mr. Heller said that even before the Manhattan Direct service was instituted, he had planned to develop the 13,000 square feet of retail space in the South Orange station, but he said the new service persuaded him to build a higher quality installation and lease to tenants like Starbucks and a bakery, rather than a sandwich shop. 
Steven D. Plofker, a lawyer and developer with offices in the Walnut Street train station in Montclair, said he thinks some areas of his town were ready for redevelopment even without the new rail service. One of his projects is another old auto dealership across a small triangular park from Mr. Heller's building.
Like Mr. Heller, Mr. Plofker is converting his old building to office space, preserving the roof trusses and skylights. "This is a neighborhood in transition," he said. "It used to be just a junkyard and used cars."
But a few blocks away, in a neighborhood of substantial single-family homes, he has another project that may benefit from its proximity to the Bay Street station. He is converting a factory, built in the days before zoning, into eight loft apartments that emphasize their industrial heritage.
He has chopped the middle out of the building so the complex will have a courtyard and is leaving the metal roof support trusses open. The floors are polished concrete, the wiring is in metal conduit attached to the masonry walls and the kitchens will be stainless steel. "We are trying to have an industrial look, and I like to leave the guts of things exposed," he said.
Mayor Russo said it was likely that most train-related development in Montclair would occur near the Walnut and Bay Street stations, since the stations farther up the line are closed in with housing and established retail development. A senior citizen housing project is nearing completion near the Bay Street station, and a new firehouse is planned nearby.
He said the town hopes to assist the few hundred residents of the older apartment buildings nearby, but admitted it might be difficult to resist economic forces. "We don't want people who have been living there for 10 or 20 years to be forced out because their rent has doubled," he said.
Some developers are eager to remove existing tenants so the generally run-down buildings can be rehabilitated to a condition more appealing to commuters. One owner of four buildings tried to empty them, saying the heating boilers were in a dangerous condition. The town blocked that attempt, but others are likely to follow. "People are looking for us to help, and we may buy a few abandoned properties for use as low-income housing," Mr. Russo said.
Meanwhile, the retail corridor along Bloomfield Avenue has been designated as an area in need of redevelopment, meaning the town can seize a property if the owners do not improve it. 
But Mr. Russo said the town is not eager to seize anything and is hoping the new train service and the residents he believes it will attract will persuade owners of some of the pockets of deteriorated stores to fix them up or sell to buyers who will.
"Things are happening that are at least partly driven by the train," he said. "I'm very positive about the future."

HEADLINE: Look Who's Minding The Till in Camden 

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO 

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
THE FIRST big surprise was that Governor McGreevey chose an official as high up as his righthand man, State Treasurer John E. McCormac, to become chairman of the 15-member Camden Economic Recovery Board to oversee a $175 million state revitalization program here. The second big surprise was that Mr. McCormac was willing to take the job, and enthusiastically.
 "There's something about this one that absolutely gets to me," Mr. McCormac said last Tuesday, days after presiding over the recovery board's first meeting. "I really feel motivated by this responsibility. It's an opportunity to make a difference in people's lives that someone in accounting or treasury doesn't always get a chance to do." 
 Moreover, a recent clarification from the state Supreme Court on its impending decision on publicly financed projects has given Mr. McCormac and others reason to move more quickly than ever on the recovery package.
In a city that not only is the state's poorest but also has a reputation for allowing money to filter into the wrong hands, putting the state's top money man in charge of allocating more than $175 million in state funds to various recovery projects makes a lot of sense. Proponents of the revitalization program hope that the state treasurer will mind the till as well as send a message to skeptical legislators (and their taxpaying constituents), the residents of Camden and private business.
"Camden has fundamental problems in its governance, and that starts with its financial governance," said State Senator Wayne Bryant of Camden, a sponsor of the legislation that created the revitalization program. "These are crucial times, and dollars aren't so plentiful. By putting John in charge, it's sending a message to taxpayers throughout the state that it's going to be done right."
In fact, some Camden leaders who may have been critical of state intervention in the past now recognize the need for an outside party at the helm.
"If the state's going to put that much money in Camden, they definitely want to be sure it's spent properly and it goes where it's supposed to go," said the Rev. James C. Jones, president of Concerned Black Clergy of Camden, who was quick to point out that three of Camden's last four mayors have been indicted on charges of financial improprieties.
The legislation is partly intended to encourage private enterprise to reinvest in this downtrodden city. Mr. McCormac said he hoped his presence at the head of the table -- as well as that of the state Community Affairs commissioner, Susan Bass, Levin and the Economic Development Authority chairman, Anthony Coscia, who are also members of the recovery board -- would help attract private investors.
"When you can make a pitch and the state treasurer and the head of community affairs are listening to you, it makes a difference. These are people who know how to leverage funds," said Mr. McCormac, who considers his task in Camden among his top assignments, right after managing the state's budget.
Day-to-day planning and the carrying out of the revitalization program will still be the responsibility of Melvin Primas, the state-appointed chief operating officer, who was officially hired and given a $175,000 annual salary at the Economic Recovery Board's first meeting, on Oct. 25. Mr. McCormac says he expects to be in touch daily with Mr. Primas and to attend all the board's meetings. 
From where Senator Bryant sits, having Mr. McCormac involved increases the potential to attract more private dollars and to tap into additional state funds if needed. The need for this might arise, he said, if, say, money has been allocated for a project to rebuild roads and sewers but then it is found that a bridge needs to be reinforced, too.
"The second-most-powerful person in the state after the governor is the treasurer," Mr. Bryant said. "He controls the purse strings, so having him there can be very helpful. He won't need to be brought up to speed' he'll already know what need to get done."
Mr. McCormac said he was especially moved by a two-hour tour of Camden last month that took him past Camden's success stories along the waterfront -- like the baseball stadium and the aquarium -- and then through the boarded-up neighborhoods in South Camden. 
"It was eye-opening," he said. "I thought, 'God, it needs help.' "
The board's next order of business, Mr. McCormac said, will be selecting a master planner from seven proposals.
While legal challenges to elements of the revitalization program still pose potential obstacles, a clarification by the Supreme Court on a broader issue is actually spurring the board to move faster.
Two weeks ago, the court heard arguments regarding the legality of the state's raising money through bond issues without voter approval. The court's decision on this question could affect numerous publicly financed projects, but when the state treasurer and the state attorney general asked the court if its ruling would apply to projects for which financing was already in process, the court said there would be no retroactive clause.
Senator Bryant said that upon learning of that ruling, he suggested the next day that Governor McGreevey go forward with the bond issues that will raise money for the Camden program.
"We have to move on it before they make their decision," the senator said. "The court won't come out with its ruling until early next year. We'll beat them."

HEADLINE: SENIORITY; 
Older Voters Hear More Than War Drums

BYLINE:  By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach and arrival of retirement appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
YOU might never know it from the nightly news, but the election on Tuesday is particularly important for older Americans.
 How the vote goes for the House and the Senate will help determine the kind of prescription drug coverage that retirees may receive, and whether conservatives can continue their drive to at least partly privatize the Social Security system. The new Congress will also face deep problems in Medicare, as well as the problem of the millions of people without any health insurance -- including many older Americans who are not yet eligible for Medicare. 
 But these domestic concerns have been drowned out, at least on the national level, by the Bush administration's constant talk of war with Iraq. Even that talk was drowned out for a while by the Washington-area sniper. 
"Bush has been very successful in focusing on Iraq," said Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. "Back in August, the Democrats were ahead on issues like the economy and Social Security. Lots of economic and social issues, as well as the corporate scandals, were pushed off the front pages by Iraq."
The White House may have changed the channel with the national news media, but has it also done so with voters?
We'll find out on Election Day. But a two-week car trip through the South last month left me skeptical that many voters have been diverted. In fact, it reinforced my faith in most voters' ability to see through news-media hype and political smoke screens from both parties. It's easy to get the impression that the Washington-New York media axis and great sections of the rest of the country are parallel universes with different realities.
Despite scant news coverage in the national news, economic and social issues are dominating many races around the country. That is clear from local television news and local political advertising: Republicans and Democrats are slugging it out over issues like Social Security privatization and prescription drug coverage. Recent polls have indicated that concern about the economy is growing.
"I wish we could have the Democrats run the economy and the Republicans run foreign policy and national security," one older voter, a Republican, told me in Louisiana. He said he disagreed with his party's efforts to privatize Social Security by allowing investments in stocks.
The power of older voters is traditionally strong in nonpresidential election years, when many younger voters take a pass. This year should be no exception, as the faltering economy and stock market pinch the pocketbooks of retirees and workers contemplating retirement.
Most people who have 401(k) plans received their third-quarter statements last month, and for many the news was not good. The Louisiana Republican with whom I talked said his 401(k) account lost $7,000 in the quarter.
There's also a lot of angst over Medicare, which continues to cut payments to doctors. These payments were reduced 5.4 percent last January and are expected to fall an additional 4.4 percent in January 2003. That is causing more doctors to refuse to take new Medicare patients. 
That problem -- together with the rising costs of prescription drugs, for which many older people have no coverage, and the fact that 41.2 million people have no health insurance whatsoever -- will command the attention of the new Congress. Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, a conservative Democrat who often supports Republicans on social issues, has said in recent interviews that the American system of medical care "is collapsing around us." For the first time, he has called for universal coverage.
Prescription drug coverage is so popular that virtually no candidate for Congress opposes it. The issue is how comprehensive it will be and whether it will contain price controls. Democrats generally favor a comprehensive plan with such controls and run by Medicare; most Republicans want a less-expensive limited-coverage plan run by private insurance companies, and with no price caps. The outcome of the election will almost certainly decide whose plan prevails.
MR. WEISBROT, who is also the co-author of "Social Security: The Phony Crisis" (University of Chicago Press), says that while the medical care system is critically in need of reform, Social Security will be solvent for decades to come with only minor tinkering. Yet the rhetoric coming from Washington often indicates otherwise.
"For almost 20 years, politicians of both parties have pretended, for political gain, that there is a big problem with Social Security," he said. "So a lot of people have become convinced there really is a problem."
He says that those who push privatization to solve the "problem" are often the "ideological descendants of people who were opposed to Social Security when it was created in the 1930's" or represent Wall Street interests who want the commissions that investing Social Security money in stocks would bring.
Here's a sobering thought: Mr. Weisbrot and the Center for Economic and Policy Research (www.cepr.
net) have calculated that if the most modest of the various privatization plans had been put into effect at the beginning of 1998, the Social Security system would have lost $45 billion in the stock market by now.
But don't expect to hear that on the evening news.

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS; 
Andra Roy, Gregory Chernack

 BODY:
Andra Marie Roy and Gregory Scott Chernack were married last evening at the Willard Hotel in Washington. Rabbi Joel I. Braude performed the ceremony. 
The Rev. Matthew J. Hillyard, a Roman Catholic priest, took part.
 Mrs. Chernack, 31, was until May the nominations clerk on the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington; she also received a law degree that month from Catholic University of America. She graduated from Centenary College of Louisiana in Shreveport. Her parents, Joan and Normand Roy, live in Shreveport, where they are partners in Roy Real Estate, a residential brokerage firm.

A Hula Hoop Of Diamonds

 BODY:
 Thirteen years ago, Courtney Wagner (son of Robert) and best friend Anita Ko toiled away behind the jewelry counter at Fred Segal in Santa Monica and got to thinking: Why not create our own line? 
 The dream bore fruit last November with Wagner & Ko's circle necklace, an orb of either an inch or 1 1/4-inch in diameter made of diamonds or sapphires ($1,100 to $2,200). Thanks to recession-proof actresses like Cameron Diaz and Gwyneth Paltrow (who has bought six in the last four months), monthly sales have gone from about 10 last winter to about 40 now, Ms. Ko said.

HEADLINE: Nuclear North Korea 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Nicholas D. Kristof well understands our dearth of options in dealing with North Korea now that it has become a nuclear power ("The Greatest Threat," column, Oct. 29). But it has already proved worse than useless to negotiate a deal, as Mr. 
Kristof advocates. After all, what happened to the last deal? 
 Do what we may in the way of appeasement, we can be sure that Yongbyon will be turned into "a nuclear assembly line" and that the cash-starved country will sell its weapons to the highest bidder as it has threatened, because it has nothing else to sell.
In view of this, international sanctions are still our best bet, backed by a threat of destruction if North Korea uses its nuclear weapons or its powerful army against our allies.
Aren't we glad that Iraq has not yet reached the intractable point that North Korea has, and that there are still means of prevention there?

HEADLINE: URBAN TACTICS; 
Latest Exit to Brooklyn

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
TIME was, you could stroll into a smoke-steeped bookstore on the Lower East Side, gamble a few bucks on a new novella by a budding writer-slash-anarchist who lived down the block, wander into the murky bar next door, and eavesdrop on that same writer trying to pry beer money from his editor.
 Those were the heady final years of the 20th century, before the dot-com bubble burst, when squatters still squatted, and the neighborhood's unruly township of tenements gave rise to a crackling literary scene inspired as much by punk rock as by Allen Ginsberg. Titles like "I Listen: A Document of Digital Voyeurism" by a techno-artist who called himself Spaceworm tried to subvert the rules of publishing, committing to print something as radical as the unedited transcripts of intercepted cellphone calls. 
 "It was one of those rare moments," said Bob Holman, a downtown literary figure who runs the Bowery Poetry Club. "There was a feeling that the anarchic punch of punk could have an effect beyond the art world. You could see a breakdown of the old hierarchies." 
But that moment withered. Due largely to the pressures of gentrification, the punks of publishing have been squeezed out of their turf on the Lower East Side and are setting up shop in various neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Like music clubs and other cultural exports that once defined the neighborhood's energy, indie presses have seen their rents rise and their audiences migrate across the East River. 
Underground magazines and books have been published on the Lower East Side since the 1960's. But the publishing scene had largely faded by the early 90's, until a small group of entrepreneurs from the music world revisited the genre. 
Among them were Gary Hustwit, a record promoter from San Diego who moved to New York in 1998 to jump-start Incommunicado Press, a micropublisher that billed itself as "the last hope for American publishing." Within days of arriving, he stumbled upon his future, an empty storefront adjoining Tonic, a music saloon on Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street.
The 800-square-foot space soon became a punk-publishing fortress. The back of the store was stuffed with desks and computers. The front looked like an anti-Barnes & Noble, cluttered with Gen-X memoirs, manifestoes against globalization, spoken-word CD's and do-it-yourself zines printed at the local copy shop. This was literature with (sometimes smudgy) soul, not mere off-the-shelf lit-product marketed like soap.
"During the day, from 10 to 6, we would run Incommunicado Press," said Mr. Hustwit, 37, who wears a goatee. "At 6, the publishing house staff would leave, and the bookstore staff would arrive and stay till midnight. We had a lot of drunken impulse buys."
Around the corner, in a dank basement on Suffolk Street, was Soft Skull Press, run by Sander Hicks, the front man for the hard-core punk band Subterfuge. "I was somewhere between being a squatter and a working-class hero," said Mr. Hicks, who was also the building's superintendent. He was 25 when he started the press in 1996, after gaining his publishing sea legs behind the counter of a Kinko's on West 12th Street.
Soft Skull made headlines in 1999 when it picked up "The Fortunate Son," a biography of George W. Bush that St. Martin's Press had dropped after learning that its author, J. H. Hatfield, had a criminal past. Soft Skull went from its usual print runs of a few hundred copies to an initial run of 25,000. "It's weird to be an anticapitalist capitalist," Mr. Hicks said. "We were coming from punk rock. But I was infused by the excitement of the creative dynamo of capitalism."
THE first rumblings of change began about two years ago, and they started with Incommunicado, for whom the attractions of capitalism spelled the demise of its creativity. In addition to issuing about 10 new books a year, Incommunicado recorded poetry and story readings, and distributed them over the Internet. "Authors like Rick Moody would come to Tonic," Mr. Hustwit said, "and we would go downstairs to where the wine barrels were and record a short story there because the acoustics were good."
The Web site on which the material was distributed, MP3lit.com, soon caught the eye of Salon.com. In 2000, just before the dot-com bubble burst, Mr. Hustwit sold his company to Salon, mostly for stock options then valued at $5 million. "I wish I could buy a car with what that is worth now," he said.
Soft Skull absorbed Incommunicado's titles and took over the bookstore. Its publishing schedule picked up, to some 12 titles a year. They ranged from "Online Diaries," the journal entries of Beck, Courtney Love and others during the 1995 Lollapalooza rock tour, to "Get Your War On," a series of comic strips by David Ress that satirize the war on terrorism.
But the book parties ended this summer, when Soft Skull was kicked out of Tonic. Commercial real estate trends suggested a better use for the space. "We broke down the wall and moved part of a bar there," said Melissa Caruso Scott, 31, who runs Tonic with her husband, John.
Richard Nash, 32, who became Soft Skull's editor at large last fall, scouted for other space on the Lower East Side, but everything he saw was too small and too expensive. Besides, in his estimation, the downtown scene had run its course, and his core readership of 20's and 30's culture vultures had moved on. "The next logical step was to find something in Brooklyn," said Mr. Nash, who lives in Williamsburg. "When Soft Skull first started, we were all hipsters who lived and worked in the Lower East Side. Now we're all in Brooklyn."
Last Friday, Soft Skull opened its new home in Boerum Hill, a sunny corner storefront on Bond Street near Atlantic Avenue. A bodega sits across the street, but nearby neighborhoods can be risky at night. "It was an opportunity to jump ahead of a curve, rather than follow a curve," he said.
Soft Skull already has good company. Akashic Books, whose co-founder in 1997 was Johnny Temple, the bass guitarist in the band Boys Against Girls, had relocated from the Lower East Side to Fort Greene, Brooklyn, several years earlier. 
"Brooklyn is not as commercialized as Manhattan," said Mr. Temple, who started Akashic in an East Village apartment with money his band received after signing with Geffen Records. "There's a thriving literary community in Brooklyn coming out of the young punk scene and outcast types. Fort Greene also has an incredible literary history. Walt Whitman lived here."
In addition, Brooklyn is home to several independent presses that have emerged in recent years, including Words Like Kudzu in Greenpoint, which has published five titles of experimental fiction. The Clovis Press bookstore at 229 Bedford Avenue is gaining a reputation as Williamsburg's answer to the St. Marks Bookshop in the East Village.
In publishing, as in other fields, it almost feels as if Brooklyn and downtown Manhattan are trading places. 
"Culturally, it has shifted," said Beau Friedlander, the publisher of Context Books, a small TriBeCa publisher. "I've pitched and sold more books on the L train in Brooklyn, just running into people." Still, Brooklyn is untested as a place to nurture alternative publishing. For one thing, the scene is scattered among several neighborhoods, said Marvin Taylor, director of the Downtown Collection at the Fales Library at New York University, which houses a large archive of independent press works from the mid-1970's to the present. 
"We think of downtown as a physical and metaphysical space," Mr. Taylor said. "But it's still not clear to me what Brooklyn is."

Global Issues Flow Into America's Coffee

BYLINE:  By KIM BENDHEIM 

 BODY:
A BUZZ in California has caught the attention of the world's biggest coffee companies.
 In a growing movement reminiscent of the grape boycott in the 1970's, antiglobalization and human rights advocates in California have been promoting the purchase of Fair Trade certified coffee -- coffee that guarantees a so-called living wage to poor coffee farmers in developing countries. An estimated 25 million of these farmers have suffered because raw coffee prices have fallen below the cost of production. 
 Students in California have helped to pressure the Sara Lee Corporation, the maker of the Hills Bros. and Chock Full O' Nuts brands, to start buying small amounts of Fair Trade coffee. On Tuesday, voters in Berkeley, Calif., a longtime redoubt of student activism, will vote on a measure that would require the city's restaurants and supermarket cafes to restrict sales of brewed coffee to blends that are Fair Trade, organic or shade grown, which are considered more environmentally friendly than conventional, mass-produced varieties. Violators could face $100 fines and six-month jail terms. 
Major coffee companies have denounced the Berkeley measure. But at least one, Procter & Gamble, which sells the Folger's brand, said it would work with beverage servers to comply if the measure passed.
Fair Trade coffee, a pet project of the antiglobalization movement, has become a growing segment of the $55 billion coffee industry. Although Fair Trade coffee is only about 2 percent of the global supply, sales rose 36 percent last year in the United States, the biggest single market for coffee. About 7,000 retail outlets across the country sell Fair Trade coffee, according to TransFair USA, a nonprofit group in Oakland, Calif., that monitors food company compliance with Fair Trade standards. 
Last week, Green Mountain Coffee, a wholesaler in Waterbury, Vt., signed an agreement to sell Fair Trade coffee under the Newman's Own Organics label, the food company owned by Paul Newman, next year in supermarkets nationwide.
The economic argument for Fair Trade coffee got a lift in September when Oxfam, the British charity, released a report saying that a global oversupply of coffee had pushed prices to their lowest levels in 100 years, adjusted for inflation, impoverishing millions of coffee farmers in developing countries. In Latin America, Africa and Asia, the report said, farmers are paid roughly 24 cents a pound for beans, while the four multinational companies that buy nearly half of the world's coffee -- Sara Lee, Kraft, Procter & Gamble and Nestle -- sell those beans at an average price of $3.60 a pound and "are laughing all the way to the bank." 
Fair Trade coffee, which can cost more than double the price of conventional blends at the checkout counter, is comparable in quality and price to premium blends. Small farmer cooperatives are guaranteed to receive about $1.25 a pound for Fair Trade coffee. 
To help these farmers, Oxfam proposed to the International Coffee Organization, a group of 40 major importers and exporters, that it cut the oversupply, and help raise prices, by destroying stockpiles of the lowest-quality beans.
Organization members generally oppose that approach, arguing that stimulating demand is a better way to raise price than reducing supply. Many also reject the Fair Trade approach, saying it supports prices artificially and could worsen the glut.
"Fair Trade isn't a viable solution," said Gordon Gillet, Nestle's senior vice president for purchasing and exports. "First, it favors the few and, secondly, it provides an incentive to farmers to increase coffee production at a time when they should perhaps be seriously considering alternative crops."
Anneke Theunissen, a spokeswoman for Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International, the group that oversees Fair Trade certification, disagreed. "At this moment, Fair Trade labeling is the only way for the disadvantaged small farmers to survive in the market," she said. 
As for the Berkeley initiative, the industry has largely dismissed it as a quirky extreme, saying customers should decide what coffee they want.
"Berkeley has always distinguished itself, to put it politely, by a surprising originality," said Francois-Xavier Perroud, a Nestle spokesman.
BERKELEY, though, may be a natural place for the coffee controversy to percolate. The city is known as a coffee Mecca where couples go to coffee houses on dates rather than to bars, and where drinkers debate the merits of one roast over another the way the French debate the merits of wines. Peet's Coffee and Tea, a famous Berkeley roaster, was the training ground for the founders of Starbucks, the biggest and most successful coffee bar chain in the world. Both were early sellers of Fair Trade beans, along with other coffees.
The Fair Trade movement began in 1997 with the establishment of the Fair Trade Labeling Organizations International in Bonn. Its founders hoped to offset the effects of global economic forces on poor countries by establishing a set price for certain commodities like coffee and cocoa. 
The value of global coffee exports has fallen by an estimated $8 billion since the 1997-98 crop year because of a glut in a market that was once regulated but is now mostly free. The biggest increase in supply came from Brazil and Vietnam, low-cost producers.
Robert Nelson, president of the National Coffee Association, a trade group that represents the coffee industry in this country, called Fair Trade certification one small answer to the oversupply issue.
"We need broader-based initiatives to really make a difference in the crisis," he said. "There is no one magic bullet."

HEADLINE: Where The Wounds Don't Show 

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
EVERY day, they cross the gray welcome mats of Bellevue Hospital Center. They pass the black bowls of the empty fountain in the garden, smoking secondhand cigarettes. Some come with purses. Some come without shoes.
 But unlike most visitors to Bellevue, these people do not come because of physical complaints. Instead, they head past the hospital police and the metal detector and enter the psychiatric emergency room, a spare complex of long hallways and closed doors surrounding a locked station for doctors and nurses. 
 About 7,700 people came here last year. Different in kind from the medical emergency rooms that are the stuff of TV drama, this one holds a hidden New York, where stories that mostly go unspoken are told. 
Like every emergency room, this one mirrors its locale. Through its psychic disarray, a visitor can discern the harsh and frantic nature of New York. Because mental distress often has social links, this type of emergency room is closely bound to the world around it. Its patients suffer from homelessness and joblessness as well as schizophrenia, and treatments include social services as well as medicine.
"There is a human condition in this city that is more than serotonin and dopamine," said Dr. Rhea Parandelis-Santiago, a third-year psychiatry resident from New York University who served as a guide to this E.R. "These illnesses don't occur in a vacuum."
The psychiatric emergency room also reflects New York's increasingly multiethnic makeup. According to the 2000 census, 36 percent of New Yorkers are foreign-born; that number rivals those of the early 1900's, when tides of immigrants washed into the city.
For these growing ranks, immigration can have weighty psychological consequences. Navigating a new nation and a new culture, while also separating from the soul of the home country, has been linked to depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. To pick just one immigrant difficulty: many Latinas are burdened by "marianismo" -- the flip side of machismo and a cultural expectation that women be docile, suffering victims.
As a center of psychiatry in a city famed for that profession, Bellevue serves as an Ellis Island for the mentally troubled. But helping these patients is no small task. The hospital as a whole receives 17,000 requests a year for patient interpreters, which it tries to satisfy with 60 volunteers.
The psychiatric emergency room is also a lens on the city's sluggish economy and financial woes. Bellevue, which is at First Avenue between 26th and 29th Streets, is the preferred home of last resort for many New Yorkers. It beats Rikers Island, and many prefer it to homeless shelters.
Dr. Parandelis, a 29-year-old with long dark hair and strong features who grew up in Larchmont, N.Y., and speaks Puerto Rican Spanish, is realistic but not daunted by the challenges of this room. When families, friends, even doctors in medical emergency rooms recoil from the human spinning out of control before their eyes, she and the rest of the psych staff mop up the mess. 
"I love this place," she said. "Part of what we do is, little by little, chip away at the sum total of chaos in the world. It's your small contribution, but it can be really meaningful." 
Snapshots of Dr. Parandelis's days, captured early this summer, offer some vivid glimpses of this raw world.
At dawn on a Saturday, a slight, baby-faced father of five named Wilson Sepulveda was released from Rikers Island. He got a four-inch knife and drank half a can of beer before striking out for the house where his wife of 18 years lived.
He was enraged at her for various reasons, he said, and each day for the last four months he had thought about killing her. So this day he climbed in the window and began stabbing her. His young son came in and placed himself between his parents. Mr. Sepulveda kept stabbing. 
"I never wanted to hurt my children," he said. "But her, yes. I want to kill her."
The next day, the police brought Mr. Sepulveda to Bellevue. He vomited in the medical emergency room. He removed his shoelaces and fashioned a noose. Mr. Sepulveda does not speak English, but no one in the emergency room, he said, spoke to him in Spanish. By the time he was transferred to the psychiatric emergency room, the blood spattered on his shorts and socks had dried. Around his neck was a rosary. 
Mr. Sepulveda, 33, has a history of depression and lately has been plagued by fragments of songs that loop in his head over and over. "I have a foul-smelling life," he said. "I need help." He had not eaten for two days. He said he last did heroin 10 years ago.
"We can help you with this rage that comes to you," Dr. Parandelis said to him in Spanish.
Mr. Sepulveda began to cry. Handcuffed to a wooden wheelchair, he stared straight ahead and let the tears drip down his nose onto his T-shirt. He looked younger, suddenly, and lost. He asked to see his children. 
Dr. Parandelis decided to admit him and start him on an antidepressant. 
"Is the son O.K.?" asked the attending physician.
"I don't know," Dr. Parandelis replied.
"Is there any way we can find out?" asked the attending physician, concerned about suicide. "In terms of whether he needs a one-to-one upstairs, if the son's O.K., he doesn't. If the son is going to die, he does."
Mr. Sepulveda smiled at the man who brought him dinner. He ate a ham sandwich and half a peanut butter sandwich before going upstairs, to the inpatient prison ward. He was still wearing his bloody socks.
"Part of what we do is sleuthing," Dr. Parandelis said. "You feel like someone spilled a giant jigsaw puzzle on the floor and maybe some pieces are missing or weren't there to begin with. In a short period of time you've got to put enough of the pieces together to see what the picture is."
After escorting a patient from the waiting room, where a hulking young man tied to a gurney was spitting invective and blood, it took a full six minutes for Dr. Parandelis to figure out why the 58-year-old woman had come. The winding trail of questions and answers eventually came to "heartache." 
The woman's voice was deep and quiet. She seemed to swallow half her words as she rocked on her chair and worried her handkerchief. 
"The heartache pain," the woman said. "The pain that's here. That's been here for many years." She tapped her chest with her fingers and stared at the ceiling. The fluorescent lights bore down on her. 
Patiently, Dr. Parandelis drew out the tangled skeins of her story. 
"Sometimes when people feel really stressed out, when they are feeling really blue, like what you are describing, they also describe hearing voices," Dr. Parandelis told her. "Voices in a room, sometimes when no one else is there."
"Um-hmm," the woman said. Her face was bruised with sadness.
"What are the voices telling you?" Dr. Parandelis asked.
"They tell me I have enemies," the woman replied. "Sometimes the voices say, 'You need to be dead.' " Her arms were etched with small burn marks. She was worried about not having enough money to eat.
Dr. Parandelis decided to start the woman on Zoloft, an antidepressant, and to admit her to the hospital. The woman agreed.
"I think you made the right choice," Dr. Parandelis said.
"Yeah," the woman said. But later, she refused to sign the admittance forms.
At 8:45 p.m., Dr. Parandelis left for dinner, a takeout turkey burger and French fries from the hospital snack bar. By 8:55, she was back in the emergency room, surrounded by paperwork. In the waiting room was a drunken man with a swelling on his forehead, and a woman with a Burberry purse. The doctor's fries were cold.
"It's not just the picture they paint for you," Dr. Parandelis said of her patients. "It's why they paint it. You always have to think about secondary gains: three hots and a cot. There are people who use this as B.B.& B., Bellevue Bed and Breakfast."
Dr. Maureen Goldman, an attending physician who has supervised Dr. Parandelis, has said she spent half her time treating people who were not ill. The streets are full of things to run from, and bad weather brings in more people. Sometimes when the weather clears, so do the symptoms.
The patient Dr. Parandelis was about to see had been running around barefoot in the middle of traffic, agitated, disheveled and smelly. Her chart said: Prostitution to support herself. Irritable. Verbally abusive. Gets discharged to a homeless shelter. Does 16 bags of cocaine a day. Did six bags of heroin today. ("They usually jack it up when they want to be admitted," noted Dr. Parandelis.) Chief complaint: "I need a doctor." 
"Awesome!" Dr. Parandelis said after reading the chart. "I can't wait to meet her."
The patient, 29, would not shake Dr. Parandelis's hand. She wore white Lycra pants and a lacy electric blue shirt. Her voice was slow as molasses. She had been walking for three days, up along the Harlem River, she said, working. 
"Are you hearing voices now?" Dr. Parandelis asked. The woman sat motionless and silent. "I'm still wondering what it is that we can do to help you out and what it is that you need right now," the doctor said.
"I don't know," the woman said. Thick tears coursed down her face like oil. She sat rock-still, not wiping them away.
"Do you want a tissue?" Dr. Parandelis asked.
"Can I lay down?" the woman said.
Roosevelt Jones, a patient-care associate and drug counselor, knows this woman. He has seen her here 10 times before, and he has watched her progress from crack cocaine to heroin. "It's just to get her ribs out of hock," he said. "Get a couple nights' sleep, get some meals in her belly. That's her pattern." 
Dr. Parandelis added: "It is hard to know what lies under the substance abuse. I think a lot of what we saw was withdrawal." She found the woman a bed in a detox unit.
Mr. Jones has worked at Bellevue for 13 years. When the "frequent fliers," as some staff members call them, return, they see him again and put their heads down. "I tell them, 'There's no need to put your head down,' " he said. "Just try again."
Charles Matthews was wearing his only possessions: a pair of khaki pants, a khaki shirt, a yellow T-shirt and brown shoes. He gets high, he said, and when he gets high, he gets arrested. Since 1995, his rap sheet has stretched to nearly 40 arrests.
He was picked up recently at a Duane Reade for shoplifting. "I really didn't think I could handle going back to jail again," he said. "I was going to off myself. Plus the last time I was in jail, I had the suicide attempt. Also, I was going through heroin withdrawal, so they brought me here. The cops were really nice, though. Especially since one of them -- I had a needle on me, and one of them got stuck."
Mr. Matthews, 29, is a poet. He writes in rhyming couplets. He wanted to be a journalist, but instead he did telemarketing for a newspaper and worked in a mailroom. After his uncle kicked him out for smoking crack in his house in Queens, it was all drugs, no jobs. Mr. Matthews has been in and out of Bellevue since he was 21.
"God, I am so sick of being one of those people out there handcuffed to a gurney or a wheelchair," he said. "It's miserable. You feel like everyone is looking at you like a common criminal or a piece of garbage." He is proud that he does not smell bad. 
"Hopefully, I'll be able to get myself into some kind of drug treatment program," he said. "And I can go to court and the judge will look favorably on it. Whereas if I had just gone straight through the system and saw the judge last night, chances are I'd be doing about a month in jail right now."
"Hopefully," he said, "I can stop this before my 30th birthday."
"Part of who we are and why we wound up in medicine is because in some respects we are scientists," Dr. Parandelis said. "There is something concrete about science that is very reassuring. There is a solution." But, she added, "I think that's less the case in psychiatry. There are times you are seeing a patient for years and years and you still can't 100 percent say what the etiology of all their symptoms is."
This was clear the morning Sharon Santos was transferred to the psychiatric emergency room from a chronic care institution on Roosevelt Island. Ms. Santos has a rare progressive form of multiple sclerosis, which, in 12 months, has stiffened her fingers and twisted her feet.
"They got me here under the impression I'm suicidal," she said. "That's not it at all. I was just very sad at the time. My body has been whacked." 
Ms. Santos's boyfriend worried that she was suicidal. He said she sounded eerie, methodical and fearless. Then the nurses on Roosevelt Island found her pulling the compression stockings that she had tied to her bed frame over her head.
"I was just using them so I could strengthen my arms and get a little stress off," said Ms. Santos, who used to be a fitness trainer at New York Sports Club and has a degree in forensic psychology from John Jay College. She used to relieve stress by in-line skating in Central Park or by working out. Now she can't walk.
Ms. Santos had been in and out of hospitals and wanted to return to her sixth-floor walk-up in the Bronx. "I am tired of being in someone else's institution," she said. 
But Dr. Parandelis was concerned because, despite Ms. Santos's coherence and intellect, she had a lot of risk factors for suicide. "She has a lot on her plate right now," said Dr. Parandelis, who finally decided to admit Ms. Santos.
Ms. Santos did not take the news calmly. "She's begging, 'Please let me go,' " Dr. Parandelis said. "It becomes personal. It makes you think about yourself. My God, what if it were me? It's really important to pull away from that."
Ms. Santos announced that she wanted to crawl out of the E.R. She was shouting and refused oral medication. Dr. Parandelis gave her a shot to calm her down. 
Ms. Santos, buried in blankets, was wheeled out of the psych E.R. shortly before 8:30 p.m. "You people are so cruel," she wailed. "I don't believe this. How can a person who can't walk become a threat? Can you explain that to me? I can't believe this. I cannot wait to get a hold of that traitor. I cannot wait. I cannot wait."
The door swung shut. Later, Dr. Parandelis said: "One of the most frustrating things for me is no matter what you do with a patient when you have them in your office or the hospital, no matter what, you are sending them out into a world you have no control of. You're sending them out often to the same stressors that brought them in in the first place."
Dr. Parandelis says she believes that the problems her patients confront are not unsolvable, and that their suffering can be eased. Her belief has not gone untested.
"The reality of medicine is that it is not putting that cape on and flying around curing people of their ills all the time," she said. 
She learned this two days after Sept. 11, 2001, while volunteering at the armory at Park Avenue and 27th Street. There, she met a Cuban man who had traveled from Miami to find his brother, who worked in the World Trade Center. The brother had called him on his cellphone and said: "Come get me. I'm here. Come find me." The man had nothing, no change of clothes, no place to stay, no food, no brother.
"How do you solve that?" Dr. Parandelis said. Wanting to help the man, she referred him to a crisis counseling center. In response, he demanded: "Do you have my brother in this place you are talking about? Because if you don't, you can't help me."
Still, although the world sometimes spits back chaos, Dr. Parandelis keeps dispensing reason. One day in August, after a sleepless overnight shift, she prepared to meet a new round of patients at Bellevue. Inside, the hospital's jarring rhythms continued, while outside the day dawned wet. There were pigeons on the grass. The parade of the city's streets -- the fruit vendors and the buses, the needy and the newly arrived -- marched on into the morning. 

GRAPHIC: Photos: "The heartache pain," one patient said, tapping her chest when Dr. Rhea Parandelis-Santiago asked what bothered her. "The pain that's here. That's been here for many years."; About 7,700 people visit Bellevue's psych emergency room each year, and while some are sick, others are not. "You always have to think about secondary gains," Dr. Parandelis said. "Three hots and a cot." (Photographs by Joyce Dopkeen/The New York Times)(pg. 12); "I love this place," said Dr. Rhea Parandelis-Santiago, above center, of Bellevue's psychiatric emergency room. "Part of what we do is, little by little, chip away at the sum total of chaos in the world." (Photographs by Joyce Dopkeen/The New York Times)(pg. 1)

Outside Halls Of Power, Many Fear Free Trade

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: QUITO, Ecuador 

 BODY:
TWO heated debates about free trade took place here last week, yet they were so different they might as well have been on separate planets.
 The most visible one was at a meeting of trade ministers from the United States and 33 other countries, who tried to hammer out a road map for negotiating a free-trade zone from Canada to Argentina. The other was led by ordinary citizens. 
 Inside a heavily fortified Marriott Hotel, the ministers were deeply divided about practical issues but shared many basic assumptions: more trade is better than less; open borders are better than closed; cross-border investment is healthy. 
The United States wants more access to Latin American markets for services like insurance, telecommunications and even health care. Latin American countries want the United States to drop its barriers and subsidies for agricultural products, including sugar, cotton and soybeans.
Outside the ministerial talks, the issues were different. Ecuador's large indigenous groups, which have considerable political influence here, are convinced that there is no such thing as a good deal. Some say a hemispheric agreement will give carte blanche to foreign oil and mining companies in the Amazon rain forest. Others fret that farmers will be wiped out by foreign imports.
"We cannot compete with them," said Ermel Chavez, head of a group in northern Ecuador called Front for the Defense of the Amazon. "We will be become nothing more than consumers."
Many of the indigenous protesters here are supported and prodded by antiglobalization groups based in the United States.
Public Citizen, an advocacy group based in Washington, helped organize "reality tours" to demonstrate the impact of foreign oil companies; Global Exchange, a group based in San Francisco that opposes the free-trade talks, promoted interviews with indigenous leaders from Ecuador and Columbia; the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the most adamant and powerful American opponent of free-trade deals, had top representatives here as well.
That said, there was no mistaking the level of genuine popular unease here and in other countries. ALCA, the Spanish acronym for Free Trade Agreement for the Americas, has become a big topic in local newspapers and among ordinary people.
"Our companies are not efficient enough to compete," said Tomas Iglesias, a retired accountant who now drives a taxi part time. 
Ordinary Ecuadoreans have experienced both the benefits and costs of greater global integration. In a bid to halt inflation, the government adopted the American dollar as its own national currency nearly two years ago. That policy stabilized prices. But because of the dollar's high value, imports from other countries soared and exports stagnated. 
Almost every country in Latin America has been hit by trade shocks. Colombia, once one of the world's biggest exporters of coffee, is now far behind Vietnam. Argentina, once a major wheat exporter, has been forced to switch over to soybeans.
Various currency crises, meanwhile, have all but obliterated a free-trade zone that unites Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay. The regional trade group began to crumble when Brazil decided in 1999 to let its currency decline in value. That almost devastated Argentine exports to Brazil because the Argentine government kept its peso locked one-to-one with the American dollar. Regional trade imploded this year when the Argentine government defaulted on foreign debt worth about $140 billion and the peso collapsed.
DESPITE the disruptions, there are good reasons to believe that more free trade and openness ultimately offer more security.
The two Latin American countries that have so far weathered the current global economic slowdown -- Mexico and Chile -- are also the most open. Mexico, of course, has been part of the North American Free Trade Agreement for eight years. Chile has arduously liberalized its economy for years and is now close to signing a bilateral free-trade deal with the United States.
The problem is that a pan-American free-trade zone would cover more than trade. It would also affect ground rules for doing business, like sanitary regulations for food imports and enforcement of labor and environmental rules. Many Latin Americans fear that the United States wants to impose its system on them, and they are correct.
But it is worth remembering that the United States has taken its own lumps: when California decided to phase out the use of a gasoline additive containing methanol, the Canadian manufacturer of the additive sued, citing investor-protection measures in Nafta. The United States government now wants to make it harder for companies to make such claims.

Japanese Join Forces And Brave the Market

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
THEY pore over their spreadsheets as if they were studying racing forms at the track -- swapping advice and boasting about their best picks. But, as they nibble on baked fish and sip green tea, they are instead discussing the merits of investing in Toshiba or Hitachi and whether to buy bank stocks.
 This is a meeting of the Golden Members Investment Club, one of about 200 Japanese investor groups that pool money to buy stocks. Japanese equities recently sank to 19-year lows, but the five club members -- middle-aged workers and small-business owners -- are still dipping into the market. For two hours on the last Wednesday of every month, they meet in a tiny room in a Tokyo office tower to plan their next investment moves, undeterred by a colossal bear market. 
 With interest rates near zero, land prices in their 11th year of decline and the nation's pension system in disarray, many Japanese are trying to find new ways to supplement their savings. Stock holdings by individuals still account for only about 10 percent of the market in Japan, versus 40 percent in the United States, and the 200 investment clubs here compare with more than 30,000 in America.
But the enthusiasm of individual Japanese investors has been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise dismal Tokyo market this year. While banks, insurers and foreigners have been bailing out of equities, individual Japanese investors have bought a net 506 billion yen ($4.1 billion) of stocks in the first nine months of the year, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. If the trend continues, they will become net buyers of stocks for the first time in a decade.
Still, with the market 77 percent below that peak, retail investment clubs set modest targets, like simply staying in the black.
"We are not telling people to invest all their savings in stocks," said Tokuei Kaneko, a manager at the Japan Securities Dealers Association, which promotes such clubs as part of an effort to develop a long-term stock-buying culture. "We just want them to study on their own and make their own investment decisions."
Judging from the nervous chatter at the meeting of the Golden club, the efforts have had mixed success. True, the club's members have embraced their task with gusto. They keep detailed logs about the nine stocks in their portfolio, and each member looks for new potential investments. 
The five men and women, who go to the meetings directly from their workplaces, listen intently as their investment adviser, a retired broker named Sumio Mochizuki, explains how to glean insight from trends in outstanding margin interest.
BUT their laughter and bonhomie mask a simple fact: the club has lost 35 percent of its money since it was formed two years ago. And gone with the money are the group's early dreams. The group's members, who originally met in a painting class, decided to invest in stocks to help finance their vacations overseas, a goal they quickly abandoned. Initially, they met in expensive restaurants and moved on to karaoke bars after dinner.
Within six months, reality set in.
Falling stock prices and their dining habits quickly ate into the pool of one million yen, or $8,100, that the group had originally amassed. So they started using a conference room in the offices of a job placement company run by one of the members, Teruko Nakazawa. Instead of dining on fancy French food, they started ordering bento boxes filled with sticky rice and sour pickles.
"We were naive to think we could make a lot of profits quickly," said Yoko Maeda, 53, who owns a business that rents artwork to companies. "We thought we should get more serious about it."
At the club meetings, the group's current adviser, Mr. Mochizuki, gives 90-minute presentations on stocks. He receives 10,000 yen ($80) from the group after each session and another 10,000 yen from the dealers association. With a laptop computer and small projector, he flips through charts showing the Nikkei's 200-day moving average and other technical analysis. He peppers his upbeat presentations with English jargon like "downside risk" and "outperform."
Ultimately, he leaves the decision-making to the group. With the Nikkei 225 down 27 percent from its 2002 peak, not much seems to be working well. Two of the core holdings, Toshiba and Furukawa Industrial, have been battered by the decline in technology spending, and Sumitomo Mitsui Bank has been hurt by worries about the health of the financial industry.
The biggest surprise has been Natori, a small company that makes Japanese snacks. Tsugihiko Hayakawa, who owns a design company, heard about Natori from one of his employees. Last month, it sold all of its shares, for a 15 percent gain. 
It also sold its holdings in four other companies, making modest profits in its investments in Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking and taking losses on Nissan Motor and Furukawa Electric. 
For the most part, though, the club embraces the buy-and-hold strategy that is typical of Japanese investment clubs, which average a membership of nine, most of them men. Half of all members are at least 50 years old and contribute an average of 17,000 yen, or $140 a month, to the kitty, according to a dealers association survey. (The Golden group, economizing in the face of the continued decline of the stock market, stopped paying monthly dues this summer.) 
Many of the clubs here say that their bible is the Japanese translation of "The Beardstown Ladies' Common-Sense Investment Guide," the best seller about a group of Illinois women who originally said that they earned an average annual return of 23.4 percent from 1984 through 1993. The women subsequently acknowledged that they actually underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- a revelation that has not deterred investment groups here. 
Most Japanese groups open accounts at online brokerage firms because they can execute trades for less than 1,000 yen, two-thirds below the price at traditional brokers. Many clubs post their results on group Web sites.
Despite the increasing use of computers, e-mail and charts, many Japanese still crave the interaction and security of the group meetings. For many retirees, investment clubs are a source of intellectual stimulation. Many, too, would not invest in stocks without being able to share the risk with others. Besides, members say, the money they contribute is about equal to what would spend taking classes in flower arranging or pottery.
"Japanese still have a bad impression about investing in stocks," said Kiyomi Saito, a member of the BRB Lombard Club and the translator of "The Millionaire Next Door," an American guide to the lives of the wealthy, written by Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko. "But it's a club, and they want to have friends."

100 Channels, but Where Are the Subscribers?

BYLINE:  By ALEX MARKELS 

 BODY:
AT 69 years old, the white-bearded man is a tad mature for satellite radio's target demographic group. Yet the remainder of his profile fits like a well-worn cowboy hat: he logs more miles on the nation's highways than most truck drivers do, and he spends much of his time there tuned to the radio. His musical tastes are all over the map -- from Django Reinhart, the jazz guitarist, to Neil Young -- and they aren't satisfied by the limited song menus on most commercial radio stations.
 He is not the type to spend money frivolously, but he is happy to pay $10 a month for programming that is largely free of the commercials that now saturate the conventional AM and FM bands. 
 "I think it's a bargain," said the traveler, who happens to be Willie Nelson, the singer. He bought an XM satellite radio system last fall for his tour bus, after hearing about the company's new 100-channel nationwide service. "It's got music you just can't hear on the commercial stations." 
Although listeners of some public radio stations can find diverse programming in a dozen or so genres, those who tune in to satellite radio can choose from as many as 60 musical categories, such as Mr. Nelson's favorites, Hank's Place and Frank's Place, which feature the music of Hank Williams and Frank Sinatra. XM's competitor, Sirius, even offers feeds from the BBC and C-Span, as well as National Public Radio programming. 
A rising chorus of naysayers has driven down the stock prices of the new medium's two pioneers, XM Satellite Radio Holdings and Sirius Satellite Radio, to all-time lows. But word-of-mouth accolades like Mr. Nelson's only reaffirm the belief of professional investors like Frank V. Jennings that satellite radio is the next big thing. An avid listener himself, Mr. Jennings, who manages the Oppenheimer Global Growth and Income fund, is betting that there are many others like him and Mr. Nelson. 
"I know what it's like being stuck in traffic without a decent radio station to listen to," said Mr. Jennings, 55, who puts in 10 hours a week commuting from his home in western New Jersey to the Manhattan offices of OppenheimerFunds. He spends much of that time listening to the Sirius radio installed in his car. "I believe there's 40 million other people who feel the same way," he said.
He is so convinced of the potential that he has committed hundreds of millions of dollars of his clients' money to both XM and Sirius shares. A few weeks ago, he promised to add $150 million to the $240 million that Oppenheimer has already put into Sirius, which beams 100 channels of digital audio programming via satellite to subscribers' specially equipped radios, which cost about $175 and up, for a $13 monthly fee. XM's equipment costs about $200.
In a recapitalization plan announced on Oct. 17, other big investors in Sirius, Apollo Management and the Blackstone Group, also promised to increase their stakes by $25 million each, supplying desperately needed cash to an operation that has already spent more than $1 billion to start its national service. 
Like XM, in which both Oppenheimer and Apollo also hold shares, Sirius estimates that it needs at least four million subscribers to achieve the cash flow to cover operating expenses. (If the recapitalization plan is approved, the company says it would only need half that many to break even.) Each company says it expects to reach those subscriber goals within about two years, mostly through sales to new-car buyers who purchase satellite-enabled radios that automakers are now installing in thousands of their vehicles.
Sirius and XM have signed exclusive distribution agreements with major car manufacturers. General Motors has invested in XM and will distribute its radios, while Ford Motor, DaimlerChrysler and BMW will install Sirius radios. The deals suggest that satellite radios could soon be available as options in about two-thirds of new cars sold in the United States, about 11 million annually. They can also be installed in older cars by electronics retailers and auto dealers. 
If the companies achieve their subscription goals, satellite radio would be among the most rapidly adopted technologies in the United States. Independent researchers have less optimistic projections. The Yankee Group, a telecommunications research firm in Boston, expects satellite radio to reach about nine million subscribers by its fifth year, about the same as the growth of satellite television but far less than that of broadband Internet.
Industry experts also point out that satellite TV providers like EchoStar and DirecTV struggled for nearly a decade before gaining enough subscribers to become profitable. Making consumers pay for radio service -- something they can always receive free -- could take longer than the companies predict. "These build-it-and-they-will-come projects take a lot of time to become accepted by consumers," said John Stone, a satellite industry analyst in New York who does not expect either company to become profitable before mid-2006. 
"EchoStar launched its satellite television service in 1996 and didn't become profitable until this year," Mr. Stone said. "It's made a lot of money for shareholders, but there was a lot of pain first. The question for satellite radio is, 'How long will investors be willing to endure the pain?' "
Mr. Jennings and his colleagues appear willing to wait at least another two years. Sirius's recapitalization plan provides enough cash for it to continue operating through the second quarter of 2004. Yet technical delays, like problems developing the special circuits needed for radios to pick up its signal, have put it far behind analysts' earlier estimates of 150,000 subscribers by the end of this year. The company finally started its national service in July, but it is only expected to have about 30,000 subscribers by Dec. 31. That is about half of what its executives predicted just a month ago.
For its part, XM has already signed up more than 200,000 subscribers and expects to nearly double that by year-end. But it has spent money even faster than Sirius. And without added financing, the company says it has only enough cash to operate into the first quarter of next year. XM's chief executive, Hugh Panero, said his company is in talks "with a number of private and strategic investors to raise additional capital."
OF course, the companies' financial problems have as much to do with a difficult economy as they do with the perils of introducing a radically different product. Both companies were started during the 1990's economic boom, and neither anticipated that the capital markets that financed their early growth would dry up. "They both knew they'd need additional funding down the road, but it took so long from the time they started that the market changed," said Bob Scherman, publisher of Satellite Business News, a trade publication in Washington. "No one's putting new money in the satellite business these days."
It was a different story a few years ago. Flush with about $1 billion each, XM and Sirius spent generously, building advanced studios and spacious offices, like the Sirius complex in the McGraw-Hill building in Midtown Manhattan. Soaring glass-enclosed spaces on either side of the reception area house a control room with a 20-foot-high screen showing its satellites' orbits and a large recording studio for musicians to perform live broadcasts. Thirty additional sound studios on the main floor are equipped with the latest digital recorders and linked through high-speed fiber optic cables. "It's a great playground for the artists," said Todd Stark, a Sirius program manager, as he demonstrated a recording of enthusiastic promotional messages from Sting, Tony Bennett and Ozzy Osbourne.
Executives at both companies say they are cutting costs. Since arriving at Sirius last year, its chief executive, Joseph P. Clayton, has consolidated the space in the McGraw-Hill building from three floors to two. "We're most focused on lowering our product costs so that we can sell the radios for less," Mr. Clayton said. "But we've also done lots of little things, like restricting the use of BlackBerrys and portable PC's. I don't even have one."
Cost-cutting won't sustain the company if subscribers don't begin signing up soon. And recent announcements about new digital radio products developed by iBiquity Digital and Motorola, which improve standard radio signals and add some features similar to those offered by satellite radio, like digital readouts of song titles, may cause consumers to hesitate in deciding which radio technology to choose. "There's no doubt that all this will confuse consumers," said Will Strauss, president of Forward Concepts, a market research firm in Tempe, Ariz. "And confusion always causes people to delay their buying decisions."
Splashy advertising campaigns like one begun last fall by XM have not fully cleared up consumers' questions. Television images of basketballs falling from the sky and rock stars like David Bowie crashing through rooftops caught viewers' attention, but industry analysts say they failed in a crucial way: showing consumers exactly how satellite radio works. That could change when thousands of auto dealerships begin demonstrating the product in new cars. But whether that will insure the success of XM and Sirius remains unclear. "My best guess is that you'll eventually see the two companies consolidate," said Mr. Scherman of Satellite Business. "And it's probably going to depend on whose money lasts the longest."
The prospect that one of his investments may go under doesn't cause Mr. Jennings of Oppenheimer to panic. "Rothschild once said, 'Buy when there's blood on the streets,' when everyone else is panicking," he said. "The current market panic is the deepest I've ever seen, so this has to be the best buying opportunity of my lifetime."
Leon D. Black, the financier who is the principal in Apollo, declined comment, but a spokesman said the fact that the company has increased its investment "suggests that it regards the outlook as positive."
For his part, Mr. Nelson doesn't care much which of the two competitors survives. "I just hope one of them does, because without satellite radio there's going to be nowhere to tune into Hank Williams, Lefty Frizzell, Merle Haggard and all the guys that I love to hear," Mr. Nelson said.
He currently gets his fill listening to XM's Frank's Place and Hank's Place channels, he said, but if XM were to fold, "maybe I can get a channel over at Sirius. I could call it Willie's Place."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
More Clouds Over Citigroup in its Dealings With Ebbers

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
THERE is no doubt that Bernard J. Ebbers, the founder and former chairman of WorldCom, was a top client for Citigroup and that his care and feeding were Job 1 at the firm. Between heaping his plate with almost one million shares of hot stock offerings and raising billions of dollars from investors to fund his business, Citigroup worked to keep Mr. Ebbers happy. 
 But a document that came to light recently indicates a relationship between Mr. Ebbers and Citigroup in one deal that is closer than previously known. The document, uncovered by the counsel to H. Carl McCall, the New York state comptroller, Democratic candidate for governor and the court-appointed lead plaintiff in a class-action suit against WorldCom, is a January 2001 filing with the Tennessee secretary of state by Joshua Timberlands, a company controlled by Mr. Ebbers. It shows Travelers Insurance, a Citigroup unit, as an equity owner in the company alongside Mr. Ebbers. 
 Set up by Mr. Ebbers in September 1999 to buy 460,000 acres of timber property from Kimberly-Clark, Joshua Timberlands is a private company. It paid $400 million for the land. Units of Travelers lent Mr. Ebbers $134 million on the deal.
Because the loan was high-risk, Travelers received a 2.5 percent equity stake in the company, which it still holds. The stake gives Travelers limited voting rights in Joshua matters, specifically granting it the right to block a bankruptcy filing by the company.
The Travelers loan to Joshua Timberlands was disclosed in Mr. McCall's complaint last month and had been turned up by his legal counsel at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann in New York and Barrack, Rodos & Bacine in Philadelphia. At the time, Citigroup did not mention an equity stake and declined to disclose the terms of the loan. It is unclear what interest rate Mr. Ebbers is paying. 
Citigroup did say that Travelers was a longtime lender to timber management companies and that the loan had nothing to do with WorldCom's extensive dealings with Salomon Smith Barney, Citigroup's brokerage unit. About eight months after Travelers made the loan and acquired the equity stake, WorldCom picked Salomon to be lead underwriter of $5 billion of its debt. 
"The information we've uncovered strengthens our case on behalf of the millions of unsuspecting investors who have paid too high a price for the WorldCom debacle," Mr. McCall said. 
"This information yet again shows the relationship between Citigroup and Mr. Ebbers went deeper than the investing public was led to believe and it is outrageous that these facts were not clearly disclosed to the investing public."
A spokeswoman for Citigroup said: "A small equity interest is a perfectly routine consideration for arranging a loan of this sort." She also said the equity interest was not substantive enough to require disclosure.
Another cloudy aspect of the Ebbers-Citigroup relationship is a loan that Citigroup's private bank made to Mr. Ebbers, using WorldCom stock as collateral. Citigroup declines to discuss this arrangement, but a loan to Mr. Ebbers from Citibank shows up in a filing in Mississippi, where WorldCom is based, dated Aug. 6, 1999. The Citibank loan is also mentioned in an April 2002 letter to Mr. Ebbers from WorldCom outlining the terms of the company's roughly $400 million loan to the former executive.
A LOAN between Citibank and Mr. Ebbers collateralized by WorldCom stock is intriguing because it would give Citigroup a reason to want to prop up WorldCom stock. And nobody was better at that than Jack B. Grubman, Salomon's former telecommunications analyst. 
On Aug. 20, 1999, when WorldCom shares were trading at $75.75, Mr. Grubman issued a strong buy recommendation on WorldCom stock, giving it a target price of $130. The stock never made it there. But he continued to rate it a buy until April 23 this year. Three months later, WorldCom filed for bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Companies That Seek Cures Now Fight for Life 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
WHEN the terror attacks halted air traffic last year, an exception was made for a private jet flying from Southern California to Washington. It carried sheets of human skin cells to treat people burned at the Pentagon.
 Now the manufacturer of that biotechnology product, Advanced Tissue Sciences, is itself in need of emergency aid. The company, based in San Diego, filed for bankruptcy protection last month and is still operating, although it has been unable to raise money. 
 "What we ran into was the change in the investment climate," said Abe Wischnia, the senior director for investor relations at Advanced Tissue Sciences. "A year or two ago, we would have had no trouble raising additional money." 
The biotechnology industry is facing one of its worst financial squeezes ever. The prices of many biotechnology stocks have plummeted, and Wall Street's vaults have snapped nearly shut, making it almost impossible for capital-hungry companies to finance themselves.
As a result, many companies are now fighting for their lives. About 35 percent of publicly traded biotechnology companies have less than a year's worth of cash left at their current spending levels, according to a recent survey by Merrill Lynch. Since the beginning of July, at least 45 biotechnology companies in the United States and Europe have announced layoffs or other cutbacks, according to BioCentury, a newsletter.
Among the companies in the most precarious positions are those whose research breakthroughs have attracted much attention in the past. Such technology often tends to be not only far-reaching, but also far out -- in terms of the time when it will start making money. These are exactly the types of businesses that risk-averse investors are now shunning.
The Alliance Pharmaceutical Corporation, just down the road from Advanced Tissue Sciences, was the subject of a front-page article two years ago in USA Today for its work developing a blood substitute, a chemical that could deliver oxygen to a patient's tissues when there was no blood available for a transfusion.
Today, Alliance is virtually out of money, unable to resume its clinical trials, down to 90 employees from 180 at its peak and delisted from the Nasdaq National Market. Desperate for cash, it recently borrowed $3 million -- at an annual interest rate of 100 percent.
Four years ago, the stock of Entremed soared to $85 a share after The New York Times reported that its experimental drugs had eradicated cancer in mice by cutting off the blood supply to their tumors. Now the stock is trading at $1.69, and the company, based in Rockville, Md., said in September that it had enough cash to last only through the end of the year.
But grabbing headlines does not always translate into business success. Sales have been slow for Advanced Tissue Sciences' artificial skin, which costs up to $600 a sheet and competes with ordinary bandages. Alliance halted a clinical trial of its blood substitute last year because some patients developed strokes, although the company says the product was not at fault. Entremed's drugs have not shown the same astounding results in people as they did in mice. Indeed, many of the companies hit hardest have spent tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on drugs and business plans that have failed, but only now are facing the day of reckoning.
Still, some analysts and executives say that if many companies fold, some useful technology may never be developed.
The recent bear market, of course, has been hard on many industries. But few depend as much as biotechnology does on investors willing to bet huge sums on technology that may not pay off for years, if ever.
"I see the biotechnology industry as always struggling, always fighting for capital," said Kevin W. Sharer, the chief executive of Amgen, the biggest company in the field and one of the relatively few that are profitable and therefore not that dependent on continually raising money from investors. In the future, he said, "it'll be a lot of losers and not very many winners."
Among the more troubled areas is one that has received much political and public attention in the last year -- stem cells and other aspects of "regenerative medicine," involving the regrowth of damaged organs. Despite the technology's long-term promise, profits are not expected for years, and some of the pioneers are ailing.
Organogenesis, of Canton, Mass., a competitor of Advanced Tissue Sciences in the artificial-skin business, filed for bankruptcy protection a few weeks ago. Nexell Therapeutics, of Irvine, Calif., which was working largely on blood stem cells, is liquidating itself. The Geron Corporation, the widely acknowledged leader in human embryonic stem cells, laid off 43 people, or 30 percent of its work force, in June.
"STEM cells has been a hot area with regard to the press, but it has not been a hot area with regard to investors," said Clayton I. Duncan, the chief executive of Incara Pharmaceuticals, a company based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., that worked on using liver stem cells to regrow diseased livers.
Incara, which had two drugs fail in clinical trials, ran out of cash at the end of September but has continued to operate. Two weeks ago, to save itself, Incara sold its liver stem cell business to concentrate on more traditional drugs.
Another sector that has suffered is bioinformatics, which uses computers to analyze masses of genetic data. Several young companies have gone out of business or been acquired for a pittance after sales did not meet expectations.
Companies pursuing another futuristic field -- tailoring medicines to patients by testing their genes -- have also fallen on hard times. Shares of Genaissance Pharmaceuticals, Variagenics and Interleukin Genetics are all selling at around $1; Interleukin has said that its existing cash will last only until January.
The biotechnology industry periodically goes through money droughts, but some say this one is the worst. "This is the first time we've had a bear market on top of a tough environment for biotech," said Jim Scopa, co-head of health care investment banking at Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco.
Many companies, however, have withstood the famine because they raised huge sums in 2000, when investors were in a frenzy about the deciphering of the human genome. The industry as a whole raised more than $30 billion that year, several times as much as in any previous year.
"The last stop at the gas station was two years ago, and people filled up their tanks very well," said Stelios Papadopoulos, a health care investment banker and vice chairman of S. G. Cowen Securities.
Still, the feeling of wealth led some companies to spend profligately. Like Internet start-ups, some biotechnology companies decided to spend heavily to build their business while ignoring the need for profits.
So now, even companies in no immediate danger of running out of money are slowing their "burn rate" -- the speed at which they go through cash -- in case the market downturn lasts for years.
DeCode Genetics, a company searching disease-causing genes in the relatively homogeneous population of Iceland, its home, cut 200 employees in September -- on the same day that it announced a collaboration with Merck & Company worth up to $90 million. In Alameda, Calif., Avigen, which is developing gene therapy to treat hemophilia, cut 28 percent of its work force last month so that its cash will last for four or five years instead of three, said John Monahan, the chief executive. Even Human Genome Sciences, with $1.5 billion in cash, and Abgenix, with $464 million, are facing investor pressure to preserve cash.
THE biggest shortage of financing has been from public investors. In the first three quarters this year, there were only five initial public offerings of stock by biotechnology companies worldwide and only 10 secondary offerings, according to Recombinant Capital, a consulting and research firm in Walnut Creek, Calif. Together, the stock sales raised $870 million, less than half the $1.9 billion raised in the first three quarters of 2001 and just a small fraction of the more than $12 billion in the same period of 2000.
The drought has shown some signs of easing. Four companies -- Trimeris, Tularik, Telik and NPS Pharmaceuticals -- have completed secondary stock offerings since late September, raising more than $300 million combined.
But all those companies have what most biotechnology companies lack: drugs that are close to reaching the market, and possible profits. Indeed, drug development companies are held in relatively good stead by investors compared with companies pursuing genomics, cell therapies or other exotic technologies.
With the public markets virtually closed, public companies can still raise money by selling stock privately to investors, though often on onerous terms. And venture capitalists still have ample money to invest in privately held start-ups.
But venture capitalists make their returns when those start-ups go public. With the market for public offerings effectively closed, venture capitalists are starting to cut back as well on the amounts of money they offer to companies.
"We're starting to see values fall pretty aggressively," said Brian G. Atwood, a managing director at Versant Ventures in Menlo Park, Calif. He added, "Almost every private company I know is considering doing a layoff."
In some cases, venture capitalists must now put additional money into companies in their portfolios that would normally have gone public by now, leaving less for new companies. And with the valuations of publicly traded companies so low, some venture firms are tempted to invest in public companies rather than private ones.
For public companies, raising money is difficult because their stock prices have been driven down, in part by a series of failures in clinical trials of drugs. About 16 percent of public biotechnology companies have market valuations lower than their cash on hand, according to Merrill Lynch, meaning that investors effectively assign no value to their technology. About 25 percent of biotechnology stocks have sold for less than $1 a share in the past year, according to Burrill & Company, an investment firm in San Francisco.
With prices so low, some stocks are being delisted or threatened with delisting by Nasdaq, making it even harder for companies to attract investors. Nasdaq is considering lowering its listing standards because so many stocks, not just biotechnology, have fallen so far.
Cygnus, which has never been profitable in its 17-year history, finally achieved what it thought was a breakthrough earlier this year when it began selling its GlucoWatch Biographer, a device worn by diabetics that continually monitors their blood sugar levels. But last month, Nasdaq told the company, based in Redwood City, Calif., that its stock would be delisted for trading at too low a price.
"There is a dichotomy," said John C. Hodgman, the chief executive of the company, which said it plans to appeal. "You're the strongest you've ever been, but you don't meet the requirements for remaining listed on the trading board."
Analysts said that they expect more companies to close or be acquired. "There was a massive overinvestment in the industry, and there is going to have to be a workout period where some companies fail," said Mark N. Lampert, who runs the Biotechnology Value Fund, an investment company in San Francisco.
Still, biotechnology companies often manage to hang on for years, even with a skeleton staff, hoping for a recovery like that of Amylin Pharmaceuticals of San Diego. Four years ago, Amylin laid off 80 percent of its employees and nearly closed after running into problems with its first drug. But two months ago, it licensed the rights to its second experimental drug, for diabetes, to Eli Lilly & Company in a deal that could bring Amylin up to $325 million.
"MANAGEMENT teams and founders are so passionate about what they are doing that they never believe it is going away," said Peter J. Crowley, the head of health care investment banking at CIBC World Markets. "They will stay at it until someone absolutely turns the lights out."
The Calypte Biomedical Corporation, which sells a urine test for the virus that causes AIDS, announced in April that it was winding down and preparing to file for bankruptcy. "We had gone as far as to box up the company," said Richard D. Brounstein, the chief financial officer.
But a month later, it got a new chairman, who has attracted more than $6 million to the company. Calypte, based in Alameda, has hired back most of its top management and is making its product again, though at the end of the third quarter its cash reserve was down again, to only $19,000.
The artificial-skin products of Advanced Tissue Sciences are being acquired by its marketing partner, Smith & Nephew of Britain, for $10 million plus the assumption of debt, so the technology will live on. Smith & Nephew hired 110 Advanced Tissue employees. An additional 70 were laid off, leaving 35 at the company.
The board of Advanced Tissue will decide soon whether the company should stay in business or shut down. If it stays open, Mr. Wischnia said, "this time the company is going to do it in a way that makes money."

HEADLINE: Sharon Gets His Chance to Fail 

BYLINE:  By Yossi Beilin; Yossi Beilin was Israel's justice minister in the government led by Ehud Barak.

DATELINE: TEL AVIV 

 BODY:
For the first time since Ariel Sharon was elected prime minister of Israel on Feb. 7, 2001, his policies will be put to the test by the Israeli public and world opinion. Having come to power on promises of bringing peace and security to Israel, he has subsequently tried to hint that despite his brilliant ideas, he is constantly being stymied by his coalition partners in the Labor Party. Mr. Sharon continues to imply that he is forced to sacrifice his effective plans for the lofty ideal of "national unity."
 The national unity government in Israel was wrong from the start, though many Israelis have tried to deny this. After most of the highest ranking Knesset members from the Labor Party had resigned from the Knesset or refused to serve in a government under Mr. Sharon, most of the Labor Party ministers who entered the government were a group of backbenchers headed by Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, a group determined not to give up its rare and unexpectedly elevated share of power. 
 For Mr. Sharon, this was a real lifesaver, since the political right does not have a majority in the Knesset and, without a coalition, he cannot govern. Shimon Peres's surprising willingness to act as foreign minister in such a government gave Mr. Sharon a coalition majority and, more to the point, legitimacy for a string of actions that undermined, stage by stage, all elements of the peace process that had been painstakingly built by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mr. Peres himself in the 1990's. The result is that Palestinian-Israeli relations have reached their lowest point since the Six-Day War in 1967.
There was no genuine meeting of interests behind the unity government. It did not manage to provide any problem-solving approach that could bring together the left and right. Instead, Mr. Sharon managed to drag the Labor Party into the gradual escalation of the conflict with the Palestinians (who did not sit idly by, and gave him plenty of fuel for the fire), while Labor's great "triumph" was its efforts, at the occasional government meeting, to prevent Mr. Sharon from taking even more extreme measures. The truth, incidentally, is that in most cases it was the United States government that acted to prevent particularly extreme measures.
The disbanding of the government was inevitable and healthy. The pretext for the dissolution -- disagreement over approval of the national budget -- was of secondary importance, not unlike the small disputes that can be the cause of divorce in an unsuitable marriage. But it is a pity that for 20 months, the Israeli public has been paying the price for the absence of an opposition force in the Israeli parliamentary regime. In that time, they have come to live with fading hopes of peace, the result of which has been the weakest economy in a decade. 
The new political situation, however, creates new and encouraging possibilities. If Mr. Sharon manages to form a narrow, right-wing government, he will no longer be able to claim that he is being held back by Labor's peace camp. He will then have to prove at last whether, after dictating the supposedly logical formula of "no negotiations under fire" and using that position to veto negotiations with any gun owner in the Middle East, he is actually capable of bringing peace and security to Israel.
Should it be that he does indeed have a security plan that is full of original solutions and can be implemented, then public opinion will surely reward him in the next general elections in 2003. But if Mr. Sharon's true agenda is revealed, and it turns out -- as I believe it will -- that he has no solution whatsoever, other than living from day to day and putting off the moment of truth for as long as he possibly can, then it is almost certain that he will pay the price in the next elections. 
And as far as the Labor Party is concerned, it cannot go to the next elections under the leadership of the group that has supported Mr. Sharon for the last 20 months. In this month's vote for the next leader of the Labor Party, it is vital that a candidate advocating peace be elected, someone who can present a genuine alternative to the present policy of paying lip service to any solution put forward (the Mitchell Report, the Tenet Plan, President Bush's vision as laid out in his speech on June 24 and the Bush administration's new "road map," recently presented to the two sides) with no intention of implementing it.
The alternative plan presented by the Labor Party must make one promise, loud and clear: During its next term in government, the border between Israel and the Palestinian state will be determined, thus guaranteeing Israel's future as a democratic Jewish nation. All efforts will be devoted, during the first year of the government, to reaching an agreed solution with the Palestinian Authority (without any preconditions as to who its leader will be, and without giving the terrorist organizations the opportunity to stop negotiations through violence).
And if such efforts should fail, then Israel will carry out a unilateral withdrawal to borders that Israel itself shall determine, including a full withdrawal from Gaza and the vast majority of the West Bank, with evacuation of all the settlements in those areas from which it withdraws. 
If this is the basis for the elections in Israel to be held next year, then new hope will arise for change in the Middle East -- after two years of Palestinian violence, Israeli retaliation, hundreds of Israeli victims, thousands of Palestinian victims and the fatalistic view, however unjustified, that the right to live in peace is not to be granted to the inhabitants of the Middle East.

Stocks Thrive on Downbeat Economic News

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Despite weak reports on jobs, consumer confidence and manufacturing, the three main stock indexes had their fourth consecutive weekly gain last week.
 The plunge of consumer confidence to a nine-year low in October, the loss of 5,000 jobs last month and a further slowdown in manufacturing all dimmed the economic outlook. 
But in some ways, the negative reports appeared to help the market. Many investors believe that the news will be enough to convince Federal Reserve policy makers to cut their benchmark interest rate by one-quarter point, to 1.5 percent, when they meet on Wednesday, the day after Election Day. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, led by Hewlett-Packard and Intel, rose 73.65 points, or 0.9 percent, to 8,517.64. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, led by AES and the Williams Companies, climbed 3.31 points, or 0.4 percent, to 900.96. The Nasdaq composite index, led by Vitesse Semiconductor and Andrx, rose 29.57 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,360.70.
 Bond prices rose and yields fell early in the week on the hope for a Fed rate cut. Some of those gains were lost on Friday as stocks rallied. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 3.90 percent from 4.09 percent a week earlier. JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

Again, a Latin American Exile Turns Into a New Yorker

BYLINE:  By Simon Romero (COMPILED BY HUBERT B. HERRING) 

 BODY:
Domingo Cavallo is not the first prominent Latin American to find himself in temporary exile in New York. Jose Marti, the father of Cuban independence, wrote some of his best-known poems while working in New York as a journalist. 
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, the five-time president of Mexico, lived part of his 19th-century exile on Staten Island.
 After Mr. Cavallo emerged from 65 days in an Argentine jail earlier this year, he accepted a job as visiting professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. 
Mr. Cavallo, a Harvard-educated economist who was once Argentina's economy minister, fell into disfavor after the economy collapsed. He is now seeking to stay involved in politics through regular postings on his Web site. Among his proposals: letting Argentines save again in dollars instead of pesos. 
Mr. Cavallo, 56, is also using his sojourn to defend his reputation after he was accused of approving illegal arms dealings in the 1990's. He was released from jail in June after the charges were dropped. 
"These days, I'm dedicated to reuniting with my family," he said in a letter to supporters. Simon Romero

HEADLINE: Help for the City's Neediest 

 BODY:
Great resources will be needed to restore what terrorists obliterated in New York 14 months ago. But there is another void in this city: the social, emotional and economic emptiness of New York's poorest and weakest people. The faltering economy and the impact of September 11 has hit hardest the people with the smallest expectations, who required very little to go wrong before they went from living on the edge to falling off. 
 Helping these fragile New Yorkers will become an even greater challenge in the months ahead. City services for the needy are destined for ever-deeper budget cuts in the current fiscal crisis. In the last three years, the number of homeless families seeking shelter has gone up 55 percent. Food banks and soup kitchens are facing larders so emptied by growing need -- meals for more than one million people every day -- they have had to turn away hungry children. And while the number of senior citizens in the city has grown significantly, assistance to them has not. 
 The people of New York long have taken to heart the adage that charity begins at home. One way to help is through The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Since 1912, the people who care about New York have given generously to the fund, last year contributing a record $9.8 million.
Every cent raised -- the Times pays all administration costs -- helps the work of seven local charities, including the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service; the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York; the Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens; the Children's Aid Society; the Community Service Society of New York; the UJA-Federation of New York; and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, Inc.
These organizations offer hope for people with few or no places to turn. Your contribution to the fund's 90th campaign can help make that difference. Send your checks to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, 4 Chase Metrotech Center, 7th Floor East, Lockbox 5193, Brooklyn 11245. You also may contribute using a credit card online at www.nytimes.com/neediest, or by telephone at (212) 556-5851, extension 7.

U.S. Savings Bonds at a High Point

BYLINE:  By KARL RUSSELL

 BODY:
Suddenly, United States savings bonds are looking very good.
 While many investors continue to lose money in the stock market, owners of savings bonds are seeing some attractive yields. 
 The yield on the most widely held savings bond -- the EE series, the kind people used to give as gifts -- is currently 3.25 percent. That's far above the average yield on a one-year certificate of deposit, now 1.73 percent, and much better than rates on money market or savings accounts. 
Downturns in the stock market generally bolster bond sales, as investors flee to safety. But the Treasury Department has also made it easier to buy savings bonds by offering them online, at www.treasurydirect.gov. It has also tried to make the bonds more appealing by inscribing "patriot bond" on some of them. KARL RUSSELL

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE INITIATIVES; 
Voters to Consider Ballot Proposals on Marijuana Use, Bilingual Schools and Pigs

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Voters in dozens of states will face a series of initiatives and referendums when they go to the polls next week, including proposals to expand after-school programs in California, abolish bilingual education in Massachusetts, decriminalize Nevadans' personal use of marijuana and, in Florida, set new guidelines for the confinement of pregnant pigs.
 Oregon has two of the most closely watched and intensely fought ballot initiatives. The more ambitious would provide comprehensive health care for all residents, with financing coming in part from new personal income and payroll taxes. A second measure would require labels identifying genetically engineered foods sold in the state. 
 Such proposals are among 203 measures, including 49 citizens' initiatives, in 40 states. Fueled by petitions, the citizens' initiatives seek to bypass the traditional legislative process and compel a popular vote on a sensitive question. The process, which became well known during the 1970's tax revolt in California and gained steam throughout the 90's on issues like term limits, appears to be falling out of favor, with 20 fewer initiatives on the ballot this year than in 2000, analysts say.
The traditional questions that appeared on ballots over the past decade -- campaign finance reform, tax limitations and term limits -- have largely been replaced by measures involving education, drug policy and election processes, said Jennie Drage Bowser, a policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver.
"The darlings of the initiative movement are missing this year," she said. "The term limit movement has clearly run out of steam."
Another visible change has been the increasing presence of national interest groups behind certain initiatives. National organizations promoting changes in drug policy, education and animal rights have provided critical help in placing initiatives on ballots.
"It's becoming less common to see grass-roots, homegrown ideas," Ms. Bower said. "It's almost as if these groups have found a new way to achieve their policy goals."
On education, there are 11 citizen initiatives and 13 measures referred to voters by State Legislatures.
Voters in Massachusetts and Colorado will consider proposals to ban bilingual education in public schools in favor of English immersion programs. The measures are sponsored by Ron K. Unz, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who successfully led similar initiatives in California in 1998 and in Arizona in 2000.
Mr. Unz predicted that Question 2 would prevail in Massachusetts, despite what he said was the united opposition of elected officials and the failure of his group to spend any money on advertising in the state. "We're in a very strong position," he said. But a well-financed drive against Amendment 31 in Colorado suggests "it's going to be a lot tougher" there, he said.
There are many spending measures. In California, the legislature has put $12.5 billion in school bond measures on the ballot. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the actor and a possible candidate for governor in 2006, has promoted an initiative that would expand tutoring and other after-school programs at a cost officials estimate at $400 million a year. 
In Florida, an initiative would require the state to offer free preschool for all 4-year-old children, at an estimated cost of $277 million a year.
North Dakota, seeking to keep its young residents, would partly reimburse them for student loans and establish a $1,000 annual tax credit for five years for residents 21 to 25.
On drug policy, measures in the District of Columbia and Ohio would require that certain nonviolent drug users be given substance abuse treatment rather than face jail.
In Nevada, voters will be asked to legalize the possession of up to three ounces of marijuana for anyone 21 years or older. Question 9 would also require the state to regulate the sale of marijuana to medical patients.
"It's clear there is a trend against the drug war and in the failure to reform drug laws," said Ethan Nadelmann, the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance.
Law enforcement groups say leniency will encourage people to try drugs. "Nothing focuses the mind like adverse consequences," said Jim Pasco, a spokesman for the Fraternal Order of Police in Washington.
On election reform, voters in California and Colorado will consider initiatives that would allow same-day registration at the polls. Advocates say the procedure, in place in six states, has increased voter turnout.
On term limits, only a few states are weighing in, because most of those with initiative authority have already acted. The most contentious issue is in Idaho, where a referendum tries to overcome the State Legislature's repeal of term limits.
Two states are considering significant tax cuts. Arkansas voters face an initiative to do away with taxes on food and medicine, at an estimated cost of $562 million a year. In heavily taxed Massachusetts, Question 1 would eliminate the state's personal income tax, eliminating as much as $9 billion in annual revenues. 
In California and Washington, ballot propositions would compel spending on easing traffic flows. California's Proposition 51 would dedicate 30 percent of some revenues on car sales from a general fund to a traffic relief fund. In Washington, a proposed 9 cent per gallon increase in the gasoline tax would help pay for a $7.7 billion investment in transit. 
Animal rights advocates have placed several initiatives on the ballot, including calls to curtail cockfighting in Oklahoma and Arkansas. In Florida, voters will decide whether to make it illegal to cage a pregnant sow. The Humane Society says "gestation crates" used in hog farms are too restrictive and cruel.
Hunters and trappers have sought to counter the proliferation of animal welfare initiatives in some states, including Oklahoma, which would nearly double the number of signatures required to get on the ballot.
Perhaps inevitably, there are more initiatives on initiatives. Voters in four states -- Florida, Montana, Oklahoma and Oregon -- will be asked to amend their initiative process. In Florida, the proposal requires that an economic impact report accompany all proposed amendments to the Constitution that the Legislature presents to voters.

HEADLINE: Climate Talks Shift Focus to How to Deal With Changes 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
The global climate is changing in big ways, probably because of human actions, and it is time to focus on adapting to the impacts instead of just fighting to limit the warming. That, in a nutshell, was the idea that dominated the latest round of international climate talks, which ended on Friday in New Delhi. 
 While many scientists have long held this view, it was a striking departure for the policy makers at the talks -- the industry lobbyists, environmental activists and government officials. For more than a decade, their single focus had been the fight over whether to cut smokestack and tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping greenhouse gases. 
 Many environmentalists had long avoided discussing adaptation for fear it would smack of defeatism. 
Experts espousing the views of industry were thrilled with the shift in New Delhi. 
"By building capabilities to deal with climate change, we'll be much better off than by just paying attention to global warming," said Myron Ebell, who directs climate policy for the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a private group that opposes regulatory approaches to environmental problems. 
Although they conceded its importance, environmental campaigners said an approach that focused on adapting to climate change rather than preventing it would inevitably fail, because the impact of unfettered emissions would eventually exceed people's ability to adjust. 
Moreover, many said, coral reefs, alpine forests and other fragile ecosystems -- without the resiliency of human societies -- would simply be unable to cope with fast-changing conditions. 
The change in attitude, expressed in the negotiations and in a formal declaration adopted Friday, has been partly driven by unusual weather this year -- record floods in Europe, landslides in the Himalayas, searing drought in southern Asia and Africa. 
No single weather event can be linked to human-caused warming. But as the costs of weather-related disasters rise, unease about climate change rises, too. So far this year, unusual weather is blamed for 9,400 deaths and $56 billion in damage, according to the United Nations and insurers, and deaths and costs have been rising for years. 
Another impetus is the rising realization that many significant shifts have already been set in motion by a century-long accumulation of warming gases. 
Even if emissions stopped today, some experts say, the volume of greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere would slowly raise sea levels for a century or two as warmed water expands and terrestrial ice melts. The result would be coastal erosion and salt water intrusion into water supplies.
The new focus suits the agendas of the Bush administration and many developing countries, which for different reasons want to avoid cutting emissions of the warming gases. But some environmental campaigners say the shift will discourage efforts to cut dependence on fossil fuels like coal and oil, the main source of the offending gases, in favor of building dikes, designing hardier crops or other engineering fixes. 
"Adaptation is like the 'wear sunglasses and a hat' theory of fighting ozone depletion," said Kert Davies, the research director for Greenpeace, referring to the Reagan-era debate over chemicals that were weakening the earth's atmospheric shield against harmful radiation.
In that case, the offending synthetic chemicals were banned under a 1987 treaty, but only because damage to the ozone layer had become vividly apparent in satellite images -- and because industry had come up with alternatives. 
But no ready substitutes exist for cheap, plentiful fossil fuels. Many experts say the use of coal and oil is bound to keep rising for decades, particularly as poor countries climb the economic ladder from bicycles and water buckets to cars and washing machines. 
Conservative policy analysts said proposed curbs on fuel use were thus unrealistic and unjustified, while making countries more resilient to extremes of weather made sense for many reasons. One goal, Mr. Ebell said, should be to enable low-lying countries like Bangladesh to respond to typhoons the way Florida responds to hurricanes. 
There are also ways to foster development in poor countries that limit harm from climate change. Experts say that in semi-arid zones in Africa and Asia, agricultural assistance could improve farmers' ability to endure heat and drought. 
In some areas, adaptation is already under way. In the Himalayas, some communities, with the help of the United Nations, are installing alarm systems to warn of flash floods as expanding lakes of glacial meltwater grow to the bursting point in the next decade. 
Low-lying island nations, like the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, have been watching the slow rise of the seas for decades and have not only been planning to build storm barriers, but possibly to evacuate entirely at some point. 
The emphasis on adapting is a profound turnabout from the course set a decade ago after President George Bush and other world leaders signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Though that treaty and subsequent addenda contained vague commitments by industrial nations to help vulnerable countries adapt, the emphasis was always about curbing emissions to prevent dangerous changes in the climate system. 
Adaptation got support in New Delhi because it suits both the current Bush administration, which has tried to shift debate away from emissions reductions, and developing countries, which have expressed frustration at the developed world's inertia in limiting its own emissions and its delays in pledged aid. 
At the meeting, poorer countries did not quite say it was their turn to pollute but, led by the host country, they did demand the right to grow out of destitution, a path that will require vast use of existing fuel reserves -- mainly coal. 
Opening the plenary session last Wednesday, India's prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said per capita use of such fuels by the world's poorest populations was a fraction of that of people in the industrial powers. Mitigating fuel use, he said, "will bring additional strain to the already fragile economies of the developing countries." 
The adaptation issue also got support from a new scientific analysis, published Friday, suggesting that the only way to safely stabilize greenhouse gases by midcentury was with a hugely ambitious Apollo-size research program on fusion, solar power, and other nonpolluting energy sources. 
The lead authors of that study echoed other experts in saying it was nearly inconceivable that the Bush administration or Congress would finance such a costly crash program. 
They also said that modest emission reductions called for under the Kyoto Protocol, a climate treaty supported by Europe and Japan, would not be enough to spur governments and businesses to seek the necessary technological shift. The protocol, an addendum to the 1992 climate convention, is moving toward taking legal force sometime next year, when Russia is expected to ratify it. But President Bush has rejected it, and without the adherence of the United States, the world's biggest source of greenhouse gases, the Kyoto pact's impact on climate will be negligible, scientists and treaty experts say. 
Still, some experts said Kyoto's significance should not be discounted. "Your first trip to the gym doesn't improve your health, but you've got to get into a regular habit," said David D. Doniger, the director of climate policy for the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group. "Kyoto is that first trip. It provides a structure to build on." 
Mr. Doniger and other veterans of the climate wars with varying perspectives said the best -- and perhaps only -- hope lay in a blend of all of the above: a mix of finding ways to improve energy efficiency now; to protect the most vulnerable countries and ecosystems from accelerating change; and to push the technological frontier to determine if any far-flung solutions can come to the rescue. 
Dr. Martin I. Hoffert, the New York University physicist who led the new clean-energy study, said he was confident that technology held an eventual solution. "We started World War II with biplanes, and seven years later had jets," he said. 
But he and other climate experts acknowledged that wartime innovations emerged in crisis, not ahead of a slow-moving environmental shift.

Homeless in the Hamptons: Here, It's the Poor Who Are Different

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
MIDDLE-CLASS year-rounders in the Hamptons come to accept the miles of millionaires inching Porsches through summertime traffic to the next tent party.
 But they did not expect this influx from the other extreme. 
 The newest East Enders are homeless, 329 of them, crammed into Southampton motels for months on end as Suffolk County scrounges for space for a homeless population that has more than doubled since 1999.
Suddenly year-round residents are wedged between the entitled rich and the entitlement programs of the poor. 
At the Tuckahoe public school here, where 22 of 327 students are homeless, Dr. Richard Olcott, the interim superintendent, said: "I'm dealing with discipline problems I never had to deal with. Not that they're wicked children. They're used to an undisciplined environment."
More undisciplined than, say, Lizzie Grubman, the misbehaving rich girl who once tried Southampton's patience?
It is a short trip from one end of the spectrum to the other. You can drive a secluded lane and peek through high hedges at one Versailles after another. Then you can wander behind the hedge at the Southampton Bays motel, and Deborah Johnson, 35, an unemployed nursing assistant, will give you a tour of the two rooms she shares with her nine children.
"This bed," she said, "it's me and my 5-year-old, my 4-year-old, my 6-year-old, my 10-year-old." That's five if you lost count.
At the nearby Olympia motel, Patty Gibbs said it was tough keeping her young sons in one room. There's a yard behind the motel, but she said the owners "don't want the grass messed up."
From Ken Drange's viewpoint, "it's an instant ghetto." Mr. Drange, a financial planner, lives near one of the motels in a neighborhood of teachers and small-business owners, which he says has endured noise, occasional rock-throwing and harassment from teenagers trapped in motels without transportation or recreation.
Southampton is suing the county, claiming that motels for the homeless violate zoning laws. The Tuckahoe School is considering a lawsuit seeking to remove at least some homeless children.
Families from around the county are here because the motels, used before for shorter homeless stays, agreed to take them indefinitely for up to $165 a night per room. Perhaps it's fitting the homeless are here. Affordable housing is an oxymoron in the New York region, and Southampton's $650,000 median housing price is one of many illustrations why. The real estate market is a centrifuge, flinging out anyone without a weighty wallet.
Unlike the rich, who generate restaurants, antique shops and marinas to serve them, the poor have arrived with one need after another.
THE town, filling gaps in the county services, takes families to a nutrition center and had summer activities for children. A private human resources program has helped, but is stretched thin, said Mary Ann Tupper, the director. The summer crowd loves benefits, but, she said, "we don't have celebrities who are interested in helping the underclass here."
Maybe they don't know what's behind the motel hedge.
Coats for the homeless are in short supply. So it was jarring to see two women in Southampton Village walking dogs outfitted in what can only be described as canine belly shirts.
To accommodate homeless children, the Tuckahoe School, whose enrollment is 25 percent minority, added a teacher, bus service, English language resources and nursing care. Despite state aid, Dr. Olcott said, local taxpayers will pay, and he expects more homeless children.
He said it was cruel for any student to have to study in a crowded motel room. "He's got no light," he said. "He's got no space. He's got no shot."
But Detra Smith said that although the motel is cramped and has cockroaches, the school is great. "My daughter has a speech problem, and they're doing everything they can to help," she said. "I love that school."
The Hamptons are catching on at the motel. Deborah Johnson left her oldest teenagers in charge of the children one night last summer, and with another homeless mother drove a Ford Pinto among the Porsches and Hummers to a hot nightclub. "I had fun," she said. "I met two girls from Southampton. They gave me their number and said to call if I wanted to hang."
She took her kids to the beach and ogled East Hampton's jewelry shows. She felt that same tug that draws the wealthy here every summer, to the chagrin of year-rounders.
"It's serene," the new East Ender said. "I love the beach. The beach houses are beautiful. I wouldn't mind living out here."

HEADLINE: Parched Santa Fe Makes Rare Demand on Builders 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., Oct. 26 

 BODY:
Against the backdrop of the snowcapped Sangre de Cristo Mountains, the building lots stand ready, platforms for more new homes on the way to this steadily growing mecca in New Mexico's high desert.
 But before a single nail is pounded, builders like Mike Gibbs now face an additional, unusual hurdle. For every new home they build in Santa Fe, they must first install, free of charge, 8 to 12 new high-efficiency toilets in existing homes, hotels and shops. 
 The purpose is to save water in a community with no more room for waste. Overtapped by drought and development, Santa Fe's current water supply can barely keep up with demand. The margins are so narrow that a bitterly divided City Council ruled in September that new construction could proceed only if its effects were offset by builders' swapping out old water-wasting toilets. The bigger the new home, the more new toilets must go in somewhere else. 
Builders like Mr. Gibbs, a thickly built man of 41, are grudgingly going along with the new rules, since the alternative could be more severe: some Council members have sought a moratorium on construction.
But that does not make the builders any happier about what they see as a growing tendency to use water as a cudgel against growth.
"I got into this business to build new homes," Mr. Gibbs said. "In order to keep building, I'm in the toilet business."
In one sense, the new rules are just the latest tactic by Santa Fe's leaders to protect a city whose distinctive style, dictated by strict building codes, has attracted a growing influx of people. But more broadly, the rules speak to the kinds of hard choices and questions surfacing in communities across the West, where water supplies are being stretched to the limit by population growth and years of drought.
Among the questions is whether there can be more growth without more water, how to acquire new water supplies, and what to do if such efforts fail.
"Obviously you can't do anything about the drought, and until you start issuing passports out of City Hall, you're not going to stop people from moving here," said Karl H. Sommer, who represents the Santa Fe Area Homebuilders Association, a fierce opponent of any building moratorium. "So it's time that someone began talking about supply."
Karen Heldmeyer, a city councilwoman who favors an all-out building moratorium, said the realistic approach would be for Santa Fe to begin to live within its limits.
"I'm not in favor of slowing down growth just to slow down growth," she said. "But I think everyone in town understands that there's a relationship between growth and water use. And I don't want people who already live here to be in a perpetual stage of water shortage."
Toilets are second only to outdoor sprinklers and garden hoses in consumption of domestic water supplies in the United States. Since 1994, federal law has required that all toilets in new homes be low-flow models, which use about 1.6 gallons per flush. 
But that law does not affect existing homes' many millions of older toilets, which tend to use more than twice that amount. Only now are communities trying to find ways to speed their replacement. Some, like Los Angeles, have used subsidies to encourage homeowners to make the switch. But other than Santa Fe, only one American city, San Luis Obispo, Calif., has experimented with a mandatory swap-out.
Santa Fe's replacement program has the potential to be the largest yet, with permit-hungry builders installing about 4,000 toilets a year, at a cost of $250 to $300 each, in the homes and businesses of civic-minded residents and merchants.
Santa Fe's population, now about 66,000, is increasing about 1.5 percent a year; Santa Fe County, of which it is the seat, is growing at 3.5 percent. For decades, almost nothing has been done to ensure that water supplies keep pace with that growth. Santa Fe's main water sources -- the Santa Fe River and city-owned wells -- have been depleted in recent years by overuse and periodic drought, including the current one, among the worst on record.
To cope, Santa Fe has already cut domestic water consumption. Its average total water use -- 145 gallons per person per day for homes and businesses -- has fallen 20 percent since 1995 and is one of the lowest in the West.
Even so, by this summer the level at its main reservoir had fallen to just 22 percent of capacity, with only a tiny faction of that considered usable. Since April, the city has enforced its strictest water-use limitations in years, including a ban on filling residential swimming pools and a rule that hotels change sheets and towels only every four days.
Still, there were days this summer, said Dale Marie Doremus, environmental projects coordinator for Santa Fe's water department, when "we were teetering on the brink," with water supplies barely keeping up with demand.
At the same time, the demand for building permits had surged. By mid-July, the city had issued 473 permits this year for new single-family homes -- more in seven months than in any full year since 1990. At one point, the City Council did pass a building moratorium, only to rescind it later under pressure from the home builders and their supporters. The builders argued that such a move would amount to a closing of Santa Fe's borders and could have a severe economic effect. 
On average, city officials say, the toilet rules that were adopted last month are expected to add $3,000 to $4,000 to the cost of a new home, in a market where the median price is now about $265,000. But that additional cost does not include what builders like Mr. Gibbs say is considerable time spent contacting hotels, businesses and homeowners, looking for places to put new toilets.
The toilet rules are to be reviewed in March, when studies aimed at clarifying Santa Fe's water picture are to be completed. At that time, the City Council is supposed to come up with a formal water budget specifying how much water, if any, can be spared for new development, and whether savings are needed elsewhere.
The builders and their allies, including City Councilman Matthew Ortiz, say a long-term solution must include new water supplies for Santa Fe, partly entailing the spending of millions of dollars on infrastructure to take advantage of the city's rights to divert large quantities from the Colorado portion of the San Juan River. 
But experts like Ms. Doremus, the city water official, say that even in the long term, increasing competition for water in the state and across the West will make it hard for Santa Fe to acquire substantial new sources.
"There's a finite amount of water," she said. "There are no hidden reserves. And what we're saying is that we don't have a lot of water to set aside for growth."

HEADLINE: Egypt Shores Up Security, but Tourism Is Shaky 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

DATELINE: LUXOR, Egypt, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
A pair of stone lions that guarded the temple of Queen Hatshepsut some 3,500 years ago are long gone, replaced by police officers in everyday clothes who tote compact machine guns inside their cheap suit jackets.
 It is five years since the massacre of 58 tourists and 4 Egyptians by Islamic militants at the temple, an attack that virtually shut down tourism in Egypt. But a police crackdown and a security regimen have proved so tough -- even sugar cane fields must be set back from roads to deny cover -- that the tourists have come back. 
 Tourism accounts for 12 percent of the economy, and 1 in 7 jobs, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt. But of late it is a decidedly unstable industry, wracked by the Sept. 11 attacks, jitters over Iraq and the violence in Israel and the West Bank, as well as economic troubles around the world. 
"When you open today any magazine or TV program, the only thing you hear is Bush saying, 'We want to hit Iraq,' " said Roger Tabet, managing director of Orascom Hotels Holding, which owns hotels at El Gouna, on the Red Sea coast. "If you take an average guy in Germany drinking his beer, or in England, what will he think? He will say, 'I will not stay in a country that's a neighbor of Israel, secondly an Islamic country and third, people are thinking Iraq is next door!' "
In 2000, 5.4 million people visited Egypt and accounted for $4.3 billion in revenues. A year later, jarred by the terror attacks in the United States and the war in Afghanistan, visitors fell to 4.7 million and revenues to $3.8 million, according to the Tourism Ministry. 
Visits by Americans have plunged, while more Arabs are trading Egypt for the United States, where they fear harassment because of an anti-Arab backlash. Fewer visitors are going to the historic sites like Luxor, but Red Sea beach resorts are doing well, though stays are short.
At the 133-year-old Mena House Oberoi near the Pyramids of Giza, only 5 percent of the guests are American, said Rajiv Kaul, the general manager, who is offering perks like guaranteed Pyramid views, late checkouts and free extra nights to attract guests. He said the killing last week in Jordan of the American diplomat Laurence Foley caused a medical company to move its conference from Amman to the Mena House.
In many ways, Luxor is typical. It looks as though it is booming. Tour boats glide up the Nile along with feluccas as groups of Russians, Germans, Italians and Japanese crowd the temples.
But people in the industry are worried. "I have no other work without this," said Michel, 62, a tour guide who only gave his first name and has been toiling under the sun for 28 years. "Without this, I am useless. I am broken." 
Some estimates say that up to 80 percent of the population in Luxor and its environs depends on foreign visitors. They include hotel employees, boat pilots, ticket takers or the villagers who help produce the endless supply of alabaster and granite bowls, Nefertiti heads and cats, and who earn $4.40 to $6.50 a day, about the cost of a ticket to the monuments.
Sherif Morgan lost his business at a Red Sea resort after the Sept. 11 attacks. He came back home to Luxor and found a job at a trinkets shop on the main street, where the owners valued his garrulous English and bonhomie with tourists. But nobody was buying, he said. They are aloof, perhaps out of fear. "They are here, but don't want to have contact with Egyptians," he said.
A brief survey of hotels showed that most were about three-quarters full, although the historic Winter Palace, whose guests have included Agatha Christie and Noel Coward, was fully booked. That is not bad for the beginning of the season, which runs until April. But nearly all here complain that too many people are coming for too brief a time.
For now, the government crackdown has crushed the Islamist threat, which also was hurt by popular resentment among the local people who lost their jobs and revulsion at the attack on Nov. 17, 1997, when six attackers shot and stabbed mainly Swiss, British and Japanese victims in a 45-minute rampage. The attack prefigured the bombing on Oct. 12 in Bali, which struck at the tourist lifeblood of Indonesia. 
Corporate groups are also putting Egyptian travel on hold. Elhamy ElZayat, chairman of Emeco Travel, a major company that handles mostly corporate tours and conferences, said he expected that out of 110 requests for tours next year, only 10 would pan out. He noted that the trend was for individuals to make travel plans at the last minute, so the gap could be filled.
At Luxor, security is less visible these days than it was six months ago, but checkpoints remain at important intersections and Interior Ministry guards in black berets can be seen standing behind rolling metal shields along the road. A police post is visible atop the tawny limestone hill from which the Hatshepsut temple was carved. Tourists must pass through metal detectors at most monuments.
"We see security has been imposed," said Jana Haut, 34, of Kassel, Germany, who said she had no qualms about visiting. "There's more hesitation about flying to the U.S.A. There's anthrax, there's the towers and now the Washington sniper."

HEADLINE: NORTH KOREA SAYS NUCLEAR PROGRAM CAN BE NEGOTIATED 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
North Korea says it wants to negotiate with the United States over the North's newly disclosed nuclear weapons program, and is open to meeting the Bush administration's demand that it shut down its previously secret uranium-enrichment facilities.
 In a series of statements issued over the last week by its mission to the United Nations, North Korea said "everything will be negotiable," including the dismantling of the enrichment program. 
 Last month, North Korea acknowledged that the uranium facilities were part of a secret program to build nuclear weapons in violation of a 1994 agreement with the United States. The 1994 accord provided for energy aid and other assistance to North Korea. 
In the statements released through its United Nations mission in New York, North Korea also said it was open to discussion of international inspections of the uranium facilities.
The State Department said it had no official response to the North Korea statements, which were made in an interview with a senior North Korean diplomat and subsequent written statements to The New York Times, contacts that the North Korean Mission at the United Nations initiated.
But administration officials said they doubted that the United States would waver in its refusal to resume negotiations with North Korea until it first dismantled the enrichment laboratories.
The United States is pressing its allies to isolate North Korea, using the North's desperate economic needs to force it to comply with the American demands. On Friday, Under Secretary of State John R. Bolton ruled out talks with North Korea until it "completely and verifiably" ended the nuclear weapons program. He said it was "hard to see how we can have conversations with a government that has blatantly violated its agreements."
In their statements over the last week, the North Koreans said they were equally firm that they would not consider dismantling the uranium facilities until after the United States had reopened talks. If the United States refused to negotiate, they said, they would welcome the intervention of an intermediary, like former President Jimmy Carter or other prominent American political figures.
"Everything will be negotiable," the North Korean government said in one of the statements issued through Ambassador Han Song Ryol of the mission at the United Nations, the country's sole diplomatic post in the United States. "Our government will resolve all U.S. security concerns through the talks, if your government has a will to end its hostile policy."
In the interview in the mission -- a small, nondescript suite of offices decorated with images of the nation's absolute leader, Kim Jong Il, and his late father, Kim Il Sung -- Mr. Han said his government had been "stunned" by the refusal of the United States to continue talks on the nuclear issue.
In North Korea, "the interpretation is that the U.S. is preparing for a war," he said. adding: "There must be a continuing dialogue. If both sides sit together, the matter can be resolved peacefully and quickly."
Asked in a later e-mail exchange if North Korea was willing to consider shutting down the uranium-enrichment program, he replied, "Yes, I believe our government will resolve all U.S. security concerns." 
Asked if the North Korean government would consider allowing international inspections of the uranium facilities, he replied simply, "Yes."
He said it was the United States that first violated the 1994 nuclear agreement, the so-called Agreed Framework, because of Washington's failure to move toward normal ties, and because of long delays in the completion of two civilian nuclear power plants that were promised under the pact.
North Korea was startled, he said, by the Bush administration's hostility toward it from the start, when the administration shut down wide-ranging bilateral talks begun during the Clinton administration.
Mr. Han said his government had been particularly alarmed by President Bush's description of North Korea as part of an "axis of evil," along with Iraq and Iran, and by Mr. Bush's repeated statements beginning last summer that the United States would pre-emptively attack nations that threatened it with weapons of mass destruction.
"The U.S. has put the D.P.R.K. on a list of pre-emptive strikes," he said, using the initials for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. "So we would like to ask the American people: What is the alterative? What is the choice for the D.P.R.K.?"
Mr. Han, who is understood to be a crucial member of his country's Foreign Ministry, said his statements had been authorized at senior levels of the government, which he said was acting to open a new "means of communication with United States government and its people." 
The North Korean Mission contacted The Times through a New Jersey restaurateur, Robert Egan, who is the chairman of a trade group that has worked to improve ties between the United States and North Korea. Officials of North Korea, he said, "want the American people to understand their position."
Members of Congress and Korea specialists in the United States said the series of statements was highly significant if only because they suggested the North's eagerness to resolve the nuclear issue. At the same time, the North has spoken of a desire to mend relations with Japan, and taken steps to open up parts of its economy to foreign investment.
Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said in an interview that he was "skeptical" and "mistrustful" about any new North Korea offer to shut its nuclear weapons program.
But he said that the United States would need to resume a dialogue with North Korea, and that the Bush administration's refusal to talk for nearly two years before last month's confrontation had the effect of "guaranteeing a negative outcome."
"I'll tell you that I thought the administration made an enormous mistake not to engage with the North Koreans from Day 1," he said. "We didn't trust the Soviet Union, but we talked to them and ultimately engaged them in a ratcheting down of the arms race."
Stephen W. Bosworth, who served as the American ambassador to South Korea from 1997 until 2000, said the North Korean statements suggested that "they are feeling pushed into a corner" and even under threat from the United States.
"They may be paranoid, but they do have enemies," he said. "Certainly there is no reason for them not to think of the Bush administration -- and more generally, the United States -- as an enemy."
"In the end, I think we're going to have to talk to them again," he said.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases; 
An Apartment, and a Step Toward a Home

BYLINE:  By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI 

 BODY:
Linnette Garcia said a quick prayer, turned the doorknob and stepped slowly into the place where life had taken her.
 Inside a dark, cold room, her five children clinging to one another in a line behind her, Mrs. Garcia flipped a light switch, sending two large rats scurrying across a littered floor. Still, there were four walls and five beds. And Mrs. Garcia and her family had a roof over their heads. 
 "My kids would not let go of each other," Mrs. Garcia recalled. "They stayed with me on top of one bed, all of us curled up in a big ball, and we just started crying." 
Yet for a long, grim stretch, that place was home.
From September 2000 to January 2001, Mrs. Garcia, then 32, and her children -- Celina, then 12, David, 8, Isaac, 7, Marcus, 3, and Alyssa, 1 -- lived in a homeless shelter in Brooklyn. 
The shelter, run by New York City, was once a hospital. For four months, the Garcias huddled together in a room originally intended to hold sickbeds. But they had plenty of company. Thirty-five of those rooms were filled with families not unlike the Garcias, families that have joined the ranks of New York's homeless in recent years. 
This year, the Garcias, along with many other struggling New Yorkers seeking shelter, food, clothing or anything else that might raise the quality of their troubled lives, are being helped by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which begins its 91st annual appeal for donations today. The list of those in need will be very long, perhaps longer than ever.
"It's important to recognize that during the 1990's, the period of unexpected economic growth and prosperity, that the number of people living at or close to the federal poverty level grew in this city," said Dr. John S. Ruskay, executive vice president and chief executive of UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven local charities supported by the Neediest Cases Fund.
"Now," he said, "at a moment when we are experiencing profound economic downturn, when unemployment rates are increasing and we are facing impending government cuts, the impact on the poor, the homeless, the hungry, the elderly and children at risk will be exacerbated."
Last year, The Times raised nearly $61 million to help victims of the Sept. 11 terror attacks, through a charitable effort called the 9/11 Neediest Fund. But generous New Yorkers and others around the country did not forget the Neediest Cases Fund, which raised $9.7 million, the most in its history. 
"The public was highly responsive to the notion that poor people who were not necessarily affected directly by 9/11 were still in need, and people were determined not to let them fall down," said Jack Rosenthal, president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers Neediest Cases.
But it is not just individuals who need the kind of help that Neediest Cases helps agencies provide. Increasingly, whole families find themselves in a shared struggle to get by.
As a crumbling economy takes its toll in failed businesses and disappearing jobs, more families, particularly those already living paycheck to paycheck, are finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet. They are checking into homeless facilities at an alarming rate.
According to recent statistics from The New York Times and the Coalition for the Homeless, 100,000 New Yorkers experience homelessness each year; each night, nearly 32,000 homeless people bed down for the night in the city's shelter system.
Families now make up 75 percent of New York's shelter population, the statistics say. New York City's Independent Budget Office reported that as of late January, 6,921 homeless families were in shelters throughout the five boroughs: 23,196 children and adults.
"People need to see what some homeless people are going through," said Judy Quinones, a social worker for the Children's Aid Society, another charity supported by the Neediest Cases Fund. "It's not a pretty picture." 
Mrs. Quinones helped Mrs. Garcia and her family move out of that grim Brooklyn shelter and into the Pelham Fritz Apartments in West Harlem, a more livable shelter for homeless families. "It's still not home," Mrs. Garcia said of her small two-bedroom apartment. "But we do have our own key."
Then there are the hidden homeless, those who might well consider the Garcias' difficult life something to aspire to. Ellen Baxter, founder and executive director of Broadway Housing, a community-based provider of housing to formerly homeless individuals and families, points out that many statistics kept by the city and other agencies do not include families that may not live in a shelter, but pay rent to live in one room of someone else's home.
"There is a difference between people who fit the city's description of homelessness, and the hidden homeless," she said. "These are people with no leases and options whatsoever regarding their living conditions, whole families living in someone's bedroom, only able to use the kitchen during certain hours."
Broadway Housing is a division of the Community Service Society of New York, another local charity supported by the Neediest Cases Fund. It currently consists of five buildings, but Ms. Baxter said that by spring, a sixth building would be added to provide permanent, low-income housing for people who might otherwise be homeless.
"The problem with the current homeless shelter structure in New York right now is that for many, there is no exit point beyond their current shelter, no permanent homes for people to go," she said. "And at this point in time, the city does not have the money to create apartments for the homeless.
"What we're trying to do," she added, "is to develop a model of houses that will accommodate homeless families and neighborhood families living on very low incomes."
Whether it is individuals or whole families facing the dim prospect of life on the streets, homelessness has long been a fact of life in New York. It was a homeless man who inspired the creation of the Neediest Cases Fund in 1911. A shabby beggar who had been living on the streets approached Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The Times, on Christmas Day that year. The chance encounter with the beggar, whose name was not recorded, inspired Ochs to use his newspaper to help the poor.
Since then, The Times has raised $190 million dollars for needy people, including those affected by 9/11. In the last three years alone, the Neediest Cases Fund raised $6.2 million, $8 million and $9.7 million, respectively.
The current economic climate will make this year's campaign, which runs through Jan. 31, one of the most challenging in recent years. But Mr. Rosenthal remains optimistic. "The longer the recession goes, the tougher things get for people," he said. "On the other hand, the public understands that as well, and the need for philanthropy in the face of a downturn increases."
For Mrs. Garcia, the assistance that the campaign provides has offered hope in the face of bleak circumstances.
Mrs. Garcia grew up in Brooklyn. After marrying a Navy man, she left for North Hollywood, Calif., in 1990. Four years later, a major earthquake rocked Southern California, and the Garcias, whose oldest daughter was traumatized by the incident, decided to come back to New York.
They took an apartment in the Cypress Hills section of Brooklyn, Mrs. Garcia working part time filing medical records in a retirement home, and her husband, who had completed four years in the Navy, taking a job as a butcher.
By the time their fifth child arrived in 1999, the Garcias had lost their jobs. Their relationship began to unravel. On the brink of eviction, Mrs. Garcia began exploring the possibility of living in a homeless shelter, an alternative her husband refused to consider. 
"He said, 'If you want to go live in some shelter, fine, take the kids, but I'm not going,' " Mrs. Garcia said. "I think he was ashamed that he couldn't provide for his family."
Before heading to a homeless shelter, Mrs. Garcia went to live with a brother in Trenton. The family stayed there a year before Mrs. Garcia's brother and his wife began having marital problems. When that couple separated, Mrs. Garcia and her children were homeless again.
They ended up in a Brooklyn shelter across the street from the school that Celina attended. "She never walked straight home because she was so embarrassed, and she didn't want the other kids knowing she lived in a shelter," Mrs. Garcia said. "When I'd see her leave school and go around the corner, making believe she was heading home in another direction, I'd start to cry."
Then one day, Celina's fear came to pass. A classmate saw Celina heading into the shelter. "The other kids started calling her 'shelter girl,' " said Mrs. Garcia, shaking her head in sorrow and disbelief. "It was devastating to her, and every time she cried, I felt like a failure."
Inside the shelter, life was not much easier. There was the time that Celina fought another girl who wanted to steal a doll that Celina had received as a Christmas present. And the moment in the shelter's cafeteria when Mrs. Garcia herself nearly came to blows with another woman who said that she had cut ahead in the food line.
So when the Children's Aid Society notified Mrs. Garcia that she and her family would be transferred to Pelham Fritz, Apartment 3A, she packed their belongings with a smile that stretched from Brooklyn to Manhattan. The next morning, a school bus picked them up and drove them to their new home.
"When the bus driver told us he was turning down our new street, all the kids put their hands over their eyes," she said. "When we got in front of the building, they all peeked out through their fingers, and were much happier with this place than where we had come from."
Mrs. Garcia is living in what is considered a Tier 2 apartment, the closest a homeless person can be to living in his or her own apartment. The next stop, she hopes, is a Section 8 apartment, somewhere, anywhere in the city. As long as she can call it her own. "We're comfortable here," she said. "But it's not ours."
When Mrs. Garcia arrived at Pelham Fritz, she received a check for $1,000 from the Neediest Cases Fund to buy her children much-needed clothing and shoes, and she has since received another check for $150. 
Children's Aid also helped Mrs. Garcia enroll at a culinary school, where she is studying to become a pastry chef. "Mommy's muffins and cheesecakes are great," said 10-year-old David. "But her biscuits, well, not so good."
In the meantime, Mrs. Garcia is supporting her five children on $267 she receives monthly from public assistance and $565 in food stamps. 
Across the hall from the Garcias, in Apartment 3G, is another family trying to escape what Linnette Garcia calls the system. Lawrence and Paula Leasure and their five small children have been trapped in their own nightmare for the last two years.
The Leasures, who left a trailer-park community in Florida in hopes of finding low-income housing in New York, have been bouncing around the system for most of that time. Like the Garcias, they are being sheltered by the Children's Aid Society and are hoping to secure a Section 8 apartment for themselves in the near future. 
For the Leasures, however, there is an even greater problem to deal with. They say their 11-month-old son, Lawrence Jr., is fighting to recover from brain damage.
These days, though, the Leasures are feeling a lot like the Garcias. They appreciate the roof over their heads, even as they dream of a place to one day call their own.
"Don't get me wrong, the people who run this place are very nice," said Mr. Leasure, who lost his job as a telemarketer in Bradenton, Fla., before coming to New York. "But with all the rules and regulations, there's really very little freedom allowed."
At Pelham Fritz, like any other shelter, there are rules. Families may receive visitors from 5 to 9 p.m. on weekdays, and from 2 to 9 p.m. on weekends. Occasionally, inspectors show up to make sure that residents are keeping the homes clean and that the kitchens have enough food. 
No alcohol is permitted around the children. Children must not be left in an apartment without a parent. There is a sign-in sheet when families re-enter the building each day, and a bed check every night at 10 p.m., when a loud voice says, "Good night," over a crackling intercom system. The residents respond with a "Good night" of their own.
"They don't want you to get too comfortable, and I understand that," Mrs. Garcia said. "We're here because we're homeless, and they want us to move on just as much as we want to move on."

An article on Nov. 3 about Linnette Garcia, a homeless mother of five who was helped by Broadway Housing Communities through donations to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, misstated Broadway Housing's affiliation. It is an independent nonprofit organization that receives support from the Community Service Society of New York. It is not a division of the society.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: VOTER QUIZ; 
It's a Party, So Why Not Give Out Some Prizes?

BYLINE:  By DAISY HERNANDEZ 

 BODY:
Candidates will do anything for a vote, it has been said -- spend personal fortunes, learn foreign languages, travel far and wide for endorsements. But if the candidates for governor have to use every trick by Election Day, so do the third parties supporting them. This year, one party decided on an unusual approach in a political fight: giving away money in a contest. 
 The Working Families Party, a third party of unions and liberal advocacy groups that picked H. Carl McCall as its candidate, needs 50,000 votes to stay on the ballot for the next four years. So it is holding an online contest with cash awards. 
 Before the polls close on Tuesday, a working family with Internet access can log onto the party's Web site, www.workingfamiliesparty.org, and enter the "Know the Issues" contest. Those who answer 13 multiple-choice questions correctly are then entered in a drawing for cash prizes. Only those who write in with New York addresses will qualify.
Voters need not worry that they have not been keeping up with the issues. This is a contest with a sense of humor. Some questions only have one answer. For example, "What ethnic group in the state has the highest number of low-wage workers who would have benefited from a raise in the state minimum wage to $6.75 per hour?"
The three possible answers are Latinos, Latinos and Latinos.
Dan Cantor, executive director of Working Families Party, said the contest was meant to help the party and Mr. McCall by drawing attention to the race. "We're trying to boost his chances," Mr. Cantor said. "This guy doesn't have much money."
Martin Oesterreich, executive director of the Liberal Party, chuckled when told about the contest, but his humor ended there. "We prefer to spend on issue-related stuff," he said, like voter registration and outreach efforts. 
The Working Families Party generally supports mainstream candidates in high-level offices. But for the party, getting votes means more than just staying on the ballot, according to Micah L. Sifry, author of "Spoiling for a Fight: Third-Party Politics in America" (Routledge, 2002). It means visibility.
"What that does in Albany is tell Democrats you're not as invulnerable as you think," Mr. Sifry said.
The "Know the Issues" contest will give the first-prize winner $468, which is "the average weekly benefit to severely injured workers," according to the party's Web site. 
The contest was announced on Thursday in the party's e-mail newsletter, which reaches 20,000 people, Mr. Cantor said. He conceded that he expected some voters to guess correctly without knowing very much about the issues.
Here are a few more questions from the contest for those who want to prepare before turning on their computers: 
"How many people laid off after Sept. 11 used up their unemployment benefits this past summer?"
"In what year did spending on prisons overtake spending on higher education?"

HEADLINE: Japan Fears U.S. Is Preying on Weak Economy 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Back when Pete Wilson became governor of California a decade ago, people here used to say that the real estate value of the Imperial Palace grounds in central Tokyo was higher than the economic production of all of California.
 On Friday, the former governor was in town here, brandishing a new report in tune with the changed times, "Can Japan Come Back?" . 
 Without reforms, American investors "are going to lose interest in Japan, and Japan is going to see investment diverted, most likely to China," Mr. Wilson warned, speaking to the foreign press club here. As aides distributed the report, by the Pacific Council on International Policy, an academic research group, the moats and gardens of the Imperial Palace seemed to shrink into a chill autumn fog 20 floors below. 
The Japanese have long known that the economic tables have turned since the golden days of the late 1980's, when their banks, investors and shoppers ruled the West.
But this week brought a series of one-two punches to a country Mr. Wilson called "a place of micro optimism and macro pessimism."
On Thursday, Japan learned that China was on track to displace Japan this year as the world's second-largest personal computer market, after the United States. Making news on Friday was an announcement that Japan's highest-paid baseball player, Hideki Matsui, had decided to decamp for the United States to play in the major leagues; and the Finance Ministry announced that tax receipts during the first half of this fiscal year were down 17 percent over the same period last year. 
All week, Japan wrestled with fears that America Inc. was plotting to buy Japan Inc. -- at a deep discount.
According to the conspiracy talk, Heizo Takenaka, the new economy chief, was doing the bidding of American "vulture funds" by planning to knock over shaky banks and force bankruptcies of companies that are insolvent on paper. Those rumors helped force Mr. Takenaka to water down his plan to tackle Japan's 12-year-old bad-loan problem.
"Agent of the Americans" screamed one tabloid headline about Mr. Takenaka, the minister of economy and of financial services.

HEADLINE: THE 2012 OLYMPICS: NEW YORK; 
After the Promises Come the Realities

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

DATELINE: COLORADO SPRINGS, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Now comes the hard part.
 It took only six years and $13 million for New York City to capture the United States Olympic Committee's nomination to serve as the host city for the 2012 Summer Games. 
 Now the Bloomberg administration, Gov. George E. Pataki and the city's bid committee, NYC2012, must overcome daunting political and financial obstacles not only to make good on promises to build $904 million in Olympic fields, courts and arenas but also to create an estimated $5 billion in new subways, housing and a stadium over the rail yards on the West Side of Manhattan. 
All of that need not be in place by 2005, when the International Olympic Committee will make the final decision on the location of the 2012 Games. But many of these projects will take years to complete, and New York must convince the International Olympic Committee, which chooses the site from a number of international candidates, that all the city's promises can be hammered into reality. 
"You've got to show some progress," said Richard T. Anderson, president of the New York Building Congress, a trade group supporting the city's bid. "One of the big issues is to demonstrate that New York can indeed pull off the big, unfinished pieces, which are the Olympic Village, the stadium and subway service." 
Although New York's bid mentions all three -- the Olympic Village complex of 4,400 apartments in Queens; a $1.5 billion extension of the No. 7 subway line from Times Square to the far West Side; and a $1.5 billion Olympic stadium over the West Side rail yards -- none of them are included in the capital plan submitted as part of the official bid. Rather, Daniel L. Doctoroff, who has been pursuing the Olympics for New York off and on since 1994 and is now the city's deputy mayor for economic development, has said that those projects will be built by the city, the state and private developers whether or not the Games come to New York.
Well, maybe.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Governor Pataki have expressed strong public support, as have many top Wall Street and real estate figures in the city.
"These are projects that we should be doing anyway for the long-term viability of the city," said Bill Rudin, who heads the Rudin family real estate empire and is a major supporter of the New York bid. 
But not everyone agrees that this is the best way to spend scarce public dollars when both the city and the state are facing multibillion-dollar budget gaps.
"I see some real strengths to the Olympic proposal in developing housing and transportation, given that it's so hard to get those things built in New York City," said Jonathan Bowles, research director for the Center for an Urban Future. "But I see some downsides. There are questions about how we can pay for this and whether a stadium is a good investment for the city."
Some city residents also resent Mr. Doctoroff's description of their semi-industrial West Side neighborhood as a wasteland and challenge his plans to rezone it for an 86,000-seat stadium and a forest of office towers and high-rise apartments.
"It's a working-class neighborhood and a service neighborhood," said Simone Sindin, chairwoman of Manhattan Community Board 4. "The fact that there are garages, carpentry shops or auto showrooms does not mean that they are expendable."
Opposition to the stadium is not as fervent or widespread as it was when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sought to install the Yankees in a West Side home. But opponents could wage the kind of long legal battle that doomed the Westway highway and development project in the 1980's.
Mr. Doctoroff, the founder of NYC2012, contends that landing the Games would essentially enforce a timetable for completing major projects that would not ordinarily be undertaken in New York's often fractious civic culture. While the proposal calls for creating an equestrian center in Staten Island, an archery range in Brooklyn and major alterations to what would be the water polo site in the Bronx, much of the Olympic transformation would take place on the far West Side of Manhattan.
The coming of the Olympics would "trigger cataclysmic change in an area that's essentially worthless," Mr. Doctoroff has said.
Much of the change would be paid for with taxes from development and rising real estate values on the West Side, according to Mr. Doctoroff. Tax-free bonds would be paid off through real estate taxes and the sale of development rights, a process known as tax increment financing, or TIF in government-speak.
But tax increment financing has not been used in New York before and would require state legislation. It is also predicated on the creation of 20 million square feet of office development -- the equivalent of 10 Empire State Buildings -- which may be a lofty assumption given the weak state of the market today. 
The strapped Metropolitan Transportation Authority is studying an extension of the No. 7 subway line. But the money for that and a Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road station would come from TIF. At the presentation of New York's bid, Mayor Bloomberg committed to breaking ground for the subway project before 2005. 
"It has to be outside our existing capital program," said Peter S. Kalikow, chairman of the M.T.A., "because I don't have anything in the existing program or the next one to do something like that."
Tax increment financing is also supposed to pay for portions of the stadium, which according to the Olympic proposal would double as an expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. But Mr. Doctoroff and NYC2012 also face a political problem. Robert Boyle, chairman of the convention center authority, does not consider the stadium to be a substitute for expanding the center.
The bid advocates expect that after the Games the stadium would be transformed into a home for the New York Jets. Together with the National Football League, the team would put up at least $400 million toward the cost of building the stadium. But taxpayers, or tax increment financing, would have to foot the bill for constructing the base for the stadium -- a platform over the rail yards -- as well as a retractable roof, two items that together would cost an estimated $500 million.
Emmanuel Tobier, a professor of economics and urban planning at New York University, says that a stadium is a poor public investment. "It'll be a disaster," he said. "Given the budget crisis and other things, it's just not the time to do it."
If a West Side stadium proves untenable, NYC2012 has an alternate plan to build a stadium in Flushing, Queens, on the old World's Fair site, which would not require an expensive platform but would be a far less desirable location. The Queens borough president, Helen M. Marshall, is amenable. "We could find a place for it," she said.
Also in Queens, the Olympic Village apartments would be built on the waterfront at Queens West. Ms. Marshall favors NYC2012's plan to convert the apartments to middle-income housing after the Games. Mr. Doctoroff says the housing should be built by private developers, probably using tax-free bonds.
Stephen M. Ross, chairman of the Related Companies, a major residential builder in New York, agreed with his friend Mr. Doctoroff. Mr. Ross, a fund-raiser for the Olympic campaign, was once part of a group that owned the New York Islanders with Mr. Doctoroff.
Mr. Ross said that if New York is selected in 2005 as the host city for 2012 he would take a leave of absence from his company to run the real estate operations for the Olympic effort.
"The Olympics will be good for New York," Mr. Ross said. "If we win, I'll spend the next seven years making sure the venues get built and no one gets ripped off."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: NEW YORK; 
Golisano Expected to Say if He'll Quit Race

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
The plodding race for New York governor took on some last-minute suspense yesterday as Tom Golisano, the billionaire Independence Party candidate, said he had reserved two minutes of broadcast time tonight during which he is expected to announce whether he is quitting or staying in the race.
 After spending about $54 million of his own money, much of it for a barrage of television advertisements attacking Gov. George E. Pataki, he refused to say yesterday during a televised debate whether he planned to see the race to its finish on Tuesday. Instead, he urged New Yorkers to watch his two-minute announcement to be broadcast at 6:28 tonight. 
 Mr. Golisano's move mystified the political world, with talk over whether his refusal to elaborate and his scheduled announcement were leading up to his withdrawal from the race or were part of a ploy to drum up last-minute attention for his candidacy. In any case, his campaign was showing signs of disarray. Public polls have him a distant third in the race, and Democrats have been pressuring Mr. Golisano to drop out, although Republicans and others in his camp have resisted the idea.
Mr. Golisano canceled his single campaign event and met with senior members of his staff at the Waldorf-Astoria before flying home to Rochester in the late afternoon, leaving confusion in his wake.
While some Golisano aides said they were pressing on with the business of a campaign, including making arrangements for events tomorrow, rifts among senior advisers about what he should do seemed to widen. Two of them -- his chief strategist, Roger Stone, and Steve Pigeon, a former Erie County Democratic chairman and friend -- were overheard in a terse exchange in an elevator after a debate on WNBC-TV between Mr. Golisano and H. Carl McCall, the Democratic nominee. Gov. George E. Pataki, who is seeking a third term and is well ahead in public polls, was not in the debate.
Mr. McCall, who went on to campaign upstate, said he would welcome Mr. Golisano's withdrawal, especially if it brought an endorsement of him. Mr. Pataki, who campaigned in the city, brushed off the questions around Mr. Golisano's candidacy, which shifted attention from the major party candidates for a second day. 
"I don't worry about what others do," said Mr. Pataki, whose aides privately suggested that Mr. Golisano was pulling a publicity stunt. "All I can control is what I do."
The first question from the moderator of the debate, Gabe Pressman, was whether Mr. Golisano planned to stay in the race. Mr. Golisano resisted answering then and to reporters afterward. 
"I am a candidate for governor of this state," he said during the debate. "I have been for seven months; I've put a lot of effort into it, but there will be a special broadcast tomorrow afternoon at 6:28."
When asked whether he would back Mr. McCall if he chose to withdraw, Mr. Golisano replied: "That's a speculation I'm not going to make, Gabe. I'm a candidate, I'm here to debate."
After the debate, Mr. Golisano said he chose to make his announcement in a way that would reach as many viewers as he could.
"I think I have the right to postpone what I'm going to say until tomorrow afternoon, so I have a much broader audience, and they can hear me in person," he said.
Afterward, his aides said Mr. Golisano had not yet written the statement and planned to produce three versions -- staying in the race, dropping out, and dropping out with an endorsement of Mr. McCall. One will be telecast on CNN and on ABC and NBC affiliates. CBS stations planned to broadcast it later in the evening, the aides said. Mr. Stone told New York 1 last night that the campaign was conducting a poll to see how voters might react to the options.
Golisano aides said that until they heard otherwise they were going forward with a statewide swing tomorrow with several events. 
If Mr. Golisano withdraws, he would be the second candidate in this race to do so. Andrew M. Cuomo quit the Democratic race a week before the primary, conceding that Mr. McCall was too far ahead in the polls and saying that he did not want to divide Democrats further.
Mr. Cuomo remains on the ballot as the Liberal Party candidate because he did not resign in time to get off it. Mr. Golisano would also remain on the ballot.
Top Golisano aides said that McCall campaign representatives had offered him positions like a high-ranking education or economic development official. McCall campaign aides denied that, though Democratic supporters on the campaign trail yesterday, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, suddenly had nothing but praise for Mr. Golisano.
Mr. Pataki has a lead in every public poll, and recent ones showed his margin widening. A Marist Poll last week showed him with 47 percent among likely voters, with Mr. McCall at 27 percent and Mr. Golisano at 17 percent.
Mr. Golisano, aides said, was disappointed that although polls he commissioned showed him with as much as 28 percent of the vote statewide, no public poll has shown him above 18 percent. He also said he was disappointed that major New York City newspapers and several upstate ones have endorsed Mr. Pataki.
Word that Mr. Golisano was considering different options arose Thursday, when his campaign canceled and then restored some advertising. Mr. Golisano did not appear publicly Friday as aides said he was meeting with several advisers and considering whether to continue in the race or quit and possibly endorse Mr. McCall.
At one point in yesterday's debate, during a discussion of changing campaign finance rules, Mr. Golisano said he was proud to have spent so much of his money in the race.
"Can I think of a better investment that I can make with my time and money than trying to improve everybody's quality of life, their financial security, their job security, help their children get a better education?" Mr. Golisano said. 
It was uncertain how his withdrawal might affect the race.
Polling conducted by The New York Times in mid-October found a statistical tie among voters who favored Mr. Golisano on whether they could support Mr. Pataki or Mr. McCall: 38 percent said they could switch their vote to Mr. Pataki, 34 percent to Mr. McCall. The poll also showed that Mr. Golisano's voters were split almost evenly three ways among Republicans, Democrats and Independence Party registrants.
Mr. McCall and Mr. Golisano, despite their warm chatter and agreement on several issues during the debate, did differ, gently, on some topics.
Mr. Golisano questioned whether Mr. McCall could find the $8 billion he has promised for new education spending because the state budget is facing a deficit of $5 billion to $8 billion next year. Mr. McCall suggested that Mr. Golisano was being simplistic in promoting the idea of shifting lottery revenue from the General Fund to pay for a broad college scholarship program.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: CONNECTIONS; 
Similar Highway Work, Varied Price Tags

BYLINE:  By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
In the western reaches of New York, not far from the shore of Lake Erie, two nine-mile patches of road were recently rebuilt and repaved by the state. Each project included repairs to a set of small bridges, and the once-rutted pavement came out smooth and clean.
 Yet there was at least one major difference between the projects. The Cherry Creek roadwork relied on state engineers for the design work, while private engineers were hired to design the Little Valley job. And the private engineers ended up charging $1.2 million more. 
 Across New York State, there are repeated examples of differing price tags for design work on projects of similar size and scope, an audit commissioned by the state found. It concluded that 85 percent of the time, engineering work handled by state employees costs less.
It was a conclusion that has led some critics of the Pataki administration to question why the State Department of Transportation still awarded $132 million worth of new contracts in the 2002 fiscal year to private engineering consultants. And given that it is an election year, the questions, not surprisingly, come back to politics.
It turns out that many of the largest companies that repeatedly win these engineering consulting jobs are regular campaign contributors to Gov. George E. Pataki or the state Republican Party. For example, the Parsons Corporation, a California-based engineering company that has won $18.3 million in state highway and bridge contracts over the past four years, has donated $195,000 to the state Republican Party during that time. Another engineering company, Gannett Fleming, has won or performed work on $15.6 million in contracts and has donated $50,000 to the Republican causes.
"Are elected officials putting taxpayers first or their own campaign finances first?" said Richard Kirsch, director of Citizen Action of New York, a group urging changes in state campaign finance laws.
Transportation Department officials declined repeated requests during the past week to discuss their use of private engineering contractors. Data provided by the agency show that total spending on private engineering consultants has declined by nearly a third since 1999, even while the total allocated for new highway and bridge jobs has remained about the same. But even with the recent declines, the spending on private engineers is still above the amounts spent during the Cuomo administration, after adjustments for inflation. 
A spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki said the state's decisions on highway design have nothing to do with political contributions. "The governor has thousands of contributions from people of all walks of life," said Mollie Fullington. "These are people who support his proven record of accomplishments and his vision for New York."
As comptroller, H. Carl McCall, Mr. Pataki's Democratic rival in the governor's race, performed two audits of the state contracting process, each urging Mr. Pataki to hire more state highway engineers and then trim spending on consultants. There are currently 2,447 engineers at the Transportation Department. No one has suggested that the state eliminate all outside engineering consultants, since many large highway jobs are too complicated for state workers to handle. But the audits suggest that contractors are being used for many routine tasks that state workers could presumably handle.
Mr. McCall has raised the issue in his campaign. "There must be some other reason to do it this way, given the savings there could be in taxpayer money," he said last week.
The most comprehensive review in the past decade of the state contracting practice was performed by KPMG, a consulting firm, for the Transportation Department. In 2000, it compared 48 pairs of similar design projects and 54 pairs of similar construction inspection projects and repeatedly found the state in-house work to be less expensive.
An engineering consultant, for example, was hired to inspect a road resurfacing project on the Cross Bronx Expressway, at a cost of $1.1 million, but state employees handled a project with a very similar scope on the Van Wyck Expressway for a cost of $532,943, the KPMG report says. Another job in which consultants were used to inspect repair work on roadway cracks cost $566,673, while a similar task handled by state workers cost $333,862.
Executives at several companies that have donated money to Mr. Pataki and other Republican causes -- as well as to Democrats who control the State Assembly -- would not discuss their multiple contributions.
"We don't comment on any of our political, charitable or other contributions," said a spokeswoman for the Parsons Corporation, Erin Kuhlman.
But Raymond J. Kinley Jr., chief executive of Clough Harbour & Associates LLP, an engineering firm based in Albany with $21.5 million in recently awarded or ongoing state contracts, said the company's $130,000 in political contributions over the past four years, $42,866 of which went directly to the Republican Party or to Mr. Pataki, were clearly directed toward politicians who back the state highway projects and the hiring of private engineering contractors. "We do support people who keep a good balance between public engineers and private consultants," Mr. Kinley said.
Mr. Kinley and Bruce Ross, a spokesman for Parsons Brinckerhoff -- no relationship to the Parsons Corporation -- an engineering firm that handles tens of millions in state contracts, questioned the validity of studies that suggest state engineers are a better deal. The reason the state needs private contractors, they said, is because these companies can quickly move to handle complicated jobs that would be delayed if they relied on state engineers.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "LEDGER -- Highway Dollars"For more than a decade, auditors have urged the state to cut its use of private firms for highway design and construction inspection jobs, arguing that millions could be saved by using state workers. The state has cut its use of contractors somewhat but it remains higher than during the Cuomo administration.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE VOTERS; 
IN POLL, AMERICANS SAY BOTH PARTIES LACK CLEAR VISION

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JANET ELDER

 BODY:
The battle for control of Congress moved into its final stretch with Americans unsettled about conditions at home and threats from abroad, but saying that Democrats and Republicans have failed to offer a clear vision about how they would lead the nation, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows.
 The poll also found an emerging divide between Democrats and Republicans in their perception of the state of the nation and the problems it faces this fall. More than twice as many Republicans as Democrats -- 63 percent compared with 27 percent -- said the country was heading in the right direction. Democrats were twice as likely as Republicans to say the economy was the primary issue that would determine their vote. 
 These findings come in the closing days of a campaign that has failed to stir much interest among voters. Nearly half said they were less enthusiastic about voting this time than they have been in past Congressional campaigns. 
But the poll suggested that if many voters were uninspired with the candidates, many were worried about where the country was heading, and about the challenges the next Congress would face. Americans expressed concerns about a worsening economy, the prospect of a war with Iraq and terrorist attacks at home. In one sign of disquiet, a substantial majority, 66 percent, said they believed life would not be better for their children than it was for them.
The final poll of this campaign suggested some difficulties for Democrats as they seek to win back control of the House, a goal that party leaders have in recent days described as daunting, while maintaining control of the Senate. Despite a flurry of speeches, advertisements and policy papers issued by Democratic leaders over the last month, barely a third of respondents said the Democrats had presented a "clear plan for the country" in the fall campaign. About 4 in 10 respondents said the same thing about the Republican Party.
In one closely watched if imprecise measure of the overall partisan strength of the two parties, 47 percent of likely voters said they would vote for a Republican in next week's Congressional contest, compared with 40 percent who said they would vote Democratic. The margin of sampling error for that question was plus or minus five percentage points.
But that question, known as a generic ballot question, is a measure of national sentiment, and does not necessarily reflect how Americans will vote in the governor's races around the country and in the handful of close Senate and House races that will ultimately determine the control of Congress.
The concern among Democrats about the nation's direction and the economy suggests that Democratic voters might be more motivated to cast their ballots on Tuesday and respond to the ambitious get-out-the-vote drives that have been organized by the Democratic Party, aimed in particular at voters who are distressed about the economy. 
President Bush, who has invested so much of his own political capital in the outcome of the elections, remains extremely popular with voters. In this poll, 62 percent of respondents said they approved of how he was handling his job, though that is down markedly from his 74 percent rating of last summer.
The nationwide poll of 1,018 Americans, including 795 registered voters, was taken from Oct. 27 to Oct. 31. The margin of error for the overall poll was plus or minus three percentage points.
The poll found that the political significance many Democratic and Republican analysts in Washington ascribed to the vote in Congress on the Iraq resolution might have been overstated. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they had no notion of how their representative had voted on the Iraq resolution that passed Congress last month. Twice as many voters said that a candidate's position on the economy was more important to them than how that candidate had voted on Iraq.
The poll came at the close of an extraordinarily competitive campaign for Congress that will determine whether a single party, the Republicans, will control the White House, the Senate and the House for at least the next two years. The Republicans now have a six-seat edge in the House, while the Democrats held a single-seat margin in the Senate until the death of Paul Wellstone.
As a final measure of just how competitive these contests are, President Bush turned his weekend into a nonstop campaign swing, visiting states and Congressional districts that remained close in these final days. A visit by Mr. Bush, White House aides said, produces a bounce of support for the Republican candidate that can last for two or three days, so this last weekend of trips has taken on particular significance.
Yet for all the attention being showered on these races by the president and the national political committees this weekend, the poll found that many Americans remained unmoved by the contests before them -- and unimpressed with the candidates and what they are saying. About 40 percent of voters said they were less enthusiastic about voting in this election than in previous Congressional elections.
"There used to be more enthusiasm and the issues were clearer," Claire Forst, 50, a nurse from Brooklyn, said in a follow-up interview. "Now you just feel that there is no reason to go out to vote because whatever happens, it's not going to matter anymore."
At the same time, Americans are clearly unsettled about the problems facing the nation. More than half of all respondents said they believed the nation was heading in the wrong direction; by a similar margin, Americans said the economy was in fairly bad or very bad shape. In this latest poll, 59 percent of Americans said they believed an attack on Iraq would worsen the threat of a terrorist attack in the United States, an increase of 9 points from a month ago.
"Saddam scares me," said Linda Annan, 53, a clerk from Lancaster, Pa., who is a Democrat. "Going to war scares me. The economy has me concerned." 
Chris Spensberg, 49, a Republican from Wisconsin Rapids, Wis., said, "With the economy and the world situation with Iraq and terrorism, you don't really have a notion that anybody has a clear-cut answer to take care of them."
The economy continues to be the issue of principal concern among the electorate: 15 percent of respondents named it as the most important issue. By contrast, just 2 percent of respondents named terrorism and 2 percent said foreign policy.
In one sense, that is precisely what Democratic strategists had hoped for in laying out a plan this year to win back control of the House, in the belief that voters would turn to Democrats at a time when they were concerned about the nation's economic health.
But for whatever reason -- the success President Bush had in focusing attention on Iraq, or what some Democrats say is the party's failure to offer its own economic plan -- there is little evidence to date that the Democrats have been able to take command of the issue. The nation was evenly divided over which party was more likely to make the country prosperous: 38 percent of respondents named Republicans, while 39 percent named Democrats.
There were still some clear differences among voters in how they viewed the strengths of the parties. By a three-to-one margin, voters said Republicans were more likely than Democrats to provide the nation with a strong military. By nearly the same margin, voters said Democrats were more likely than Republicans to make certain that prescription drugs were affordable to the elderly. 
For Mr. Bush, there has, over the last month, been a slight increase -- to 35 percent from 27 percent -- in the number of people who say he is "paying enough attention" to the economy. The rise coincides with a period in which the White House made a concerted effort to portray Mr. Bush as concerned with that issue. At the same time, 54 percent of respondents in this poll said they approved of the president's handling of foreign policy, among the lowest figures since the World Trade Center attack of last September.
Still, as always, there was mixed evidence of the degree to which Mr. Bush benefited Republican candidates, and how much weight his appeal for a Republican Congress might carry. 
Nearly half of voters said it was "better for the country" to have divided government. About 40 percent said the president was not a factor in their vote, while 31 percent said they considered their vote to be one of support for Mr. Bush and 19 percent considered their vote to be in opposition to him. 
"I really support Bush," said Nona Hesson, 58, a retired teacher from Kerrville, Tex., who is a Republican. "If the Republicans get control of Congress, I think it would be a lot easier for Bush to get his point across." 
But, Ms. Hesson added: "I don't want things to just be railroaded through. I think if we had equal representation in Congress, it would be the best solution, rather than one party having main control."

How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sunday through Thursday with 1,018 adults throughout the United States. Of these, 795 said they were registered to vote.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active residential exchanges across the country.
Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race, age, and education. 
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the margin of sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error. Variations in the wording and order of questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

Joblessness, a Bit More His Than Hers

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
WHO, exactly, are the unemployed these days? It's not that easy to get an answer.
 You might think the government knows, and it does, sort of. Or will, eventually. The federal government does a telephone survey each month so that it can calculate the official unemployment rate. 
 But the number of people questioned is tiny. And even so, it will be months or years before researchers analyze all the data. Critics also point out that many unemployed people don't have telephones, or aren't around to answer them.
 Then there are anecdotal descriptions. Some commuters have a simple definition of the unemployed: the people they used to see on the train every morning who aren't filling the seats anymore. PTA leaders may see the unemployed in a sudden surge of volunteers, people who used to be too busy to pick their children up at school.
 You may notice the unemployed holding "office hours" at Starbucks, or using the computers at the public library to perform job searches. They may be the new faces turning up at the food bank, or the people haunting storefront employment agencies, desperate storefront employment agencies, desperate for even a day's pay.
 Another way to get a snapshot of the jobless, if not a complete portrait, is to look at who has been receiving unemployment insurance benefits. It is only a sketch, because many people who are out of work do not qualify for benefits; they worked only part time, perhaps, or for too short a stretch, a made too little money.
 "At least half of the unemployment are not reflected in the data," said James Parrott, deputy director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-backed research group. At the same time, he noted, certain industries like construction usually have a lot of workers receiving benefits, because their employment is seasonal.
 The data have other quirks. The New York State Department of Labor releases 12-month moving averages, so it's not clear how many people were getting benefits in August, only how many were getting benefits, on average, in the 12 months ending in August. And August is the most recent month of available data.
 So the following picture is not panoramic. 
 But given all those caveats, here is the typical unemployed person in New York City: male, between the ages of 25 and 34, with a high school degree, and a previous job in a white-collar service-sector (in something like advertising or accounting or computer services).
 That would have been the picture the previous year (the "before 9/11" year), too, but with one different. A year ago, the typical unemployed person would probably have been a woman.
 Unemployment in New York City is divided remarkably equally between men and women, at least according to the benefits data. A year ago, 49.4 percent of recipients were male; now, about 50.6 percent are.
 The number of people of both sexes receiving benefits has soared by 58 percent in the 12-month period, to an average of 95,360 from 60,440; the rate of increase among men has just been slightly higher than the rate for women.
 There have been some other interesting changes, too. People with "professional" jobs, as the labor department defines them, are now the second largest group of unemployed people, after blue-collar workers; a year ago, clerical workers were No. 2.
 And there has been a surge in unemployment among the highly educated. Though their numbers are still small, those with more than four years of college rose by 68 percent, to 6,250, on average, in the latest 12 months. The number of unemployed people with four years of college almost doubled, to 18,050.
 The industries that produced all these unemployed people are the ones you might expect: business services, manufacturing (especially apparel and printing), retailing, finance and construction. The drop in tourism also created an increase in laid-off workers at hotels, restaurants and airports.
 Men dominated the construction layoffs; women lost the majority of manufacturing jobs (because of the garment industry) and were also harder hit by cutbacks in the finance area, which includes banking.
 And of all the employers tracked by the Labor Department, only one produced fewer laid-off workers this year than it did the year before. It's also the one the least connected to the New York economy. It is, of course, the federal government. Somehow, that just figures.

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
Preaching the Gospel According to Dave & Buster

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
THE instructor had flown in from Dallas and was teaching the class in a corner of the billiards room. The students were a dozen young men newly hired for the security staff, and the smallest, judging by appearances, might be able to squeeze into a XL shirt.
 Today's lesson: How do to deal with difficult customers. 
 It was the last day of the two-week training period, and the goal was to imbue 300 new employees of the newest Dave & Buster's restaurant with the chain's way of doing things. This branch, on Veterans Memorial Highway in Islandia, is the 32nd branch of the Dallas chain, which promotes itself as the "ultimate place for big 'kids' to play." 
The Dave & Buster's chain attracts about a million customers a year with its blend of sports bar, video arcade, billiards parlor and nightclub. The chain falls into the category the restaurant industry calls "eater-tainment," pulling in customers with better than bar food and an array of games, drinks and distractions.
Dave & Buster's arrival on Long Island was preceded by Jillian's, a competitor with locations in Westbury and Farmingdale. 
Like many large companies, Dave & Buster's has its own way of doing things and its own lingo, and both were heavily emphasized in the days of training leading up to the restaurant's opening on Sept. 18. 
The first few weeks of operation are crucial, said John Mirabal, the general manager of the Islandia restaurant. If customers are disappointed, they will not return, so Dave & Buster's, like many chains, puts substantial effort into getting its openings right.
"We pay constant attention to the details so that nothing goes wrong," said Mr. Mirabal, who had been the general manager of the chain's branch in Honolulu. 
Mr. Mirabal said he worked closely during the summer with the other members of the opening team to make sure that things went just so. 
"We say 'thank you' a lot," said Paul Martinez, the team's coordinator. "We expect each guest to hear the words 'thank you' at least 30 times in the course of their visit."
As Mr. Mirabal, Mr. Martinez and other managers scurried about attending to last-minute details, in the billiards room, Will Carr was teaching the security staff ways of keeping order and handling customers who may have had too much to drink. 
The emphasis is not on enforcing rules, like the one that proscribes smoking, but on treating customers as if they were friends paying a personal visit, Mr. Carr said. He emphasized the distinction between customers and guests.
"McDonald's has customers and Wal-Mart has customers," he said. "Dave & Buster's has guests."
The new employees, many of whom had worked as bouncers at bars or nightclubs, grappled with the concept. "This is what?" Mr. Carr asked aloud, gesturing at the walls around him. The question drew blank stares.
"This is your home," he continued. "People who come to your home are what?"
One of the students tentatively replied, "Guests?"
"Guests!" Mr. Carr said, with the enthusiasm of a speaker certain that a troubling question has, at last, been put to rest. "They are guests. We treat them, and one another, with respect. You wouldn't chase after a guest to your home and tell them you have a no-smoking policy, would you? At Dave & Buster's we are ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen."
It was a phase new employees would hear over and over.
On opening day, the company's founders, Dave Corriveau and Buster Corley, attended the ceremonies. "We would have been in this market a long time ago, but until recently we couldn't secure a location on a budget we could pay," Mr. Corriveau said. 
Moving into Long Island, Dave & Buster's followed the store-opening process it has developed over the 20 years it has been in business, tweaking it here and there to meet local needs. In mid-July, an advance team led by Mr. Mirabal arrived and opened a recruiting center in Stony Brook. Situated strategically near the state university campus, the center was close to a ready supply of prospective part-time employees. On Aug. 1, the hiring center moved to Islandia. Throughout August the company continued to advertise for employees and to post notices on employment Web sites. Representatives attended a series of career fairs and job expos.
"The toughest part is having to explain to people what Dave & Buster's really is, until they've experienced it for themselves," said William P. Jacobus, the chain's director of beverage operations and a member of the opening team.
Mr. Jacobus spent part of his summer recruiting the kitchen staff in the culinary programs at local colleges. The cooking staff and other kitchen employees then received up to three weeks of training, Mr. Jacobus said. Bartenders received two weeks, as did security captains. Other employees received a week or less.
"I've opened 19 stores, and I don't see much anymore that surprises me," Mr. Jacobus said. "Long Island is pretty much like our other markets. I did notice that people seemed to already know one another from earlier jobs when they got here. I think the labor pool for this industry is pretty established."
Bridget Bain, the special-events sales manager in Islandia, said she and her staff spent the summer and early fall introducing themselves to large companies within a 10-mile radius and becoming active in local business groups. Despite the slow economy, she said, the effort was beginning to pay off, although she would not say how many meetings or events had been scheduled at the new location. 
"We had a wonderful week last week, and each week bookings continue to grow," she said on Monday.
John Donaldson of East Hampton said he came to Dave & Buster's in Islandia nearly every weekend, meeting a friend from Kew Gardens, Queens. "It's sort of a halfway place to meet for her and for me," he said. "The food is better than your average sports bar, the service is great, and there are plenty of things to do after you finish eating. It's a complete evening."
Mr. Donaldson, a manager at the East Hampton Business Services center, said he was intrigued by the promises the chain made before the Islandia location opened. "It all sounded different and appealing and turned out to be what they said it would be," he said. "There really was nothing like it before they arrived. I tell people it's like Chuck E. Cheese's, only for adults."

HEADLINE: The Thinking Inside The Box 

BYLINE:  By Lynn Hirschberg; Lynn Hirschberg is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
 In September we asked Leslie Moonves, president and C.E.O. of CBS and head of UPN, Jeff Zucker, president of NBC Entertainment, and Chris Albrecht, chairman of HBO, to imagine a perfect television schedule. Starting from scratch, with unlimited funds and access to talent, how would they build their fantasy network universe? Just before the Emmys, as their new fall shows were starting to appear, Moonves, Zucker and Albrecht met at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Los Angeles to talk about an ideal TV reality and why it's so hard to achieve. 

The Fantasy-Land Do-It-Yourself Whatever-You-Want Network

JEFF ZUCKER: You're really tan.
LESLIE MOONVES: You know what? I haven't gone away. I have a place in Malibu, and I tan very fast. So--.
ZUCKER: He's really tan.
MOONVES: Thank you. It's that Bob Evans look.
LYNN HIRSCHBERG: O.K., the game here is, you have a clean slate. You have no schedule. And at least initially we're going to pretend, Chris, that you work in an environment that involves advertising.
CHRIS ALBRECHT: O.K.
HIRSCHBERG: You're not at HBO.
ZUCKER: You're busted.
MOONVES: Yeah, none of this highfalutin stuff anymore.
HIRSCHBERG: But then we'll let you two play at running HBO. So you're starting from scratch. You have all the money and talent you want. How do you create a network?
ALBRECHT: I think the first thing you need is a plan, a target for your business model. And that's not just, how much are you going to spend and what are you going to charge the advertisers, but whom are you going after? More and more, that question determines a lot of what people are programming. The hardest target is to try to please everybody. The idea that there's a model 18- to 49-year-old person is ridiculous. I don't know any 18-year-old who likes the same thing as a 49-year-old except in very, very, very, very rare cases. So I would try and find a different targeted demo -- probably young men, probably young women, although those groups are pretty fickle. Or maybe I would even target an older, more upscale audience. But I would avoid the get-the-biggest-number-of-eyeballs-into-the-tent-at-all-given-times measure of success, because I think it's the hardest way to go.
MOONVES: I slightly disagree with you. I think you cannot be all things to all people all the time, but at certain times of the day you can be. You can have a show that is targeted for 60-year-olds on Sunday at 7 o'clock. And on Thursday at 8 o'clock you can be going after 22-year-olds. I think the idea is to be diverse -- and I don't mean just racially, although that is important. I still remember what Brandon Tartikoff said when everybody was giving him credit for "Hill Street Blues" turning around the network. He said it wasn't "Hill Street Blues"; it was "The A-Team" that really did it. "Hill Street" got all the Emmy Awards, but "The A-Team" brought viewers to "Hill Street." You know, "Fear Factor" and "West Wing" can live successfully together. "Survivor" and "60 Minutes" can live successfully together. "Taxicab Confessions" and "The Sopranos" can live successfully together.
ZUCKER: I think we want to appeal to the demo that the advertisers are trying to reach, which is most likely 18-to-54. But at the same time, I would also like this fictitious network to be as broad as possible and have as many people under the age of 18 as over 54.
MOONVES: Hold it. He has just disputed everything NBC has stood for in the last 30 years.
ZUCKER: That's not true. That's not true.
MOONVES: Jeff ZUCKER has come around to the right way of thinking.
ZUCKER: A broadcaster should be exactly that, broad-caster. I've learned this from my friend Les. I believe the No. 1 priority is to deliver those 18- to 54-year-olds. Because that's what the advertisers want. And you notice I expanded it to 54, by the way.
MOONVES: That's good.
ZUCKER: But having said that, I believe that we should also try and appeal to as many people as possible. That's all I'm trying to say. And I actually would say, for Les's benefit, that we haven't been smart enough about that in recent years.
MOONVES: I'm speechless.
ZUCKER: Which is a stunning fact, right there. But I do believe you have to get the younger people first, because they're the hardest group to reach.
MOONVES: Well the big hits will attract everybody. You know, the 60-year-olds are watching "Survivor," and the 14-year-olds are watching "Survivor."
ZUCKER: That's the only way a network becomes a hit.

All Hits Are Surprises
MOONVES: You need a monster hit -- and the irony is, all hits are surprises. You don't know that "Sopranos" is going to change the world, that "Friends" is going to change the world, that "Survivor" is going to change the world.
HIRSCHBERG: I think Chris knew "Sopranos" would.
ALBRECHT: Not a clue.
MOONVES: "Survivor" was a fluke. Both "Big Brother" and "Survivor" were experiments.
ZUCKER: Most hits are flukes. Most hits probably almost didn't get on the air.
MOONVES: When NBC put "E.R." on the air, they did not like the testing. Julianna Margulies died in the first episode. Then, holy mackerel, she's testing -- maybe we better put the oxygen back on and let her live.
ALBRECHT: On "Hill Street," two guys actually died in the pilot. Then the show got on the air, and all of a sudden they were just seriously wounded. That show kind of limped along the first year until it got how many Emmy nominations?
ZUCKER: Well, the other problem in creating this perfect network schedule -- if there's ratings involved -- is waiting out the great shows. Before, shows could finish last in the ratings and eventually become hits. But it's much harder for that to happen today.
HIRSCHBERG: Well, say you could wait. Would you start with a drama, or would you start with a comedy? Jeff, you have this famous line--.
MOONVES: He has a famous line?
ZUCKER: Don't give me any openings. Oh, what I've said is, "Yes, I wish I had 22 Aaron Sorkins creator of 'The West Wing' ," because we would do 22 hours of "The West Wing." But the fact is, I can't afford it either financially or creatively, because there aren't 22 Aaron Sorkins.
HIRSCHBERG: Well, let's say there were five.
ZUCKER: Well there are five Aaron Sorkins. One of them's doing "The Sopranos," and one's doing a series for Les, and one's doing a series for us. Even so, I would start my new fantasy network with a comedy. Because I think, especially today, a comedy is much harder to find. And I think that with advertisers there's much more of a quest for a big, great comedy. I would try and target it younger, because it's harder to find the younger people, and if you make it a hit, everybody else will come. I don't think you have to stay in the "Friends" formula or anything like that.
MOONVES: They've been saying that for eight years.
ZUCKER: Exactly. NBC's biggest problem is they keep saying, "Find the next 'Friends."' There is no next "Friends." There will be a next great show.

Alchemy in the Golden Age of Drama
MOONVES: You know, when we start development, and people say, "What are you looking for?" We really say, "We're looking for everything." I don't know where my next hit is coming from. If you ask me today what will be on the schedule next May, I wouldn't even come close to having a clue.
HIRSCHBERG: You know that "Star Search" will be on.
MOONVES: Right -- may it be as successful as "American Idol." But, remember, we had it first. When you look at the past few years at CBS, it's a combination of "Survivor," "C.S.I." and "Raymond." Those are our three bright, shining lights. And they're all in very different genres and very different styles of shows.
HIRSCHBERG: But are advertisers or audiences looking for something specific?
MOONVES: Well, Jeff's correct. I think this is the golden age of drama. I don't think there has ever been a time in the history of network television that there've been more great dramas across the board. But comedy has had a rather fallow period. And what everybody is looking for is, What is the next breakout comedy?
ALBRECHT: Whether it's a comedy or a drama, you're looking for your signature show. Something that not only brings people in but says a little bit about what you stand for, to the audience and to other creative people. What "The Sopranos" did was show people what was possible.
ZUCKER: I think Chris has a really good point. Whether it's "Sopranos" or "The West Wing" or "C.S.I." or "Raymond" or "Survivor," we each have had signature series. I think that that's critical.
HIRSCHBERG: Do you ever initiate ideas?
ZUCKER: I might have a lot of crazy, wacky ideas, but the best ideas actually walk in the door.
MOONVES: Yeah, I think our skill is better as an editor and a sifter-through of material.
ALBRECHT: I don't do anything on a show. I don't write a show. I don't direct a show. I don't produce a show. I don't act in a show. I don't edit a show. So my idea of a show is almost sort of useless. I don't do anything.
HIRSCHBERG: Don't you help with casting? You said yes to James Gandolfini, which was a daring, nonnetwork sort of choice.
ALBRECHT: There were three people tested for the role: Stevie Van Zandt; a guy named Michael Rispoli, who played the don that Junior ends up inheriting the family from; and Gandolfini. Rispoli was funny, and I thought, Well, it could be him. The other guy's scary. And big. And mean. Ultimately, the question was, Who would Tony Soprano really be? That was the only way we could finally make a decision, because the room was split.
MOONVES: Supposedly, Anthony LaPaglia had the part when "The Sopranos" was at Fox.
ZUCKER: That's right.
ALBRECHT: For me to come up with an idea is almost useless, because then I'm like some nonwriting executive producer who's trying to get people to do what's in my head, when what I really want them to do is what's in their heads. I just want what's in their heads to be really good.
HIRSCHBERG: So even in a fictitious network, you're sort of stuck -- you're dependent on Aaron Sorkin or David Chase creator of "The Sopranos" . Is there anybody that's not on your schedules that you would all dream of working with?
ALBRECHT: I love Letterman. I think he'd be the perfect guy on HBO. I'd probably have him do some version of what he does.
MOONVES: Sorry, you can't have him. Others have tried.
ALBRECHT: I think that Dave is unique in the sense that he has tremendous credibility with lots of different constituencies. The rest of the stuff -- you know, I was in Florida at a convention for HBO, and Peter Roth FedExed me the "West Wing" pilot, because he didn't think it was going to get on the air. But I said I didn't think that it was right for HBO.
HIRSCHBERG: Why not?
ALBRECHT: It's a great drama for network television because it's kind of almost really about something. But it stays in a somewhat safe territory.

You Love Larry David, but Would You Want to Marry Him?
HIRSCHBERG: Jeff, who would you want to work with?
ZUCKER: I think Larry David co-creator of "Seinfeld," now star and creator of "Curb Your Enthusiasm" is a brilliant guy, and he's obviously had tremendous success at several series. And so he might be somebody that we could turn to for this comedy that we're going to use as a building block.
MOONVES: Larry's good. "Curb Your Enthusiasm" may be my favorite comedy on the air.
HIRSCHBERG: And it's on HBO. But "Curb Your Enthusiasm," there's an interesting question--.
ZUCKER: Would it work on the network?
MOONVES: It is probably too off for CBS right now. I think the advantage that HBO has is, they're looking to attract subscribers. It's a different attitude than attracting a mass audience.
HIRSCHBERG: Jeff, you want to work with Larry David, but would you put on something like "Curb Your Enthusiasm"?
ZUCKER: I'm going to ask him to develop the next comedy.
MOONVES: He wants "Seinfeld."
ZUCKER: I think "Curb Your Enthusiasm" is a great show. I don't know if it would be the anchor comedy that we want to build this network on. But I want Larry to create the next one, and I'm happy to leave it up to him to figure out what that is.
ALBRECHT: But if you think that it's really funny, and if you like Larry David, why wouldn't you put it on and see what happens?
ZUCKER: I think we should keep on programs that we think are terrific that don't necessarily have a big audience to begin with. But I think we can also have a gut as to whether it's ever going to find that big audience.
MOONVES: The old days of sitting with a 9 share because it's going to grow to a 15, those days are over. We're in a 500-channel universe. The die is cast in six weeks. You can make a move or two and see if it has a shot. But you know pretty well.
ZUCKER: That's the difference between our universe and HBO.

Never Another 'Everybody Loves Raymond'
ALBRECHT: So you think what happened with "Everybody Loves Raymond," where it built over time, couldn't happen even now?
MOONVES: Exactly. We were a 12th-place network at the time "Raymond" was on. It was Friday night, 8 to 9, where we were dead anyway. Then we flipped it a couple of times, and it showed some life. Unfortunately you can't have the patience for the builds anymore. In your ideal world, where I have all the money in the world, and I don't have a corporation looking down on me, maybe I could be more patient.
ZUCKER: Especially when you're at a network that is having some success, I don't believe that it's possible for a "Cheers" or a "Seinfeld," both of which languished in their youth, to happen today. It's a shame. Comedies take time, and they have to find their voices and get their legs.
MOONVES: Ironically, networks that are doing a lot worse can be a little bit more patient. "Raymond" may not have lasted on CBS today because we're doing better than we were six years ago.
ZUCKER: Which is why, actually, it is possible for a network that's down to eventually come up.
MOONVES: But it takes longer than it did before. A lot of times people say, "Why'd they cancel that show so quickly?" We have our reasons. We've seen the next five episodes. We've seen the producer running around losing control of the show, having no good scripts.
ZUCKER: Absolutely right. We have more information than the audience.
MOONVES: Sometimes you say, "My God, I could leave this show on for 12 years -- they're not going to know where the bathroom is."

How to Make a Network Executive Really, Really Jealous
HIRSCHBERG: All right, now you guys get to run HBO.
ZUCKER: Thank God.
MOONVES: Can I go to Wimbledon?
HIRSCHBERG: What do you envy about HBO?
MOONVES: Money, time--.
ZUCKER: Money, time, the ability to only do 12 or 13 episodes at a time.
HIRSCHBERG: Is it harder to do fewer?
ALBRECHT: Well, it's harder to do good. I think mediocre is really easy. And bad is easiest of all. Basically, it's not like we only want to do 13. We'd take 26 "Sopranos" if those guys could do it.
MOONVES: But you have the luxury to be able to accept only 13. I need 24 "C.S.I."'s every year. I can't afford my year if I don't have them. You figure out what the cost of a show is, and what advertising rates will be for originals and for repeats. If I cut the number of originals and had more repeats, that number would not make any sense anymore.
ALBRECHT: But on a hypothetical level, could you do 12 weeks of "West Wing" at 9 o'clock and then 12 weeks of "C.S.I." at 9 o'clock?
ZUCKER: Well, it becomes a financial issue. The economics of the broadcast business are based on accumulating 100 or 150 episodes so the studio can recoup its money in syndication and get a second wind out of the show.
MOONVES: And there's a fear that you may lose your audience when you only have 12 or 13 episodes. If you don't call the girl for a date a couple of times more during the year, she's going to go out with somebody else.
ZUCKER: And to go back to what else I envy, not only is HBO able to order 13 episodes, but they're basically programming with original series one night a week. Sunday.
ALBRECHT: Yeah. And we have a lot of movies--.
ZUCKER: No, listen. This is envy. It is nice to be able to promote one night of series. It really is. But we do seven nights a week. Or six, plus Saturday.
MOONVES: And I'm sick of this "It's not TV, it's HBO." By their own definition, they're not in our business! I want to bring back the Cable Ace Awards.
ALBRECHT: Oh, my God, the worst of the worst. That was when you knew you were in cable.
HIRSCHBERG: When did you start going to the Emmys?
ALBRECHT: I think it's 10 years ago.
HIRSCHBERG: How important have the Emmys been for you?
ALBRECHT: Well, first let me say that all our programming decisions are judgment calls. I have no idea if "The Sopranos" makes money for HBO, because we don't sell directly to anybody.
ZUCKER: You don't ask people if that's why they buy the channel?
ALBRECHT: We don't know who the new subscribers are. We sell to the cable operator. We try to do special acquisition campaigns to get new subscribers based around the premiere of "The Sopranos," and to a certain extent, you can see what kind of impact it had. But I guarantee you that's not millions of people. And what they're doing is, they're buying a deal. You actually have no idea if when "Sopranos" is off the air those people disconnect. So the challenge for us is trying to figure out where to spend our money. Networks have instant feedback that tells them if the job that they need done is being done. I have no feedback.
HIRSCHBERG: Are the Emmys feedback?
ALBRECHT: I think the Emmys help us gain a certain credibility. Does it translate into subscribers? I don't know. Certainly fewer people watch the Emmys today.
MOONVES: Fewer people watch because HBO's winning all the awards.
ZUCKER: Because fewer people have seen those shows than network shows. But the other thing that I'm envious about, since we're on this bandwagon, is the unbelievable amount of money HBO gets to spend on promotion. You spent more money promoting a series like "Band of Brothers" than we spend on a series.
ALBRECHT: That's not true. If I were to buy the air time that you spend promoting a new series, it would far exceed the money that I spend.
ZUCKER: But you spend money on our air.
MOONVES: "Band of Brothers" is different. "Band of Brothers" wins Emmy awards. It is possible, probable, that it brings subscribers to HBO. If I have a miniseries, and it wins the Emmys, big deal. I'm not going to get more viewers on CBS.
HIRSCHBERG: If you ran HBO, would you try another night of original programming?
ALBRECHT: Well, we've tried to expand. But we spend half a billion dollars a year on theatrical movies, and I have no idea if they're going to be good, bad, who they're going to appeal to. There's no consistent lead-in that you can use on any other night of the week. Because one movie may have been a hit with men. One movie may have been a hit with women. One movie may have been an adult movie. One movie may have a teen movie. All of those pieces can really drive you crazy.
HIRSCHBERG: Can you imagine a time when HBO would not be dominated primarily by movies?
ALBRECHT: Just like these guys are worried that if they only had 12 episodes of "C.S.I.," then viewers would say, "Hey, it's not on anymore; let's watch 'Will and Grace,"' we need to make sure that we're the first pay service in every home. What Starz wants, what Showtime wants, isn't to be in more homes than HBO. They want to be in all the homes that HBO's in.
ZUCKER: HBO is helping Showtime and Starz.
ALBRECHT: Believe me, if you look at our profits over the next couple of years, they'll go up. If you look at Starz, they'll go way up, because their programming costs are fixed, and they're getting in a lot more homes because of package deals with HBO.
ZUCKER: You know, you never say that HBO's most successful show is "G-String Divas."
ALBRECHT: "G-String Divas" is not our most successful show.
ZUCKER: Oh, come on.
ALBRECHT: It actually didn't get nearly the ratings I thought it would. "Real Sex" gets great ratings.
MOONVES: Well, "Real Sex" is a good show.
ZUCKER: We'd get killed for that show. The media really doesn't focus on those shows on HBO. They focus on their terrific series.
ALBRECHT: Every once in a while somebody will say, "I don't know what the big deal about HBO is -- you people forget they still have garbage on like 'Real Sex' and--."
ZUCKER: Yeah, I try saying that sometimes.

Networks Find a Way to Feel Good About Themselves Once Again
HIRSCHBERG: On the fictitious network, would you want TV movies?
ALBRECHT: You have to have a balance between the staples -- long-running series and the things that you can event-ize, be it a movie or a miniseries. Things that let you focus a lot of attention on your product. And nothing can create as big an event as broadcast network television. Nothing. It's free in every home in America. It's a 24-hour promotional platform. It's part of the family. It combines consumer advertising, consumer product and entertainment. And when something happens on broadcast television that's an event, it's unlike anything.
MOONVES: Network television can still aggregate an audience like nothing else in this country. There's nothing better than that communal experience.
ZUCKER: Whether it's the Super Bowl or the 9/11 movie that Les did or the finale of "American Idol" or the finale of "E.R." Even the series premiere of "Sopranos" will still be dwarfed by the World Series or the Super Bowl.
HIRSCHBERG: How important for this fictitious network is it to own a single night? Because HBO owns Sunday night to some degree.
ALBRECHT: We don't own Sunday night. We do well on Sunday night.
HIRSCHBERG: But a fewer number of hours can mean more pressure.
ZUCKER: Well, the problem for Chris now that I don't envy -- I envy all those other things -- but I think that the series that come behind "Sopranos" and "Sex and the City" are going to be judged against those series.
ALBRECHT: Well, I think the hard thing is, if a show fails on CBS or NBC, the show fails. If--.
ZUCKER: To big articles and big headlines.
MOONVES: Chris, if "The Wire" fails, it will not get nearly as much attention as we would if "American Dream" or "Without a Trace" fails.
ALBRECHT: But I think there's a certain bubble for HBO, and part of the bubble is perception. That stresses me out.
MOONVES: Well, there's something exciting about the immediacy of network TV, there's no question about it.
ZUCKER: It's why I actually like the fact that we get graded every morning.
HIRSCHBERG: Les, do you like that, too?
MOONVES: I like it better now that I'm an A student. When I was getting D's when I first came to CBS, it was very hard to read the ratings at 6 a.m.
ZUCKER: Well, it certainly determines your outlook for the day.

Perfect Pitch
ALBRECHT: When you put shows on the air at a network -- because I've never sat in those rooms -- what's the line between "I believe in the show" and "I believe the show's going to be a big hit"?
MOONVES: It depends. When you're scheduling 22 hours a week of prime time, the line gets very blurry. You have to be able to appreciate a show like "Full House" as well as "E.R." or "C.S.I." or "The Sopranos."
ZUCKER: I think that's absolutely right. You have to have a combination of shows that you would watch and shows that everyone else would watch.
ALBRECHT: But Les, when you saw "Full House," because you made that show when you were at Lorimar, did you think it was funny?
MOONVES: Yes, it was funny. It was cute. But I didn't have the same reaction as I had to "Friends." I will race home and see "The Sopranos." That's appointment television, which I think is what we're all looking for.
ZUCKER: Besides, you can make a good pilot, but it doesn't mean you're going to make a good series.
MOONVES: You've heard the joke where the guy dies and God says, "O.K., you get your choice of places." One place is idyllic, with beautiful women and water, and the other place is awful. The guy picks the beautiful place, and he shows up there and it's a mess. He says, "Where's the place you showed me?" God says: "Well, I showed you the pilot. This is the series."
ALBRECHT: But there's this myth that there's this huge pool of really talented out-of-work creative people that are just waiting for the call, and that somehow--.
ZUCKER: We're ignoring them.
MOONVES: I can't believe when a producer comes in and says, "Look, we really want to do a good show." I say, "You're at the wrong network." If somebody says that, they're an idiot. I mean, that's stupid. "Now, this really is going to be a good show." I have heard that probably 10 times.
ALBRECHT: The hardest thing to do in show business, by far, is to create and execute a high-quality, successful, long-running television series. And if you add comedy on top of it, that's even harder. To me, the hardest thing to do is "Friends" and "Raymond." There is nothing harder, not making a big movie, not anything.
MOONVES: Comedy pitches are about execution. "Cheers" -- it's eight people in a bar. The question is, How do you execute? What is "Friends" about? It's six people that live in an apartment building.
ALBRECHT: And every comedy pitch starts the same way. They'll start to lay out who the characters are. There's this wacky this and this eccentric that and this really funny--.
MOONVES: Amateurs call up and say: "You know, the place I work is so funny. It's a shoe store, and we've got this wacky guy in the back who's a midget." No, don't put in a midget, please. Comedies are about execution.
HIRSCHBERG: What's the best pitch you've ever heard?
MOONVES: The best pitch I ever got was Mark Burnett's pitch on "Survivor," because I had resisted it. I didn't even want to see him. And this guy totally sucked me in. He wove a great story.
ALBRECHT: Last year David Milch co-creator of "N.Y.P.D. Blue" pitched us the most amazing idea for a series set in ancient Rome. It was kind of a cop thing. And I was totally mesmerized. I knew I was going to pass on the idea, because we actually already were developing something set in ancient Rome. But it was the best pitch I ever heard.
HIRSCHBERG: You were already doing something set in ancient Rome?
ALBRECHT: Yeah. So I said, "O.K., we have to pass on that, but I've got to do something with you, because you're brilliant."
ZUCKER: Which is why he's now doing a western.
ALBRECHT: Yeah. This was probably the only time I gave somebody an idea. I said, "You know, I think the country's really ripe for a great western."
ZUCKER: And now everybody seems to be developing one.
HIRSCHBERG: What was the best pitch you ever heard?
ZUCKER: Probably Graham Yost with "Boomtown." It was a great pitch, just all the different storytelling techniques that he wanted to use. We knew right then that this was going to be a very, very serious contender.
MOONVES: And "Boomtown" is different. "E.R." was just a hospital show, but it was probably the best pilot ever shown.
ALBRECHT: The pilot doesn't really matter, though.
MOONVES: And the fact that the best season of "Friends" is the ninth is incredible. It's a miracle when something works.
ZUCKER: A miracle.
MOONVES: Finally, something we agree on.

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
Applying Science to the Casino

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
FOR many Las Vegas casinos, the conventional wisdom is that the key to success is to build huge copies of the world's wonders, then add sequins. But to Gary W. Loveman, it's about figuring out where to put the fishhook.
 It's also about using the latest science and business intelligence to do so. 
 Mr. Loveman is the newly named chief executive of Harrah's Entertainment, the Las Vegas-based company that operates the Harrah's casinos. He has been at the company for four years as president and chief operating officer. But before that he was a business professor at Harvard, and, while not strictly analogous, his presence in the gambling industry represents a culture clash as jarring as hillbillies in Beverly Hills. 
Far from espousing the "if you build it huge, they will come" axiom of his executive forebears in Las Vegas, Mr. Loveman has a philosophy grounded in M.I.T. training and Harvard case studies. For example, he is fond of noting Wal-Mart's discovery that its stores sell more Band-Aids if they are stocked next to the fishhooks; he is now pushing Harrah's to collect and mine customer data to figure out where to place slot machines and blackjack tables, and what promotions work best to increase betting.
"We've tried to make a science out of understanding very carefully what provocations are meaningful to customers," Mr. Loveman, 42, said. "In a sense it's the equivalent of Wal-Mart putting the right product in action alley."
The question is whether Mr. Loveman can translate his vocabulary of "decision logic" and "empirical data" into additional profits. Further, will employees and managers continue to buy into the unconventional approach, and his relatively highbrow demeanor? 
"The industry is filled with a lot of rough-and-tumble people," said Steven Kent, a gambling-industry analyst at Goldman Sachs. "The trick is for him to get managers to buy into a system they didn't grow up in."
That said, Mr. Kent added that Mr. Loveman is willing to "shake things up and make a decision based on profitability, not history."
Harrah's has fared well as a result, Mr. Kent noted. Last month, the company, which operates 26 casinos across the country, said its revenue rose to $1.13 billion, in the third quarter, up 11.9 percent from the period a year earlier. The company, despite having less opulent casinos than its Vegas neighbors, has focused successfully on a middle-tier market: mom-and-pop gamblers who bet less money than high rollers but bet more consistently, Mr. Kent said.
Things did not look so good for Harrah's in 1997, when Mr. Loveman was still a Harvard professor. The company, which has 40,000 employees, was being beaten in several markets, Mr. Loveman said, and was spending too much on promotions to attract gamblers in Las Vegas.
Mr. Loveman said he learned all of this when Harrah's asked him to teach its managers new strategies to improve their performance, something he did for several companies while he was teaching at Harvard. Not long afterward, Philip G. Satre, the chief executive of Harrah's, hired him as chief operating officer, then named him company president last year. On Jan. 1, Mr. Loveman will succeed him as chief executive; Mr. Satre, 53, will remain chairman.
In terms of personal income and glitz, it has been the career-change equivalent of trading a Honda Accord for a Ferrari, which is what Mr. Loveman did when he left the ivory tower for sin city. His annual pay rose to $3 million from $120,000, and he can use a corporate jet to shuttle between Las Vegas and Boston, where he lives on weekends with his wife, Kathy, and three children.
What is consistent is that he is still maniacally competitive. As a youth in Indianapolis, he attended a basketball camp run by Bob Knight, then the coach at Indiana University, but when he was the only member of his squad not to make the camp's all-star team, he quit the sport. He turned his attention to tennis and said he became one of the top 25 players in Indiana.
He received a bachelor's degree from Wesleyan University in Connecticut, where he fed his love of music by working at the college radio station and organizing concerts. After a stint as an economic researcher at the Federal Reserve Bank, he went to M.I.T. to study economics, completing a Ph.D. dissertation on causes of the protracted unemployment in Europe in the 1980's. Upon graduation, he accepted a business professorship at Harvard.
"When he told me he took a job at Harrah's, I said, 'You're kidding,' " said Bruce Miller, a lawyer in Boston and a longtime friend of Mr. Loveman's. "We all have a preconceived notion about what those guys in Vegas are all about; we've all seen 'Casino.' "
Mr. Loveman said he didn't gamble until he was 32. But he said the casino business suits his personality. "It's a competitive tonic," he said of Las Vegas. "I get a report card every day."
When Harrah's hired Mr. Loveman, the company had sown the seeds of science; it was collecting data on customers through "Total Reward" cards that they slip into a slot machine or give to a dealer. The cards record playing habits and correlate them with the gambler's age, sex and name. Mr. Loveman was responsible for interpreting the data from casinos and using it to attract gamblers, said Mr. Kent, the Goldman Sachs analyst.
Mr. Loveman found that the company could reduce its costs and achieve the same results by tailoring promotions to individual gamblers. Some customers would show up if they just got an offer for a free room, whereas others needed the inducement of show tickets. He said his approach is a combination of the "decision-science based marketing" used by credit card companies and epidemiological research, using controlled tests, with placebos, to give only what is necessary to change a gambler's behavior.
SOME Harrah's managers who were steeped in the culture of Las Vegas resisted the approach. Mr. Loveman responded by ridding the company of resisters -- and bringing in his own people. He recently hired a Rhodes scholar to be the assistant manager of a casino in Lake Charles, La. One of the first executives he brought in was Rich Mirman, a former Booz Allen Hamilton consultant whom Mr. Loveman met while at Harvard. Mr. Mirman runs marketing at Harrah's.
More change is on the way. Mr. Loveman said he planned to use his customer data to focus promotions even more narrowly. One person might get a coupon to use a particular slot machine at a given time, for example.
Ultimately, he added, he wants his industry to emulate the sophisticated retail operations, like Wal-Mart, that use customer data in innovative ways to improve their businesses. "I would be humbled to be in the same sentence as those guys," he said of Wal-Mart.

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY; 
Why Business Needs a Strong S.E.C.

BYLINE:  By DANIEL AKST 

 BODY:
MEMO to chief executives:
 What a mess. Corporate America has been rocked by scandal, yet the Securities and Exchange Commission is run by someone who seems awfully ginger about cracking down, and his agency is starved for funds. We can only imagine morale over there. 
 What to do? Get your lobbyists in gear and to demand a bigger, better-funded S.E.C. You're laughing? Go ahead, but here are some incontrovertible reasons why saving the S.E.C. is a matter of vital self-interest for you. 
* Eliot Spitzer. State attorneys general everywhere took notice when Mr. Spitzer, their counterpart in New York, found his face on the cover of Fortune magazine for his aggressive pursuit of financial malfeasance. Sure, the securities business is focused in New York, but it's not just about New York. Massachusetts is suing Credit Suisse First Boston, accusing it of using its ratings on stocks to reward companies for hiring it to underwrite their stocks and bonds; the state is demanding an end to the cozy relationship between investment banking and research departments in the industry. States have regulated securities for years, but not like this. Do you want to be subject to the varying laws, whims and political aspirations of 50 egos in 50 states? If the vacuum in Washington persists, rest assured that you will be.
* Stock prices, especially yours. You're supposed to serve your owners, and your owners want high share prices. Heck, so do you; otherwise, what good are all those options that come with your paycheck? But if investors lack confidence in corporate financial statements, or suspect that executives bestow investment banking business based on receiving first dibs on hot initial public offerings, they will be less willing to risk their money on stocks. That means lower earnings multiples, lower share prices and higher capital costs. Those can be a drag on the entire economy, but even if that doesn't matter to you, remember: it hurts shareholders, including you.
* That mean Street. You may think you're better off without a strong S.E.C., but you're not, because you need a watchdog on Wall Street. Remember the 1980's? How about Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky? Or think back to the days before there was an S.E.C., when manipulators wrecked companies. John Kenneth Galbraith has suggested that institutional dysfunction on Wall Street played a major role in the crash of 1929. While a strong S.E.C. is no guarantee of orderly securities markets and free-flowing capital, it's hard to believe it wouldn't help.
* History. While we're looking in the rear-view mirror, let's acknowledge that an understaffed, low-budget S.E.C. is nothing new. From the earliest days of the agency, in the 1930's, scarcity shaped its approach. Without the money or the staff to do more, William O. Douglas, the chairman, had to rely on hollow threats and on self-regulation by Wall Street. Things went downhill from there; the agency remained largely invisible until the 1970's, when Stanley Sporkin made headlines as its chief of enforcement. But the stakes are much higher now. Stock ownership is more widespread, money moves at the speed of light and the financial world is much more complex.
* No pain, no gain. As S.E.C. chairman in the 1990's, Arthur Levitt raised the agency's profile, attacked Wall Street conflicts of interest, struggled to improve corporate accounting, made public companies share information with everyone, not only with favored analysts, and demanded plain English in investor materials. Business Week called him the small investor's "best buddy." During his watch, stock ownership (and prices) soared. Coincidence? Maybe. But having an activist S.E.C. didn't seem to do any harm. And those were golden days, when everybody made money so fast it didn't seem to matter how much was pilfered.
Times have changed. Now, more than ever, all of us need an ably led S.E.C. that has enough money to do its job.
So, chief executives, it's time to call your pals in Washington. After all the money you give them, they'll be happy to hear from you.

HEADLINE: Nonstop Nights Out Of Mayor Workaholic 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
WHEN you are the richest politician in America, have a seemingly endless appetite for conversation, comfort food, golf and the art scene and you run a city where somebody wants you for cocktails six nights a week, mixing business with pleasure is not much of a problem.
 Last week, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg wanted to have a chat with the state's most important legislators about the city's budget woes, he did not hop aboard a northbound Amtrak. Instead, the mayor whisked the two leaders, Joseph L. Bruno and Sheldon Silver, aboard his private plane and took them to Bermuda, where they played a few rounds at the island's finest resort and spent the night at his palatial estate. 
 When the mayor needed quality time with the three city commissioners most under the gun -- police, fire and education -- he invited them and their wives to Noche, a cavernous tropical outpost in Times Square, for ceviche and a dessert of tres leches. On nights when he is feeling especially ambitious, Mayor Bloomberg can hit a book party and two charity events and still make it to Staten Island for chicken and mashed potatoes at a favorite restaurant, American Grill, with the borough president, friends or an aide. 
Not since John V. Lindsay has New York City had a mayor whose after-dark life was so active and varied as Mr. Bloomberg's. 
On any given night of the week, he races between events -- sometimes four to an evening with a costume change -- and then to dinner with people he feels contribute to the city. Many of these outings are strictly mayoral -- presenting a proclamation at the New York Is Book Country reception, for example -- while others are for groups that Mr. Bloomberg supported when he ran Bloomberg L.P., like arts philanthropies.
Almost any New York mayor has access to celebrities, sports figures and other bright lights, because of the job title. Mr. Bloomberg's situation is less typical. His prominent friends, including Henry A. Kissinger and Kofi Annan, were mostly gathered before he was mayor. He is more intrigued, it seems, by getting to know people he had almost no previous contact with -- fire chiefs, recycling experts, counterterrorism advisers. 
"In his company, his evening life was an extension of his day," said Patricia E. Harris, deputy mayor for administration. "As mayor, it is the same thing. Usually, his dinners are used to thank people or to promote New York or to listen."
Unlike Mayor Lindsay, who favored the "21" Club, passing time among movie stars and any patrician trappings his mayoralty could lend him, Mr. Bloomberg, whose estimated wealth is $4.8 billion, is just as happy in a burger joint as sipping a Bellini at Cipriani. So it was that Caroline Kennedy found herself sitting at the Neptune Diner in Queens with the mayor, after they flew into La Guardia from Washington.
While Mr. Bloomberg has been spotted by tabloid gossip columnists roughly a dozen times in the last two months -- at the Dia Center, holding a book party for Arthur Levitt, the former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman, for instance, or waving away Graydon Carter's cigarette smoke at a dinner party at the Four Seasons -- many of his evenings are spent away from the camera, with few in the know about what goes on. One Saturday night, for example, the mayor had dinner with a fire department chief and his family at Gracie Mansion. 
While Mr. Bloomberg still gets to the occasional Park Avenue dinner party, his days as a party-hearty sybarite (among his more famous parties at Bloomberg L.P. was one with a seven deadly sins theme) appear to be behind him. Old friends looking to go for a steak on the Upper East Side are often surprised when the mayor suggests Thai food in Queens or chicken in Staten Island instead. Pamela Silvestri, who owns the American Grill in West Brighton, Staten Island, wrote to Mr. Bloomberg during the campaign, urging him to come in. He has ever since. "They are always punctual and very easy to deal with," Ms. Silvestri said of Mr. Bloomberg's posse. 
Last week notwithstanding, the mayor does not have time to make use of his many homes. He has not been to his apartment in London in two years or his place in Colorado since last Christmas and has used his home in Bermuda a handful of times since he was elected.
"Mike is meeting people, making contacts and networking during the day and the night," an aide said. "He hates the weekends. The joke at the company is that his favorite day was Monday." 
Naturally, many of the people who knew the mayor as a corporate chief want him at their events as mayor. It is not always easy. The fashion designer Arnold Scaasi, for instance, called the mayor and implored him to attend a party for a retrospective of his work at the Fashion Institute of Technology. "I've known him for at least five or six years," said Mr. Scaasi, who met the mayor when they were doing work for Literacy Partners, which teaches adults to read and write. "He has a great sense of humor and is extraordinarily intelligent. Who wouldn't want to socialize with him?"
The mayor's office receives dozens of requests from groups wanting Mr. Bloomberg to speak, to cut a ribbon or to help celebrate an anniversary. His office weighs each request, seeking a mix of organizations, but often favoring charitable groups that the mayor supported in the years he was at Bloomberg L.P. "What you might think of as social is him continuing to be loyal to people and organizations," said Ms. Harris, who used to run Mr. Bloomberg's charitable giving.
One night in late September, the mayor hopped from a meeting about Sept. 11 at the Marriott Financial Center (6:15 p.m.) in Lower Manhattan, where he spoke, to Jimmy's Downtown, a Midtown restaurant (7:15), for the smoke-free happy hour, and stopped by his Upper East Side town house to jump into a tuxedo before heading for the Sheraton Hotel on Seventh Avenue to receive an award from the United Nations Association at 8. On most of his nights out, Mr. Bloomberg is home by 11:30. He arrives at the office the next day by 7 a.m., to prepare for his daily staff meeting at 8. 
Mayors have had a passion for socializing -- Jimmy Walker, who served in the 1920's, once quipped: "It's a sin to go to bed on the same day you get up." Edward I. Koch loved to hit the movies and to give dinner parties at Gracie Mansion, and David N. Dinkins spent many a night on the formal dinner circuit. Rudolph W. Giuliani enjoyed monthly town hall meetings in all boroughs and going to the opera, and there is no question that he would have attended 80 percent of the events on Mr. Bloomberg's public schedule. But Mr. Giuliani's private hours were almost always spent in the company of his closest aides.
"We would all be at the hall until really late, and then the mayor would get up and say, 'O.K., time for dinner,' and we would all go," a Giuliani aide said. "It was always simple, neighborhood places."
Unlike most of his predecessors, Mr. Bloomberg does not live at Gracie Mansion, the mayoral home on the Upper East Side, and so he spends less time socializing there than other mayors. Instead, the mansion is used as an upscale municipal catering hall, where city commissioners, agencies and, several times a week, the mayor himself give dinners. He was, for instance, host of a cocktail party at the mansion for people who contributed to the city's commemoration of Sept. 11. 
Mr. Bloomberg also gives frequent dinners at his town house on East 79th Street, where he mixes with old friends and new, including state senators, city commissioners and always a big name from the arts world. ("Friend" is a term he uses broadly: if you have ever eaten any meal larger than a snack with Mr. Bloomberg, you get that designation.) 
His town house dinner parties are catered, often by Glorious Food. They have to be. The kitchen pantry chez Bloomberg is stocked with little more than peanut butter and a can of coffee. Rare is the night that Mr. Bloomberg orders in Chinese food -- generally only when he visits his youngest daughter, Georgina, at the home of his former wife, Susan, with whom he remains friendly.
Restaurateurs are happy that the mayor likes to eat out, especially as many of them struggle in an embattled economy. Mr. Bloomberg travels light -- his security detail is small -- is unobtrusive, and his parties tend to be low-maintenance and fun, several restaurant owners said.
"You didn't feel that the mayor was cut off from the rest of the operation," said David Emil, who owns Noche, where the mayor has eaten twice in the last month. Mr. Emil, who once had a banana split at a dinner party at the mayor's home, was inspired to put the dessert on his menu, he said. "He really seemed at ease and comfortable and talked to a lot of people outside the restaurant after," Mr. Emil recalled. "He made me feel that he understood the life he was living in New York, and that felt good to me."

HEADLINE: Learning to Love Deficits 

BYLINE:  By Michael M. Weinstein; Michael M. Weinstein is director of programs for the Robin Hood Foundation, an antipoverty group, and a former economics columnist for the Times.

 BODY:
After a four-year absence, the federal budget deficit has returned -- and so has the politically contorted debate over it.
The deficit is $159 billion for the year that ended Sept. 30. Democratic leaders warn that the current deficit is a danger to the economy and prevents the government from spending federal dollars on pressing social needs. The Bush administration dismisses the importance of the deficit, noting that it amounts to only about 1.5 percent of gross domestic product. Not so long ago, these positions were reversed. Liberals said deficits could be used to energize a sluggish economy and to pay for projects that produce long-term economic benefits. Conservatives preached fiscal rectitude. 
 Liberals were right then, wrong now. How did this change of heart come about? 
 In the late 1980's and early 1990's, deficits were large, eventually reaching about 5 percent of gross domestic product. To address the problem, President George W. Bush raised taxes in 1990. Partly as a result of that tax increase, Mr. Bush lost the 1992 presidential election to Bill Clinton, who signed a deficit-reduction package in 1993. Each package cut deficits by more than $400 billion.
By all economic calculations, that should have been enough. But what started out as a prudent call by Democrats and Republicans for fiscal restraint soon tumbled toward a mindless fervor for zero deficits. And that tumble has had profound consequences for public policy and the plight of the country's poorest families. By discarding plans to raise federal spending on training, education and infrastructure for the sake of balanced budgets, mainstream Democrats took on the fiscal coloration of conservative Republicans.
Yet the economic case for zero deficits is nearly nonexistent. For starters, the goal of zero is arbitrary. The measurement of deficits takes no account of inflation or growth: a $100 billion deficit poses less threat to the $11 trillion economy of today than it did to the $6 trillion economy of the early 1990's.
The case against deficits improves only slightly when it comes to their effect on private investment. When the government spends more than it collects -- in other words, runs a deficit -- it borrows the difference. The purpose of cutting deficits is to reduce the amount of money that government siphons out of capital markets and away from private investors. Less private investment can result in less job training and research and development.
But what if the government borrows for exactly those same purposes -- paying for federal programs that train unskilled workers or build the Internet? There is no economic principle that says such public investments cannot be at least as pro-growth as the private investments they replace.
The pluses and minuses of federal borrowing, then, depend entirely on what is done with the borrowed money. Public borrowing can be economically smart -- or so most liberals used to preach.
Some still do. Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research estimates that running deficits of $200 billion a year would, at worst, reduce national income by little more than 1 percent, and most of the pain would not be felt for decades. In fact, if the government were to invest the borrowed money wisely, modest deficits could easily do more economic good than harm.
Now it is conservatives who increasingly step forward to put deficits in their proper place. R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, says that eliminating the current deficit would knock a fraction of a percentage point off interest rates -- nowhere near enough to trigger a surge of private investment. Besides, economists point out, the country could run deficits of $200 billion a year with impunity, because at that rate the country's debt would not grow faster than the economy.
So why have liberals and conservatives switched positions? Political expediency. Republicans now embrace deficits so they can hand a tax holiday to a small sliver of very rich Americans. Democrats preach zero deficits to block the Republican tax-cutting frenzy. Democrats' motive may be noble. But their rhetoric -- ridiculing deficits and exaggerating the financial threat posed by the modest deficits expected in Social Security -- is bogus.
That rhetoric has come back to haunt them. Despite years of spectacular growth, low inflation and a modest federal debt, Congress -- including many Democratic members -- still pleads fiscal poverty. It could afford to spend more money to train unemployed workers, for example, or to extend unemployment insurance payments during the current economic stagnation. But it refuses to pay for these sensible programs out of benighted fear of running modestly higher deficits.
In fact, Congressional Democrats are worried about the wrong issue. The return of deficits poses far less threat to the nation than policies that grow out of antideficit rhetoric.

HEADLINE: The World; 
To Iran, Iraq May Be The Greater Satan

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: MADRID 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH'S vision for Iraq is a bit like that of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the father of Iran's revolution. After Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, the ayatollah described Saddam Hussein as part of an evil alliance, calling him "a pro-American mercenary" and "an infidel" and urging the Iraqi people to overthrow him. 
 "If you can kill Saddam before we execute him, stab him in the back!" he told Iraqis. "Paralyze the economy! Stop paying taxes! This is a war between Islam and blasphemy!" 
 After Mr. Hussein withdrew most of his troops and declared a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war in 1982, the ayatollah rejected it, vowing to install an Iranian-style Islamic republic in Baghdad. It was 1988, the year before he died, that he gave up trying.
In their public stance today, the Iranians are being a lot more circumspect about changing Iraq's regime by force, now that the country proposing to do so is the United States. So as Americans prepare for war against Iraq, a huge question looms: Can the United States and Iran work together, or can they at least stay out of each other's way? Whatever their animosities, history suggests that the two sides know how to dance around each other in the shadows, making it possible that each can work toward mutual goals while never acknowledging cooperating with the other.
In any action to disarm Iraq, the preference of the Bush administration, as officials have long described it, would be not only to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction, but also to rid it of President Hussein. Various administration officials have spoken of installing a government that reflects the will of the Iraqi people and conforms to Washington's vision of what a modern Middle Eastern nation should look like.
Is that offensive to Iran? On the surface, of course. But in the shadows, perhaps not.
Last week, Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, was in Madrid reiterating Tehran's official line: Iran is vehemently opposed to any war against Iraq, only the Iraqi people can determine their destiny, and "if there is a war, we can take no sides and help no one." 
But other voices in Iran have begun suggesting that an American invasion might not be such a bad thing.
Mr. Khatami's brother, Mohammad Reza Khatami, deputy speaker of Iran's parliament and a voice of the reformist constituency that brought the president to power, said a few weeks ago, "The day that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is toppled will be among the happiest days for the Iranian people, no matter how this occurs."
Jafar Golbaz, a deputy in parliament, went further: "It will be the happiest day for all Iranians to see Saddam toppled, no matter by whom. Tehran may even decide to cooperate with the United States if it receives assurances that its interests will be respected."
So what will Iran do if war comes? President Khatami, despite his statements to the Europeans that a unilateral war to topple Mr. Hussein would destabilize the whole region, also suggested that Iran would not oppose any decision by the Security Council. He said in Madrid that there should be support from the United Nations if "there need to be further steps taken."
In fact, Iran has done just fine by sitting on the sidelines when Iraq was threatened before. In 1990, it refrained from interfering with the American-led coalition that expelled Iraq from Kuwait. It ignored American violations of its air space along its western border with Iraq and did not retaliate when American missiles inadvertently fell on its side of the border.
Even more significant was Iran's decision not to get involved after the war, when Iraqi Shiite Muslims in the south and Iraqi Kurds in the north rose up against Mr. Hussein. One argument raised in Washington against going to war with Mr. Hussein is that war could ignite a Shiite rebellion that the Shiites of Iran could use to dismember Iraq. 
But Iran, like Iraq's other neighbors, fears the instability such a dismemberment would bring to the border, to oil markets and to Iraq's majority Shiite population, who are Arabs, not Persians.
Similarly, in the American-led war against Afghanistan, Iran benefited by doing less, rather than more, despite its antipathy for the Taliban. It gave support to the American-backed Northern Alliance and cooperated in creating a new government in Kabul. While some American officials have said Iran harbors Al Qaeda, Iranian officials say their country, with the help of American intelligence data, has rounded up and expelled 250 Qaeda members.
If Americans pour into Iraq and stay to shape a government, Iran will almost certainly want some say about the outcome, if only because it wants to avoid feeling encircled. American influence is already strong in Afghanistan to the east; Pakistan to the southeast; the gulf Arab states to the south. Even Russia counts itself an American ally.
But fear of encirclement has not prevented the Iranians from working with the Americans on Iraq. 
When the administration organized a meeting of the six main Iraqi opposition groups in Washington in August, a representative of Ayatollah Mohammad Bakir al-Hakim, a senior Iraqi Shiite cleric living in Iran, was at the table. Meanwhile, Iran's navy is quietly cooperating with American vessels in the Persian Gulf, channeling boats suspected of smuggling Iraqi oil and dates away from Iran's shores so Americans can intercept them.
"We are condemned to be neighbors," Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, once said of Iran and Iraq, meaning that Iran will have to coexist with whatever regime is in power in Baghdad. These days, at least a few Iranians seem to be suggesting much the same about America.

HEADLINE: Let Them Come to Berlin 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
I haven't been to Berlin since since the opening of the Berlin Wall, so when I arrived at my hotel near the Brandenburg Gate, my first question was: Where's the wall? My German friend explained that the only trace left is a cobblestone path that snakes across Berlin, drawing a line in the pavement where the wall once ran. It's easy to cross that line without even knowing it.
 And therein lies the core of the crisis between America and Germany today -- triggered by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's use of anti-Bush and anti-Iraq-war rhetoric to win re-election, then fueled by a German minister comparing President Bush to Hitler and now capped by Mr. Bush's refusal to answer two letters from the German leader. 
 Would somebody please bring back the Berlin Wall? Since World War II, America and Germany have had many disputes, but always within limits, because both sides a saw dangerous foe on the other side of that wall -- the Communist totalitarians -- and realized we needed to fight together. There is still a dangerous foe out there -- now it is religious totalitarians -- and we still need to fight together. But without the wall clearly defining our side and the enemy's, all sorts of lines are being crossed.
What is most shocking about the German election is not how the Chancellor ran against America, it's how popular that theme was here. Two things are feeding this. One is the new anti-Americanism, a blend of jealousy and resentment of America's overwhelming economic and military power -- the "Axis of Envy," as Josef Joffe, editor of Die Zeit, calls it. The other is the new anti-Bushism -- resentment of the often contemptuous, unilateralist, anti-green instincts of the Bush team -- which was crystallized by Dick Cheney's August speech suggesting that any U.N. inspections of Iraq were useless and America may have to act alone. "The Cheney speech had a decisive impact on the German election," said Friedburt Pflueger, a top official of the pro-U.S. C.D.U. party, which got creamed.
Bottom line: Many Europeans today fear, or detest, America more than they fear Saddam. That's crazy, but it explains why Mr. Schroder easily moved from raising legitimate questions about how to handle Iraq to taking Germany out of any war against Saddam under any conditions. This put Germany to the left of Saudi Arabia, which at least says it will support an Iraq war if it is approved by the U.N. It was the kind of rhetoric that leaves Americans thinking Europeans won't use force under any conditions, and therefore are a danger to themselves and to us.
It is time for both sides to knock it off. We need each other. As Germany's thoughtful foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said to me, "We are facing a new totalitarianism -- the totalitarianism of Al Qaeda and bin Laden," which has emerged from the crisis in Islam. And the goal of these religious totalitarians "is to destroy the open society everywhere and the economy that it's based on."
The war against the religious totalitarians can't be fought with just armies or walls. It must be fought with police, intelligence sharing, development aid, peace diplomacy, and military operations. To win this war the open societies must each play to their strength -- America's hard power and Europe's soft power.
When Germany says it's willing to provide the peacekeeping force in Kabul, that is a huge help for us. When Germany funds the expansion of the European Union to lift from poverty ten new democracies of Eastern Europe, that is a huge help to us. But at the same time, some things are true even if a Texas cowboy believes them. I'm still not sure what the right way is to handle Iraq, but I am sure that ruling out war there, under any conditions, against a murderous U.N. outlaw like Saddam is wrong.
With a nod to J.F.K., my motto today is simple: "Ich bin ein New Yorker." We are all New Yorkers now. Wherever you live, if you believe in the open society, if you cherish a world of freedom, you are now in World War III -- a war against the new totalitarians, who strike at our businesses, discos, airports and theaters in an attempt to get us to shut ourselves in and our societies down. Either we fight this war together, or we lose it together. To those who forgot what it takes to defend the open society, let them come to Berlin -- let them walk the winding path where the Wall once stood and recall the collective effort that brought it down.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Spin City; 
The Surprises Began Before the First Vote Was Cast

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHO would have thought that the fate of the Senate and many of President Bush's legislative ambitions might depend on Walter F. Mondale, who stepped out of semi-retirement to run for the seat of the late Paul Wellstone? And who would have imagined that Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey would abruptly abandon his re-election bid just weeks before the election and clear the way for an archrival, former Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, to step in?
 Those late entries were a stunning turn in what had already been a relentlessly perplexing campaign season. The results in midterm elections are often confounding, but this go-round has a greater than usual sense of urgency and potential for chaos. The last time the balance of power in both the House and Senate was so precarious was during the Eisenhower administration. In the Senate alone, where Democrats hold control by a one-vote margin, more than a half-dozen races could swing either way. 
 Even Wednesday morning might not bring certainty because of the close races, possible recounts, runoffs and new vigilance toward voting irregularities after the wild 2000 contest. (And don't even count on knowing by Thanksgiving.) 
"The correct analysis on the Sunday before this election is, 'Who knows?' " said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, a mastermind of the Republican takeover of the House in 1994. "This is the least decided election in my lifetime."
Of course, all the tumult could end with a whimper. The House could stay (barely) Republican and the Senate stay (barely) Democratic. Yet other possibilities exist that have colossal implications for the careers of politicians and lobbyists in the capital, and, most important, for how the nation is governed.

The G.O.P. Dream
Ever since Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont defected from the Republican Party in 2001 and gave control of the Senate to the Democrats, Republicans have been plotting their comeback. The most obvious way they could reassert themselves is by wresting back committee chairmanships. Mr. Jeffords, for one, is chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and is popular among environmentalists. He could be replaced by Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, a frequent antagonist of the Environmental Protection Agency who would most likely press the administration's drive to change clean-air laws. 
The area where Republican control would make the most immediate difference is in confirming judgeships. Republicans would move swiftly to undo the Democrats' successful efforts to put off -- or sometimes sink -- Mr. Bush's judicial nominees. Democrats have used their narrow majority on the Judiciary Committee to block those Bush nominees they have deemed too conservative. White House officials have even said that if the Republicans regain control of the Senate, Mr. Bush would renominate Priscilla R. Owen, the Texas State Supreme Court justice whose federal appellate court candidacy was defeated by Democrats on the committee who objected to her antiabortion rulings, among other decisions.
"If we gain control of the Senate, you'll clearly see a lot more judges," said Senator Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican and Judiciary Committee member. "The judges have been stalled in the Judiciary Committee. That would change dramatically."
Those judges could change the law on several fronts, including environmental disputes over control of natural resources, the reach of states to regulate abortions and the division of power between states and the federal government.
If the House, Senate and White House are all Republican, that would certainly enhance the potency of Mr. Bush as he embarks on his re-election campaign. While a Republican House and Senate would not roll over for the White House agenda, it would be far easier for Mr. Bush to champion big issues that he could run on in 2004, like passing a Medicare drug benefit to his liking (that would neutralize the Democrats who have pressed for a more ambitious approach), creating a homeland security agency that would give the president wide control over its employees, approving new tax cuts and limiting damages that could be awarded in medical malpractice cases.
Democrats are so worried about losing power that they are already mulling options should there be a 50-50 outcome in the Senate. For example, they have set their sights on recruiting Senator Lincoln Chafee, a moderate Republican from Rhode Island.
Mr. Chafee refuses to entertain such notions, but others are not giving up. "There's no pressure on Lincoln," Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat. "I'd call it encouragement. He would be more Democratic than I would be."

A Democratic Heaven
The prospect of the Democrats recapturing the House may seem more unlikely than the Democrats holding onto the Senate, but it is a far more frightening possibility for the White House. That is because while in the Senate little can be accomplished without a majority, in the House the rules afford the party in charge far more power to set the agenda -- and essentially push the minority party into the corner.
The chairmanships of important committees would shift from some of the most conservative lawmakers to some of the most aggressively liberal, including Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, who would likely take over the Ways and Means Committee, and John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, who is in line to head the Judiciary Committee.
Some Democratic lawmakers have said that if they had control they would demand that Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Committee, appear before them to explain the controversies over his efforts to appoint a board to oversee the accounting profession.
"Every committee will be much more aggressive," Mr. Rangel said. Saying that "a lot of the progress that we have made under the Clinton administration has been destroyed," Mr. Rangel pledged to press for health care legislation, raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment benefits and other measures aimed at helping the poor and middle class.
Mr. Gingrich, who knows better than anyone how the opposing party could use Congress to badger the White House, said he would expect Democrats to try his playbook. "The Democratic majority would try to weaken the administration," he said. "You'd have Democratic chairmen on television announcing various and sundry investigations."
An even scarier prospect for the White House would be if Democrats win both the House and the Senate. Yet for all the tumult that would cause for Republicans, the reality is that the president always has his veto pen.

The Status Quo
Short of a Republican sweep, this might be the preferred outcome for Mr. Bush. If the Senate stays Democratic but with a paper-thin margin, Democrats would not have that much clout anyway. But in his re-election drive Mr. Bush could campaign against obstructionism in the Senate.
As exasperating as it is for Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, to preside over a Senate that is so closely divided, it is better than the alternative. Asked how life is for Mr. Daschle with a one-seat majority, his friend Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, said: "Better than with a one-seat minority. If he does nothing but stop them from doing bad things and wrong things, it's worth it."

The Switcheroo
What if Republicans take over the Senate and Democrats regain the House? It's never happened before, but that doesn't mean it's impossible. Such a turnabout could tarnish the reputations of Mr. Daschle and the current speaker, J. Dennis Hastert.
"If we lose -- if we go down more than five seats," said Representative Mark Souder, an Indiana Republican, "there would probably be a complete reanalysis for someone the conservatives find acceptable" to supplant Mr. Hastert. Then again, Mr. Souder said, leaders are not always elected because of ideology. He said maybe Mr. Hastert would remain because he has helped raise so much money for his members. "A lot of this isn't a sweeping, 'What's best for the party?' but how much money did you raise?" he said.
Mr. Daschle would have even more explaining to do if his South Dakota protege, Senator Tim Johnson, loses, and that costs the Democrats control. But there would be one upside for Mr. Daschle: he would no longer have to worry so much about taming his unruly flock of Democrats. That could free him up to take on several of his Democratic colleagues and run for president.

HEADLINE: The World: After Hussein; 
Controlling Iraq's Oil Wouldn't Be Simple

BYLINE:  By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

 BODY:
THERE is still some dispute over the extent of Saddam Hussein's chemical or biological weapons, but one thing beyond dispute is that he has oil. Lots of it. Five times more proven reserves than the United States, the second biggest supply after Saudi Arabia, and more waiting to be found.
 For many of the countries most immediately involved in the debate over whether to invade or not to invade Iraq, including Russia, France, Saudi Arabia or China, the fate of that oil is a critical national interest. 
 Yet oil does not loom large in public debates, at the United Nations or elsewhere. At the White House, suggestions that oil is a consideration are still treated as unseemly. 
"The only interest the United States has in the region is furthering the cause of peace and stability, not his country's ability to generate oil," said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman. But wouldn't a victorious American army end up administering Iraq's oil fields? "I wouldn't even try to start guessing what the military may or may not do," Mr. Fleischer replied.
No serious expert believes the charge made by Mr. Hussein that Washington's one real goal is to seize his oil. That, argues Philip K. Verleger Jr., a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, would be "an economic gamble of enormous proportions," given the deplorable state of the Iraqi oil industry, the enormous costs of rebuilding the country, and the uncertainty over the future.
But 112 billion barrels of proven reserves is also something nobody can overlook. So even if it's not only about oil, or even mainly about oil, Iraq's "ability to generate oil" is always somewhere on the table, even if not in so many words.
But what is at stake is not an instant bonanza that so vast a reserve might suggest. Oil is a complicated and expensive business, and experts agree that Iraq would need something in the vicinity of $5 billion and at least three years to repair the ravages of 20 years of war and sanctions, and to resume the explorations abandoned in 1980, the year it invaded Iran.
The last report by United Nations experts, in March 2000, said Iraq's capacity had fallen from a peak of 3.5 million barrels a day to 2.8 million, and would continue falling without prompt action. 
Even if the flow resumed in the absence of United Nations sanctions, which allow Iraq only to barter its oil for food and other basic commodities, repairing the rest of the country and paying off its huge debts (if in fact a future government assumed them) could well absorb the bulk of the proceeds.
"People have lost perspective," said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "They think all Iraqi oil is up for grabs. The way I think about it is there is clearly an oil element, but it is not the decisive one."
"Nobody even knows if there will be a rehabilitated Iraqi national oil company," Mr. Yergin continued, "or whether it will be the vehicle to extract Iraq out of its debts. No company will write a check for a million dollars without some sense of stability, without knowing who to negotiate with."
Yet the very fact that there are so many unknowns may drive the countries with a serious interest in the future of Iraq and its oil -- Russia, France, China and Saudi Arabia most prominent among them -- to seek some assurance that they and their concerns will be taken into account by a victorious America.
Russia is a case in point, with something to lose -- and gain -- at every juncture of an American war on Iraq. The immediate effect is likely to be a steep increase in oil prices, benefiting Russia's oil-driven economy. Beyond that, Russia's interests get more complicated.
Iraq still owes Russia from $7 billion to $10 billion for arms purchases during the war with Iran, and Russian oil companies, with their history of cooperation with Iraq, are poised to be major players in any revival of the Iraqi oil industry.
Lukoil, Russia's biggest oil company, signed a 23-year deal with Iraq five years ago to rehabilitate the country's southern oil fields, a deal potentially worth billions. 
At the same time, Russia is worried that an eventual increase in Iraqi oil production could drive prices down.
Perhaps even more worrisome for President Vladimir V. Putin is that if the United States secures a private gas pump in Iraq, he might be denied the energy cooperation on which he has placed his hopes for a new relationship with Washington and the West.
So Russia finds itself in a conundrum, opposed to a war that could undermine its best claim to serious global influence, but aware that it cannot sustain a long and serious disagreement with Washington over an issue like Saddam Hussein's future that the United States considers critical.
"Iraq opens up everything the Russians have agonized over in the past 10 years," said Toby T. Gati, who served as a special assistant to President Bill Clinton for Russia and is now a senior adviser with the Washington law firm Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld. "It raises a question in their minds about American intentions, about which they can do little." 
"So the real issue," Ms. Gati continued, "is American power -- how do countries safeguard their interests in a unipolar world, where Washington's attitude is that what's good for America is good for the world?"
Similar questions over American intentions can be heard in Paris, Riyadh and many other capitals. Youssef M. Ibrahim, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said some countries -- like Saudi Arabia -- might start looking for ways to block what they perceive as an American threat in Iraq.
"The Saudis are saying to themselves, the Americans are going to invade Iraq and turn it into their private pumping station," Mr. Ibrahim said. "So what can they do? One, they can wait three years and see, or two, they can wage a war right now. The only war they can wage is to open all the valves." That, he said, would drive many competitors out of business by dropping prices precipitously.
But for the Saudis, as for the Russians -- and the French, who also have a longstanding relationship with Iraq -- the risk of ending up on the wrong side of Washington and of whatever government it supports in Iraq ultimately leaves no real alternative but to fall in line behind the United States. So their tactic, at the United Nations and other forums, is to do what they can to impress their national interests on Washington, and to press as hard as they can for Washington not to go it alone.
"So it is about oil, about what the Middle East looks like after Saddam, which is about which countries get to play," Ms. Gati said. 
For now, the fear in foreign capitals is that those who do not back Washington will not get to play.
As for the rest, Mr. Fleischer probably was as good a guide as any when he said, "I think that it's impossible for anybody to speculate about anything and everything that could possibly happen under any military scenario."
The next sign may come in early December, when the State Department will hold meetings with the Iraqi opposition on the future of their oil.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: FLORIDA; 
Black Turnout Could Be Critical for Democrat

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Two days after a boatload of Haitian migrants made a desperate journey for the Miami shore, Bill McBride, the Democratic candidate for Florida governor, swept through the Miami neighborhood known as Little Haiti on Friday to denounce their detention and perhaps pick up a few votes.
 "If you don't care about this, then your heart is just too hard," Mr. McBride told the crowd of more than 100 cheering Haitian-Americans at a community center. "We should not be locking people up who are seeking freedom." 
 In recent days, Mr. McBride, a Tampa lawyer and first-time candidate, has intensified his focus on potential black voters. Often accompanied by some of the state's most prominent black political figures, he has made appearances at black churches and schools in poor neighborhoods to talk about overcrowded classrooms and the need for a more inclusive state government. Mr. McBride is also scheduled to attend services at black churches on Sunday with Al Gore and Bill Clinton.
In the homestretch of his campaign to unseat Gov. Jeb Bush, Mr. McBride is keenly aware that his candidacy is dependent upon huge support from black voters, particularly in South Florida. "I think it's the key to a big turnout, and if we have a big turnout I'll win," Mr. McBride said on his way out of the Haitian community center.
Indeed, large black voter turnout was an important factor in Mr. Gore's close race in 2000 with the governor's brother, George W. Bush. It is expected to be just as important for Mr. McBride in on Tuesday if he expects to offset the governor's solid Republican base in crucial areas like the Florida Panhandle.
"African-Americans make up about 11 percent of Florida registered voters," said Alan Stonecipher, communications director for the McBride campaign. "Their role is going to be vital, no question about it. If there is high turnout with every other group and not with African-Americans it would mean that our ability to win becomes less likely." 
Democratic strategists say Mr. McBride must pull off a tricky balancing act in the final days of the race by continuing to reach out to the black communities in South Florida while not neglecting the crucial I-4 corridor from Daytona Beach to Tampa Bay in Central Florida. That area is considered critical to state elections because it has a heavy concentration of swing voters.
"He needs to energize the Democratic base," said Jim Krog, a lobbyist who ran the 1990 and 1994 campaigns of Gov. Lawton Chiles, a Democrat. "They've got to look for every tool they can to do that. I'd use Janet Reno; I'd use Bill Clinton. I'd use the churches, those folks whom the African-American community identifies with as their champions. I would attempt to get those champions involved in the next few days." 
Mr. McBride is executing just such a game plan, but it may not be enough to overcome Governor Bush's lead, his solid support among Republicans and his popularity with another critical constituency, the state's sizable Hispanic population, particularly Cuban Americans in South Florida. Mr. Bush had a 49 percent to 43 percent lead in a poll conducted Saturday through Thursday by several Florida newspapers owned by The New York Times. 
"I think in a very close election, which this is, both those demographic groups are very, very critical," Mr. Krog said. "The Hispanic vote, in particular the Cuban vote, is very important for Bush."
Although Mr. Bush has alienated many blacks in the state with his policies on affirmative action and his role in the 2000 presidential election, in which African-American voters were disproportionately disenfranchised, Mr. McBride has not been entirely successful in shoring up the black vote. With his strategy of running a largely one-issue campaign focused on public education, Mr. McBride has not consistently hit Mr. Bush on issues that resonate with many black voters.
In a recent televised debate, for instance, Mr. McBride made only passing reference to the crisis at the Florida Department of Children and Families, for which the governor has been widely criticized. The agency, which Mr. Bush promised to fix as a candidate four years ago, admitted in April that it had lost a 4-year-old black Miami girl and had not noticed her absence for more than a year.
State black luminaries are trying to project a united front for Mr. McBride. But they acknowledge that defeating Mr. Bush will not be easy.
"I've just been telling everyone I see, in a Burger King drive-through or just picking up my dry cleaning, to make sure they vote," said State Senator Kendrick Meek, a Democrat and one of the state's black political power brokers.
Mr. Bush has managed to gain the backing of some black residents and community leaders in the state. This week, several dozen African-American community leaders, pastors and families endorsed Mr. Bush at a news conference in the low-income Liberty City neighborhood in Miami. And last week, The Broward Times, a 24,000-circulation African-American newspaper in Coral Springs, endorsed Governor Bush, the first time in the paper's 13-year history that it has supported a Republican.
"I met with McBride several times, and he didn't address the issues," said Keith Clayborne, editor of the paper.
"We asked him about issues of economic development. How would you assist black enterprises? It was a very vague response that didn't address the question. His answer was always we have to beat Jeb Bush, because he knows in the black community Jeb Bush is a huge negative. "McBride has not taken any program that Jeb has implemented and said he has a better plan for it," Mr. Clayborne said.
Mr. Bush's supporters say that they do not expect the governor to receive huge support among black voters, but that he can win enough of those votes to chip away at the large numbers Mr. McBride will need to win. "We feel it will be a double-digit number, north of 10 percent," said Al Cardenas, chairman of the Florida Republican Party. "We're very encouraged by it." 
Mr. McBride's main supporters contend that the Republicans are simply putting on a good game face, realizing that Mr. Bush will be in trouble on Election Day if black voter turnout is overwhelmingly high. But the McBride backers seem less certain that will happen.
"Let me put it this way, nobody's declaring victory," said State Senator Daryl Jones, one of the state's most popular black elected officials, who was defeated by Mr. McBride in the Democratic primary and is now campaigning for him. "The Republicans are not saying they're going to win, and the Democrats are not saying they're going to win. No one knows; this one is way too close to call."

HEADLINE: Life With Microsoft Still Stifling for Rivals 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
At the end of a four-and-a-half-year court battle and distracted by a gloomy high-technology economy, Silicon Valley today largely took Microsoft's victory in a federal antitrust case on Friday as a foregone conclusion.
 Living with Microsoft has increasingly meant staying away from markets that the company controls as a result of its desktop computer software monopoly and looking for niches that are not likely to attract Microsoft's attention. 
 Indeed, many executives here said they were more concerned with what Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court in Washington chose not to think about when she approved the company's settlement with the Justice Department. Rather than focus on her relatively narrow ruling on how Microsoft manages its Windows operating system, these executives said they were more concerned about competing with Microsoft in an ever-expanding range of markets from hand-held computers to providing Internet service. 
"Now the gloves are off," said Jonathan I. Schwartz, an executive vice president who heads software efforts at Sun Microsystems. "The industries that need to be concerned will include media companies, retailers and financial institutions."
Microsoft, Mr. Schwartz warned, now has new targets that are not technology companies, and in the wake of a narrow ruling that allows it great freedom in new markets, the nature of the competition would soon become far broader.
"The impact of this ruling won't be felt in Silicon Valley because the Valley has already suffered the impact of Microsoft's monopoly," he said. Sun has long been one of the most outspoken critics of Microsoft and is locked in a private antitrust lawsuit with the software company over the licensing of Sun's Java programming language.
Executives at other software and hardware companies here also said they had been resigned to a judgment in support of the settlement with few additional restrictions on Microsoft.
Mitchell E. Kertzman, the president and chief executive officer of Liberate Technologies, an interactive television software company based in San Carlos, Calif., said the ruling was a "nonevent."
"In the Valley, people were disgusted, but not shocked," he added. "We assumed that this was the way we would have to live with Microsoft."
Indeed, the battles for control of the personal computer operating system and the Internet browser that the court's ruling dealt with are for the most part viewed here as being long over.
The bruising battles over the rise of the commercial Internet that led directly to the antitrust lawsuit have also given way to a restructuring of the Valley that in many ways resembles an earlier era, executives said.
"The climate today feels exactly reminiscent of the late 1980's," said Jim Breyer, the managing general partner of Accel Partners, one of the Silicon Valley's leading venture capital firms. "From an industry structure standpoint, it's as if you've dialed the clock back 13 years with both I.B.M. and Microsoft being in a better position than at any time in the past decade."
The Valley, he said, is now in one of those periods between major technological disruptions, when no one is certain what the next breakthrough will be.
By ruling narrowly on the question of how Microsoft can exploit its monopoly in personal computer operating systems and largely rejecting charges that Microsoft repeatedly tried to extend that monopoly into new markets, the judge insured that her ruling would have little impact on Valley's current economy and technology, executives said.
At the same time, underscoring Microsoft's continued overwhelming presence in the personal computer industry, neither Apple Computer nor Hewlett-Packard, the Valley's leading PC makers, would comment on the case.
Although Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, has largely resisted opportunities to criticize Microsoft publicly during the case, Apple did provide government witnesses who testified about Microsoft threats and pressure.
While Hewlett-Packard has publicly been one of Microsoft's strongest allies during the court case, some executives at the company privately reached out to reporters to point out instances of Microsoft's use of pressure tactics to control the industry.
The continued silence of powerful companies on the case was seen as evidence by some in the industry that the court ruling has done little to rein in Microsoft's economic power.
"People have been reluctant to talk about Microsoft consistently for the past five years," Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry Association, an industry trade group, said in an interview.
Later, in a statement, Mr. Wasch said that "we listened to the same testimony that Judge Kollar-Kotelly did, and we are perplexed that she didn't recognize that Microsoft's anti-competitive behavior now extends far beyond the browser, into a range of other technologies and markets." He urged state attorneys general who had sought strict penalties against Microsoft to appeal Judge Kollar-Kotelly's decision.
Whether that happens or not, many companies in Silicon Valley are likely to continue spending more time struggling to survive in markets that Microsoft doesn't dominate.
Although Microsoft has been a fierce competitor of Sun's in the field of programming languages, executives at companies in fields where Microsoft has faired poorly, like hand-held computing, said they had a more immediate concern: the slumping economy.
"People are concerned about other problems today," said Donna Dubinsky, the chief executive of Handspring, a maker of hand-held computers based Mountain View, Calif. "I don't think this is people's No. 1 problem today. There are greater concerns."
For others here, Microsoft has always been a force to be contended with, but it is still one that generates ambivalence.
Randy Komisar, a veteran technology entrepreneur and lawyer, said that his first assignment when he joined the pioneering notepad computer maker Go Corporation in 1991 had been to determine whether or not to sue Microsoft.
Microsoft had negotiated with the start-up firm while secretly planning a competing product. Microsoft killed its version after Go had failed -- in part because of Microsoft's plan to enter the market.
"We felt pretty violated," Mr. Komisar said. Yet the company did not sue, deciding it had little chance for a significant legal victory against the much larger company.
Today, Mr. Komisar said he still feels ambivalent about Microsoft. On the one hand, it is one of the few bright lights in a grim economy that badly needs some signal of strength. At the same time, he sees Microsoft using its monopoly in PC operating systems to bully its way into other markets, like the hand-held computer market.
"The good news," he said, "is that Microsoft has been proven to be a monopoly and that means that the Justice Department can stick its fingers in more easily" if Microsoft bullies too ferociously in the future.
Mr. Schwartz of Sun Microsystems echoed those sentiments.
"The glass is clearly half full," he said. "Every customer I talk to knows that Microsoft is a potential competitor and a problem."

HEADLINE: FEUDING FOR PROFIT: Rap's War of Words; 
In Rap Industry, Rivalries as Marketing Tool

BYLINE:  This article was reported by Lola Ogunnaike, Laura Holson and John Leland and was written by Mr. Leland. 

 BODY:
Six years after the violent deaths of the rap stars Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G., which some in the industry consider the culmination of a war of words between rival East Coast and West Coast rap camps, the world of platinum-selling hip-hop remains fascinated by threats and insults. Indeed, taunts and menace have often served as provocative come-ons for a $1.6 billion industry.
 Now with rap album sales even more depressed than the music industry as a whole, these rivalries may hold a key to its turnaround. This month the rap world is counting on four heavily promoted CD's by major stars to salvage the year. 
 Many people, from teenagers to the heads of giant media companies like Sony and Vivendi Universal, are looking to these albums as an indication of whether rap can rebound and remain the vital form -- and the cash cow -- it has been for the last decade. 
And as always, the feuds, exacerbated in an era of corporate consolidation, are stirring the buzz and whipping up enthusiasm.
The current talk is about bad blood between Ja Rule and DMX, who in recent interviews and forthcoming albums have taunted and belittled each other. And in the semi-autobiographical movie "8 Mile," which opens Friday, the character played by Eminem is beaten up by rival rappers, who carry a battle of words off the stage and onto the street.
The killing in Queens last week of Jam Master Jay of the group Run-DMC revived headlines of rap killings and blood feuds of the past, though it is far from clear what occurred in this latest case.
Whether the style is called rap or hip-hop, underneath all the feuds is the question of money.
"Companies make out well," said Bert Padell, an accountant whose clients include Madonna, Run-DMC and others. "Managers make out well. Artists don't make out well." Mr. Padell said it was common for a performer with an album generating $17 million in sales to wind up with as little as $70,000 before taxes. When the performers feel compelled to use that money in competitive flossing, or showing off, tempers can flare. 
After more than two decades of growth, hip-hop album sales hit a wall last year, declining about 15 percent to 89 million in 2001, from a peak of 105 million the previous year, according to the Nielsen SoundScan company, which tracks sales figures. Album sales for the music industry were down overall, but less -- 3 percent in 2001 -- reflecting both the recession and the growth of free Internet file-sharing services. For the first six months of 2002, sales of hip-hop albums were down almost 20 percent from the same period last year, compared with a general industry drop of 13 percent. Once driven by surprise breakthroughs by new performers, the genre has come to rely on a few bankable stars whose recordings require ever-escalating budgets.
Hilary Rosen, the chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, blamed rap's slump on its success: as its influence spread, fans could get hip-hop flavors from rock or pop albums. 
For the music business, which last year sold $13.7 billion worth of albums, hip-hop accounted for 12 percent of sales. Even with this dip, rap has provided some of the industry's few bright spots. The three top-selling albums this year according to Nielsen SoundScan -- "The Eminem Show" by Eminem, "Nellyville" by Nelly and "Ashanti" by Ashanti -- are rap or rap-inflected. This month's major albums are by Eminem, Missy Elliott, Jay-Z and Ja Rule.

The Rapper
Leaving the 'Hood, But Still Staying Close
Many hopes rest on 26-year-old Jeffrey Atkins, known as Ja Rule, whose fourth album, "The Last Temptation," is scheduled for release on Nov. 19. He also stars opposite Steven Seagal in an action movie called "Half Past Dead," which opens Nov. 15. 
Interviewed in a SoHo recording studio last week, Ja Rule communicated the positive side of success with $250,000 worth of jewelry, and the negative side with a switchblade he calls Valley. The studio, owned by Ja Rule's record label, Murder Inc., is called the Crack House.
He said he needed the knife for protection. "If I was Justin Timberlake, I wouldn't have to walk around with a gun and knife," he said, referring to the lead singer in the boy band 'N Sync. "But I'm not. I'm Ja Rule." 
Ja Rule embodies the contradictions of a modern hip-hop performer, trying to balance thug bona fides with the embrace of the corporate mainstream. The father of two, married to his high school girlfriend, he has collaborated with Jennifer Lopez, Mary J. Blige, Mariah Carey and others. 
But as his fame has grown, so has his fear for his life. A jealous former neighbor, an overzealous fan, anyone is a possible threat, he said. "It's sad, because that feeling is mainly towards my black people," he said. "When my white fans come around, I don't feel uneasy, like they want to harm me. But when I'm around a whole group of black people, a defense comes on," he said. "That's the tragedy of this."
He added, "Don't get it wrong -- we love our ghettos and our ghettos love us, but there are always the one or two knuckleheads that you have to watch out for."
Many rap stars try to straddle two worlds, enjoying newfound wealth while remaining close to their roots. Fans, white and black, like their rappers to be close to the street. "If you're not from the 'hood," he explained, "they don't feel you're a real rapper."
Ja Rule, who grew up in Hollis, Queens, now lives in a wealthy New Jersey suburb. He bought his mother a home nearby and two other homes as real estate investments. But, he said, like many of his peers, he found his new community lonely and sterile. "You have no choice but to go back to your 'hood because that's where your friends are, that's where your love is," he said.
The straddle can be precarious. "The streets is like our drug," he said. "That's what I'm trying to explain to the white audience. This is our addiction that we can't get away from and this is what drags down the rap star. It's like the actual drug that drags down the rock star."
Ja Rule said that like many other rappers he had overcome not just the difficulties of his youth, but also an early record deal that brought him recognition but little money. He is currently in litigation with the company. Because he has only recently started to really get paid, he said, he is not apologetic about his jewelry, which included a $100,000 Rolex watch. "I know people probably look at me and think this is senseless," he acknowledged. "But when you're dealing with what you call new money -- which is what I am -- to spend is still very fun for me. I'm still enjoying it."

The Numbers
Big Sums in Advances Get Whittled Away
In a Manhattan office cluttered with sports memorabilia, Mr. Padell, the accountant, outlined the economics of a typical hip-hop deal, with the caution that no two deals are identical. Not all rappers, he said, had the advantages of Ja Rule, who also makes money as a writer, as a frequent guest performer and as a partner in a record company aside from his albums.
"Let's say you're a successful artist -- your last album sold, say, 1.5 million copies," he said. A performer with such a track record might negotiate an advance against royalties of around $1 million. This, he conceded, sounds like a lot of money.
"But . . . " he continued.
He started ticking off expenses.
Out of their advances, performers pay for all recording costs, including studio time and personnel. As hip-hop has become more successful, album sales and radio airplay increasingly depend on big name producers like the Neptunes, Timbaland and Jermaine Dupri, who charge anywhere from $35,000 to $100,000 per song. Many rappers also call in other artists for duets or cameo appearances at $10,000 to $50,000 a song, Mr. Padell said. The performer also pays for the rights to any digital samples, which vary widely in cost.
In all, Mr. Padell put recording costs at about $700,000 -- all paid for by the artist -- leaving $300,000, still a lot of money.
"But . . . " he said again.
Out of this figure, the performer's manager gets 20 percent, or $60,000; the business manager or accountant takes 5 percent, or $15,000. The lawyer, who negotiated the deal in the first place, might get 5 percent of the entire advance, or $50,000.
After these fees the artist has $175,000.
Of this, about $70,000 would be due in taxes, leaving $105,000 for making it to near the top of the hip-hop game. True, many performers also get money for concert appearances or publishing fees. But in turn, Mr. Padell said, his hip-hop clients often support a network of parents, siblings and friends, and many of them tithe to their churches.
Mr. Padell said that performers who make a 500,000-copy gold album, might end up with more money working for UPS.
Many of these costs apply to musicians working in any genre, but the high costs of producers, the short careers, the pressure to support family members, and the competitive flaunting of wealth weigh heavily on hip-hop acts. As one hip-hop executive explained, a rock band can show up at a music event in a Honda. If a rapper does not have the latest expensive SUV, his or her star appears to be on the wane, which can be career death.

The Industry
Companies Need Hits By Nurture or Merger
The real money in rap is made by media giants like Sony, Bertlesmann and Vivendi Universal. In the mid-1990's the major music companies shifted to a strategy of selling music around the world rather than just at home, and they merged to grow. The largest mergers of the era involved the creation of Vivendi Universal, which acquired what were once Island, Def Jam, Interscope, Geffen, A&M, Polydor, MCA and other labels, and in the process acquired many of the top rap acts. At the same time, AOL Time Warner sold its share in Interscope after shareholder controversy over its rap portfolio.
Vivendi Universal has 9 of the Top 20 rap albums this year, and its stars include Ja Rule, Eminem and Ja Rule's rival, DMX.
Lyor Cohen, chief executive of the company's Island Def Jam Music Group, said he missed the simpler practices of the 1980's. "When I first started working with artists like L. L. Cool J, the barrier to entry was low," Mr. Cohen said. "There were no videos. No radio. But you could walk into a club and get the D.J. to spin your album and sell one million units. Now the barriers to entry are high. You can't do that anymore. And the higher the stakes the harder it is."
Two executives said that even five years ago a rap album by a newcomer could be made for $75,000, while an established star might spend $500,000. They said a comparable new act today would spend $500,000, and the star more than $1 million.
Chris Schwartz, who founded the label Ruff House in the 90's, blamed consolidation for raising costs and dampening creativity.
He said the megacompanies needed huge, safe hits, the equivalent of sequels in the movie business. "They spend enormous amounts of money to make market share," he said. "So now the first year you get a hiccup, it's a big hiccup."
Yet Mr. Cohen said consolidation was good for both his company and for hip-hop. "It shows the economic strength of the music," he said.
In large measure because of hip-hop, the Universal Music Group distributes one in three records sold in the United States. "They've been able to ride over the decline in the global market because of the strength of its rap and hip-hop," said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, the boutique New York brokerage firm.

The Feud
Fights and Jabs Whip Up the Fans
Top rappers and executives, including Jay-Z, Nas, Snoop Doggy Dog, Eminem and Jermaine Dupri, have advanced their careers through battles of insult. Some of the talk is dazzlingly clever, much of it inflammatory, and all of it disseminated and promoted through the record companies.
Much of the beef, or animosity, is purely promotional. "People have nothing else to talk about," said Corey Smyth, who manages Talib Kweli, De La Soul and other hip-hop acts, who have not engaged in this kind of jawboning. "As long as it doesn't turn violent, to me it's a good thing."
Ja Rule's feud with DMX began over timbre: both have gravelly voices, and DMX accused his rival of stealing his style. As it escalated, Ja Rule taunted DMX about drug use; DMX questioned Ja Rule's sexual orientation. Ja Rule ends a rhyme on his forthcoming album, "You're mad at the world or just me, because I'm on top of the world?" He accused DMX of attacking him for the sake of publicity. "He's cold right now and he's trying to get a little heat going by making dis records about me," he said. "But I'm not having that."
DMX promises a song called "Ruled Out."
Feuds create publicity at little or no expense. Nas returned to the charts last summer through a running beef with the more successful Jay-Z. "The rivalry was the spark for one of rap music's most celebrated comebacks," said Elliott Wilson, editor of the hip-hop magazine XXL. Sales of Nas's album "Stillmatic," unspectacular before the feud, jumped to more than 1.6 million copies.
Ja Rule and DMX both record for Island Def Jam labels. Mr. Cohen, the chief executive, said that it is the companies' responsibility to make sure beefs like theirs don't go beyond words. "The moment you see it, you deal with it," he said. "They have a great opportunity to change the socioeconomic course of their families for generations to come, and we remind them of that."
Back in the Crack House, Ja Rule, weary but optimistic, weighed the price of success. "Who's really getting the money?" he asked. "Who's really shedding the blood and who's getting the money? We're the soldiers, we're on the front lines, we're not in the Pentagon or the White House."
He added, "Hopefully, I'll die old and be able to laugh about all this. I'll start putting together my Vegas lounge act now."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: NEW JERSEY; 
Plenty of Verbal Jabs and Punches in Final Senate Debate

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

 BODY:
New Jersey's two main candidates for United States Senate met last night for their only broadcast television debate, and their 60-minute discussion was packed with enough combative exchanges and impromptu jibes to fuel an entire campaign.
 Douglas R. Forrester, the Republican, pounded away at the voting record that Democrat Frank R. Lautenberg compiled as a United States senator from 1983 to 2001, blaming Mr. Lautenberg for higher taxes, an under-funded military and weakened intelligence-gathering services. He also said that Mr. Lautenberg shared responsibility for the fact that New Jersey sends more in taxes to Washington than it receives in federal aid. 
 "We are last, New Jersey is always last," Mr. Forrester said. "I provide a better vision for moving New Jersey out of last place."
But Mr. Lautenberg, who appeared unfocused and ill prepared during portions of a debate with Mr. Forrester on cable television Wednesday night, dominated much of last night's discussion by citing a flurry of statistics from a yellow legal pad and tossing in several offhand remarks at his opponent's expense. Mr. Lautenberg claimed credit for bringing back billions of dollars in federal aid for New Jersey transportation projects and education programs. He also accused Mr. Forrester of favoring a plan to use Social Security funds to give a tax cut to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.
When Mr. Forrester offered himself as an alternative to the "failed policies of the past," Mr. Lautenberg said that Mr. Forrester really sought to help conservatives restrict abortion rights, curtail gun control laws and force taxpayers to pay for cleaning up toxic waste dumps, instead of the companies that created them.
"If we let the polluters off the hook, if we give our tax benefits to the wealthiest among us, if we fail to make sure that we have the kinds of programs to get rid of guns in our society, to get rid of our environmental disaster that we have hanging over us, then we will have not served the public well," he said during his closing statement.
Mr. Lautenberg, who replaced Senator Robert G. Torricelli on the ballot last month and quickly built a steady lead in the polls, tried for weeks to avoid debates altogether, or schedule them so they would be seen by a minimal number of viewers. After Wednesday's cable television debate, Republican Party officials publicly described Mr. Lautenberg's performance as "incoherent." Privately, some Forrester aides suggested that Mr. Lautenberg, 78, might be too old to effectively serve a six-year term.
But at tonight's debate, hosted by Gabe Pressman and broadcast on WNBC-TV, Mr. Lautenberg put Mr. Forrester on the defensive several times. When Mr. Forrester gave a lengthy response, Mr. Lautenberg wryly chided him for delivering a "filibuster" and a "dissertation." 
When Mr. Forrester criticized his record on defense issues, Mr. Lautenberg, a World War II veteran, responded by issuing a challenge.
"Tell me, tell this audience, what you've done in your 49 years on this earth to make our country safer," Mr. Lautenberg asked Mr. Forrester, who has no military experience. "How many times have you prevented a terrorist from attacking us?"
Mr. Forrester replied: "Well I happen to believe, senator, that one of the things I did was get Bob Torricelli out of the Senate. I happen to think that was in our interest."
Before the debate, both candidates spent the day addressing party loyalists at get-out-the-vote rallies. About 500 people attended a rally in Newark where Bill Clinton praised Mr. Lautenberg for helping his administration bring economic prosperity to middle class Americans.
Mr. Forrester's campaign suffered a setback, when President Bush declined a request to campaign in New Jersey this weekend. Campaigning in Perth Amboy yesterday, Mr. Forrester said he was grateful the president campaigned for him in September and was confident that he would nonetheless defeat Mr. Lautenberg.
"We've had such support, including the president, that I could not ask for more," Mr. Forrester said.

Refinance and Earn Miles. But Is the Deal for You?

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
LIKE many other homeowners, Ming-Bong and Susy Lee took advantage of the decline in interest rates and refinanced the mortgage on their three-bedroom home in Belmont, Calif., this year. The Lees, who actually refinanced twice, say they are saving nearly $200 on their monthly payments. But that wasn't the only benefit.
 The couple and their two young sons, Bryan and Brandon, also got a trip to Hawaii. It was among the perks offered to Mr. Lee through his frequent-flier program at United Airlines: for every $10,000 in mortgage money borrowed, he received 1,250 miles. (The Lees declined to disclose the size of their mortgage but said the total amount borrowed for the two refinancings was just about enough for four free round-trip coach tickets to Maui.) 
 Frequent-flier partnerships between airlines and mortgage lenders are not new. United and American Airlines were among the first to have them, in 1996. But more and more lenders, brokers and real estate companies have been teaming up with airlines and travel companies, hoping to cash in on the strong mortgage market. The Mortgage Bankers Association predicted last week that lenders would make a record $2.42 trillion in home loans this year. 
Among the more recent partnerships, Lending Tree entered into agreements this year with United, Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines, US Airways, Six Continents Hotels and American Express. E-Loan, the online broker that the Lees used in February and September, signed a deal with United last year and with Delta Air Lines this year. Delta Corporate Services, no relation to the airline, which provides real estate broker referrals, last year hooked up with Hilton Hotels.
While these partnerships give consumers more opportunities to add points or miles to their reward programs, they may not be the best way to shop for mortgages, experts say. And some states restrict the use of mileage for certain transactions. Most of the lenders involved in such partnerships are among the largest in the country, and "they're not noted for their particularly aggressive pricing," said Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a mortgage research firm in Butler, N.J. 
"Rates at these institutions are not necessarily the lowest, cheapest rates in the business; they are average at best," he said.
For instance, he said, the average rate last week on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at branches of Bank of America, CitiMortgage, Countrywide Home Loans and GMAC, all participants in rewards programs, was 6.27 percent, compared with an average of 6.23 percent charged by 144 nonparticipating lenders surveyed randomly.
Mr. Lee, 38, a manager at a computer software company, said he did shop around initially, but ultimately chose E-Loan in each refinancing. He said he is satisfied with the 6 7/8 percent rate he received on his 30-year jumbo mortgage in his last deal. Could he and Mrs. Lee, 34, a homemaker, have received better terms elsewhere? Perhaps, though they probably wouldn't have gotten the free trip to Hawaii.
Despite the added perks, the mileage deals have yet to take hold in a big way. Randy Petersen, the publisher of InsideFlyer, a magazine specializing in travel loyalty programs, estimates that only 51,000 frequent fliers, out of a total of 20 million active program members, have participated in mortgage deals.
"People's habit typically is to read their local newspaper about refinancing, and to refinance with someone they know locally," he said. "And the programs haven't been around in a refinancing boom like this; this is something relatively new."
Mr. Petersen said that the vast majority of the mortgage program participants struck their deals in the last 18 months, a time of generally declining interest rates.
Many airlines and travel companies have included some information about the programs in mailings to members. But that may not be enough.
"I'm in the dark about the programs," said Hugh F. Kelly, a real estate consultant from Brooklyn who is a member of the loyalty programs at Delta, American and Hilton. "Once you know about them, you have to go through multiple levels of clicking on their Web sites to get to them, and you also have to know exactly what you're looking for. The programs are hobbled by their presentation."
Joe Kennedy, the president of E-Loan, said Mr. Kelly's complaints were valid. "Even though these offers are very attractive, most frequent-flier program statements are loaded with offers, and they're lost in the blur."
For example, the frequent-flier program of American Airlines alone has partnerships with more than 125 companies in a wide range of industries, in addition to its arrangements with Countrywide Home Loans and Cendant Mobility Real Estate Services.
ONE of the largest programs is run by Lending Tree, which acts as an exchange for 189 lenders and 650 real estate brokerage companies. The company and its five airline partners offer miles for both loans (mortgages, refinancing and home equity) and real estate transactions -- the actual buying and selling of the home. Frequent fliers get 1,250 miles for every $10,000 of a loan; in addition, if they buy or sell through Lending Tree, they get 3,000 miles for every $10,000 of its price.
Lending Tree also has different bonus programs for participants in the Six Continents travel loyalty program, which is for guests of Holiday Inn, InterContinental and Crowne Plaza hotels, and for participants in American Express Membership Rewards, who receive points only for buying and selling homes.
Mortgage partners with programs similar to Lending Tree's include E-Loan, Bank of America, Countrywide, GMAC Mortgage and U.S. Bank Home Mortgage. In addition to its program for real estate transactions, American Express has arrangements through Membership Rewards and its banking unit with PHH Mortgage Services. Diners Club works with CitiMortgage, allowing members to redeem points to cover the closing costs of a mortgage and receive other mortgage-related discounts. Diners Club and CitiMortgage are both part of Citigroup. 
Real estate companies with travel deals include GMAC Real Estate, Cendant, PMP Relocation Services and Delta Corporate Services.
TO find out if their travel loyalty programs participate in such deals, consumers can check their Web sites; they usually list all the participating partners, including real estate and mortgage companies. The deals can be arranged online or offline, depending on the company.
But there are some caveats. First, the offers are sometimes limited. GMAC Real Estate, for example, caps its bonuses at 125,000 miles, while home-equity offers through GMAC Mortgage are not available in certain states. Members of the American Airlines frequent-flier program who decide to buy a home through Cendant are restricted to brokers in its real estate network, most of whom are affiliated with Coldwell Banker, Century 21 and ERA, all Cendant brands. In addition, the laws of some states -- including New Jersey, Kansas, Kentucky, Nevada and Oregon -- prohibit deals that feature miles for the actual purchase or sale of homes, though they are allowed for mortgage deals.
Then there's the matter of redeeming mileage awards for free airline tickets or other rewards. Airlines sometimes impose blackout dates and other restrictions, particularly to popular destinations like Florida.
Greg Cassity, 37, an information technology consultant and member of Delta's frequent-flier program, says that is one of his concerns. He recently received nearly 250,000 bonus miles for selling one house and buying another in suburban Atlanta through Lending Tree.
Mr. Cassity said he wants to redeem the miles for two Delta tickets to Ireland for himself and his wife, Sheryl, 41, a finance manager at Coca-Cola. He also hopes to get free airline tickets for other family members. But he said he has had problems in the past with blackout dates and seat availability when he has tried to redeem miles on short notice. "My only reservation going forward is on the Delta side -- how much trouble I will have booking flights using SkyMiles," he said. 
Mr. Petersen of InsideFlyer said mileage redemption has not been a problem for most travelers this year. "Airlines have not cut back the number of free awards," he said. "More frequent fliers are using awards in a fragile economy." 
Ultimately, said Douglas G. Duncan, the chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, people considering a loan through a travel loyalty program should thoroughly research and shop for the best rates -- and analyze their personal needs.
"If the consumer is the kind of person who never travels anywhere, this is not the right product," he said. But for those who like to travel, "it might well make sense."
"If all is equal, and one lender as a last effort throws in the frequent-flier miles," he said, "that may well tip the balance to that lender offering the best deal."

HEADLINE: A Surplus of Ideas for a Budget Deficit 

 BODY:
The magnitude of the fiscal crisis facing New York City is difficult to overstate: With a total city budget of some $42 billion, $24 billion of which comes from city revenues, the city faces a deficit of between $5 billion and $6 billion for the year beginning July 1. The Op-Ed page asked several analysts for suggestions on how the city might bridge the gap.

By Diana Fortuna
Diana Fortuna is president of the Citizens Budget Commission.
 In the face of an unprecedented budget gap, New Yorkers deserve more creative options than a choice between higher taxes and reduced services. The best alternative is to deliver municipal services more efficiently. 
 First, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg should abandon notoriously inefficient work practices that have persisted through good times and bad. The city can save $200 million annually, for example, by modernizing procurement procedures, essentially replacing paper purchase orders with online transactions. Savings are also possible in more visible public services. In the Police and Fire Departments, overtime is routinely budgeted for predictable tasks that could be staffed more cheaply. Also, uniformed workers fill thousands of jobs that could be performed more efficiently by civilians. The city could make many of these changes without reopening union contracts.
The city should also bring municipal workers' fringe benefits into line with standard public and private practice. The city pays 100 percent of the cost of comprehensive health insurance for its workers, retirees and their families. Most companies and other governments (including the federal and New York State governments) require some contribution toward premiums. If the city required premium contributions, it could save more than $500 million annually.
Of course, this change could only be made through collective bargaining with the city's unions. But now is the time to act -- not just because the city faces such a dire fiscal crisis but also because all the city's contracts with its unions (except for the teachers' union) are up for renewal.
New York is already one of the nation's most expensive local governments. Before the mayor and City Council raise taxes or reduce services, they need to explain what steps they are taking to make government more efficient.

By Ronnie Lowenstein
Ronnie Lowenstein is director of the New York City Independent Budget Office.
Since neither the state nor federal government seems ready to ride to the city's fiscal rescue, a combination of spending cuts and tax increases is likely. While spending cuts can be harmful, raising taxes in a high-tax city like New York can also have negative repercussions.
At least two principles should guide our consideration of potential tax increases: fairness and long-term competitiveness. The tax increase that comes closest to meeting both these criteria is restoration of the commuter tax, which would bring in more than $400 million a year. A commuter tax reduces the incentive for individuals who work in the city to reside in the suburbs, and it is also equitable, both because commuters have higher average incomes than city residents do and because it seems fair to have individuals who work here and use local services bear some of the costs.
Increasing the city's tax on personal income is another option. Either increasing the base rate for high-income filers from 3.2 percent to 4.2 percent or adding a 10 percent surcharge for all filers would each raise about $550 million annually. The advantage to raising income taxes is that the increases fall most heavily on high-income residents, who are best able to pay. At the same time, however, many of New York's highest income residents are particularly mobile, and could continue to work in the city but avoid city personal income taxes by residing elsewhere.
The city could also consider raising the property tax rate by 10 percent while loosening limits on property tax assessment increases that have pushed a disproportionate share of the burden onto owners of apartment and office buildings. The rate hike would increase tax revenues by roughly $1 billion a year, and loosening the assessment limits would over time make the property tax more fair. The city also needs to examine the structure of its business income taxes, which have not kept pace with long-term growth in corporate profits.
There is certainly no question that taxes matter. But so do services. Dirtier streets, rising crime and dilapidated parks can be as much a disincentive to living or working here as rising taxes. Higher taxes may be necessary to keep an adequate level of services. Carefully choosing among possible tax increases can minimize the damage to the city's economy.

By Abe Lackman
Abe Lackman, who served as city budget director in 1994, is president of the Albany-based Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities.
The severity of the budget crisis facing the city and state can best be compared not with the city's near bankruptcy of the mid-1970's, but with the situation during the Depression. In times such as this, many will instinctively seek answers to the usual questions: How much will spending have to be cut? Which taxes will have to be raised? Instead, a better way to set sensible policy for the long run is to ask which services and priorities should be protected or possibly even enhanced.
The future of New York City depends on maintaining the city's capacity to survive -- and thrive -- in national and world markets. Two priorities are essential: To preserve the city's physical infrastructure and to build on its intellectual infrastructure.
New York City must ensure that its roads, bridges and transportation systems are in good repair. Deferrals in bridge and road maintenance would be unwise, for example. We also need to move forward with an integrated transportation hub in lower Manhattan, the key to redevelopment of the region. At the same time, New York must protect its human capital in its many colleges and universities, independent laboratories, research hospitals, libraries and museums.
In biotechnology particularly, New York possesses a regional advantage. Consider that the city is home to more than 100 members of the National Academy of Sciences and eight private research universities and institutions in the city are among the top 100 recipients of funding from the National Institutes of Health.
Before city policy makers become mired in a frenzy of budget cuts and tax or fare increases, they should first decide how best to identify -- and build on -- our strengths.

HEADLINE: A New Cryptography Uses Photon Streams 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
The quirky world of quantum physics, where mathematical elements can hold multiple values and objects can be in several places at once, is heading toward commercial products.
 A start-up company, MagiQ Technologies, plans to announce today a cryptogaphy -- or code -- system that uses a technology called quantum key distribution to thwart eavesdropping on a fiber optic communication channel. The company, based in New York, says it has a working model of its system and will have a commercial version available in the second half of next year. 
 With the system, keys to the code are transmitted as a stream of photons, sent over a fiber optic cable. Because of the properties of quantum physics, the mere act of observing the transmission would alter the photons, rendering their information useless to any eavesdroppers.
A limit of the system is that it would not work on the Internet, only over dedicated fiber cables in which the photon transmission can be carefully controlled. But outside researchers say that quantum cryptography does make possible electronic conversations that would be immune to eavesdropping.
"MagiQ seems to be ahead of the research community in terms of making this affordable and practical," said Dr. Burton S. Kaliski Jr., the chief scientist of RSA Laboratories, one of the leading developers of conventional cryptographic systems.
Research in quantum cryptography goes back into the 1980's. But MagiQ (pronounced as magic) and a Swiss competitor, ID Quantique, are the first to attempt to develop commercial systems based on the technology. ID Quantique's system has not yet reached the market.
MagiQ was founded in 1999 by Robert Gelfond, a former securities trading executive for D. E. Shaw & Company who was also a first-round investor in Amazon.
The company has raised $6.9 million from investors who include Amazon's founder, Jeff Bezos; Walter Riley, the chairman of Guaranteed Overnight Delivery; and Neal Goldman, the president of Goldman Capital Management.
Industry analysts say that military applications would probably be the primary use for quantum cryptography. "The Defense Department is going to care, and that's big money for a small start-up to survive on," said Laura Koetzle, a computer security analyst at Forrester Research.
MagiQ also plans to explore other commercial applications from quantum physics, including quantum computing. Some scientists predict that computers based on quantum principle are possible and will be able to perform specialized tasks far more quickly than computers can.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Turning Photons Into Computer Code"A photon the quantum unit of light can be oriented in one of four possible positions. These positions, called the photon's polarization, can be used to convey information, much like a string of 1's and 0's in computer code. HOW IT WORKS The polarizations can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal. Two of the polarizations are designated as 1's and the others as 0's. Photon detectors try to read photons either in a horizontal or vertical polarization or in a diagonal polarization. If the detectors choose the right orientation, they are able to read the number.

What Trumps a Desk at Yale? A Seat in Parliament

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Last winter, Jun Saito, a Yale University teaching assistant in political science, was in New Haven surfing Web sites when an item from home caught his eye. Japan's main opposition party was looking for a sacrificial lamb to run for Parliament in a district known as a ruling party "kingdom."
 Fast forward to last week: Mr. Saito, 33, was moving into a new office in Parliament, was getting used to snappy salutes from parliamentary guards, and was composing e-mails to his academic advisers, gingerly explaining that his doctoral thesis might be late. 
 He had the ultimate student excuse for a late paper: he has been sworn into the Parliament of Japan, the second most powerful economy in the world. 
"I am taking a leave of absence," he said, looking a mite guilty over this opportunity for first-hand political research, as he gave an interview in his new office. "Getting a Ph.D. is almost impossible if I stay in this line of work."
Mr. Saito was swept into office Oct. 27 in a special election marked by both apathy about politics and a small turn of the generational wheel. On one hand, record low turnouts marked the seven races, six of which were won by members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party or their allies. In Mr. Saito's Yamagata Prefecture, a mountainous northern district known for its skiing, only 43 percent of voters turned out, down from 72 in the last vote, in June 2000.
At the same time, four of the new members are in their 30's, contrasting with the Parliament's image as a cautious club of grandfathers. Even with this new blood, the governing party, which controls almost half of the 727 seats, has as many members over age 70 as under age 45.
"In Japanese politics, to be in your 60's is to be a young boy," said Kotaru Tamura, 39, who was elected as an independent supported by the governing party, noting that he succeeds a man who died in office at age 84. "We are the babies."
Although both men represent rural, rice farming districts, they exemplify an increasingly cosmopolitan aspect of Parliament. Both speak fluent English, honed while they earned master's degrees in the United States. Mr. Tamura's was, coincidentally, also from Yale, in business.
"The voters know I am international," Mr. Tamura said in his equally bare bones office. "They don't care about Yale, U.C.L.A. or University of Nebraska. They just know that I studied in the U.S."
During the fall campaigns, the new congressmen said, voters were primarily worried about the economy, complaining about lack of new investment and of factories moving to China.
"They see me as a human bridge between their world and the outside world," said Mr. Saito, stressing that on the campaign trail he largely spoke to voters in the local dialect. His Web site resume mentions that he studied in the United States, but it also stresses his farm boy roots: attending primary school in a wooden schoolhouse, and "riding next to my father on the combine harvester after school."
"I was raised up seeing the backs of my family members working," he continued. 
These younger, more traveled members could help break the political paralysis that has left Japan settling for muddle-through policies ever since the economic bubble burst in 1989, according to "Can Japan Come Back?" a report issued here on Friday by the Pacific Council on International Policy.
"A gradual infusion of new faces bodes an eventual change in Japan's political culture," reads the report by the Los Angeles-based research organization.
The recent election also indicates widespread political alienation. Four of the seven seats up for election, including Mr. Saito's, were vacated by ruling party members forced to resign because of corruption charges. The Liberal Democratic Party, in power almost continuously since 1955, had the support of only 35 percent of 1,886 voters interviewed in late October for the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun. 
"If I were a graduate student in political science and looking for a theme, I would compare the PRI in Mexico," the long-governing party there, "with the L.D.P. in Japan," Pete Wilson, the former governor of California, said here Friday, presenting the Pacific Council report. "Both have had long political monopolies."
The scope of Mr. Saito's graduate thesis is narrower -- focusing on Japanese electoral politics. But his advisers in New Haven barely conceal their feeling that he jumped the gun, winning office before getting the degree.
"I guess winning the election is prima facie evidence that he is doing something right," said Tasos Kalandrakis, an assistant political science professor who is on Mr. Saito's dissertation committee. "It may be true that academics are not always able to cope in the real world, but Jun strikes me as someone who can."
Frances Rosenbluth, his thesis adviser, confessed: "I have to admit I was disappointed when I first learned of Jun's decision to run for office.
"He was my pride and joy," she added. "I was a little disappointed that he would not be the next star in Japanese political science."
Reminded of these sentiments, Mr. Saito again looked a little sheepish. But then he brightened, remembering that he expects to campaign within two years against Koichi Kato, the governing party congressman who resigned last April over corruption allegations.
"Kato got his master's degree from Harvard, and I got mine from Yale," he said. Couching a race for a parliamentary seat in rural Japan in terms of a rivalry usually played on football fields in New England, he added: "So I will be trying to defeat an evil Harvard graduate."

HEADLINE: Earning More, But Struggling To Own a Home 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: MEDFORD, Mass. 

 BODY:
Blake A. Newman is trying to avoid falling back two generations on the housing ladder.
 His grandparents, immigrants from eastern Europe, lived in a rented apartment in the Bronx. His parents owned their own home in Queens, thanks partly to his father's second job as a concessions salesman at the old Madison Square Garden. 
 But still stuck on the first rung, Mr. Newman, a 37-year-old renter, spends part of every day reading up-to-the-minute real estate listings delivered by e-mail in hopes that he, his wife and their two children can find a decent house they can afford on his salary as a musician and teacher and hers as a nurse. 
Around Boston, and in many other big metropolitan areas, rapidly rising home prices have overwhelmed the recent decline in interest rates and made the purchase of a first home more difficult than it has been in years for large numbers of younger adults. Like Mr. Newman, some find themselves living an odd inversion of the American dream, earning considerably more money than their parents did, but still struggling to own a home.
In many places, people who did not join the ranks of homeowners in the last decade face greatly diminished financial prospects, having missed out on a home-price boom that added tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars to other families' wealth, economists say. Making matters worse, many renters invested in the stock market in recent years, to build up savings for a down payment or children's future college expenses, only to lose money or earn a meager return on their investment, while the homes they want to buy were soaring in value.
"It just feels like people like us, who've been renting for a long time and want to get started in their own house, can't," Mr. Newman said. "Prices have just gone crazy."
The house-price boom -- concentrated in the Northeast and California -- is also creating significant new social divisions in the metropolitan areas affected, separating younger families from older ones and making some towns less diverse. In Milton, Mass., for example, a grade-school teacher recently wrote to the town planning board asking it to create affordable housing, so she could move from her home 40 minutes away and more often attend Little League games and concerts where she teaches.
"People who haven't been in on the game find that the opportunity to own is a moving target that's moving further away from them," said Karl E. Case, an economist at Wellesley College and a co-founder of a real-estate research company that is now called Fiserv CSW. "It's creating inequality. It's creating more stratified communities."
Around Boston, where house prices have doubled in the last five years, a family making the local median income of $61,000 can afford the monthly payments on a house worth only half the median price of $395,000. This is true even though the annual interest rate on a typical mortgage fell to a four-decade low last month, before inching back above 6 percent. In the mid-1990's, a median income allowed the purchase of nearly a median-priced house, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
For families who own homes, of course, the surge in house prices and fall in mortgage rates have often brought a windfall, in the form of refinanced loans and lower monthly payments. Many consumers have spent the extra money on new cars and other products, preventing last year's recession from being worse than it was, economists say.
But homeowners will ultimately be affected as well by the growing number of people priced out of hot housing areas. With fewer potential buyers entering the market at the bottom, the sharp run-up in home values may be nearing an end, not only here in Boston but also in New York, Denver, Minneapolis, nearly every large city in California, and other places where prices have greatly outstripped incomes.
Already, the national home ownership rate, after rising steadily since 1994, has leveled off and fallen slightly over the last year when it reached a record high 68.1 percent. Here in the Boston region, only about 59 percent of families own their homes, and the proportion has dropped a little during the last five years of rapid price gains.
To be sure, prices of the most expensive homes in and around Boston, New York and a few other big cities have lately begun to slip, brokers say. But they add that most house prices continue to rise in spite of the lingering economic slowdown.
Even if the home market softens soon, most renters here will not be able to afford houses that they could have bought five years ago with less savings than they have today.
"I wish I had bought long, long, long ago," said Kelly P. Diamond, an administrator at a Boston-area university who rents a one-bedroom apartment in the city's North End, a neighborhood she said she would have to leave when she does buy an apartment. "I try not to dwell on it, but when I think about it, it's definitely upsetting."
The rapid price increases have been caused by the low mortgage rates, immigration, the aging of the population, and a widespread feeling that real estate is the new can't-miss investment, among other factors. The boom has been strongest in California and the Northeast, where land is often scarce and cities are seen to be much healthier than they were in previous decades.
Throughout much of the rest of the country, particularly in the South and Midwest, the decline in mortgage rates has kept first homes as affordable as they were in past years. In Chicago, Las Vegas and Richmond, Va., for example, prices have increased only moderately faster than incomes since the mid-1990's, according to Economy.com. In the Dallas region, home prices and incomes have grown at roughly the same rate, making the typical home effectively less expensive today than it was seven or eight years ago, once mortgage rates are taken into account. In a few places, including Rochester and Pittsburgh, incomes have actually increased more rapidly than house prices.
But in California, the Northeast and other hot housing cities like Denver, renters say they feel some of the same pangs of regret that were common among investors who missed out on the run-up in stock prices during the late 1990's. Moreover, the consequences of missing the real-estate boom seem harsher, since some people have moved out of neighborhoods they like and instead begun commuting from faraway suburbs, like New Hampshire towns that are an hour's drive from Boston.
People who already own homes, by contrast, are able to use their earlier investment to maintain their standard of living if they move. Once on the home ownership ladder, many people use their homes to improve their position. Some of Ms. Diamond's friends who did buy apartments years ago have taken profits from selling them to buy much bigger units or to move into townhouses. To save for a down payment, Ms. Diamond, who is in her mid-30's, has been cutting back on her travel and has decided not to buy a new car. Still, she expects to be forced to move away from downtown, where she likes walking.
In the 12 months ended Sept. 1, only 28 two-bedroom apartments sold for less than $300,000 in the main residential neighborhoods near Boston's center, while 85 sold for more than $1 million, according to Link, a company that tracks listings. Three years earlier, 265 apartments sold for less than $300,000 and 14 sold for more than $1 million. The situation is similar in the nearest suburbs.
"Prices have gone through the ceiling in Somerville; Cambridge is almost unbelievable," said Michael Albano, vice president at the Boston Real Estate Group, a brokerage. "Brookline, forget about it."
Here in Medford, a middle-class suburb just north of Boston, Mr. Newman and his wife nearly bought a two-family house for $260,000 in 1999. They backed off because the rental unit needed renovations, and they would not have had enough money left over to make them. Mr. Newman, regretting their decision, figures the house now sells for almost $400,000.
The price increases have also become a political issue, with dozens of communities voting over the last year on whether to raise taxes and create affordable housing with some of the money. The measure was voted down in Boston, but around the state has passed in about the same number of places as it has failed.
Meanwhile, Citizens Bank, which has many branches here, has begun subsidizing the home purchases of its workers who make less than $100,000 and are buying a house. The employees receive a zero-interest loan of up to $8,000, which the bank forgives over five years.
The biggest price increases have probably ended around Boston, brokers say. Houses are staying on the market longer, and some sellers of expensive homes have reduced their asking prices in recent months.
The market "is a little bit less robust," said Steven Cohen, a senior broker in Gibson Domain/Domain in Boston's South End. "Still, there's a sense of a long-term boom that has not ended."
Indeed, many renters remain eager to become buyers, convinced of the long-term financial and personal benefits of owning a home.
Classes for aspiring homeowners offered by the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance are more popular than ever, said Thomas Callahan, the group's executive director, but fewer of the course's graduates are buying homes afterward. Last year, 200 families bought homes through one state-subsidized mortgage program, down from about 400 a few years ago.
"I feel ready to lunge at any home in my price range, if I can find one in my price range," said Acia Heath, a graduate of a home-buying class who lives in Dorchester, a Boston neighborhood. Together, she and her husband make about $70,000, and they are looking for a two-family house that costs no more than $280,000. 
The most frustrating part of the search, many young renters say, is their feeling that the purchase of a home around many major cities has become more difficult despite the decline in interest rates.
"It's hard to see how I might end up as my parents did, in a nice little starter home when I'm ready to have kids," said Jennifer K. Lanigan, 27, the teacher in Milton who recently wrote to the planning board. "When you look at how incomes have changed and how home prices have changed, it doesn't line up. It's very disheartening."

HEADLINE: Going for Olympic Gold 

 BODY:
The march toward winning the bid for the 2012 Olympic Games has gone something like a Busby Berkeley musical, with a "let's put on a show" kind of enthusiasm from New York boosters. But now that the United States Olympic Committee has selected New York over San Francisco as the American entry in the competition for the 2012 Summer Games, planners will need to get serious. Public debate about their ideas must begin well before the point of no return in 2005, when the International Olympic Committee chooses one host city from a tough list of competitors. 
 The New York proposal won the domestic contest in large part because it is grand, inventive and appealing, promising accommodations that are world class for athletes and spectators. Once those people are gone, the city would benefit from the new buildings, sports facilities and mass-transit service left behind. Some of the plans are for projects the city has needed for a long time -- the deadline pressure of the Games could force New York to do things that it should have been doing anyway. But there are other areas where the bid bears closer examination. 
 Central to the proposal is the future of the far West Side of Midtown Manhattan, over and around the Hudson rail yards. The area, which has only 130 legal residences, represents the final frontier for development in Manhattan. As Deputy Mayor Daniel Doctoroff, the longtime Olympic booster, likes to point out, the Games can provide the catalyst to put the space to income-generating use. Even if New York does not ultimately win the bid, City Hall wants to proceed with the development.
All this makes sense, particularly extension of the No. 7 subway line to an area that desperately needs subway service to encourage growth, and an expansion of the Javits Center. We're less convinced about building a stadium to seat 86,000 people on a platform above the rail yards. The total price tag of at least $3 billion, which would also underwrite hotels and a park, is supposed to be largely covered by bonds, which would later be paid off by future tax revenues from the newly developed area. That part of the scheme may pose risks if businesses fail to move in as planners anticipate.
Now that the Olympic plans will have the public's attention, City Hall must explain how that risk would be minimized. And it needs to bolster its argument for a stadium in an urban area peppered with arenas. Large stadiums tend to deaden, not enliven, surrounding neighborhoods. Even if the New York Jets pay for the facility -- something not set in concrete -- financing the $500 million platform and roof would fall to the city. While less glamorous, a refurbished Shea Stadium could be used for the Olympics. It is an option that bears exploring.

Walking the Course Is a Salute to City Life

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

 BODY:
FLASHBACKS often occur at the strangest moments. 
 At 5 p.m. yesterday I'd just completed walking my first New York City Marathon. I'd jogged most of the last mile and was outside Central Park with many other finishers, silhouettes in silver capes walking silently in the dark to various destinations. Stunned, weary, exhausted. 
 Suddenly I had a flashback to the morning of Sept 11, 2001. I was near the World Trade Center with hundreds of others who had watched in horror as the towers fell. There was the same sort of stunned silence as we walked silently to our various destinations. No hysteria. We were numbed by the magnitude of the pain, suffering and devastation.
But last night was a happy moment. The completion of a marathon was an exhilarating accomplishment for many, the culmination of hard training to complete the 26.2-mile course in one of the world's great events.
On the other hand, I waited until last Thursday to consider walking the course. You can cover the marathon just so many times from so many angles before the only thing left is actually doing it: feeling the energy first-hand, feeling the pain and soreness of joints, muscles and tendons that haven't been tested like this for years. 
Running was out of the question; walking seemed doable. What better tribute to New York than to do what New Yorkers do: walk. We walk from one side of Manhattan to the other; we jump out of cabs stuck in wretched traffic jams and walk. We walk up flights of subway steps.
Beyond that, I was reared on walking. My mother and I used to take long walks from our house to the Y.M.C.A. She would make up stories and spin one line after another to pass the time, and time flew by. In the final years of her life, walking was my mother's therapy, her respite, her meditation.
Next year marks the 40th anniversary of my mother's death. Her therapy is now my therapy.
Part of the reason I decided to walk the course, in a roundabout way, was Sept. 11 and the marathon healing process so many of us are undergoing. We've been in this marathon mode since our lives were turned inside out by the attacks on symbols of our wealth, our sense of freedom, our security. We are still coming to grips with what has happened to us, how we've changed and how the city has changed.
So my thinking was this: If New York won the United States bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics, I would complete the course. No training, no preparation. I would walk this marathon on the strength of passion.
I walked the course with three guides from the Achilles' Track Club: Naomi Holland, Tessie Tiaba and Gloria Sandiford. They accompanied Jose Montanez, a legally blind runner. We started at 8:59 yesterday morning.
By the time we reached Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Tiaba and Holland were in a groove, jogging fast with Montanez. That left Sandiford and me to complete the course on our own. She had broken her foot in a cycling accident in July; the cast came off in September and this was her first marathon test.
What you can see but can't fully sense from photo trucks and media cars is the passion of spectators and the real agony of some of the runners. A moment on the Queensboro Bridge that crystallized what this race was about.
We heard the hum and rumble of cars on the upper deck, but on the lower level, in shaded darkness, runners bunched together in silence: breathing heavily, intensely focused. The only sound was made by rubber soles on the concrete roadway. One runner stumbled and fell, another fell over him, and everyone else sidestepped them and kept going.
We exited the bridge and made the turn onto First Avenue to wild cheering. While we had more than 10 miles to go, we sensed that we were home. Free.
What you understand when you participate in the New York City Marathon, when you go through boroughs with thousands of spectators cheering in their own manner, is that the people give New York the energy it is so well known for.
Will the Olympic Games make the city better?
The International Olympic Committee will not make the final selection for the 2012 Games until 2005. That gives New Yorkers three years to resolve the heated fight that has already begun. There is strong opposition, and I'll join in if it looks as if these Games will become just another tea party for the wealthy and elite with little economic, ethnic and racial diversity.
Are we willing to use tax dollars to build stadiums when the city has so many other pressing needs? Will any of the facilities constructed be used to house the city's mounting homeless? 
The upside of New York being host to the Olympics will eventually outweigh the downside. But the politicians and the well-heeled organizers have to make a case to the people that the Games will improve the quality of life for New Yorkers.
This city needs the 2012 Games to bring its healing process full circle. The New York Games, like a well-run marathon, will be worth the effort.

HEADLINE: In the Excitement of an Olympic Bid, a $1 Billion Stadium 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

DATELINE: COLORADO SPRINGS, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
The latest proposal for an Olympic stadium, a striking glass and steel structure that would sweep down to the edge of the Hudson River, was unveiled Saturday before New York won its bid to be the United States nominee to serve as host city for the 2012 Summer Games.
 The billion-dollar stadium complex, to be built above the West Side rail yards in Manhattan, was described to the United States Olympic Committee here by Daniel L. Doctoroff, founder of New York's bid committee, as the most environmentally advanced in the world. It is also the single most controversial element of the New York City bid's $5 billion proposal for new parks, sports complexes, subways and housing. 
 "The big question mark is the Olympic stadium," said Richard T. Anderson, the president of the New York Building Congress, a trade group that supports the Olympic bid. "The good news is that we can build anything. The real question is political: Is there the political will and public consensus to do it?" 
The stadium is opposed by neighborhood groups and the local community board and will almost certainly need an extensive environmental review. Mr. Doctoroff said the 86,000-seat stadium would be paid for largely by the Jets and the National Football League (it would become the Jets' home after the Summer Games end). But under the proposal, taxpayers would pay $500 million or more for a retractable roof and a platform to build the stadium over the rail yards, between 30th and 34th Streets and 11th and 12th Avenues.
"The New York Jets' own study predicts 10,000 more cars in gridlocked Manhattan," said John Fisher, president of the Clinton Special District Coalition, which opposes the plan. "A stadium in Queens would likely cost about one-third as much as one in Manhattan and it would be closer to the team's fan base. Just when Lower Manhattan needs help and the city is scrambling to pay for its firefighters, Mayor Bloomberg and Doctoroff are pushing this boondoggle just for a little glory."
The city's bid committee, NYC2012, does have a backup plan to put the stadium in Flushing, Queens, but Mr. Doctoroff, who is the city's deputy mayor for economic development, dismissed many of the criticisms. He said the stadium would enliven what many people see as a largely barren neighborhood and raise the possibility that the Super Bowl might be held in New York City. The stadium itself, he said, would normally be used for 10 football games a year, on Sundays, when traffic congestion is at its lowest.
The proposal unveiled in Colorado Springs is actually the latest commissioned by L. Jay Cross, president of the Jets, who was part of the New York delegation to the United States Olympic Committee's national meeting this weekend. Mr. Cross has been quietly showing the designs to state and city officials since the spring, and more recently to real estate developers and others. But in deference to the politically charged nature of the proposal, state officials had urged him not to show it publicly until after Election Day on Tuesday.
On Saturday, Mr. Cross declined to discuss details of the stadium.
The original proposal described a venue that would be used for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games, as well as for track and field events. The stadium would then serve as both a home for the Jets, which now share a stadium in the New Jersey Meadowlands with the Giants, and as an expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, just to the north of the rail yards.
But the chairman of the Javits Center, Robert E. Boyle, said he would not consider the stadium a substitute for what he contends is a badly needed expansion of the convention hall. He favored extending the Javits north to 42nd Street, rather than south to the stadium.
So Mr. Cross went back to the drawing board. He largely abandoned the notion that the stadium would become an addition to the Javits Center, although the latest plan does show an underground connection to the center, which would allow the stadium to be used occasionally for events like boat shows.
Mr. Cross also came up with a new look for the stadium, with a nearly transparent exoskeleton of glass and steel and wind turbines and solar panels to provide power. According to people who have seen the plans, the basic stadium (without the platform it would be built on) would cost about $800 million. The Jets and the N.F.L. have told city officials that they would put up more than $400 million toward the cost; they presumably would borrow the rest.
But Mr. Cross's most elaborate plans call for the building to be used, at separate times, as both a 75,000-seat football stadium and a new Madison Square Garden, which could seat 23,000 for basketball and hockey. He has had promising talks with Cablevision, which owns Madison Square Garden, according to several people familiar with the talks.
Cablevision, however, has told city and state officials that it thinks the property tax exemption that Madison Square Garden received in 1985 would remain in place if it moved to the rail yards. Under that exemption, the city has foregone more than $100 million in taxes, even though the Knicks and the Rangers are among the most valuable franchises in their respective sports.
Many residents of the area around the convention center say they are resigned to its expansion, but remain opposed to a stadium, Olympic or otherwise.
"We are not against the Olympics," said Simone Sindin, chairwoman of Community Board 4, "but we are against the siting of the stadium in Manhattan."

HEADLINE: Tupper Lake Journal; 
Closing Leaves a Hole in a Town's Retail Heart

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO 

DATELINE: TUPPER LAKE, N.Y., Oct. 30 

 BODY:
When a Bradlees or a Caldor store closes in the retail-rich New York suburbs, people shrug their shoulders and drive another six minutes to the nearest Kmart or Target.
 But when the automatic doors of the Ames Department Store slid shut here for the final time in October, residents of this depressed Adirondack village suddenly had no place to buy underwear. And what would register as an inconvenience downstate has become a calamity for this thinly populated region, where the piney woods are already dusted with snow. "It's like a death in the family," said Edith La Londe, 67. "It's horrible. I can't imagine how we're going to survive without it." 
 For Tupper Lake, population 3,935, and surrounding towns and hamlets, Ames was it: the place (sometimes the only place) to buy toys, brooms, blankets, sunglasses, jewelry, blue jeans, curtains, yarn, CD's, Christmas lights. The list goes on.
The closest department store was a half-hour away in Saranac Lake, but that was an Ames, too, and it also closed this month. Now residents find themselves having to drive the hour and 20 minutes to Plattsburgh, where there is a Wal-Mart, for many basic needs. "We were in Plattsburgh last weekend, and the number of people there from Tupper Lake was unbelievable," said Sandra A. Strader, the Tupper Lake mayor. "The big thing was, 'I'm buying underwear.' "
The closings were part of the discount chain's recent bankruptcy and liquidation of 327 stores in the Northeast and the mid-Atlantic states. A dozen stores were scattered across the Adirondacks, a six-million-acre state park, and the state's North Country -- two regions where residents had few shopping options even before Ames closed.
But Tupper Lake appears to be taking the loss the hardest. Ames was a major employer in the village, and the town's economy was already shaky, with the recent demise of the A.&P. supermarket and Big Tupper Ski Area.
Saranac Lake and Lake Placid (or, as locals joke, "Lake Plastic," as in credit cards) have stores, true. But they tend to be boutiques catering to tourists, selling moose-shaped candelabras and pine-scented sachets.
"It's an hour and a half in any direction to another department store," said Jane Denis, from nearby Piercefield. "The saddest part is we'd like to do our business in Tupper Lake."
Judy Reandeau's week illustrates the void. On Tuesday, she drove to Plattsburgh to buy plastic sheeting for her windows, now that temperatures at night are in the teens. On Wednesday, she tried to find oil for her sewing machine at the Family Dollar store here, without success. "Ames would have had that," she said, "and the plastic for my windows, too. They had some of everything. I'm driving to Plattsburgh once a week now."
While Saranac Lake may be more prosperous than Tupper Lake -- and a half-hour closer to Plattsburgh -- it, too, is anxious about the shutdown of Ames. Rose Nadon, 76, does not know where to find materials for her needlepoint. She could go to Plattsburgh, but she does not own a car.
Jennie Frenette, a high school music teacher and mother of three, said Saranac Lake was blessed with an arty toy store. But, she wondered: "Where do you find a Barbie doll in town? I don't know."
State officials say they are aware of the hardship wrought by Ames's closing and are working to find a replacement. "We're confident that a new opportunity for other businesses to step in will materialize, and we will work with local officials to make that happen," said Michael Marr, a spokesman for the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's economic development agency.
Grant Sanborn, executive vice president of operations of Ames Department Stores, which is based in Connecticut, said no retailers had inquired about moving into the Ames stores in Tupper Lake or Saranac Lake, although some developers had "expressed interest."
Mrs. Strader, the mayor, said she had reached out to Wal-Mart to try to interest the company in the 30,000-square-foot Ames site. "They told me they're coming, but they haven't given us a time," she said. "We're keeping our fingers crossed that something will come in."
The Ames store is technically still here, as the company, founded in 1958, tries to liquidate the assets.
This week it was quiet. The store manager, Sue Trudeau, and a local man hired to oversee the liquidation, Patrick Klouse, were alone in a beige landscape of naked shoe racks and empty jewelry spinners that once held 14-karat gold charms for $14.89. A giant sign that read "Infants" leaned against a wall.
Ms. Trudeau said the Tupper Lake store was hardly a money loser. "All of the New York stores were really profitable, especially in the North Country," she said. (Mr. Sanborn said he could not confirm that.)
Mr. Klouse's wife, Sharon, had worked in the store's jewelry department.
Now she collects unemployment insurance while she looks for a job. Mr. Klouse went through the same thing himself last year when the A.&P. closed. He had been with the store for 31 years, 28 years as the manager.
"You get by," he said. "You make things work out. But there's not much in town, that's the thing."

HEADLINE: VOTERS IN TURKEY EXPEL LEADERSHIP 

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Voters angrily drummed Turkey's incumbents out of office today, choosing by a sound margin a party led by a former Islamicist, who quickly sought to calm fears by emphasizing his support for a moderate, secular Turkey.
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan, 48, the leader of the party, Justice and Development, said tonight that it was firmly committed to joining Europe and to continuing strong relations with the United States. 
 "Secularism is the protector of all beliefs and religions," Mr. Erdogan, who is barred from a formal role in the government, said in an interview here with American reporters. "We are the guarantors of this secularism, and our management will clearly prove that." 
Though he once opposed joining the European Union, Mr. Erdogan said tonight that his first priority was to begin formal talks to become a member. "We're running out of time on E.U. membership," he said at a news conference.
With 99 percent of the ballots counted, Justice and Development had won 34.2 percent of the vote -- enough under Turkey's election law for it to form a government without a coalition partner. 
Its nearest rival, the staunchly secular, center-left Republican People's Party, won 19.4 percent, and is expected to become the sole opposition party. None of the 16 other parties in contention appeared likely to cross the 10 percent threshold needed to gain seats in Parliament. Under the Turkish system, votes cast for the parties below the 10 percent threshold are distributed among the parties above it. In a measure of voters' anger at incumbent politicians -- especially at corruption and the bad economy -- the party of Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit barely won 1 percent of the vote.
"I'm not surprised, even though I didn't expect it to be so low," said Mr. Ecevit, 77, whose ill health this summer prompted elections two years ahead of schedule. The party that had been running third in the polls, the Youth Party, fell short of the 10 percent threshold. 
Though Justice and Development looked set to dominate Parliament, the role of its charismatic leader, Mr. Erdogan (pronounced EHR-doh-han) was far from certain. 
He is not permitted to serve as prime minister, nor to hold any government position, because of a 1998 conviction for reading a poem that a court said incited religious hatred. Some experts worry that Turkey will suffer under a weak prime minister -- with Mr. Erdogan effectively ruling from behind the scenes -- as the nation seeks to begin accession talks with the European Union and the United States ponders an attack in Iraq. Turkey is considered crucial to any American action because of its air bases near the Iraqi border.
Mr. Erdogan declined to say tonight exactly how his party would handle the problem, though he noted that voters were well aware of his "legal prohibitions." He suggested that he could remain head of the party, presumably setting policy, while a prime minister tended to the state itself.
"People voted for the party, and the reason behind the existence of the party is its program," he said in the interview at party headquarters as supporters cheered in a parking lot outside. "There are similar examples in the world, where the leader of the party is not necessarily the leader of the government. This can work in Turkey as well."
The ban on his holding office runs out early next year, though he still could not become prime minister because that job must be held by an elected member of Parliament. Moreover, the fate of the party itself is clouded by charges brought by the nation's chief prosecutor last month that were intended to ban it outright.
The victory tonight gave the party a clear majority of a projected 364 seats in the 550-seat Parliament as well as the highest percentage for any single party in Turkey in at least 20 years. Voting is mandatory in Turkey, and the turnout is usually at least 80 percent.
But some experts believed the party's hold on power remained tenuous because despite its strong support, around 65 percent of Turkey's 41 million voters did not cast their ballots for Justice and Development, and because there remain ongoing questions about Mr. Erdogan's precise role in government and his Islamic past. 
"It's not like they are in an earthquake, but they will never feel very safe," said Ahmet K. Han, a professor and political analyst at Istanbul Bilgi University, who predicted that the government would not last long. 
But Mr. Han also said the election marked a watershed in Turkey's politics: voters denied seats to all three parties in the current ruling coalition, as well as to any other party that has recently held power.
"This the death of politics in Turkey as we know it," he said. "This is a real call for new politics. The population is in real need for a change."
The sentiment was echoed by Yakup Kepenek, a leading member of the Republican People's Party, begun by Kemal Ataturk, who founded the Turkish Republic in 1923.
"What we would wish the most," Mr. Kepenek said in an interview tonight, "is that they should re-establish the lost respect for Turkish politics."
Though much attention in the campaign focused on Mr. Erdogan's past as a proponent of political Islam, many voters seemed willing to overlook their concerns. Mr. Erdogan was a popular mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998, and many voters said they wanted leadership that was competent, clean and not responsible for the current political mess.
"Tayyip Erdogan was the only man I could trust," said Murat Oren, a 29-year-old cab driver in Istanbul who voted for Justice and Development. "The situation we are in right now has nothing to do with religion. It is all the economy."
But many questions remain about how Mr. Erdogan and his party will get along with the leaders of Turkey's establishment, especially in the military, which staged three coups in the last 42 years when it felt the state was in danger. In 1997, the army nudged aside the first Islamist government in Turkey, headed by the Welfare Party, and newspapers are full of rumors that the army is eyeing Mr. Erdogan with concern. 
Mr. Erdogan and many of his top leaders were members of the Welfare Party and its later incarnations -- and, in many ways, the victory tonight marks a new stage for what he says are his evolving political views. As mayor, he opposed joining the European Union and advocated withdrawing from NATO.
In 1998 he was imprisoned for reciting a poem in public that read, in part, "The mosques are our bayonets, the domes our helmets and the believers our soldiers." He served four months in prison for that offense, which his supporters quickly point out would probably not be a crime under reforms passed here last summer.
H. Cuneyd Zapsu, a party leader and businessman, said that most voters believed Mr. Erdogan had changed, and that opposition to him among Turkey's political elite was based less on fear of Islam than fear of a poor boy who made good. As a boy, Mr. Erdogan sold lemonade to help support his family.
"The whole issue is how somebody like Tayyip Erdogan -- who doesn't know English, who didn't study abroad, from someplace like the Bronx in New York -- how he can say, 'I'm going to rule you,' " Mr. Zapsu said. "This is the issue in the end. Everybody knows Tayyip Erdogan is not a shariat guy anymore," he said, referring to Islamic law. 
Justice and Development Party leaders said tonight that they expected the first major step toward forming a government would come on Tuesday, when 50 party members would discuss whom they might nominate as prime minister.

HEADLINE: China's Communist Party, 'to Survive,' Opens Its Doors to Capitalists 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: KUNMING, China 

 BODY:
Wu Kegang is a globe-trotting businessman who lives in a hilltop home in Hong Kong. He owns a vineyard and a yacht-engine factory on the mainland, runs a trading company in the United States and sends his son to Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. 
 He also pays his dues -- 3 percent of his annual salary -- to the Chinese Communist Party. 
 Party leaders are courting entrepreneurs like him, trying to keep control of a society that depends more on capitalist dynamism than on government dictates. 
When party delegates convene in Beijing on Nov. 8, they plan to take the rare occasion to hand authority to a new generation, from Jiang Zemin, the man who has served as China's president since 1993 and leader of the Communist Party since 1989, to a hand-picked set of new leaders, headed by the largely unknown Hu Jintao. 
But more than that, the party will be looking to transform itself to hold on to power at a time when the rhythms of capitalism are pulsing through Chinese society. The party leaders intend to enshrine Mr. Jiang's theory of the "three represents," declaring that the party now represents capitalists as much as the workers and peasants who formed its base for more than 80 years. 
For now, people in private business will probably represent only a small minority of the party's 66 million members. But already entrepreneurs are on their way to replacing barefoot doctors and selfless soldiers as party icons. A few could even find themselves elevated to the Central Committee.
With the opening to business leaders, China's leaders are blurring the class distinctions they once considered sacred, perhaps jettisoning ideology altogether in a race for relevance.
"Our party is doing what it takes to survive," Mr. Wu said during a visit to his wine-making operation in Kunming, which is about 800 miles west of Hong Kong. "It is attracting the people who have the social status and the economic clout to govern."
That is a gamble, even some in the party concede. For one thing, such a bald association with the rich could strip the party of the last shreds of popular support and worsen already rampant corruption. Party leaders are also trying to diversify their ranks and the economy without eroding their monopoly on power.
Influential business people have responded by joining hands with what they often describe as a pragmatic dictatorship that has shed its revolutionary politics and is refashioning itself, willingly if clumsily, to guide a market economy.
Some have done so opportunistically, for the access and influence that the party provides. Others resist the party, wary that it is more interested in harnessing them than in setting their talents free.
Zou Zongshen, for instance, tries to avoid political entanglements for his prosperous motorcycle business in the southwestern city of Chongqing. His crosstown rival, Yin Mingshan, also runs a thriving motorcycle maker, but enthusiastically devotes half his time to what he calls "political work." 
Mr. Wu began his career as a party official in the southern special economic zone of Shenzhen. In the early 1990's, he abandoned that life and "jumped into the sea," as the expression went at the time, to become a private businessman. Now, he has a bit of both identities, having re-established links with his original party organization. 
Mr. Wu, 50, has an oversize, gold-embossed name card that lists 12 companies he runs in Hong Kong, the United States and China, including those specializing in engines, wine, real estate and electronics. His wine company, Yunnan Red Wine, is expected to be listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange in several months. 
Chinese entrepreneurs once dodged anything to do with politics. But in a lunchtime interview, after a meeting with province party officials, Mr. Wu quickly warmed to the subject.
"It is only logical that there be more connections between business and political life," he said. His hair was slicked back in the style popular in government service. Only the jade bracelet dangling from his wrist suggested another line of work. 
The party's new acceptance of capitalists, he predicted, will clear a path so that private entrepreneurs and executives from state-run companies can assume high government posts, like provincial chiefs, mayors and heads of important ministries. 
"The more entrepreneurs who move into the government power structure, the more optimistic I am about the future," he said.
The party began allowing capitalists to take over chunks of the state-controlled economy in the 1980's, a direction that paid off handsomely; the economy now is 20 times larger than it was in 1980, and private industry has become the main engine of growth. It accounts for one-third of economic output today, compared with almost nothing 20 years ago.
There were fears that the emergence of a business class would create a Faustian bargain for the party. Yet instead of becoming antagonists, business people and the party have become co-dependents. At least for the immediate future, they appear to have more to gain by cooperating than by competing.
This is true because the government controls much more of the economy than statistics suggest. It closely regulates many industries and bans competition in areas deemed politically sensitive, like military goods, telecommunications, steel production and the media.
Politicians vet land sales and set zoning rules. They decide who gets bank loans and who can list shares on China's stock markets. Tax rates are usually subject to negotiation. Businessmen need political connections to thrive.
China's leaders also need capitalists more than ever. With most state-owned companies in terminal decline, the government desperately relies on private sector tax payments, and that is no easy challenge in a society that has poor record keeping and a history of tax dodging.
The government has also turned to private businesses to absorb millions of workers laid off by state companies. Without such help, the risk of urban unrest would soar.
Zhou Yiling, who founded a private advertising company in Nanjing after losing her job at a state-run hotel, sees the private sector and the state as inextricably intertwined. So much so, she says, that she hires only fellow state workers who, in the popular euphemism, are off-post.
"The era of state-owned companies is ending, and it is time for private companies to take their place," she said.
Ms. Zhou is also one of the first entrepreneurs in the eastern Chinese city to apply for party membership, a status she never had when she worked for the state. She is now asked to attend long classes to study Communist Party theorists from Marx to Jiang. 
Party officials handling her application often visit her office in a converted three-room apartment, decorated with pink curtains. More than a dozen employees -- Ms. Zhou calls them comrades -- sit shoulder to shoulder laying out advertising inserts for local newspapers. 
Ms. Zhou is hesitant to talk about her party ties before she becomes a member. But she does reflect on the benefits she could receive. "We do much of our business with state-owned newspapers," she said. "The editors are all party members, and my own status will advance greatly in their eyes."
The party has promoted its mission of helping such business people, but that has ignited vocal objections from party members and political theorists. If the Communist Party has anything left to offer Chinese people, some argue, it is its founding pledge to defend the interests of workers and peasants against people who would exploit them for profit.
Hu Angang, a left-leaning political and economic theorist in Beijing, wrote of the party's plan to admit capitalists, "Some people in the party really hope to mainly represent the interests of entrepreneurs, and not the broad interests of workers and peasants."
Many entrepreneurs turn a cold shoulder to the party's entreaties. Some say politics bores them, and others chide the culture of soliciting and giving bribes, which already infects many aspects of business life.
Mr. Zou, 50, runs the motorcycle company that bears his given name, Zongshen, in Chongqing, the Detroit of China's motorcycle industry. Once a motorcycle repairman, he started his factory a decade ago. Today, he is one of China's richest men.
Party officials have long urged him to become active in political meetings. He sometimes obliges. "If they have a three-day meeting, I'll attend one day," he says. But he decided against applying for party membership.
"It's a waste of time," he said.
Mr. Zou draws slowly on his cigarette and talks in short sentences when asked about politics. He says years of butting heads with the bureaucracy persuaded him that "it's best to keep some distance." He says he avoids under-the-table deals. He will not hire government officials to represent his company, he says.
"It's best if business is business and the party is just a regular ruling party," he says. "We should keep things separate."
Across town is Mr. Zou's mirror image. Mr. Yin runs the rival motorcycle company, called Li Fan, and he is also a wealthy man.
But in the lobby of Li Fan's headquarters, alongside an exhibition of three dozen motorcycles, is a display of photographs of Mr. Yin receiving the Communist Party elite -- Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, all current or former members of the Politburo. 
Mr. Yin estimates that he spends half his time running his company. The other half is for political work. 
This now includes being chairman of the Chongqing chamber of commerce, a quasi-government association, and serving as vice chairman of a government-run newspaper in which he has invested. His highest honor: Beijing recently appointed him provincial chairman of a national organization designed to represent all walks of life to central leaders. 
Mr. Yin, 64, receives visitors in his boardroom, which can seat 50 at an oblong table. He wears a black suit and a tie on a Saturday afternoon. During an interview, he asks his assistants, also dressed formally, to fetch articles he wrote or speeches he gave. He quotes his own aphorisms, like "Pure gold fears no fire," which are printed on his factory walls.
His ardor for politics seems paradoxical. He was persecuted under Mao, labeled a counterrevolutionary and spent 18 years doing forced labor. 
An edict issued by Deng Xiaoping in 1979 freed him, however, and earned Mr. Yin's loyalty. "Deng is history's greatest man," Mr. Yin said. "I ended up doing well because of the policies my country followed." 
Today, he said, he has a chance to influence policy. He has helped fellow entrepreneurs get loans from state banks after intervening with the mayor of Chongqing. He even had a chance to buttonhole Zhu Rongji, the prime minister, on a business concern close to his bottom line -- big city restrictions on motorcycles. "There has been some improvement since our talk," he said.
In return, he has urged entrepreneurs to hire more laid-off workers, keep better records and pay more taxes. 
Capitalists, he said, have moved to the center of Chinese life. "The base of the party is increasing," he said. "Had they tried to keep us separate from the mainstream, it is the party that would have been weakened."

When Chinese Communist Party delegates convene in Beijing on Nov. 8, they plan to rewrite their Constitution so that the party will officially represent capitalists as much as workers and peasants. 1978 -- Deng Xiaoping (right) takes power and initiates China's market-oriented reforms. Farmers are given control of their land and allowed to raise crops based on market demand. 1982 -- Party officials formally allow the development of the so-called individual economy so far as that is a necessary and helpful supplement to the state sector. 1995 -- A new economic team led by Zhu Rongji (right) comes to power in Beijing. It adopts a new policy that clears the way for privatization of failing state enterprises. 1997 -- The party formally acknowledges that the private sector has become an important component of a socialist market economy. These businessmen are thought to be candidates for high government or party positions; all three are prominent entrepreneurs.

HEADLINE: Why Close Races Ruin Politics 

BYLINE:  By Norman J. Ornstein; Norman J. Ornstein is a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Has the nail-biter election become a way of life?
 With control of the House of Representatives and the Senate up for grabs and a serious chance of a tie in both, it seems that it has. What people forget -- their view obscured, perhaps, by the ultra-close 2000 presidential election and the most balanced Congress in 70 years -- is that this dynamic is exceedingly rare in American politics. 
 Except for brief periods of transition in the late 1890's and just after World War II, one party or another has tended to dominate the electoral scene, winning Congressional control (and usually the White House) in most elections. The majority dominance worked in cycles, shifting roughly every 40 years, after a dramatic event like a depression or a major war. In the most recent cycle, Democrats had a hammerlock on Congress for the 40 years from 1954 to 1994, winning every election in the House and 13 straight in the Senate before a six-year lapse with the election of Ronald Reagan. 
We could be in the midst of another brief transition. But it doesn't look that way. What the 2000 election signaled, and the 2002 elections will probably reinforce, is that we are in an age of parity, perhaps unique in American history and likely to be with us for some time to come. 
At all levels of American politics, Democrats and Republicans are dead even. Beyond the number of seats in Congress, if one adds up all the votes cast in 2000 for the House of Representatives across 435 individual districts, they are virtually even between the parties. Control of the machinery of state governments? Democrats control 18 states, Republicans, 17. Fourteen are split. (Nebraska is unicameral and nonpartisan.) Total number of state legislators across 50 states and 99 chambers? An advantage of about 2 percent for Democrats. Voters? Most polls show near-even party identification, and a tie on party preferences for Congress in the next election. Despite terrorist attacks, a sagging economy and the possibility of a war in Iraq, none of these fundamental indicators has changed a whit. 
It is, of course, possible that a dramatic development will break the impasse at the last minute, leading to an emerging majority party. But it is far more likely that the majorities in both houses will stay extremely close, leaving their control up for grabs again in 2004. Given the nature of redistricting, which has narrowed the number of genuinely contestable seats in the House to less than 10 percent of the total, and of modern campaigning and fund-raising, which discourage the emergence of attractive and capable challengers, there is little chance of the shift of 50 or 60 seats in the House, or 10 or 12 in the Senate, that would create a new, robust and enduring majority.
Close elections and an even balance are like manna from heaven for the press. On the surface, they seem healthy for democracy. Who can argue with tight, tough competition? 
But the age of parity has a giant downside that doesn't exist when there are more certain majorities. When control of Congress is not an overriding issue, lawmakers can turn from an election to policy making without life-and-death political considerations looming over every issue and every decision. Bipartisan compromise can best be reached in an atmosphere free of intense partisan overtones. 
But if control hangs in the balance, every word uttered or vote taken has larger implications. Politics is always part of the legislative process. But in these periods of parity, political considerations -- and focus on the next election -- tend to outweigh everything else. Legislation is turned into a tool to put the other party on the defensive or to insulate one's own party from attack. 
Thus, Democrats have tried relentlessly to make Social Security "privatization" an issue against Republicans; Republicans have worked with equal vigor to inoculate themselves against the charge by pledging to maintain current and future benefits. Yet neither side has worked to craft a Social Security reform bill that could actually make it into law. And when bipartisanship does take place, it can have dangerous consequences. In the effort to outdo each other, Republicans and Democrats bid up prescription drug benefits to fiscally irresponsible levels.
Whichever party comes out on top on Tuesday, the failure this fall to make progress on a host of issues -- from pension and accounting reform to homeland security and terrorism -- bodes ill for the next Congress, when manic concern about the next tossup Congressional elections will be inflamed by the 2004 presidential contest. Look on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning for the election winners. After that, look hard for legislative breakthroughs. They'll be tough to find.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
A thriving niche in publishing: the custom magazine that resembles its newsstand cousins.

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives 

 BODY:
WHILE traditional consumer magazines continue to be whipsawed by an inhospitable advertising environment, one part of the publishing business is thriving -- the production of custom magazines for corporate sponsors.
 In one of the biggest deals this year, the custom publishing unit of the Meredith Corporation won the bidding to create three magazines for the Dodge, Jeep and Chrysler brands of DaimlerChrysler. Six million copies of the magazines have begun arriving in the mailboxes of Chrysler owners, filled with lifestyle features on topics ranging from architecture schools to rock music. 
 Other marketers, abetted by willing publishers, are increasingly starting publications of their own that look, feel and read like a typical magazine, rather than a mere catalog of praise for their own products. The Toyota Motor Corporation, for example, hired Fluent Communications in Seattle to start a North American version of Lexus magazine, an 800,000-circulation title with articles on the pleasures of caviar and Las Vegas. 
Charming Shoppes, the parent company of Lane Bryant, Catherines and Fashion Bug clothing stores, has signed on with Brinsights, a New York marketing boutique, to publish Lane magazine beginning next spring. Lane will be a fashion and lifestyle publication for the plus-size woman, and 2 million copies will be available -- for purchase -- in Charming Shoppes' stores.
And Clear Channel Entertainment earlier this year picked Forbes Custom Communications Partners, a venture between Forbes Inc. and the WPP Group, to publish the quarterly Show People: The Theater Lifestyle Magazine.
Overall, the custom publishing market in 2001 is estimated to have reached $1.5 billion, and has been growing at 10 percent a year, according to reports cited by the Custom Publishing Council, part of the Magazine Publishers of America. By contrast, advertising in consumer magazines dropped 11.7 percent last year, according to the Publishers Information Bureau.
Latching on to any part of a company's marketing budget during an advertising recession is just one attraction for publishers. A custom publication inherits an instant audience, thanks to a marketer's database, allowing publishers to avoid the high subscription-acquisition costs that come with a standard magazine. And unlike the years of investment the ordinary magazine requires, the profits are instantaneous and sometimes significant.
But the custom publishing market has its downsides. Publishers do not control the magazines' destinies; their fate is firmly in the hands of their sponsor companies' marketing departments.
Poaching is also a constant worry in the increasingly competitive business. Once dominated by small companies that produced only custom publications, nearly every major magazine publisher (including Time Inc., Hearst Magazines and Hachette Filipacchi Media) and even advertising agencies like the WPP Group now have units of their own.
And as custom publications proliferate and become nearly indistinguishable from their editorially independent brethren, they run the risk of stealing advertisers and readers from a publisher's wholly owned magazines.
But publishers willingly accept the risks. Meredith, which also publishes the consumer magazines Better Homes and Gardens and The Ladies' Home Journal, is one of the oldest players in the custom publishing business, having launched that business in 1969. The integrated marketing unit now has about 75 employees, generating five to 10 percent of the parent company's $733 million in revenue from magazine publishing in the 12 months ending in June, said Steve Lacy, president of the publishing group.
In its deal with DaimlerChrysler, Meredith convinced the carmaker to use it for all three of its new titles, instead of parceling each out to a different publisher as planned. The Chrysler Group also worked with its agency, PentaMark Worldwide in Troy, Mich., a division of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, on the magazines.
"These magazines are direct marketing vehicles, but they're more than that," Mr. Lacy said. "They are also intended to have a look and a feel of a real magazine."
Jeep magazine's cover story, for example, explores the Hawaiian island of Kauai (on foot, with nary a Jeep reference), while its Chrysler sibling reports on apprentices at the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture.
For Meredith, the magazines give the publisher entree to DaimlerChrysler's marketing budget without diminishing the revenue from advertising.
"This isn't rob Peter to pay Paul," said Jeff Bell, vice president for business-to-customer relations at DaimlerChrysler. "We support this with our marketing operations, but not out of our advertising."
But publishing both custom magazines and standard consumer titles can create conflict, said Eric Schneider, president and chief executive at Redwood Custom Communications, which is 50 percent owned by the WPP Group.
Redwood publishes only custom publications, including Kraft Food & Family magazine for Kraft Foods, part of the Philip Morris Companies. "These publications, in our view, compete against traditional publications for ad revenue and for readers," he said.
"If I'm selling advertising for Kraft magazine, for instance, it kind of cuts into my ad stream for House and Home," he added. And readers have finite attention to give as well. "If I'm gaining readers, it could come at the expense of my readership" on other titles, he said. "You only have so much time that you can dedicate to reading magazines."
That custom publications might complicate the old model of magazine publishing does not bother some custom clients. "All due respect, but Jeep magazine is about as good as Outside magazine," said Mr. Bell of DaimlerChrysler.
Just like the regular world of magazine publishing, the custom business has seen its share of implosions. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company, part of British American Tobacco, shut down its custom titles Real Edge, published by Emap P.L.C., and Flair and the Art of Simple Living, published by Hearst, late last year, noting that the company knew tobacco, not publishing, and that the costs were outweighing the benefits. And Williams-Sonoma gave up on Taste magazine, a thick, lavish lifestyle magazine put out by Weldon Owen Publishing.
Eager to avoid throwing marketing money down similar holes, companies increasingly demand proof that their custom magazines are doing some good for the bottom line. As a result, Meredith studded its DaimlerChrysler titles with calls to action that will generate measurable results for the client, like invitations to visit a particular Web site or call a particular phone number for more information or discounted goods and services. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 5, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The Advertising column in Business Day yesterday, about the production of custom magazines for corporate sponsors, misstated the ownership of one such publisher, Redwood Custom Communications. It is 50 percent owned by the Omnicom Group, not the WPP Group.

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
As a Campaigner, the President Hits the 'Repeat' Button

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: SIOUX FALLS, S.D. 

 BODY:
On Saturday in Tennessee, President Bush said Van Hilleary, the Republican candidate for governor, was a great guy because he didn't need "a poll or a focus group to tell him what to think." On Friday night in Kentucky, Mr. Bush commended Representative Anne M. Northup, who is in tough re-election fight, because she, too, didn't need "a poll or a focus group to tell her what to think." Five and a half hours earlier in New Hampshire, Mr. Bush praised Representative John E. Sununu, the Republican candidate for Senate, for having, amazingly enough, that very same ability to ignore polls and focus groups.
 Regular listeners to Mr. Bush's political stump speech sometimes feel like they're in the middle of "Groundhog Day," the 1993 movie that forced Bill Murray to relive the same Feb. 2 over and over. The speech got an especially hard workout this past weekend, when Mr. Bush delivered it seven times in six states in a final all-out push for candidates in close midterm elections. Today he is to deliver it four more times at rallies in Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas and Texas. 
 The president has repeated his 30-minute-plus stump speech so often that it rarely makes news, even though it is at the core of the case he makes for himself. Delivered largely extemporaneously, the speech is a kitchen sink of carefully calculated phrases by White House political advisers -- Mr. Bush now talks about the economy before he gets to Iraq -- and a revealing look into the president's on-the-road thought process. 
"The stump comes out of the president's mind," said Michael Gerson, Mr. Bush's chief speechwriter. "He is the editor, redactor and creator of the stump. It's kind of an organic process where you give him some material and he doesn't use it directly, but he may play off of it."
Unlike Mr. Bush's major addresses, like his speech to the United Nations on Sept. 12, the president delivers his stump speech without a teleprompter or prepared text. He works largely from memory, mixing and matching favorite lines from other remarks, but is aided by full sentences of briefing points made by White House speechwriters on 5-by-8 index cards. Mr. Bush typically scrawls over a few selected cards in a black Sharpie marker with single words -- "economy," "jobs" and "small business," for example -- to remind himself to get into his familiar riffs on those subjects, then throws out the rest.
"I just don't think he's using much of anything," Mr. Gerson said. "I think he's kind of in a groove."
These days Mr. Bush's stump speech is almost a mirror opposite of the one he was giving last January, when he focused on smoking terrorists out of their caves. With recent polls showing Americans more concerned about the economy than terrorism, Mr. Bush now starts off with lengthy accolades about his 2001 tax cut, with assertions specific to each state about how many billions of dollars it will put into voters' pockets over the next decade. He talks of the need to create jobs, improve schools and add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. The speech is more than half over before Mr. Bush gets to Iraq and the campaign against terror.
"I think it's pretty clear to Americans where we are on the war," a White House official said. "We've got more of a communications challenge on the economy and domestic issues, and we lead with them."
The stump speech also reflects the evolving political priorities at the White House. Last spring, when the administration was under intense scrutiny for missing clues to the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Bush larded his speech with demands for the creation of a department for domestic defense. During last summer's corporate scandals, he used the speech to refer to corrupt executives in the terms -- he was going to hunt them down -- he normally reserved for terrorists.
Interspersed throughout are pet jokes of the president, although not necessarily of his advisers. A new Bush favorite that has even the White House staff rolling its eyes is Mr. Bush's assertion that his administration is going to have to hunt down the terrorists because "therapy isn't going to work on them." Still, pumped-up Republican crowds usually give him a big laugh. 
Less successful is Mr. Bush's well-worn construction about how badly the terrorists miscalculated America's response to the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. "Oh, they probably thought that after Sept. the 11th, 2001, we'd file a lawsuit or two," Mr. Bush said at a rally on Saturday night in Tampa, Fla., as he has countless times before, to moderate laughter.
When Mr. Bush first trotted out the line many months ago, it was often met with silence, but now the president's timing has improved, along with the response from the crowds. 
Still, the only time the line ever brought down the house was in a bit of contextual humor last summer in Mississippi, when Mr. Bush was deploring junk lawsuits in what happened to be the junk lawsuit capital of the United States. "They hit us, but they didn't know who they were hitting," Mr. Bush said. "Oh, they probably thought we'd file a lawsuit or two!"
Over the months, Mr. Bush has also dropped some once-cherished lines and verbal tics. He no longer makes references to his dogs, Barney and Spot, for example, and he has cut back on his excessive use of "fabulous" to describe everything from his wife to the American military. 
Nonetheless, every man running for political office in America, including Mr. Bush and his brother Jeb, has married above himself. Oh, and at a rally last week in Denver, Mr. Bush said that Senator Wayne Allard, the Republican seeking re-election in Colorado, didn't need "a focus group or a poll to tell him what to think."

HEADLINE: Mixed Signals From White House on Future of S.E.C. Chief 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON and RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Administration officials sent out conflicting signals today about the future of Harvey L. Pitt as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission as they scrambled to defuse an awkward political problem two days before Congressional elections.
 Advisers to President Bush made clear that he would dismiss Mr. Pitt if the investigations into his selection of a new accounting oversight board show that he failed to act properly. They also continued to privately complain about his repeated political missteps even as they publicly praised him on the Sunday morning television news programs. 
 In a sign that Mr. Pitt may have already begun to consider leaving, a spokeswoman for the commission at first declined to comment today when asked directly whether he intended to stay or could do his job credibly while he remained the subject of three investigations. But when pressed, she later amended her reply to say that she had "no reason to doubt that the chairman will continue to do the job the president and the Senate appointed him to do."
Some advisers to Mr. Bush suggested that Mr. Pitt may lose his job after the completion of the inquiries into his handling of the accounting board. Others said it may take longer in order to give the White House time to find a replacement. The advisers repeated today that they were "displeased and deeply angered" that Mr. Pitt had failed to notify them about the ties between William H. Webster, the new head of an accounting oversight board, and a company that has been accused of fraud.
They were also said to be troubled that the issue arose just as Congressional elections have drawn so close and the control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate hangs in the balance.
Mr. Pitt's latest difficulties began with the disclosure last week that he had failed to inform the four other commissioners or the White House that Mr. Webster had until recently headed the audit committee of U.S. Technologies, which is being investigated by the authorities for possible fraud.
Mr. Webster has said he told Mr. Pitt of accusations against the company before he was selected in a bitterly contested vote to be the chairman of the new accounting oversight board. The board is supposed to clean up the accounting profession after a wave of large corporate and auditing failures.
The failure by Mr. Pitt to share that information has led to investigations by the commission's inspector general and the General Accounting Office, as well as a Senate inquiry. The commission is now in the awkward position of having both Mr. Pitt and Mr. Webster under investigation just as both of their offices are trying to persuade corporate boards and their accountants to be more aggressive in rooting out problems and more forthcoming with investors.
On the Sunday morning talk shows, the president's advisers said the matter of Mr. Pitt's future should await the outcome of the investigations, which could take months.
"This particular issue is being reviewed and examined by the inspector general," said Marc Racicot, chairman of the Republican National Committee, on NBC's "Meet the Press." "My understanding is as well that the S.E.C. has commissioned their own review to determine whether or not there was or could be a mistake in judgment. And I think until such time as those facts are presented, everyone is well advised to make certain that they retain their independent judgment."
Karen P. Hughes, another adviser to Mr. Bush, agreed.
"We need to learn all the facts and see the results of that investigation," she said on ABC's "This Week."
She praised Mr. Pitt's tenure at the agency, saying that under him, "the S.E.C. has imposed a record amount of fines and has enacted a record number of disgorgements against corporate executives who've been engaged in unethical practices."
At the commission, the criticism over the selection process has quickly become an exercise in finger-pointing. Mr. Webster has said that before the vote, he told both Mr. Pitt and Robert K. Herdman, the agency's chief accountant, that his work for U.S. Technologies might pose a political problem. 
Mr. Pitt has said he relied on Mr. Herdman to look into the issue, agency officials said. They said that Mr. Herdman has said that he did not conduct extensive background checks of the candidates.
Christi Harlan, the agency's top spokeswoman, said that neither Mr. Pitt nor Mr. Herdman would comment about his role in the selection of Mr. Webster. The two men have long been friends and colleagues, and Mr. Herdman was personally selected for the job by Mr. Pitt. Before joining the government, they worked closely -- Mr. Pitt as a private lawyer and Mr. Herdman as a senior executive at Ernst & Young -- to beat back tougher restrictions on the accounting profession.
Beyond dealing with the intensifying criticism of Mr. Pitt, the president continues to face pressure from Democrats and even some Republican advisers to make changes to his economic team, which has been dogged by criticism that it is gaffe prone and unable to build confidence on Wall Street, in the business community and among voters. Late last week, speculation was rampant in Republican circles that a shake-up would be likely after the election.
Republicans with ties to the White House said that Lawrence B. Lindsey, the director of the White House's National Economic Council and Mr. Bush's closest economic policy adviser, might leave by the end of the year.
But one senior administration official said he had heard nothing about Mr. Lindsey leaving. Another senior official said Mr. Lindsey has been rumored to be leaving for a year now and has not done so.
Administration officials said R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, had told people inside and outside the White House that he was considering returning to teaching. Mr. Hubbard was an economics professor at Columbia University before joining the administration. A spokesman for Mr. Hubbard declined to comment on his plans.
The most persistent target of outside criticism has been Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary. But Mr. O'Neill shows no signs of departing -- a few weeks ago, he was scheduling speaking engagements as far ahead as next fall -- and he is busily preparing a number of new initiatives, including a package of options for overhauling the tax code.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE OVERVIEW; 
In a Race With Few Divisions, Candidates Search for the Right Closing Themes

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
In the final weekend of one of the closest Congressional campaigns in years, Democratic candidates returned yesterday to the issues that they had once hoped would sweep them to victory, warning of a deterioriating economy and a Republican threat to Social Security. Republicans, led by President Bush, urged voters to elect a Republican Congress that would enact initiatives like a homeland security bill and tax cuts.
 From a street walk in the suburbs of Las Vegas to a fly-around in South Dakota, from small-town coffee shops to a huge presidential rally at a Minnesota hockey arena, Democrats and Republicans struggled to strike the right closing themes in a campaign that has been notable for its absence of any sharp divisions. 
 In this final weekend, Democrats sounded themes they had been talking about since last summer: an unsteady economy, prescription drug coverage for the elderly and the future of Social Security.
"You know who the real important person is to me?" said Jean Carnahan, a Democrat struggling to hold her Senate seat in one of the season's closest election fights. "The man who told me he's cutting his pills in half every day. He needs prescription drug benefits in Medicare. That will be one of the very first things when I return to the Senate. " 
In Arkansas, Mark Pryor, a Democratic challenger fighting to unseat Senator Tim Hutchinson, a Republican, struck a similar theme last night in Pine Bluffs: "Arkansans wants a senator in Washington who will fight for them whether it is for prescription drugs, education, highways or the economy," Mr. Pryor said to a burst of applause.
For Republicans -- personified in three states yesterday by none other than Mr. Bush, in the midst of an exhaustive campaign swing -- it was a domestic security bill, a push for making tax cuts permanent, and the frustration Mr. Bush voiced at Democrats in the Senate who have blocked his judicial nominees.
"I need someone to help me fulfill one of my most awesome responsibilities, which is to pick to pick good judges for our federal benches," Mr. Bush said in Springfield, Ill., as he campaigned on behalf of candidates for governor, the Senate and the House. 
"The current Senate has done a lousy job on the judges. We've got a vacancy crisis in America, which means Americans aren't getting justice."
"It's so important to have members of Congress who understand the role of government -- it's not to create wealth, but an environment in which the small business can grow to be a big business; in which the entrepreneurial spirit of America can flourish," Mr. Bush said.
This last Sunday of campaigning came on the eve of an election in which voters will chose 435 voting members of the House, 34 members of the Senate and 36 governors. Before the death of Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, the Democrats held a one-seat edge in the Senate. Republicans hold a six-seat edge in the House. There are 21 Democratic governors and 27 Republicans; the other two are independents.
Leaders in both parties said yesterday that as of now, it seemed likely that Democrats would hold on to, or slightly expand, their edge in the Senate, while Republicans would at least keep control of the House. 
But Democrats seemed poised to make significant gains in governorships, notably in states that could prove pivotal in the 2004 presidential campaign, including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois. Beyond that, the election could reshuffle the gender makeup of the nation's class of governors: 10 women are running for governor, from nine states. There are now five female governors, though three are retiring.
A flood of final weekend polls underlined just how tight many of the races were, and why most predictions that were made yesterday were offered with at least a few to-be-sures. In another of the more dramatic contests of the year, the race for Senate in Minnesota between Walter F. Mondale and Norm Coleman, a poll published yesterday in The Minneapolis Star Tribune showed Mr. Mondale six points ahead of Mr. Coleman in the contest to replace Mr. Wellstone. A poll in The St. Paul Pioneer Press published that same morning showed Mr. Coleman six points ahead.
No matter how close the picture appeared over all, Democrats seemed clearly frustrated at what several described as a lost opportunity in trying to take back the House. Some questioned whether they had succeeded in laying out a clear alternative Democratic economic plan.
In particular, some Democrats, in a private preview of what could turn out to be the public post-mortems that will begin on Wednesday, said the party should have risked running directly against the tax cuts that President Bush pushed through.
"The way to nationalize an election and make it a referendum on the Bush economy was to talk about the billion-pound elephant in the room -- the Bush tax boon for the wealthy," said Chris Lehane, a Democratic consultant. "It is the only domestic policy issue. You can't talk about the economy with any credibility without addressing the issue. It would have been an organizing principle for a consistent message, and it would have broken through the cacophony of D.C.-speak."
In an interview yesterday, Representative Thomas M. Davis III, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, slipped more than once into the past tense as he discussed what the Democrats had done wrong.
"The one thing that the Democrats failed to do was nationalize the elections," he said. "It has allowed us to pick them apart. I can't tell you if they're for the tax cut or against it, for Iraq or against it, for homeland security or against it."
His Democratic counterpart, Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, responded: "I know there are people out there who say there is no national message. It's clear to me that there is a message. Wherever I go, the issue of the economy, the issue of prescription drug costs, is the subject of every commercial."
Yet in one sign of how times have changed, Ms. Lowey made no mention of what last summer had been an issue Democrats said they would ride to victory: abuses by corporate executives. Asked if she still considered that a potent subject to use against Republicans, she responded with a sigh: "In some districts it is. But I really don't think it's been a key issue in many districts."
Much of the discussion on the campaign trail yesterday involved politicians or their blue-chip surrogates -- among them Mr. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and former President Bill Clinton -- urging Americans to make certain to turn out to vote on Tuesday. Their appeals reflected the calculation of both parties that voter turnout efforts would prove particularly important in elections this close, as well as a reading of various polls that suggests not many Americans intend to turn out to vote on Tuesday.
But across the nation and throughout the day, Democrats and Republicans sought to stress issues that would encourage potential supporters to turn out.
In Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson pointedly questioned the position of his Democratic opponent, Mr. Pryor, on abortion rights. "We need a senator who stands for the sanctity of human life," he said. "You can ask a thousand Arkansans what his position is and none of them will know."
Mr. Pryor declined to get drawn into the discussion. "Abortion is a complicated issue," he said. "There are single-issue voters on each side, but I think people are kind of worn out about it."
For his part, Mr. Pryor -- sounding very much like many Democratic candidates yesterday -- tried to portray his Republican opponent as a threat to Social Security, arguing that he had favored measures that could have resulted in what Democrats call its privatization.
"Does anybody think that's a good idea, Social Security privatization?" Mr. Pryor asked a rally of supporters in Springdale. The crowd responded with a roar, "No!"

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE HOUSE; 
CONTROL OF HOUSE EXPECTED TO STAY IN HANDS OF G.O.P.

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Republicans are poised to buck history and make slim gains in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, according to analyses by campaign officials of both parties, the latest polls and reports from political experts around the country.
 Race-by-race examinations of competitive districts indicate that Republicans are more likely to increase their total of 223, in a House of 435 members, than to suffer a net loss, much less lose the majority. 
 Parties holding the White House almost always lose House seats in off-year elections as weaker candidates who rode in on a president's coattails lose when running on their own. Democrats did gain in 1934 and 1998. But never have Republicans gained strength in the House in a midterm election while holding the White House. 
President Bush, seeking to end that losing streak, has campaigned relentlessly for Republican candidates. 
Today, he was in Illinois, Minnesota and South Dakota. In Springfield, Ill., where Representative John Shimkus, a Republican, appears ahead of another incumbent, David Phelps, a Democrat, Mr. Bush said, "For the sake of Illinois, for the sake of this Congressional district, for the sake of the country, put John Shimkus back in the United States Congress." 
With many contests very close, Democrats could still achieve a modest increase with a superior effort to get their supporters to the polls. But with two dozen or fewer seats still in play, Democrats would have to win almost everywhere they still have a chance to make the net gains they would need to take control.
Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said today: "I think we are going to make history. I think we are going to pick up seats -- whether it's one or five I don't know. And we'll certainly hold the House."
His Democratic counterpart, Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, disagreed flatly. 
"I think we're going to win the House," she said. "I think our get-out-the-vote effort is really going to make the difference." 
Ms. Lowey said she expected "that when people in these districts go to the polls, they're going to ask if they are better off now than they were two years ago and vote Democratic."
But while the competitive campaigns have emphasized domestic issues, such as the economy generally or Social Security or prescription drugs, most analysts say the Democrats have failed to grip the public with their approach. 
Charles Cook, publisher of the The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan journal, said: "Churchill talked about the pudding that had no theme. This is an election that had all kinds of possibilities, Iraq, terrorism, the economy, corporate corruption, and none of them fully developed."
Indeed the fall campaign has changed very few House races. For every surprise, like the upset Tim Bishop, a Democrat, may score over Representative Felix J. Grucci Jr. on Long Island, there are a half dozen more where a once plausible challenge to a favorite faded.
In Iowa, for example, four incumbents, three Republicans and a Democrat faced respectable challenges, but all now seem likely to win.
Many, however, that appeared deadlocked at Labor Day still do; four of them are Democratic seats, those of Representatives Karen L. Thurman of Florida and Bill Luther of Minnesota, and open seats in Indiana and Maine. 
Other tossups where neither side now claims a meaningful lead include new districts in the Denver suburbs and Western Georgia, a Democratic seat in Indianapolis, and a Republican seat in Washington's Maryland suburbs.
The House has 223 Republicans, up one from the election two years ago as a result of a special election in Virginia. It has 208 Democrats, and one independent who votes with the Democrats, and three Democratic seats are vacant, because of the death of Patsy T. Mink of Hawaii, the resignation of Tony P. Hall of Ohio, and the incarceration and expulsion of James A. Traficant Jr. of Ohio.
On its face, those numbers would mean the Democrats need a net gain of six to take control. But Representative Ralph M. Hall of Texas, a Democrat running without opposition, has announced he will vote with the Republicans to organize the House if his vote matters. So the Democrats need a net gain of seven.
Because of the advantages of incumbency, there is less turnover in the House than there used to be. So presidents, whether on the ticket or not, have less influence on who is elected to the House. 
The last newly elected president to bring in any additional House members of his party was Ronald Reagan in 1980, with 34.
Mr. Bush himself got less than a plurality of the popular vote in 2000, so he hardly was able to carry many Republicans to victory; House Republicans lost one seat.
When Bill Clinton won in 1992, Democrats lost nine seats, though they gained three when he was re-elected in 1996. Mr. Bush's father saw the Republicans lose two House seats in 1988.
Since their party was founded, a Republican in the White House saw his party add seats in an off-year election only once -- in 1902. But Republicans actually emerged weaker. The House expanded after that election, and the Republican increase from 198 to 207 was outweighed by a Democratic increase from 153 to 178.
While both parties say this is a critical election, neither a modest Republican increase nor Democratic gains that fall short of control will have much effect on legislation in the House.
Republicans have held their narrow majority together on one critical vote after another and have seen no need to compromise with House Democrats, and a few votes either way will hardly change that.
For Mr. Bush, though, a gain of a single seat, because of its historical dimension and his nationwide barnstorming, would be a boost. The White House is ready to claim credit if Republicans do gain; a senior administration official on Air Force One today told reporters the president had been helping House candidates by framing "the issue agenda" and "he obviously helps showcase candidates" by drawing big crowds. The other Bush factor, which the official did not mention, is that Mr. Bush has raised millions for Republican candidates, helping their overall financial advantage over Democrats. 
The magnitude of the Democratic task of regaining control for the first time since 1994 is underscored by two independent but very similar estimates published last week. Congressional Quarterly said that seats that were either safe or leaning Republican totaled 219, the Democrats and their one independent had 203, and the rest were in doubt. The Cook Report said Republicans had 218 seats solid, likely or leaning their way, but the Democrats and independent totaled 199 in those categories.
The Democrats' basic hope of regaining control rests on get-out-the-vote efforts, at which they usually outdo Republicans. Labor is central to that effort. For example, in Maine's Second District, a tossup race, 53 union staffers are supervising an effort for Michael Michaud, a Democratic legislator and a paper mill worker, that has distributed 105,000 fliers and will have 500 workers on Election Day. Moreover, while Republicans have usually outdone Democrats in getting absentee ballots to their supporters, Democrats seem to be way ahead of them in Iowa this year. Similar forces are at work in other competitive races.
But across the country this year Republicans are talking convincingly about how they will compete with the Democrats in get-out-the-vote efforts. Mr. Davis said that had been emphasized in the eight special elections the party has contested in the last two years. "That was kind of spring training," he said.
Steve Rosenthal, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s political director, said he was aware that the Republicans were talking as though they understood the need for an Election Day effort, but he would wait to see if they enlisted enough dedicated volunteers to pull it off. 
"It's hard work to go out on the road all day and knock on doors or sit on the phone and call people you don't know," Mr. Rosenthal said.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Political Issue For the Ages

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Buffeted by fate, with their control of the Senate in direst peril, the Democrats have turned this fall to elderly candidates to hold on to seats they desperately need in Minnesota and New Jersey.
 Is this a sign of weakness? Shouldn't the New Jersey Democrats have had better options than the 78-year-old former Senator Frank R. Lautenberg to replace Robert G. Torricelli, who dropped out after a desultory campaign? Shouldn't the Minnesota party have had others to turn to after Senator Paul Wellstone was killed besides former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, a mere 74? 
 Perhaps; but the senior citizen nominees have not hurt the party thus far, and if they win, they will have plenty of other old-timers for company. More than half the sitting senators are 60 or older, and 14 are 70 or older. 
Republican rivals are trying to picture them as out of date. Mr. Mondale's opponent, former Mayor Norm Coleman of St. Paul, has been running advertisements saying, "You can either move into the future or get stuck in the past."
Mr. Lautenberg's opponent, Douglas R. Forrester, a businessman, said in a debate last week that the Democrat represented "the failed policies of the past."
This morning, on "Face the Nation," the CBS interview show, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the leader of the Republican senatorial campaign, took up the same theme, extending it to Republican nominees in New Hampshire, South Dakota and Missouri, whom he repeatedly pictured as "young," "energetic" and "fresh." The Democrats, he said, were "looking to ancient history."
Clearly, Mr. Lautenberg's and Mr. Mondale's decades in the public eye make them vulnerable to such gibes. But their status as political elder statesmen is a strength as well as a weakness; there is no need to introduce the stand-ins to their electorates.
Free of the miasma of controversy that swirled around Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Lautenberg has taken a substantial lead in the polls. The race between Mr. Mondale and Mr. Coleman is rated a toss-up, as was the race between Senator Wellstone and Mr. Coleman. Nonetheless, the choice of the two old-timers suggests that the Democrats in Minnesota and New Jersey have had trouble developing young talent in states where they once had plenty.
In Minnesota, the heirs to two of the state's great names, Hubert H. Humphrey III and Ted Mondale, son of the former vice president, have failed in major races in recent years after building promising early careers. Representative Robert Menendez, 48, one of his party's brightest lights in New Jersey, has built an enviable reputation in Washington, but he has repeatedly shied away from seeking higher office.
A more serious problem for Democrats across the country is their party's evident failure, despite the nation's economic woes and widespread public misgivings about a possible war in Iraq, to articulate a credible set of alternate policies. In the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll, taken from Oct. 27 to Oct. 31 and published today, only 31 percent of 1,018 voters interviewed said they thought the Democrats had "a clear plan for the country"; 42 percent said they thought the Republicans had one.
"In this campaign we're the dog that didn't bark," said a disgruntled Democratic senator not up for re-election this year. "We've made no issue of Bush's tax cuts, and a lot of us backed him on Iraq. That's no way to neutralize the advantage the White House gives the Republicans."
The poll showed no overall deterioration in the Democrats' standing with voters. Like most other surveys in recent years, it showed the electorate fairly evenly divided among Republicans (31 percent), Democrats (34 percent) and independents (28 percent). But it also indicated that nominating older candidates like Mr. Mondale and Mr. Lautenberg is unlikely to give the Democrats any particular lift with older voters; only 45 percent of people 64 and older expressed a favorable opinion of the Democrats, compared with 58 percent in that age group who said that they had a positive view of the Republicans.
Most analysts give the Democrats little chance to regain control of the House of Representatives, although the Republican margin there, 14 seats, is small by historical standards, and although the party holding the presidency has lost House seats in all but two House elections since the Civil War.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, spoke in an interview last week of his party's difficulty in recruiting effective candidates and seasoned campaign managers, and of the heavy spending this year by Republicans and their allies that the Democrats have not matched.
At the moment, the Democrats lack imposing candidates who might challenge President Bush in 2004. Most presidents come from the statehouses, not Capitol Hill, and 27 of the 50 governors are currently Republicans, including most in the big states. But that wind could shift this week. The Democrats are favored to hang on in California, their most important redoubt, and to take over the governors' mansions in Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
That should give the party ample optimism for campaigns to come.
Recent history suggests that Mr. Mondale and Mr. Lautenberg might play significant roles in the Senate if elected, whatever their opponents argue in the heat of battle. Barry M. Goldwater was re-elected to the Senate in 1968, four years after he was trounced in the presidential election. His young colleagues called him "the professor," but he served with distinction, and he was one of the two Republican senators who called upon Richard M. Nixon on Aug. 7, 1974, to urge him to resign, which he did two days later.
Hubert H. Humphrey, Mr. Mondale's mentor, was re-elected to the Senate in 1970, only two years after he lost a heartbreaking election to Mr. Nixon. Although he said in his memoirs that he had not been greeted as he had hoped, chiefly because of his support for the war in Vietnam, he stoutly defended the old liberal New Deal values, and even Jimmy Carter, who had disdained them in his 1976 campaign, ultimately found Mr. Humphrey a valuable ally.
But neither of this year's two hastily recruited veterans is likely to succeed to the degree that John Quincy Adams did. After a bitter loss in the 1828 presidential election after one term in the White House, the nation's sixth president spent 18 years in the House. Adams was ridiculed initially for what many people considered a humiliating political comedown.
But by the time he died in office, as Leonard Falkner wrote in his book "The President Who Wouldn't Retire," Adams had forged a second career "that took him to far greater eminence than the presidency had been able to provide."

HEADLINE: NETANYAHU AGREES TO A CABINET POST IF A VOTE FOLLOWS 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu conditionally agreed today to become Israel's foreign minister, provided that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon calls for new elections soon.
 Mr. Sharon, who would surely face a sharp primary challenge from Mr. Netanyahu before any general election, did not immediately respond to the barbed proposal. 
 It was the latest move in Israel's suddenly dynamic politics, as Mr. Sharon has worked to recruit allies and box in rivals in order to shore up his minority government now that the Labor Party has walked out. 
Like Mr. Sharon's choice for defense minister -- Shaul Mofaz, a former army chief of staff -- Mr. Netanyahu favors exiling Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. He opposes the creation of a Palestinian state. 
In a television interview tonight after meeting with Mr. Sharon, Mr. Netanyahu said that if he joined the government, it would have to move quickly to address three issues. He said he wanted to reach understandings with the prime minister on exile for Mr. Arafat, statehood for the Palestinians, and the location of a new fence along the boundary of the West Bank. Mr. Sharon, Mr. Netanyahu said, also supported exile.
Mr. Sharon tried and failed to persuade his previous government to support exiling Mr. Arafat. He has said he has also been restrained by a promise to President Bush not to harm the Palestinian leader.
As foreign minister, Mr. Netanyahu would replace Shimon Peres, an architect of the Oslo accords and a supporter of a two-state solution to the conflict with the Palestinians.
After 19 months of unity government, Mr. Peres departed the coalition last week, along with other ministers from the left-of-center Labor Party, over a budget dispute. Today, Mr. Sharon's representatives began negotiations to bring far-right parties into the coalition.
Mr. Sharon has assured the Bush administration that his new government will not depart from the policies of the old one. But rightist factions are demanding as the price of their support that the government oppose some of Mr. Bush's stated goals, including the eventual creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Without Labor's 25 seats, Mr. Sharon, who has endorsed the eventual creation of a Palestinian state, now controls only 55 seats in the 120-seat Parliament. He is vulnerable to a majority vote of no-confidence. Such a vote is scheduled for Monday, but Mr. Sharon is believed to have lined up enough backing to survive it.
If the government falls, Mr. Sharon is required to call new elections to be held within 90 days. Under the electoral calendar, elections are not scheduled until October.
If Mr. Sharon accepts Mr. Netanyahu's proposals, elections could come as soon as February, politicians here said.
An adept debater who speaks American-accented English, Mr. Netanyahu, who served as prime minister from 1996 until 1999, is widely seen inside Israel as one of its best spokesmen abroad. He is a member of Mr. Sharon's party, the Likud, and so might seem an obvious choice for foreign minister. But the offer, like Mr. Netanyahu's conditional acceptance of it, was double-edged.
In offering the Foreign Ministry to Mr. Netanyahu, his chief Likud rival, Mr. Sharon tried to corner him politically, Israeli politicians said. Mr. Netanyahu was faced with the choice of becoming Mr. Sharon's subordinate or appearing to favor his own ambition over the good of the country in a time of crisis.
But Mr. Netanyahu invented a third option, essentially throwing a similar dilemma back at Mr. Sharon. Mr. Sharon must now choose whether to accept early elections or risk looking like the self-interested one.
"They are playing chess with each other," said one member of Parliament from the Likud, clearly relishing the exchange.
In a statement from the prime minister's office tonight, Mr. Sharon "praised the decision in principle by Mr. Netanyahu to join his government." The statement said Mr. Netanyahu's demand for early elections was "being examined."
In the television interview tonight, on Israel's Channel 1, Mr. Netanyahu made no secret of his ambitions, describing himself as "a former prime minister, and as one planning on becoming prime minister."
Mr. Netanyahu said he told Mr. Sharon he would be "glad to serve as foreign minister in a government going to early elections."
"If we don't go to early elections," he said, "the Likud will fidget, the government will fidget, it will be subjected to endless blackmailing, and the economic collapse -- which is happening before our eyes -- will only worsen. I told him that we both must do the right thing, and the right thing is to immediately go to new elections."
In forgoing a run for prime minister two years ago, Mr. Netanyahu argued that no Likud prime minister could govern effectively, because there was no clear right-wing majority in Parliament. Now, the right is seen as likely to gain seats in a general election.
In the television interview, Mr. Netanyahu said he had a "clear objection to a Palestinian state, which in my opinion will be a state of terror led by Arafat with an ability to threaten our existence."
Mr. Netanyahu, 53, has been a persistent critic of Mr. Sharon from the right. Even as Israeli forces seized West Bank cities and towns in reprisal for Palestinian violence, he has repeatedly criticized Mr. Sharon as not going far enough in battling Mr. Arafat and his Palestinian Authority.
In a statement, Mr. Netanyahu said he "agreed to accept the position of Israel's foreign minister provided the government goes to early elections to salvage Israel's ailing economy." 
Mr. Sharon told his reduced cabinet today that he intended on Monday to submit to the Parliament his choice of Mr. Mofaz as defense minister. Mr. Mofaz finished a four-year term as chief of staff in July.
Some members of Parliament have expressed the concern that Mr. Mofaz is too recently out of the army to serve as its civilian master and watchdog. They say he may be too close personally to the top officers and too invested in the army's policies. But he is nevertheless expected to win parliamentary approval.
Mr. Mofaz will replace Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, the chairman of the Labor Party, who is now the leader of the opposition in Parliament.
Mr. Peres confirmed today that Mr. Sharon had offered him the chance to break with his party's decision and remain foreign minister. "They personally offered me the chance to be foreign minister, but I refused," he told Israeli radio. "I am a member of the party, and not a conditional member. All my life I have been a member of the movement. I do not belong to the breed of person that thinks he is the torch-bearer, the great leader." He predicted that a narrow, right-wing coalition would not survive.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Accountability Concerns Come to Conservation 

BYLINE:  By JON CHRISTENSEN 

 BODY:
Conservation biology has long been driven by a mission to save all the pieces at whatever cost. But just as questions about accounting are shaking up the financial world, conservationists are beginning to pay much closer attention to results. They are looking for more bang for the buck -- not just financially but biologically, too. 
 In recent months, scientists from diverse conservation groups have been meeting to discuss principles and accounting standards for auditing environmental projects. Two of the largest conservation groups, the Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund, are leading the effort, with help from the nonprofit Foundations of Success, which specializes in measuring results. 
 Government agencies and the people and groups that finance the projects are watching closely to see if greater accountability can be achieved. 
Measuring the effects of conservation projects can be bewildering. Biological systems are so complex that complete audits are practically impossible. Conservation also depends on making judgment calls about the effectiveness of political, economic and social strategies.
Still, a consensus is emerging that the environmental movement needs something akin to the generally accepted accounting principles that govern financial reporting. In "The Future of Conservation," a recent article in Foreign Affairs, Dr. Steven Sanderson, president and chief executive of the Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo, called for independent scientific audits of international conservation projects.
Dr. Sanderson said that the audits should include the work of groups like his own and that those audits should be subject to peer review. "If we are honest with ourselves," he said, "we won't do it as well as it could be done independently."
Billions of dollars are spent annually -- some estimates surpass $120 billion -- on protecting ecosystems in the United States alone. The World Bank has overseen about $3 billion in loans and investments for conservation projects in the last decade. But measuring the returns is an inexact science at best.
In September, "The State of the Nation's Ecosystems," a five-year study involving about 150 scientists, fell short by its own admission. About half of the data needed to assess the health of ecosystems was found inadequate for the report, published by the H. John Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment. The scientists hope eventually to fill in the blanks.
But even long-term studies won't answer all the questions about ecosystem health, said Dr. Thomas E. Lovejoy, president of the Heinz Center and an adviser to the World Bank on biodiversity. He directed a study that ran for more than 20 years in the Amazon to learn the effects of forest fragmentation and the minimum critical size of ecosystems.
"The bad news is, we don't know all the answers because the rates of change are slow," Dr. Lovejoy said. "The good news is you're not losing things instantaneously." Conservationists can often stem the loss of species while figuring out how ecosystems function, he said, and that is why measurements of success are important.
Dr. Lovejoy is on the board of Foundations of Success, which grew out of the Biodiversity Support Group, a 10-year project supported by the federal Agency for International Development to improve the effectiveness of conservation.
"As a conservation industry, we have to prove we are effective and achieve what we say we are," said Nick Salafsky, the co-director of Foundations of Success. "If we can't show that, the attention and resources of society will shift to other problems. That recognition and pressure from donors is forcing conservation to wake up and face this issue."
With a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Foundations of Success is working with the Wildlife Conservation Society and Conservation International on a study tracing the history of accounting and impact assessment in fields like business, education and social services, as well as the environment. Deloitte Consulting conducted a similar survey for the Nature Conservancy this year.
"We're latecomers to this game," said Dr. M. A. Sanjayan, a scientist who is leading a Nature Conservancy team that is developing methods for auditing the organization's conservation efforts. Conservation groups rarely rigorously measure success, Dr. Sanjayan said, and they never report failures. 
"You can't get that level of truth from environmental organizations," said Dr. Sanjayan. "There's no industry standard, no Dow Jones." 
One donor in particular prodded the conservancy into examining its results. Two years ago, the conservancy's California office asked Seth Neiman, a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, for a large contribution to help save open space on Mount Hamilton, an island of natural habitat in a sea of encroaching suburbs south of San Jose.
Mr. Neiman asked how the conservancy knew the investment would provide lasting protection for the oak woodlands and the creatures that live there. Mr. Neiman said he was not interested in preserving a piece of land for 30 years. "That would be an act of vanity," he said. "I want to know what we might do as a way to protect an ecosystem for 500 years."
Mr. Neiman asked Dr. Sanjayan: "How do you know you're having an impact? Why should I donate millions of dollars and time if it isn't possible to reach this goal?"
"That stumped me," Dr. Sanjayan said. He told Mr. Neiman he did not have an answer. But maybe with Mr. Neiman's help they could find a way to begin answering the question of whether conservation groups were conserving what they said they were over the long run. 
Mr. Neiman agreed to help underwrite the effort. His company, Crosspoint Ventures, is a limited partnership that has invested more than $2 billion in almost 200 companies. He has watched high-tech start-ups grapple with finding the right measurements for their business performances in recent years.
Measuring results is crucial for honest reporting of financial results, he said, but it is even more vital for management and learning. "In business, you have an unrelenting feedback cycle," he said. "If you don't make a profit, you're dead." 
Mr. Neiman has given the Nature Conservancy about half a million dollars for the auditing project. In the short term, the auditing has meant some painful self-examination for the conservancy, which had revenues of $787 million last year and assets of $2.8 billion. 
The new auditing has been tested at two sites, the Cosumnes River Preserve in California, home to sandhill cranes and salmon on the Sierra Nevada's last wild river, which is increasingly hemmed in by suburbs and vineyards; and Komodo National Park in Indonesia, home of the famous Komodo dragons, as well as coral reefs threatened by fishermen who use cyanide and crude bombs to stun fish.
The audits examine detailed site conservation plans and strategies for countering threats at each site, as well as monitoring threatened species and determining whether managers have the resources to carry out their plans. 
Both audits showed progress was being made toward conserving what the projects set out to save, but the projects had a long way to go to be truly sustainable, especially in Komodo National Park. The conservancy is now road-testing the method by auditing projects across the organization, which has more than 1,400 preserves in 50 states and 28 other countries. 
In the long term, Dr. Sanjayan and Mr. Neiman believe, auditing will result in better returns on the money invested annually, roughly $6.5 billion, in private conservation efforts around the world. If government agencies adopt the methods, it may have an even greater effect.
"If this is done right, it will change the whole discussion about conservation," Mr. Neiman said. "People will start asking, 'What are your results?' "
Julie Packard, the director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium and a board member of her parents' foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, called the move toward auditing exciting.
In recent years, the foundation has given millions to the Nature Conservancy and other groups.
"The organizations need to feel a responsibility not only to the ecosystems they are seeking to protect," Ms. Packard said, "but to donors and investors who are expecting that the lands will be protected as healthy ecosystems in the 500-year time frame. It's a lofty goal. And it's an imperfect science. But it's the right question to be asking."

HEADLINE: Oregon Firm to Design for Museum 

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN

 BODY:
The Museum of Contemporary Arts and Design, formerly known as the American Craft Museum, has chosen an architectural firm from Portland, Ore., to design its new quarters at 2 Columbus Circle, the site of an eccentric nine-story white marble slab of building that has been vacant since 1998.
 Allied Works Architecture, headed by Brad Cloepfil, was chosen from four finalists for a $30 million redesign of the building by the architect Edward Durell Stone and popularly known as the Huntington Hartford building. Other works by Stone include the Museum of Modern Art, the General Motors Building and the Kennedy Center in Washington. The design museum, now on West 53rd Street, hopes to move in after about three years. 
 Museum officials said Mr. Cloepfil, 46, who designed the new Contemporary Art Museum in St. Louis, and is working on an expansion of the Seattle Art Museum, was chosen on the basis of his experience, not on a completed design, which is due in early 2003.
"He has done a number of urban projects that involve reuse and redesign as well as new construction, and they are all done enormously creatively," said Holly Hotchner, director of the museum. "We are redoing a site that has not worked very well, and he will hopefully come up with brilliant solutions, given the constrictions of the site and of our budget."
The redesign of the building, one of the few in New York to occupy its own block, is certain to stir protests among preservationists, who regard it as both an ugly duckling and something of a landmark. The city's Landmarks Preservation Commission has declined several times to put the building on its agenda. When it was first built, it was widely reviled as "a die-cut Venetian palazzo on lollipops," even a turkey. Still, it has since acquired a certain status.
"This is a building that has not had its day in court," said Frank Sanchis, executive director of the Municipal Arts Society. "It has always been a curiosity from the day it went up, and a building for which people have a love-hate relationship. And there is plenty of hate and plenty of love."
Bernard Tschumi, dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, has argued against tampering with the building, particularly its most dominant feature, the lack of windows facing Central Park.
"Either keep the building as a testimony to that period and to that architect, or tear it down and start from scratch," said Mr. Tschumi, who said he declined to be on the panel that selected the architect. "Don't fiddle with a building that has a lot of integrity. You have to make up your mind."
Museum officials said they were looking for changes both to the building's unusual facade, with its famous blank wall edged with portholes and topped by a Venetian-style loggia, and to its interior, which was once an art gallery for a collection assembled by Huntington Hartford, heir to the supermarket fortune.
The building was eventually turned over to the city, which used it as a visitor center and headquarters for the Cultural Affairs Department until four years ago. It was awarded to the Museum of Contemporary Arts and Design last summer.
"This building has never really worked as a great public building," said Laurie Beckelman, director of the museum's new building program. "What we are looking for is a building that is more friendly to the city and a great public museum."
But she said the redesign would necessarily be thorough. "We will use the steel," she said, "and there is a 154-seat theater downstairs that we will use, and we will see what else."
In a telephone interview from Portland, Mr. Cloepfil said he was aiming for a redesign reminiscent of the original. "I think that whether one considers it to be historic or not, it has become an icon for the city because of its location and because of its color," he said. "Respecting its role in the memory of the city is very important."
With the giant AOL Time-Warner building now under construction on the west side of Columbus Circle and the building at 240 Central Park South, across Broadway, recently named a city landmark, the museum on the southern rim is expected to be the next and last piece of the circle's redesign to fall into place.
As city-owned property, it must have an urban land review, which is expected to begin early next year and last up to a year, Ms. Beckelman said.

 Bon Appetit
The bill of fare runs from soup to nuts. But some of the offerings are boiled salmon with lobster sauce, broiled nut steak in vermicelli and pigeon desosse farcie Souvaroff. Pizza and hot dogs are there, too, at the New York Public Library at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, where the free exhibition "New York Eats Out" opens on Friday and continues through March 1. The show consists of 255 menus as well as prints, magazine covers and other items from the library's collection and from other holdings. So there it is, from the heyday of Delmonico's in the mid-19th century through the early 1960's.

Scotch, Imported
In the 19th century, when Glasgow prospered as a center of trade and industry, its emerging affluent class began to collect contemporary French art from local dealers. In time the Kelvingrove Art Gallery there amassed Scotland's pre-eminent public collection of French art. Beginning tomorrow, 65 paintings by artists like Bonnard, Cassatt, Cezanne, Dufy, Gauguin, Matisse, Millet, Monet, Picasso, Pissarro, Sisley and Van Gogh -- many never seen outside Scotland -- will be exhibited at the Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Ky. Continuing through Feb. 2, "Millet to Matisse: 19th- and 20th-Century French Painting From Kelvingrove Art Gallery, Glasgow" will later be seen at the Frick Art and Historical Center in Pittsburgh, the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha and the Kalamazoo Institute of the Arts in Michigan.

With a Twist
The titles recall the heyday of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes: "L'Apres Midi d'un Faune," "Pulcinella," "Bolero" and "Le Spectre de la Rose." But the ballets to be presented by Thierry Malandain in the New York debut of Ballet Biarritz come with a twist. In the program to be performed from 8 tonight through Sunday at the Joyce Theater, these classics have been reinvented with reverence and its opposite.

Salute to Yiddish
In 1892 10 Jewish immigrants in a tenement on Essex Street on the Lower East Side founded an organization chartered in 1900 as the Workmen's Circle, known in Yiddish as the Arbeter Ring. In the ensuing century, it has devoted itself to friendship, mutual aid, social and economic justice and the preservation of Yiddish. At 7:30 p.m. tomorrow at Town Hall, the Workmen's Circle will celebrate its centennial with "Yiddish in America," a concert of music, song and spoken word intended to convey the depth and range of the language. Among the scheduled entertainers are Bruce Adler, Theodore Bikel, Tovah Feldshuh, Sheldon Harnick, Lainie Kazan, the Klezmatics, Mandy Patinkin (above), Joseph Wiseman and labor and Yiddish choirs from New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Toronto.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Jobs Are Exiting Mexico 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH MALKIN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
An exodus of factories the last two years, many of them to China, has led to a wave of soul-searching among business leaders and government officials here over Mexico's ability to compete with other low-cost exporters for the United States market.
 "It's like somebody shaking you and saying, 'Wake up, the environment has changed, and you have to change strategy,' " said Rolando Gonzalez Baron, president of Mexico's National Maquiladora Export Industry Council, which represents the plants that assemble duty-free components for export. The industry sold $77 billion of goods abroad last year, almost half Mexico's total exports. 
 For years, a cheap peso had masked inefficiencies in Mexican manufacturing, including high employee turnover and unwieldy logistics. But since the currency began appreciating in 1999, costs have risen some 30 percent. Now export manufacturers must figure out what Mexico has to offer besides the geographical good fortune of lying next to the rich American consumer market. 
Though the maquiladora industry has stopped hemorrhaging jobs and the peso has slipped about 10 percent the last few months, the volume on the debate rose recently as Mexico played host to the Asia Pacific Economic Conference in the resort town of Cabo San Lucas. Mexican business leaders lobbied officials to crack down on China's investment subsidies, which they say are against World Trade Organization rules and are partly to blame for Mexico's woes.
"I know that China is cheating," Mr. Gonzalez said. "Eventually, they are going to be in trouble if they keep cheating and don't do anything to improve. They will be sanctioned in the future."
President Jiang Zemin of China responded to the accusations of protectionist policies at the APEC meeting last month. "We are putting aside the obstacles," he told business leaders.
Mr. Gonzalez and other manufacturing executives acknowledge that Mexico's problems competing with China go much deeper. Along with low labor costs and rising productivity, China offers foreign investors a sophisticated base of suppliers, tax breaks, well-trained engineers and managers and efficient ports.
In Mexico, businesses complain about high taxes and crime, red tape, transportation tie-ups at the congested border, poor infrastructure and a shortage of skilled technical workers and managers. To stay competitive, Mexico will need to develop its strengths, including its ability to provide just-in-time delivery to United States factories and retailers.
Mexico can no longer compete on low wages alone. Mexican wages for workers in the maquiladora sector range from about $2 to $2.50 an hour, including many benefits and labor taxes. Figures on Chinese labor costs are less reliable, but they range from 35 cents to as much as $1 an hour if all benefits and taxes are paid.
Historically, "Mexico has chosen to compete on labor costs, but because of that, it hasn't made the transition to more productivity-based industrial development," said Richard N. Sinkin, managing director at the InterAmerican Holdings Company, a San Diego consulting and investment firm that focuses on manufacturing in Mexico.
The maquiladora industry lost 287,000 jobs from its October 2000 peak, a 21 percent drop, to its low point in March.
The economic slowdown in the United States and a strong peso accounted for some of the loss. In addition, the Mexican government was slow to resolve confusion over new duties on Asian components and the tax status of the maquiladora plants.
Since the spring, the industry has added a few new jobs, as the peso has slipped and demand from the United States has improved, but the pace is sluggish for an industry that was the most dynamic in the late 1990's.
Some government officials say they are happy to see low-wage and low-technology jobs go elsewhere. But Jorge Carrillo, a social scientist at the College of the Northern Border in Tijuana, thinks that is misguided. "Sometimes you hear these pronouncements, 'We want only high-tech.' These comments don't understand the path of industrialization."
Mr. Carrillo pointed to the Delphi Corporation's research and development center in Ciudad Juarez, a border city, where the auto parts company also employs thousands of workers in assembly plants. "There can't be a Delphi Technical Center if there isn't a manufacturing center first," he said.
Electronics is the industry that has suffered most. Government figures show production shrank 8.8 percent last year.
The Dutch giant Royal Philips Electronics has just shut its PC monitor plant in Ciudad Juarez, putting 900 people out of work. The work went to an existing plant in Suzhou, China, where Philips says it has a competitive supplier base. And in the spring, the Tokyo-based Canon Inc. shut down a 13-year-old ink-jet printer factory in Tijuana that at one point employed 700 people. The work moved to Thailand and Vietnam.
To stay competitive, the industry will have to promote research and development, so that it can offer tailor-made products, said Federico Lepe, executive vice president for the electronics industry chamber of commerce in Guadalajara.
The outlook is far from entirely grim for Mexico. Manufacturers of bulky items will stay in Mexico, since trans-Pacific shipping costs add a lot to their final price. And Mexico is continuing to evolve as an important element of an integrated North American manufacturing economy.
Last month, the Maytag Corporation announced it was shutting down its refrigerator plant in Galesburg, Ill., and moving the work to the Mexican border city of Reynosa. In September, Toyota Motor said it would expand the Tijuana plant it is building to produce Tacoma truck beds and also assemble the truck there.
The auto industry, which accounts for nearly 15 percent of Mexico's gross domestic product, is well-positioned to weather Asian competition. The industry works on a just-in-time basis, with suppliers continually delivering to the assembly plant on a tight schedule. That is hard to manage across an ocean.
Similarly, retailers that require just-in-time delivery will help Mexico keep its factories. Sanyo makes 5.5 million television sets a year, mostly for Wal-Mart Stores, dividing production between Tijuana and Forest City, Ark.
To attract more manufacturing, investors tick off lists of needed reforms, beginning with education. The average number of years of education of the Mexican work force is just eight.
"For each dollar of gross domestic product, the Chinese invest 10 times what we do in sending people to study for M.B.A.'s and master's degrees in engineering in the United States or Britain," said Carlos Mancera, a partner at Valora Consulting, an educational consulting firm here.
Mexico's high crime rate is another problem. Companies also complain that Mexico's taxes are too high and its labor laws too rigid.
But fixing those problems is such a huge undertaking that few expect to see improvements soon. "Cleaning up corruption, more transparency in the court system, a simplified tax code, vastly improved education," Mr. Sinkin, the consultant, said with more than a touch of irony. "Put all that together, and you've got a winning strategy."

Credit Card Bills To Give You Heartburn
How much was that bag of crackers from the minibar again? More than 25,000 people who stayed at Holiday Inns or Crowne Plaza hotels from Oct. 24 to Oct. 27 could be getting big surprises when they look at their hotel charges on their credit card statements. 
 It seems that First Horizon Merchant Services, which processes credit card bills for the hotels, had a slight decimal-point problem in its processing. A hotel bill of $250, for example, was charged as $25,000. Six Continents Hotels, which owns the affected brands, has set up a 24-hour toll-free line for aggrieved customers: (800) 621-0555, Operator 28. 
 In addition to having their bills adjusted, "adversely affected guests will receive two complimentary nights at any Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn or Holiday Inn Express Hotel," Six Continents said in a statement.

Air Fares Are Expected To Rise Next Year
You have to admire anybody with the nerve these days to make projections on air travel. So let's hear it for Eclipse Advisors, which is boldly predicting a 4 to 8 percent increase next year in the prices companies pay for air fares. 
Eclipse, the purchasing technology division of the travel-management company Rosenbluth International, made its 2003 forecast based on calculations that airlines have learned painful lessons about revenue, if nothing else, this year. 
In a new forecast issued as corporate travel managers and their airline suppliers work out preferred-supplier contracts for next year, Eclipse says that fares for business fliers will increase because airlines are adapting to new realities like the wholesale shift to discount nonrefundable fares by business travelers. Fewer overall flights, draconian restrictions on those nonrefundable tickets, and a crackdown on underperforming corporate contracts will enable airlines to regain at least some revenue initiative out of the business travel market, Eclipse said. 
On the other hand, international air fares appear to be headed for a decrease of 5 percent to 8 percent, as airlines, especially on trans-Atlantic routes where business is really sagging, drop economy-fare prices to fill up planes. 
Meanwhile, for high-end business travelers, next year will also be a better time for staying at a posh hotel. Citing a buyer's market in upscale and full-service hotel brands, Eclipse projects an overall decrease of 5 to 10 percent in hotel rates paid by corporations. San Francisco, Boston, New York and Washington all will remain sluggish. But demand in New Orleans, Miami and Orlando, Fla., may pick up as meetings and conventions that otherwise might have gone overseas hold events closer to home, Eclipse said. 
The National Business Travel Association is also staring into its crystal ball and seeing higher prices. In its 2003 business-travel cost forecast, the trade group predicts an overall increase of 5 percent in business-travel costs. 
Air fares will rise 7 percent, to $1,179 for the average round-trip business fare; hotels and rental cars will cost 2 percent more, the study said. 
Compared with 2000 and other peak business-travel years, these increases are relatively small, especially as low-fare airlines have muscled into the corporate-contract market. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Meet the New Loopholes

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Tomorrow the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, otherwise known as McCain-Feingold, will go into effect. After years of debate, soft money, the unrestricted contributions raised and spent by political parties and interest groups, will finally be regulated.
 But it won't change much. People will find ways to get around the new law. Substantial sums will continue to rush into the American political system -- the money will just enter through different routes. Incumbents, whose fund-raising advantage the law was meant to curtail, will likely do better than ever under the new rules. In short, the world of campaign finance will stay pretty much the same. Here's why: 
 Soft money will stay in politics. Had the campaign reform act not become law, we estimate, based on past trends, that the political parties would have raised about $680 million in soft money in the next election cycle. That much money cannot be forced out of the political system. It will show up during the next election in new and different ways.
The new law will allow state and local party soft money fund-raising for purposes of generic voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts. Federal officials may attend and speak at fund-raising events where state and local parties raise those funds. National political leaders may also raise money without limit for nonprofits if the money does not finance national political activities. Those permitted activities will allow a member of Congress, for example, to raise money for the general fund of a group, arguably freeing up other money for the nonprofit's more overtly political work, like voter registration and political ads. Though it's not clear how much money a group will be able to dip into for political purposes, the flow of money to campaigns will surely remain abundant.
Although the new law specifically forbids soft money fund-raising by party affiliates, partisan activists are setting up substitute party organizations to raise and spend soft money. The new organizations must be established before Nov. 6 and they must avoid all affiliation with the parties, but they don't have to do much more than that. Democratic Party leaders expect one of these groups, the Democratic State Party Organization, to raise $40 million in soft money by the next election. Republican activists are following suit with groups like the Leadership Forum. Based on recent trends, the Republican groups might be expected to raise about $60 million in soft money in the next cycle.
Interest groups will grow richer and more powerful. McCain-Feingold allows interest groups to raise as much money as they wish. "The law actually will help us," Stephen Moore, president of the Club for Growth, told The Washington Post, adding that people and corporations that used to give to the Republican Party will now give to his organization, which promotes free market economics. Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, has said that she expects to benefit similarly from those sympathetic to Democrats. Interest groups will try to use the funds raised to do what the political parties can no longer do: run advertising paid for by soft money that supports causes and, indirectly, candidates.
The person with the most lawyers wins. Interest groups will have to be careful when they jump into the fray. The government may regulate ads that are coordinated with election campaigns or ads that directly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. In both cases, the money for the ad must be raised under federal contribution limits. In other words, no soft money can be used. Conversely, if a group running ads is independent of a campaign or if its ads comment on issues, the First Amendment frees it from government regulation. Interest groups promise that they will act independently when they run issue ads. Expect their virtue to be questioned. Also expect the terms "coordination" and "express advocacy" to emerge as full-blown buzzwords in the next election cycle.
Individuals will be dragged into court, accused of coordinating their work with a party or candidate. Lawyers and lawsuits will play an ever-larger role in our elections. Grass-roots groups that lack the money to purchase legal advice will be compelled to steer clear of elections.
Under the new law, ads that mention (or "expressly advocate") a candidate and are paid for with soft money cannot be broadcast 60 days prior to an election. As a result, interest groups will try different strategies to get their ads on the air. The courts will be forced to define what it means to mention a candidate. A smart election lawyer will rise to fame by figuring out how to allude to candidates without mentioning them.
Strong incumbents get stronger. The world is already pretty good for incumbents. They enjoy a 98 percent re-election rate. Their districts have become ever safer, thanks to increasingly sophisticated gerrymandering. Absent soft money, their prospects of re-election will grow even brighter.
Whatever its disadvantages, soft money sometimes financed challengers and provided information through advertising to voters. Under the campaign finance law's constraints, more resources will go to compliance and finding loopholes and fewer will go to challengers and the dissemination of information.
The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act will certainly change American politics, but probably not for the better. Elections will be less competitive, interest groups will become wealthier and our political system will become increasingly tied up in the courts. That doesn't sound like the world reformers aimed to create.

HEADLINE: Turkey Is Calm as Victorious Party Leader Promises Moderation 

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
There was no hint of panic here today over the sweep of the nation's elections on Sunday by a party with a strong Islamic identity, but rather polite talk from all quarters about not rushing to judge Turkey's new leaders.
 The financial markets rose, as did the Turkish lira against the dollar, apparently soothed by early statements from the party's leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who crisply announced that his first priority was speeding up talks to join the European Union. 
 In victory speeches and interviews, he talked about keeping strong ties to the United States and said he could support war against a fellow Muslim nation, Iraq, under certain circumstances.
Even his new official rival, Deniz Baykal, leader of the one other party to win a place in Parliament on Sunday, declined today to call Mr. Erdogan a threat to Turkey's closely guarded secularism. 
"Such accusations would put the country into distress," said Mr. Baykal, leader of the Republican People's Party, the new opposition in Parliament. "We have to act in good faith. But I will retain caution. The whole world will be watching developments very carefully."
Indeed, businessmen, diplomats and Western leaders all said the Justice and Development Party would have to prove its commitment to the moderate, secular and pro-Western platform on which it campaigned. 
The issue is an immediate one, as the European Union will move next month to decide whether to start formal talks about Turkish membership and the United States is pondering an attack on Iraq.
Political analysts say Turkey's 40 million voters did not pick Mr. Erdogan for his Islamic credentials. Voters appeared to be protesting against incumbents who had presided over a bad economy and rife corruption. Mr. Erdogan, a powerful speaker with magnetism and drive, won high marks for his performance as mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998.
They also say he probably benefited from a backlash against the overt drive to exclude him from power. In September he was barred from running for a seat in Parliament because of a conviction in 1997 for reciting a poem that a court said incited religious hatred.
The ban that keeps him from holding office is still in place, raising questions over who will actually wield power. Party leaders will meet on Tuesday to discuss whom to nominate as prime minister.
Mr. Erdogan has said nothing on the question, but the Turkish press has circulated three names: Abdullah Gul, Mr. Erdogan's deputy, considered a Western-leaning moderate; Vecdi Gonul, a former police and court administrator who is a friend of President Ahmet Necdet Sezer; and Abdulkadir Aksu, a former interior minister.
"Everybody is sort of watching and waiting to see how this will move," said one Western diplomat in the capital, Ankara. "There is the question of their leaning: are they going to do Islamist things? But the indications that I have seen is that they are going to try to do political reform to stay in power."
Mr. Erdogan, 48, and his party won more than 34 percent of the vote in the elections on Sunday -- enough under Turkey's election law to allow it to form a government on its own.
But much suspicion remains. He and many party leaders belonged to the Welfare Party, the first Islamic party to hold power in Turkey. The army nudged it from office in 1997, and Mr. Erdogan has since disavowed Islam as part of politics or government.
Today he dismissed any speculation that the army -- which has been silent on Mr. Erdogan and views itself as the fail-safe protector of Turkish democracy -- would have reason for concern. "This army is our army," he said. "Nothing should come between us and them."
European leaders said that they welcomed the victory of Mr. Erdogan's party and that its platform gave no immediate reason for alarm. "There is clearly a will to pursue rapprochement with the European Union," said Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief. "We will have to judge the next Turkish government by its acts."
Even before this election, there were questions about whether the European Union would ever accept Turkey, with concerns ranging from human rights to the stresses already placed on the union as it looks to expand by 10 new members. 
An issue rarely mentioned in public is whether the group is eager to accept a Muslim nation with more than 60 million people, and some experts wonder if it will be even less inclined to do so if Turkey is headed by a government with strong Islamic roots.
Hasan Unal, a professor in the department of international relations at Bilkent University in Ankara, said the European Union could offer Mr. Erdogan and his party protection. It will demand assurances of Turkey's commitment to democracy, he said, a case that will not be helped if the army ever moves against Mr. Erdogan and his party.
"They believe that Turkey's connection to the European Union would be the best way of easing the military pressure on them," he said.

HEADLINE: China and Neighbors Move Ahead on Trade and Island Issues 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
Southeast Asian nations, meeting in Cambodia, worked today toward a series of agreements with their giant neighbor, China, whose expanding economy poses one of the region's major challenges.
 Addressing a potential flash point that has festered for years, the countries signed an agreement with China aimed at avoiding conflicts over disputed islands in the South China Sea, primarily the Spratlys. 
 The various groups of small islands, some with possible deep-sea oil deposits, are claimed in part by six nations and have been the site of periodic armed skirmishes.
The agreement today was marked by compromises on both the Chinese and Southeast Asian sides. It evaded difficult specifics, but was seen as a sign of progress in normalizing relations in a number of areas. 
"It signals a new level of trust," said the Chinese deputy foreign minister, Wang Yi.
The Southeast Asian nations, at their annual summit meeting held this year in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, also agreed today to work toward a free trade pact with China, whose economy has been expanding at their expense.
The regional grouping, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, includes Cambodia, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar, formerly Burma.
The 10 nations, with a combined population of more than 500 million, offer an inviting region for Chinese trade. But they have also been losing much of their industry to China, where labor is cheaper.
Analysts said the Southeast Asian nations had little choice but to enter into the agreements with China because of its economic and military power.
"We are fully conscious that China is a superpower," said a senior official with Cambodia's Ministry of the Environment. "Maintaining economic ties with it is very important."
In another area of potential cooperation and conflict, China and the leaders of five other Asian nations endorsed major development plans along the Mekong River.
China has begun a series of dam projects on the river that could disrupt the ecology and the economies of downstream nations, particularly Cambodia and Vietnam.
"Everyone is afraid to stand up to China in this region," said Aviva Imhof of the United States-based International Rivers Network, which has criticized development projects.
The so-called Greater Mekong Subregion includes Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar and the southern Chinese province of Yunnan.
Prime Minster Hun Sen of Cambodia alluded to potential development problems, saying: "We see the signs of such stress in erosion, siltation and changes in water currents. For the sake of our common futures we must implement a Mekong management strategy that ensures sustainability."
The other major issue discussed at the three-day meeting was terrorism, which has become an increasing worry for Southeast Asia, particularly after the bombing last month on the Indonesian island of Bali.
The region is worried not only about potential attacks but also about their effect on tourism, which is a major enterprise for a number of the countries.
They agreed today to take joint action to prevent attacks by militants and to try to assure visitors that they would be safe. 
Western governments have issued a number of travel warnings recently. "True, they were a reminder for people to be cautious, but one should not jeopardize the good image of the entire region," Mr. Hun Sen said.
The gathering in Phnom Penh amounted to a coming of age for Cambodia, which in the last five years has begun moving away from decades of war and mass killings. 
Many of the capital's rutted streets were paved for the occasion and adorned for the first time with traffic lights, a gift from China.
A government spokesman said the greatest challenge in preparing for the summit meeting was to provide "presidential suites" in hotels for visiting leaders. Until now, there were only three such luxury accommodations in the city.

Investors Buy $1.5 Billion Of California Power Bonds

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Individual investors nationwide snapped up $1.5 billion of high-yielding $12 billion power bonds from California in a two-day order period ended yesterday, the underwriter, J. P. Morgan, said. 
 California began selling $6.3 billion of tax-free, fixed-rate bonds in the latest part of an $11.95 billion bond that will raise cash and repay money borrowed to buy emergency supplies of electricity during the energy crisis that began in 2000. Yesterday's sale came on the heels of a $4.25 billion variable-rate power bond sold in late October. 
 A syndicate of debt underwriters led by J. P. Morgan Securities priced the deal on Friday with a top yield of 5.45 percent for uninsured bonds that mature in 2022. The fixed-rate, tax-exempt bonds were split up as a $2.7 billion uninsured portion and a $3.6 billion insured segment. The offering was issued as a revenue bond by the Water Resources Department. Electricity users in California have been paying a fee tacked onto their utility bills that will be used to make interest and principal payments. The insured bonds, which are rated triple-A, carried a maximum yield of 4.61 percent for paper due in 2018. 
In the Treasury market, prices fell yesterday as a surge in stocks tempted investors to dump safe-haven debt.
The price on the Treasury's 10-year note fell 10/32, to 102 21/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.04 percent, from 4 percent on Friday, in early afternoon trading. 
The price on the 30-year bond fell 9/32, to 104 24/32 Its yield rose to 5.06 percent from 5.04 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Former Hostage Taker Now Likes to Take On the Mullahs 

BYLINE:  By NAZILA FATHI 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
Sitting at the head of a small table at the office of the daily Hambastegi, Muhammad Ibrahim Asgharzadeh scribbles notes and listens carefully to suggestions for increasing circulation of the paper, the voice of his reformist Solidarity Party. "We have to transform the newspaper," he told editors, circling the word "modernize" in his notes. 
 Mr. Asgharzadeh's politics have come a long way from the militant Muslim activism he subscribed to 23 years ago when he and two other students organized an assault on the American Embassy in Tehran, taking dozens of diplomats hostage for 444 days. 
 Mr. Asgharzadeh, 47, is reminded of the attacks at this time every year when the Nov. 4 anniversary brings a flood of speaking invitations from universities and hard-line groups. These days, his answer is always no. 
"They expect me to denounce America and encourage burning the U.S. flag," Mr. Asgharzadeh said. "I made the mistake of climbing over that wall only once," he added. 
The three leaders of the embassy takeover -- Mr. Asgharzadeh, Mohsen Mirdamadi and Habibollah Bitaraf -- were university students in Tehran in late October 1979, when they met to plan the operation. Today, Mr. Asgharzadeh, along with his former compatriots, is a changed man. As the secretary general of the Solidarity Party -- which advocates more political and social freedom -- he is a strong supporter of President Mohammad Khatami and is a member of the Tehran municipal council. Mr. Mirdamadi is a member of Parliament and Mr. Bitaraf is President Khatami's minister of power. All three consider themselves political reformers. 
Mr. Asgharzadeh, an advocate of democracy and improved relations with the United Sates, has shaved the beard he wore after his student days and has developed a taste for well-tailored suits. He frequently cracks self-deprecating jokes about his past as a hostage taker. But his often bitter words against the current government have made him a target of hard-line religious leaders. 
That was not the case in 1979, when the leader of Iran's Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, gave his blessing to the hostage plan just minutes after the embassy was taken. The three student leaders, and others who joined them during the 444-day occupation, won high-ranking government posts during the first decade after the revolution.
From 1982 to 1988, Mr. Asgharzadeh worked closely with Mr. Khatami, who then headed the official Keyhan newspaper and later became the minister of culture and Islamic guidance. He served as a military commander in the war with Iraq for six months, and was a member of Parliament from 1988 to 1992.
It was after 1988 that Mr. Asgharzadeh began voicing his opposition to the clerics' policies. "The war had ended, the new government of President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani wanted to reconstruct the country and people wanted a more open system," he said. "It was time for political development in order to avoid the erosion of the system. We could not continue a closed economic system and hostility toward the West." 
As a member of Parliament, Mr. Asgharzadeh made fiery speeches advocating greater political freedoms and democracy. But in 1992 his outspokenness finally provoked the conservative Guardian Council into barring him from running for most elected posts and sentencing him to a month in solitary confinement. Such outspokenness remains dangerous in Iran, as was confirmed by the arrest today of Abbas Abdi, another former hostage taker who is also now a leading reformist politician.
Mr. Asgharzadeh, who had spent more than 10 years training to be an engineer, quit the field after his release from prison in 1992. He returned to school, studying political science at Tehran University, where he is working on a doctorate. In 1996, he helped set up the reform movement that led to the election of Mr. Khatami a year later, and he ran for municipal council, the only post where elections are not screened by the Guardian Council. 
Local councils, he said, are a good place to start grass-roots democracy and to expand citizens' rights. "The government has no choice but to give in to the distribution of power if local councils and nongovernmental organizations manage to function independently." 
But the task is not easy, even on a municipal level. Mr. Asgharzadeh, ever the rebel, has taken on what he calls the construction "mafia," a group that he argues dictates most policies in the Tehran municipal government. Even the mayor, who is appointed by the municipal council, serves the interests of that group, which is composed of the nouveau-riche children of Iran's clerical elite, Mr. Asgharzadeh said.
Last year, for example, the mayor banned construction in the affluent northern neighborhood of Tehran, but not until after some of those so-called mafia builders had been granted extensive construction permits for the area. The mayor, Hassan Malek Madani, said the aim was to divert construction to the south of Tehran, which is not as developed as the north. But the ban led to a sharp increase in the price of housing in northern Tehran, doubling the value of buildings owned by the group Mr. Asgharzadeh is battling. 
Mr. Asgharzadeh is a critic, too, of the reform movement, particularly of the meager pace of change it has achieved. He has also questioned President Khatami's handling of foreign affairs. The Foreign Ministry, he said, lost an opportunity to mend relations with the United States in March 2000, when the secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, acknowledged American errors in its dealings with Iran, including Washington's support for a coup in 1953. 
Still, Mr. Asgharzadeh's reputation as an organizer of the embassy siege continues to haunt his political career. At a campaign speech in 2001, he was asked if he could ever justify climbing over the wall of a place that did not belong to him. The questioner was referring to the embassy attack. He tried to explain his actions, he said, telling the students how America had interfered, with disastrous results, in Iran's affairs. But the students did not buy it. 
Mr. Asgharzadeh said last week that even his own 16-year-old son, Muhammad Ali, is critical of the 1979 action, saying it radicalized the country and helped cause the eight-year war with Iraq.
While Mr. Asgharzadeh acknowledged that the attack on the embassy probably altered the path of history, he said that was never his intention. "We only wanted to be more creative and show our symbolic protest to America's interference in Iran's politics for 48 hours," he said. "But things got out of our control."

HEADLINE: Departing Chief Says the I.R.S. Is Losing Its War on Tax Cheats 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
Preparing to step down tomorrow after five years, the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, Charles O. Rossotti, says the agency is steadily losing the war with tax cheats, especially the wealthiest and most sophisticated among them.
 The Bush administration, which has yet to name a replacement for Mr. Rossotti, recognizes that tax cheating is widespread but says the I.R.S. is getting the right amount of money in its budget. And the administration stopped Mr. Rossotti from speaking his mind to Congress, according to three senior I.R.S. officials. 
 The officials said the oversight subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee was to have held its first hearing on sophisticated tax cheats on Oct. 1. But the hearing was called off at the request of Mr. Rossotti, who the officials said had been ordered by the Bush administration not to testify about his views that the I.R.S. cannot adequately enforce the law without annual budget increases that keep pace with the growing number of tax returns and the increasing sophistication of tax cheats. 
Asked whether he had been muzzled, Mr. Rossotti, who had won wide praise in tax circles for bringing a culture of candor to the I.R.S., refused to comment. Asked why, he said, "I am still a member of this administration."
But Mr. Rossotti expressed his concerns in an interview. "The tax system continues to grow in complexity, while the resource base of the I.R.S. is not growing and in real terms is shrinking," he said. "Basically, demands and resources are going in the opposite direction."
"This is systematically undermining one of the most important foundations of the American economy," he said.
In a report to a civilian oversight board created by Congress in 1998, Mr. Rossotti made his point with numbers that became public the day before the hearing was canceled.
The great majority of major tax cheats, in some categories four of five, will be allowed to get away without paying their full share because the I.R.S. lacks the money to enforce the law, Mr. Rossotti wrote.
Over all, the I.R.S. gets a budget of 41 cents per tax return, 10 percent less, after adjusting for inflation, than in 1997. Yet during those five years many sophisticated new techniques to evade taxes have come onto the market, sold by the nation's largest accounting firms and others. And Congress has enacted 293 changes in the tax law, imposed complex rules protecting taxpayer rights and demanded the diversion of many law enforcement resources to functions like answering telephone calls from taxpayers. 
David Hariton, a corporate tax lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell, said tax avoidance has become so sophisticated that "the government needs to devote 10 times as many resources as it does now if it wants to tax capital effectively." 
He said the additional spending would bring in many tens of dollars of tax for each dollar spent on law enforcement.
Because most I.R.S. resources are devoted to routine work like processing tax returns, the 10 percent reduction has meant a 28 percent decline in money for audits, investigations and collections, Mr. Rossotti wrote to the board.
"The I.R.S. is simply outnumbered," he wrote. 
He said the I.R.S. needs to work 13.3 million cases in which documents, primarily from partnerships and similar entities that are used mostly by wealthy investors, do not match up with reports on individual tax returns. But the agency has the resources to pursue only a fifth of these cases.
In his report to the oversight board, Mr. Rossotti put the tax loss from that area alone at $7 billion annually. But in earlier reports to Congress the I.R.S. has used figures that could put the tax loss as high as $64 billion. Mr. Rossotti has said that every fifth dollar of partnership income is not showing up on tax returns. 
He said the I.R.S. had also identified 82,100 taxpayers who used offshore accounts to evade taxes, but could pursue only 17,000 of them. He estimated the annual tax loss at $447 million, or less than $7,000 for each taxpayer, a modest figure when compared with his previous estimates of multibillion dollar losses. Jack Blum, an I.R.S. consultant, has estimated that offshore evasion alone costs the government $70 billion annually.
To close the law enforcement gap this year, Mr. Rossotti said, the I.R.S. needs $1.9 billion -- an increase of 51 percent for its enforcement budget -- and authority to hire 29,306 more people, on top of the 48,000 it already has in compliance and enforcement.
In addition, he wrote, at a bare minimum the agency needs a 2 percent increase, above inflation, each year just to keep pace with growth in the tax system.
News reports about what Mr. Rossotti wrote to the oversight board infuriated officials in the Office of Management and Budget, who insisted he make no other public comments contrary to the administration's view that the I.R.S. budget is adequate and that he say nothing about future budgets, according to senior I.R.S. officials. 
The I.R.S. is getting a 4.8 percent increase in its law enforcement budget, to $3.7 billion, this year, Mitchell B. Daniels Jr., director of the Office of Management and Budget, wrote last month to Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Senator Baucus had written Mr. Daniels in September asking whether the I.R.S. had enough money to enforce the law.
Mr. Daniels wrote: "I am confident that these resources," together with tax simplification and other reforms being studied by the Treasury Department, "will allow the I.R.S. to effectively attack the serious noncompliance problems Treasury has identified." 
Former commissioners, retired I.R.S. executives and others who work closely with the agency say it needs a large infusion of money for law enforcement to reverse the wave of tax cheating, which, they warn, will only grow, especially among corporations and high-income individuals, so long as law enforcement is weak.
One recently retired I.R.S. senior executive, who said his new employer would not allow him to be identified in an article, said "the I.R.S. does not need another $100 million, it needs 2 or 3 billion more."
Dennis Crawford, who retired this fall as acting chief of criminal investigation, agreed that the agency was letting too many tax cheats get away for lack of resources to pursue them, but said a sudden and huge budget increase would be wasted.
"The I.R.S. doesn't have the capacity to handle a $2 billion budget increase," he said. Rather, he said, it needs steady and significant increases to build its capacity until it is sufficient to deter tax cheats.
Five current and recently retired criminal investigators, in interviews this year, described solid cases against major tax cheats that were not being pursued for lack of money. 
One of these agents, describing a citizen who uses offshore accounts to cheat the government out of more than a million dollars, said he was appalled that not only was no criminal charge being brought, but the citizen was not even being pursued civilly just to pay the taxes.
Mr. Rossotti, 61, left a successful career as chief executive of a technology and management company in 1997 to try to fix the I.R.S.
When he arrived he was widely expected to focus on the agency's antiquated computers, some of which were bought during the Kennedy administration.
But Mr. Rossotti said that in the six months that he had to study the agency before taking charge he came to realize that its management structure was even more troubled than its antiquated technology.
Two former commissioners praised Mr. Rossotti for addressing management problems effectively, but faulted him for being slow to recognize the collapse of law enforcement.
"He's done well under difficult circumstances," said Donald C. Alexander, the Nixon administration tax commissioner. "I just wish he had spent more money on revenue agents and less on consultants."
Mr. Rossotti spent more than $200 million on advice from the Booz Allen Hamilton consulting firm to reorganize the I.R.S. around four types of taxpayers -- large and medium-size corporations, small businesses and the self employed, wage-earning individuals and tax-exempt entities. This eliminated the old system, which was based on geography.
Mr. Rossotti also improved a variety of management reports and refocused his dwindling audit staff on new kinds of cheating that were proliferating.
Sheldon Cohen, the Johnson administration commissioner, said he was delighted that Mr. Rossotti had begun to address the collapse of tax law enforcement, however belatedly.
Mr. Alexander said that "Rossotti has this survey showing everyone loves the I.R.S. now and everyone hated it five years ago."
"The reason the I.R.S. was hated in 1997 and 1998 was that the Senate held those hearings to blast the I.R.S. and most of the media went right along with it," Mr. Alexander said. "Rossotti placated Congress very well when they were in that idiot mood in 1997 and 1998, but he should have shifted much more quickly into addressing cheating, which he started on 18 months later than he should have."
As for Mr. Rossotti's replacement, Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, said, "When there is a decision by the president as to who he wishes to nominate there will be an announcement."
In the meantime, Mr. Rossotti's deputy, Bob Wenzel, will be acting commissioner.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In Portland; 
The Image May Be in Timber and Paper, but the Jobs Are in Electronics

BYLINE:  By MARK A. STEIN 

 BODY:
Portland, Ore., still carries the image of a timber town or a place where Nike churns out designs for athletic shoes, but the city's biggest source of economic growth is electronics manufacturing.
 Almost 1,700 high-technology companies, most of them semiconductor makers, are clustered around the city and account for 36 percent of factory jobs -- three times as many as the wood and paper industries combined. The biggest local private employer, with 15,000 jobs, is Intel, which makes its Pentium microprocessors on seven campuses in the area. 
 Lots of pure water and cheap power are the main attractions for technology companies, as well as Portland's nearness to Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle but without their congestion. The port of Portland -- by volume the third-largest on the West Coast after Los Angeles and Long Beach, Calif. -- is another advantage. 
The biggest companies with their headquarters in Portland are the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation and Nike.

AIRPORT
PORTLAND INTERNATIONAL, which is close to downtown and served by a new light-rail line, has all the benefits and drawbacks of a regional airport. Gates are a short walk from the curb, lines are usually short and security is generally problem-free. But because it is not an airline hub, relatively few nonstop flights to cities east of the Rocky Mountains begin or end at PDX.
Delta Air Lines closed its Asian hub in Portland in March 2001, but Lufthansa just announced that it would open its own hub there next spring, offering nonstop service to Frankfurt. The airlines with the most service to Portland are Alaska, United, Southwest and Horizon.
The MAX trolley from the airport to the city center costs $1.55 one way and takes about 40 minutes. A taxi costs about $20.

HOTELS
The BENSON HOTEL (503-228-2000, $91 to $265) was built in 1912 by Simon Benson, a local timber baron, and has been impressing people ever since with its lobby paneled in Circassian walnut imported from the forests of Imperial Russia. It has three private dining rooms and meeting rooms that can accommodate as many as 600 people each. Each room has a two-line phone with an Internet link. "The rooms are kind of small, but the lobby is great," said Kristin Axelrad, a former sales representative for Pendleton Woolen Mills Inc., a privately held blankets and sportswear company in Portland.
Equally grand is the GOVERNOR HOTEL (503-224-3400, $165 to $500), which opened in 1909, and has a health club and an indoor pool in its west wing. For boutique lodgings, there is the modestly priced LUCIA (503-225-1717, $90 to $155). "It's right downtown, it's small, and it's very nice," said Gert Boyle, chairwoman of the Columbia Sportswear Company.

RESTAURANTS
The PORTLAND STEAK AND CHOPHOUSE (503-223-6200, $100 for dinner for two with wine and tip) in the lobby of the Multnomah Hotel (part of the Embassy Suites chain), and the PORTLAND CITY GRILL (503-450-0030, $110) atop the Unico US Bank tower jostle for honors as the local home of beefy Northwestern cuisine.
JAKE'S FAMOUS CRAWFISH (503-226-1419, $110) has been around for more than a century, and the seafood menu has not changed much in that time: grilled local salmon, iced local oysters and creamy clam chowder.
Many local executives take visitors to LUCY'S TABLE (503-226-6126, $95). The room is understated, the service is attentive and the location is convenient. "You can practically walk there from downtown," Ms. Boyle said.

ENTERTAINMENT
JAZZ DE OPUS (503-222-6077) in northwest Portland is a local institution and looks the part, with dark wood paneling, Tiffany-style lamps and photos of jazz legends on the walls.
Local blues players play at the TILLICUM CLUB (503-292-1835), a hole-in-the-wall in southwest Portland that has music five nights a week and good, cheap bar food.
HARVEY'S COMEDY CLUB (503-241-0338) in northwest Portland has shows every night except Monday and two shows a night on Friday and Saturday.
"Portland is not Manhattan," said Ms. Axelrad, a New Yorker, "but there are lots of things to do."

ON YOUR OWN
The PORTLAND CLASSICAL CHINESE GARDEN (503-228-8131) is a downtown oasis based on a garden in Suzhou, China, built during the Ming Dynasty (A.D. 1368-1644). On a city block near the Columbia River, the garden has an artificial lake, Chinese trees and shrubs and buildings constructed by Chinese craftsmen.
Through the end of this year, the PORTLAND ART MUSEUM (503-226-2811) has shows on Grandma Moses and the UBS PaineWebber Collection of contemporary art. The UBS collection includes works by Damien Hirst, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Susan Rothenberg, Edward Ruscha and Julian Schnabel and Cy Twombly.
On Saturdays (and Sundays), the PORTLAND SATURDAY MARKET convenes under the Burnside Bridge in Old Town.

LOCAL BUSINESS LORE
The Securities and Exchange Commission found that Flir Systems, a Portland company that makes night-vision equipment, inflated its revenue in 1998 and 1999 with fictitious sales and by booking expenses as assets. Three executives settled civil cases last month; a fourth is contesting the accusations and a fifth is still under investigation.

This feature about places to stay, eat and visit in leading business destinations appears every Tuesday.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE CONDUCT: THE CHAIRMAN; 
Webster's Public Service Image Not Duplicated in Private Sector

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
As a public servant, William H. Webster has an impeccable resume.
 Mr. Webster, who last week became the head of a new government board that will oversee the accounting industry, is the only person to have served as the director of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency. He has received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a special medal from the American Bar Association for outstanding leadership. 
 But outside Washington, Mr. Webster's record is less than perfect. Since he retired from the C.I.A. 11 years ago to build a lucrative second career as a corporate lawyer, Mr. Webster has repeatedly taken positions that critics say have been at odds with his reputation.
A lawyer who sued General Motors for making unsafe pickup trucks says that after the automaker hired Mr. Webster with great fanfare, he permitted G.M. to shelve his report into whether the company had improperly destroyed documents relating to the case.
Some labor leaders say that Mr. Webster has not devoted enough time to his $100,000-a-year position on a government-created board that monitors the Teamsters union.
And a former chief economist with the Federal Communications Commission says that Mr. Webster's involvement with NextWave, a telecommunications company that defaulted on billions of dollars of payments to the F.C.C., should disqualify him from being the accounting board's chairman. NextWave was a "bottom feeder," said Gerald Faulhaber, a Wharton School professor who served as the F.C.C.'s top economist in 2000 and 2001. "Do I feel comfortable with my watchdog being involved with these guys? No."
Mr. Webster, who did not return repeated calls or e-mail messages for comment on his corporate life, now faces criticism for his short stint as the head of the audit committee at U.S. Technologies, a nearly bankrupt Internet company that is under criminal investigation for possible fraud. In August 2001, U.S. Technologies fired BDO Seidman as its auditor after the firm said that the company's financial records were disorganized and that some transactions had not been recorded.
Mr. Webster and Gregory Earls, the chief executive of U.S. Technologies, said last week that U.S. Technologies did nothing wrong and that the company fired BDO Seidman because its audit was expensive and slow. But the accounting firm has now asked a federal judge to release it from its client confidentiality agreement with U.S. Technologies so that it can respond to what it says are "false and misleading" statements from Mr. Webster.
Even before these problems came to light, Mr. Webster's appointment as head of the board sparked sharp criticism from Democrats and some big investors. They said he was not knowledgeable about accounting and -- at 78 -- too old to take on a tough and time-consuming new post.
Still, many in Washington say that they respect Mr. Webster. Even the Democrats who criticized his appointment to the accounting board were careful to say that they were not attacking him personally. "He is a top-notch civil servant," said Griffin Bell, the former attorney general who asked Mr. Webster in 1978 to head the F.B.I.
Before Mr. Webster took that job, the agency conducted a background check with interviews of 500 people who knew him, Mr. Bell said. "And not one thing turned up against him."
Soon after Mr. Webster left the government and became a partner in the Washington office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy in 1991, he took a surprising position. In 1992, the Air Transport Association, an airline trade group, hired him to lobby against fingerprinting and background checks for security screeners and airline employees who worked in secure areas. Facing opposition from the airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration delayed for four years before adopting a weakened requirement for background checks.
Representative James Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat, told The Los Angeles Times last year that he was "flabbergasted" that Mr. Webster had once lobbied against the proposal. "I looked him square in the eye and asked, 'Would you be taking this position if you were still director of the F.B.I?' " Mr. Oberstar said.
In 1993, General Motors hired Mr. Webster to conduct an internal inquiry into whether it had destroyed documents relating to the safety of pickup trucks that had been made from 1973 to 1987 and that had fuel tanks mounted outside the vehicles' frames. Mr. Webster was hired one month after a Georgia jury returned a $105 million verdict against the company. (The verdict was later overturned on appeal, and G.M. settled the case and three others.) Mr. Webster never released his report, said James Butler, the plaintiff's lawyer who won and later settled.
"Why announce in a public press release if you're going to have the former F.B.I. director do an investigation if you're not going to report the results?" Mr. Butler asked, suggesting that the findings may have been unfavorable. Mr. Webster should not have permitted the findings to be silenced, Mr. Butler said.
Mr. Webster's performance on a government-created board that monitors the Teamsters union for corruption has generated criticism and praise. In the late 1990's, some Teamsters complained that the union's pension funds had been depleted under the board's watch.
A labor leader who is not a Teamster and has observed Mr. Webster serve for the last decade on the board said he thought Mr. Webster did not take the responsibilities very seriously and worked only a few hours a month on the board. But Marick Masters, a business professor at the University of Pittsburgh, said he thought Mr. Webster had done a good job on the board, considering its limited resources.
"These aren't full-time appointments. They don't have large staffs. You have to be somewhat limited in what your expectations are about what these boards can do," Mr. Masters said. "It's very difficult for one board to get in there and really investigate everything." He said he thought Mr. Webster would do a good job as head of the oversight board.
Mr. Webster's position on the board of NextWave Telecom has also raised concern. Congressional investigators have said they will examine Mr. Webster's role at NextWave in addition to his work at U.S. Technologies. NextWave is a bankrupt wireless company whose main asset is a set of airwave licenses that the company won in an auction from the government in 1996 but never paid for. Since 2000, the Federal Communications Commission has been trying to recover the licenses from NextWave and sell them to other companies. NextWave has sued the government to keep the licenses.
"NextWave came in, and they got more licenses than anyone else," said Mr. Faulhaber, the Wharton professor. "And then at their earliest opportunity, they defaulted."
Mr. Webster knew or should have known that NextWave's actions were not in the consumers' or the government's best interest, Mr. Faulhaber said. He said Mr. Webster should not serve on the accounting board, which demands someone whose reputation is above reproach.
"He may be a perfectly fine fellow," Mr. Faulhaber said. "But this is a Caesar's wife situation."

HEADLINE: Struggling Sale Opens Auction Season 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
A Picasso portrait and a Monet landscape, a Matisse cut-out and a Henry Moore sculpture -- works that would have easily brought millions of dollars in seasons past -- were just a few examples of big-ticket Impressionist and modern art that failed to sell last night at Phillips, de Pury & Luxembourg.
 Even Phillips executives were unable to put a positive spin on the auction, the first in two frenetic weeks of fine-art sales. 
 "We expected it to be difficult, but not that difficult," said a deflated Simon de Pury, chairman of Phillips and the evening's auctioneer. "It's clearly a very disappointing result." 
Of the 44 works up for sale, a mere 19 found buyers. The auction totaled $7 million, one-seventh of its $49.3 million low estimate.
The struggling third-place auction house lacked both the manpower and the financial muscle to compete with Sotheby's and Christie's for this fall's best offerings. The resulting sale consisted of mediocre paintings, drawings and sculptures, many of which had been on the market all too recently. And everyone knew it.
The sale wasn't a disaster from the start. It began with a 14 works on paper by Klimt and Schiele that were identified in the catalog as "Property From an American Private Collection." Experts said the seller was Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics mogul who was a founder of the year-old Neue Galerie, a museum of German and Austrian art in Manhattan. The success of the Neue Galerie and a current fashion for German art brought solid prices.
Two of the Klimts far exceeded their estimates. "Nude With Spread Legs," estimated at $70,000 to $90,000, sold to James Roundell, the London dealer, for $141,500. Three bidders went for "Crouching Nude From Left," which went to an unidentified buyer for $125,000, just above its $120,000 high estimate.
(Final prices include Phillips's commission: 19.5 percent of the first $100,000 and 10 percent of any amount above that. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
German paintings also brought surprisingly high prices. The evening's most expensive painting was by Lyonel Feininger, a New York-born painter of German and American parentage, whose work is more regularly seen in sales in Europe. His "Newspaper Reader" (1909) brought $2.2 million, just above its $2 million high estimate. Two telephone bidders tried to buy "Crouching Deer," a 1911 painting by the German Expressionist Franz Marc. It sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $999,500, just above its high estimate of $900,000.
Impulse, mood and consumer confidence fuel auctions. As asking prices went up last night, the salesroom became eerily quiet. And the minute a room goes quiet, even dealers or collectors who have planned to bid generally lose their nerve.
No hands went up for "Japanese Bridge in Monet's Garden" (1895-96). The painting, with a light pastel palette, had last been up for sale at Christie's in May 1999, when the Nahmad family, Lebanese dealers with galleries in New York and London, were said to have bought it for $5.9 million. Phillips estimated it would bring $6.5 million to $8.5 million last night, but Mr. de Pury stopped trying to rouse a bid at $5.6 million.
The cover work of the Phillips catalog was an early Picasso portrait, "Bust of a Woman Smiling." Painted in 1901, when the artist was still under the influence of Toulouse-Lautrec, it shows a dark-haired woman wearing a large hat fashionable at the time. The painting had come from the sale of Belle Linsky's collection at Sotheby's in 1988, when it went to a Japanese collector for $4.4 million. Last night it was expected to bring $5 million to $7 million, but bidding stopped at $4.2 million.
Matisse's "Tree in Flower (Mural Scroll, No. 1)," from 1947-49, had been offered privately at Sotheby's this year, with an asking price of $6 million. Several dealers were also approached to try to sell the cut-out without subjecting it to the harsh glare of public auction, but nobody was willing to meet the asking price. Last night it carried an estimate of $4 million to $6 million, and Phillips is said to have given the seller, an unidentified American collector, a guarantee (an undisclosed minimum price regardless of a sale's outcome) of nearly $4 million. But nary a bidder could be spotted, and Mr. de Pury gave up at $2.6 million.
At Phillips's sale of Impressionist and modern art in London in June, the Nahmads bought about one-third of the lots. Last night they were among the biggest sellers. In addition to Monet's "Japanese Bridge," they were offering "Argenteuil, Late Afternoon," a landscape of boats on the Seine at sunset, which went unsold at $3.6 million after an optimistic estimate of $5 million to $7 million. The painting had brought $3.5 million at Christie's in 1990. While the date represents a prime period for the artist, experts before the sale said the surface of the painting was thin, probably from overcleaning.
The sculpture market has been particularly strong recently, and last night Phillips had a 1955 cast of Rodin's "Kiss" (1880). But it failed to sell, even at $720,000, far below its low estimate, $1.4 million. So did Moore's "Rocking Chair No. 2," a 1950 cast estimated at $750,000 to $900,000. Bidding began and ended at $480,000.
After the sale, many dealers and collectors quietly wondered if the evening might be the start of a tumbling art market. "I don't think it means much because the quality wasn't much," said Irving Blum, the Los Angeles dealer. "Sit tight and hang on to your hat. Things will be fine."

HEADLINE: After Providing Lift to City Economy, Insurance Payments for 9/11 Losses Slow Down 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Within five months after terrorists struck the World Trade Center, insurance companies paid more than $16 billion in claims for damage from the attack, providing a sharp boost to New York's struggling economy.
 But the flow has slowed: so far this year, the insurance companies have paid $3 billion in claims. 
 The payments have slowed, industry experts said, because insurance companies and their customers have taken care of the easiest claims, and now they are dealing with the most complicated ones, some of which may take years to resolve.
By the latest industry estimates, insurers expect to pay about $40 billion for the attacks on Sept. 11 in New York and Washington. This suggests that about $20 billion remains to be paid, though not all of it will come to New York, because many people with claims -- like the families of passengers on the planes used in the attacks -- are scattered around the country. 
But whatever the final amount, New Yorkers -- struggling with a battered economy and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the wake of the attack -- have already received much more money from insurers than from the state and federal governments and all other sources. And the impact has been profound. Without the insurance money, said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy. com, a research company, "the city's economy would probably still be under water."
Most of the insurance money has been paid fairly smoothly, according to the the New York State Department of Insurance, which regulates the insurance industry. More than 33,000 claims -- often several related to the same business -- have been paid or partly paid, the department said, and 300 complaints about payments have been received.
Gregory V. Serio, the state superintendent of insurance, said the insurers have generally "acted responsibly." But, he said, "That doesn't mean there haven't been some complications or controversy."
The amount of trade center losses is "still defying some degree of mathematical precision," Mr. Serio said. Even though estimates of the insured losses have generally been lowered to $40 billion -- from as high as $70 billion initially -- he said the losses might ultimately run to $50 billion. The number is hard to nail down, said Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group in Manhattan. That is so, he said, because business-interruption insurance is calculated on lost income, and there is a certain amount of estimating or subjectivity involved; also, liability claims for deaths and injuries depend on proof of negligence, which may take years to resolve. 
The customer with the biggest claim of all is Larry A. Silverstein, the holder of the lease on the twin towers. He is fighting in court with his insurers over his contention that the events of Sept. 11 constituted two occurrences, instead of one, and that he is thus owed about $7 billion in insurance money for two events at the World Trade Center, rather than about $3.5 billion for one event.
For some, payment was swift. That was so for Wet Electrics, a start-up software company whose offices at 30 West Broadway were crushed by falling debris.
Kevin P. Cunningham, the founder and chief executive of Wet Electrics, said that without the $150,000 he received from his insurer, the Hartford, in late December, Wet Electrics' debut would have been delayed for months. 
There are other happy customers, too. TradeWeb, an Internet company that had been on the 51st floor of the north tower, lost everything but its people. Within six months it received more than $5 million for property damage and lost income from its insurer, the Hartford. 
"Their people were not only skilled at what they do, but very eager to cooperate," said Brian G. Hunt, a vice president of TradeWeb, which enables bond trading on the Internet.
The process has not gone so well for everyone. Peter Semetis, the owner of Sale & Pepe Fine Foods and Catering, a deli at Trinity Place and Exchange Alley, got exactly what he asked of his insurer, the Utica National Insurance Group: $160,000, also for property damage and lost income. But he said it took repeated phone calls from him and his lawyer before he got his final check for $110,000 in August.
Michael Austin, a spokesman for Utica National, said he regretted Mr. Semetis's disappointment. But he said Utica National handled hundreds of claims and "we feel we dealt with most all of them quickly and fairly."
Julie Menin, an owner of Vine, a restaurant at 25 Broad Street, estimated that she lost $600,000 in sales in 2001. She said her insurer initially offered to pay for seven days of lost business, less than one-tenth of what she considered her actual losses.
Ms. Menin, who founded an organization called Wall Street Rising to help rebuild downtown, said that after the dispute was mentioned in an article in The New York Times last fall, the State Insurance Department phoned her. "They were incredibly helpful," she said. Early this year, she said, she reached a confidential settlement with the insurer.
Jeannine Chanes, a lawyer who has been providing free legal services to small businesses through the City Bar Association, estimated that more than 100 shoe-repair shops, hairdressers and other small businesses are involved in disputes with insurers. But she said it was not necessarily the fault of the insurers. "There's misunderstanding and reluctance on both sides," she said. "There is no clear villain here."
A critical problem for many small businesses is that they had too little coverage or, in some cases, none at all. Vivia Amalfitano, a part owner of Steve's Pizza, at 110 Trinity Place, said her insurer, Utica First Insurance Company, was "completely sympathetic" and promptly paid her $80,000, the full coverage in her policy. But she said that she was underinsured, and that her actual losses were at least $30,000 higher.
One broker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some insurers appeared to be delaying payments intentionally. "The downturn in the markets has hurt them badly," he said. "Some of these claims are substantial, and to pay them the insurance companies have to sell bonds." The insurers do not want to do that any sooner than they have to, he said, adding, "The delays haven't been that bad, but things could be moving faster."
P. J. Crowley, a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, said he did not believe it was true that insurers were intentionally delaying. But he said that because of the "unprecedented nature and the complexity of what happened on Sept. 11, it has taken longer for business to file claims and document their losses, and it has taken longer for insurers, in some cases, to evaluate those claims and make payments."
The unpaid claims are complicated for a number of reasons.
Michael C. Wachs, the managing director of CEOcast Inc., a company on John Street that handles investor relations for small corporations, said he and his insurer, Zurich North America, are stalemated and heading for binding arbitration. Mr. Wachs figures his company is due about $850,000 in damages and lost income. Mr. Wachs said he had received $310,000.
"They have changed their position repeatedly and used maybe four different methods of analyzing the claim, each inconsistent with the previous one," Mr. Wachs said.
Keith Owens, a spokesman for Zurich North America, said the claim has been difficult to evaluate. "We are still working in good faith to resolve this."
The operator of four New York Sports Clubs in Lower Manhattan, Town Sports International, is claiming losses of $9 million. Its insurer, the American International Group, has paid $1.2 million. "They've desperately tried to find ways that we're not covered," said Richard Pyle, the chief financial officer of Town Sports. After months of delay, he said, he had his first meeting with an A.I.G. representative last Thursday .
"Right now, there seems to be some dialogue," Mr. Pyle said.
A.I.G. would not comment on the Town Sports claim. But Ned Burke, a spokesman for the insurer, said his company "has and continues to honor its obligation to our insureds."
A year ago, many thought the attack would bring a tidal wave of lawsuits for insurance payments, if only because it was a huge event that involved a lot of people and a lot of businesses. But only about 30 suits have been filed, according to David Eldreth, the editor of a newsletter at Mealey's Publications, which tracks lawsuits. 
Since the attack businesses have been seeking increased coverage. But insurers have been reducing coverage and raising prices. With insurance suddenly scarce, Mr. Eldreth said, companies are thinking twice before taking their insurers to court. "They are afraid of losing their coverage," he said.

CanCeline Dion help Chrysler rebound? The automaker is betting millions that she can.

BYLINE:  By Danny Hakim 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
CELINE DION was able to sell a movie about a sinking ship. But can she sell a Chrysler? And can Chrysler sell her?
 The Chrysler Group on Tuesday will announce a broad-based partnership with Celine Dion, the 34-year-old French Canadian chanteuse, and Sony Music Entertainment that will include appearances in advertisements, cross promotions of her music with the cars and even a special Chrysler song she will croon. The terms of the three-year deal were not disclosed, though it will pay Ms. Dion in the tens of millions of dollars. 
 The partnership finds the two parties at junctures where they could be helped by plenty of promotion. 
Chrysler, which has struggled since being acquired by Daimler-Benz in 1998, is pinning its hopes on a crop of automobiles scheduled for next year that are more reflective of its new German parentage. And the unit of DaimlerChrysler is eager to shed the Chrysler brand's rust belt heritage for a classier demeanor. 
Ms. Dion, best known for "My Heart Will Go On." from the film "Titanic," is ready to serve. On March 25, she begins an ambitious new phase of her career with the first of 600 performances at a 4,000-seat Roman Coliseum-style theater built for her at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. And the publicity boost from the Chrysler partnership can only help sell tickets to the elaborate production, which will be directed by Franco Dragone, a director of Cirque du Soleil shows.
"I did some commercials for Chrysler 14 years ago, I was a spokesperson for Chrysler in Canada in French and in English," said Ms. Dion in an interview. "When they came back to me this time, it felt very natural."
So natural, she added, that she might even give her chauffeurs a break. 
"Soon I'll be driving a Town and Country minivan, which is going to be a family thing," she said. "I'm ready to pick my own tomatoes with my son and my husband. That's my goal. Forget the limousines. "
The project is being developed with BBDO Detroit and the Arnell Group, both divisions of the Omnicom Group. Chrysler executives would not specify how much they would spend on the campaign. But in 2001, Chrysler brands were supported by $474.4 million in advertising, according to an Advertising Age analysis of data from CMR, a unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres. 
George Murphy, senior vice president of global brand marketing at Chrysler, said "we'll integrate everything about our brand into hers, and she'll integrate her brand into ours." 
"Can you imagine putting her with her baby Rene in the back of one of our minivans and having her sing one of her love ballads?" he added. "We'd have all of America crying. Seriously."
(Mr. Murphy was referring to Rene-Charles Angelil, the toddler son of Ms. Dion and her husband and manager, Rene Angelil.)
Peter Arnell, the founder of the Arnell Group, said: "I've only had moments in my career that alignments were so organic. The other was with Tina Turner and Hanes hosiery, because of the natural relationship between Tina and her legs and her energy."
Next year, as Ms. Dion is starting her Vegas stand, Chrysler will be introducing automobiles with a more European look. The cars will share parts with Chrysler's new corporate cousin, Mercedes -- for example, 40 percent of the parts in a new Chrysler sports car, the Crossfire, will come from Mercedes. Chrysler, suffering from a shrinking market share and a price war among the Big Three, is also trying to invent an alternative to the tired minivan segment with the Pacifica, which the company bills as a classy mix of station wagon, minivan and S.U.V.
By bonding with Ms. Dion, Chrysler executives hope to sidestep a common problem for automakers trying to overhaul their products. 
"It takes at least a purchase cycle for word to spread around to say 'wow are they different,' " said James Schroer, Chrysler's executive vice president of sales and marketing. "We're trying to speed up."
The deal was first conceived during a phone conversation between Mr. Schroer and Thomas Mottola, chairman and chief executive of Sony Music. 
"Tommy Mottola called me and was complimenting us on a commercial called 'PT Love,' " Mr. Schroer recalled. 
The ad uses an old Nat Cole song, "Love." Mr. Mottola suggested using songs by Sony artists for future ads. 
"I said 'who do you have who could do that?' He said Celine Dion, and I said 'holy smokes,' " Mr. Schroer said. 
"It gives us a whole new platform to extend her brand and her imagery, but also it creates a much larger distribution platform," said Mr. Mottola. "We might be doing customized product for her dealers and we can tie in her brand- new album in February and her show in Las Vegas."
Ms. Dion said Chrysler's current campaign tag line, "Drive = Love" appealed to her. 
"I fell for it because they want to use music," she said. "It's not going to be an effort to me because this is what I'm doing, because I'm using music to talk about love. I'm a very passionate person."
But can you get passionate singing about Chryslers? Asked this question, Ms. Dion broke into song. 
"Ohhhh please go buy this car
It's amazing, you'll see"
"I'm not going to do that, O.K.?" she said. "I'm going to use a song about passion, a song written especially for that, and it will be a song of love."
Clive Chajet, a corporate identity consultant and the chairman of Chajet Consultancy in New York, said the match seemed apt.
"If you're going to use celebrities, its got to be someone popular and relatively noncontroversial," he said. "I think it's a fine choice."
Alan Siegel, chairman and chief executive at Siegelgale, a brand-identity consulting firm in New York, was a little more dubious. 
"They think she's classy? I think she's popular and very recognizable and has a certain presence," he said. He said he did believe, however, that she would be largely immune to problems that have beset such celebrity endorsers from Martha Stewart to O. J. Simpson. 
"I think she's no risk there," he said. "She's built a very positive career. I've never heard any negative about her."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: THE OVERVIEW; 
BUSH'S FINAL SWING ON EVE OF ELECTION TAKES IN 4 STATES

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER and LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
In a furious finale to an unpredictable campaign, President Bush rolled across four battleground states for the House and the Senate yesterday, imploring voters to send him "some allies" and vote Republican on Election Day.
 From Cedar Rapids, Iowa, through Missouri and Arkansas and finally back home to Texas, Mr. Bush campaigned hard to defy historical tradition and gain seats for his party in a midterm election. By day's end, he had made 17 stops in 15 states over the last week, put the prestige of the presidency behind an array of Republican candidates, and reminded his audience that the nation was still at risk. 
 Leading Democrats were trying to match the power of the bully pulpit by energizing their core supporters with a sharp economic message and an intensive ground operation. Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, former Vice President Al Gore, former President Bill Clinton, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, among other party luminaries, were all trying to rally Democrats to the polls today, underscoring how much was up for grabs on this Election Day.
Mr. Bush's sprint, and the Democrats' frenetic campaigning, came as candidates around the country closed with a final burst of advertising -- much of it negative -- and what party leaders described as a relentless drive to turn out the vote. Their efforts were galvanized by the unusual number of races that seemed achingly close to the end, both among the governorships and the Senate.
With control of the House and Senate on the line, as well as potentially the shape of the Supreme Court, two competing armies of political professionals and their interest-group allies have descended on crucial states and communities for these final hours. A net pickup of just seven seats would give Democrats control of the House, although Republicans were voicing increasing confidence that they would hold the line.
But the Senate, where Democrats have a one-vote majority, remained exceedingly unpredictable, with 10 Senate races considered winnable by either side.
"Anybody who thinks they have a handle on this is nuts," said Steve Rosenthal, political director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Democrats were hoping that their legendary ground game could help compensate for a popular president and a fall campaign overshadowed by the prospect of war. Republicans were fired by memories of elections past, notably 1998 and 2000, when many felt out-hustled by Democrats on Election Day. 
"We've got a Senate race that is basically tied, like a high school basketball game that gets decided on the final shot before the buzzer," said Ralph Reed, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, where Senator Max Cleland, the Democratic incumbent, was facing a stiff challenge from Representative Saxby Chambliss, a Republican. "And I think the final shot will be turnout."
In an effort to rally black voters, especially critical in the South, Democrats were counting on Mr. Clinton to carry a get-out-the-vote message on black radio, in "robo-calls" to black voters, and in a conference call to black ministers last Friday, before their final pre-election Sunday church service. On Chicago's radio station WGCI, Mr. Clinton asked in one spot, "Are you wondering why friends and neighbors are losing their jobs and new jobs are hard to find?"
The National Rifle Association deployed thousands of volunteers across the country working the phones, walking precincts and driving people to the polls; this year, officials said, they concluded the game would be won on the ground.
"There are 90 million gun owners, 20 million hunters and 4 million N.R.A. members," said Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.'s chief executive. "That base is gold when it comes to Election Day." The group's latest radio advertisement, he said, cautions voters not to be fooled by "camouflage candidates," who take pictures of themselves "skeet shooting, when in fact they haven't taken the price tags off their camouflage."
Nationally, Republicans have mobilized what they call the 72 Hour Task Force; they say they are dispatching 1,500 campaign staff members from Washington, who will work with 225,000 volunteer "community leaders" across the country.
But Republicans clearly consider Mr. Bush their prime turnout weapon. In an e-mail message to 225,000 Election Day volunteers, Mr. Bush declares, "If you care about our culture, and the values we pass on to our children, about our country, then vote Tuesday and ask your friends and family to vote too."
After Mr. Bush appeared last weekend in Georgia, state officials said some 450 volunteers headed off in buses for a day of door-knocking that hit 30,000 homes.
In Arkansas yesterday, Mr. Bush said he needs Republicans in the Senate, like incumbent Senator Tim Hutchinson, who will vote for a good homeland security bill, not a "lousy" one, and support the military.
In St. Louis, where he campaigned for former Representative Jim Talent, who is challenging Senator Jean Carnahan, a Democrat, Mr. Bush declared, "See that's what I'm looking for, some allies." He added, "Somebody who we can count on to do the right thing in America. Somebody whose vote we can count on to do the right thing to make sure this country is strong and safe and a better place."
For its part, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said it now has 750 full-time coordinators in the field, working with 4,000 local union coordinators and "tens of thousands of union volunteers." Mr. Rosenthal, political director for the federation, said, "There are union members all over the streets."
Already, there were pre-emptive charges from Democrats that Republicans were trying to suppress voter participation by negative advertising, particularly in minority communities. Mindful of the chaos of the 2000 election, both parties said they were establishing elaborate efforts to monitor the voting and move quickly on charges of abuse or fraud.
The final days had a special edge because many campaigns, abandoning the restraint they showed before the Sept. 11 anniversary, unleashed a wave of harsh attack commercials in the week leading up to the election, rather than ending on a more customary positive note.
In New Hampshire, where John E. Sununu, the Republican nominee, and Jeanne Shaheen, his Democratic opponent are locked in a tight race for the Senate, Mr. Sununu recently broadcast a commercial that asks why Ms. Shaheen has been "hiding the fact that she's a Democrat." Perhaps, the narrator suggests, she is ashamed because she endorsed Michael Dukakis and Al Gore, highlighting photographs of Mr. Gore and Mr. Dukakis in an army helmet.
In suburban New Jersey, Anne Sumers, the Democrat running for an open House seat, is hurling images of the Washington-area snipers at viewers to make the point that her opponent is soft on regulating guns.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 CAMPAIGN: MINNESOTA; 
For Minnesota, A Late Debate In a New Race

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
The debate today was billed as youth vs. experience, vigor vs. wisdom, a last-minute showdown pitting iconic elder statesman vs. can-do up-and-comer. It became a feisty verbal joust of "Norm" vs. "Mr. Vice President," the terms the candidates used to address each other symbolizing the new choice voters face.
 Walter F. Mondale, the 74-year-old former senator, vice president and ambassador to Japan who was tapped last week to replace the late Senator Paul Wellstone, took control early with pointed, partisan attacks that painted his opponent, Norm Coleman, as a right-wing tool of the White House who could not be trusted. Mr. Coleman, 53, the former mayor of this capital city, refused to get rattled, repeatedly reciting his record as a jobs-builder and respectfully observing that Mr. Mondale's was precisely the kind of tone he hoped to change in Washington. 
 Just hours before the polls opened, the candidates in Minnesota's strange, shortened Senate race met for the first time this morning in an hourlong debate at the historic Fitzgerald Theater here, staking out distinct positions on abortion, taxes, war against Iraq, prescription drug benefits and education. With the shock and sadness of Mr. Wellstone's Oct. 25 death in a plane crash shadowing the closely watched race, both candidates agreed that the choice was about competing visions for the future.
"It's not about Vice President Mondale's age, it's not about my age, it's about the age in which we live," Mr. Coleman, the Republican, said in his first chance at the microphone. "I will be a champion for 21st-century thinking."
Mr. Mondale, the Democrat, asked, "Which future?" and added, "Will it be the one where we're working for the people?"
When Mr. Coleman brought up the double-digit inflation, long lines for gas and increased taxes that characterized Mr. Mondale's term as Jimmy Carter's vice president, from 1977 to 1981, his opponent countered with Mr. Coleman's new campaign slogan, which became the debate's mantra: "This election is about the future."
"It's not about the collapse of the shah in 1979, it's not about Afghanistan in 1980," Mr. Mondale said. "It's about Afghanistan and Iraq and the real world today."
Angry over the exclusion of minor-party candidates from the rare day-before-the-election debate, Gov. Jesse Ventura tried to upstage the event by appointing, as it began, an interim senator to fill Mr. Wellstone's seat, a move that could determine control of the Senate during the lame-duck session starting on Nov. 12. Mr. Ventura chose Dean Barkley, a state planning commissioner from Mr. Ventura's own Independence Party who twice ran for the Senate on the Reform Party line.
"If you consider life experiences outside of government and politics, my appointee may be better qualified than either of the two major-party candidates," Mr. Ventura said. 
Broadcast live on CNN, the 10 a.m. debate opened the last of five days of precision campaigning for Mr. Mondale, who headed off to a noontime rally in a frigid Peavey Plaza in Minneapolis, with Soul Asylum providing the backbeat and Jessica Lange the star quality. Mr. Coleman dashed from the theater to a rally in Mankato with former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York before setting off on an overnight bus tour through 14 cities and towns.
During the debate, Mr. Mondale frequently leaned forward in his chair, wagged his finger at his opponent and spoke to him like a scolding father. "No, no, no, Norman," he interrupted during a discussion of the proposed Homeland Security Department. When Mr. Coleman began a point with, "The question is----" Mr. Mondale cut him off, saying: "No, I'm asking questions now. Why do you take this hard line?"
Mr. Coleman did not get riled, sticking to a careful, measured script. "This is the tone that you don't want to see in Washington," he said after one outburst. "This is the tone that has resulted in where we are today." 
In an exchange about abortion -- the Democrat said he would reject judicial nominees who opposed Roe v. Wade, while the Republican said he had no litmus test -- Mr. Mondale said, "This is about fundamental principles and not tone."
He also noted a shift in strategy by Mr. Coleman, a former Democrat, who ran an aggressive, negative campaign before Mr. Wellstone's death. "You have a campaign here that is a poster child for what is wrong with politics," Mr. Mondale said. "Norm, we know you, we've seen you, we've seen you shift around."
Mr. Coleman kept his composure. "We've each governed," he said. "I did it in St. Paul. We didn't raise taxes for eight years. We added 18,000 jobs." Referring derisively to the Carter era, he added, "The times of raising taxes and more government regulation are over."
Each man had his own goals in the confrontation: Mr. Mondale, with snappy responses and a sharp command of contemporary issues, tried to defuse criticism of his age and long hiatus from elective office. Mr. Coleman, with his steady, deferential manner, sought to garner more of the kind of plaudits he has received for running a positive campaign since the plane crash.
Mr. Mondale sounded some national Democratic themes, including a call for corporate responsibility. Mr. Coleman said, "You can't be talking about special interests," drawing distinctions between the populist Mr. Wellstone and Mr. Mondale, who has spent recent years sitting on several corporate boards. "You can't be playing the class warfare card."
Emphasizing that he has spent his life in Minnesota, Mr. Mondale suggested that Mr. Coleman, who was born in Brooklyn, was a puppet of the White House, which had propelled him into the race. But Mr. Coleman, who repeatedly dropped references to his two years of campaign travel throughout rural Minnesota, said that if his victory helped Republicans regain control of the Senate, "the president will owe me big time."
As the hour wore on, the way the men referred to each other became more pronounced. The younger debater uttered not one "Fritz" or even "Mr. Mondale" while the elder candidate never called his opponent, "Mayor," just "Norm" or "Norman."
Afterward, Mr. Coleman explained by saying simply, "I have a great respect for the vice president." Mr. Mondale, when asked about it, said, "That's his first name."

HEADLINE: In New Jersey, Subdued End To Improbable Senate Race 

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: TOMS RIVER, N.J., Nov. 4 

 BODY:
After an improbable campaign marked by ethical debacles, legal battles and a midstream change of candidates, the United States Senate race in New Jersey neared its end today on a surprisingly subdued note.
 Douglas R. Forrester, the Republican nominee, was met by relatively sparse crowds as he made appearances at centers for the elderly and shopping districts across the state. The Forrester campaign even canceled a scheduled event at a shopping center in Jackson. A press release cited "inclement weather," but the weather, though cloudy, was dry, and a Forrester aide later conceded that too few people were there to make it a worthwhile stop. 
 Not until a 6 p.m. rally did Mr. Forrester see his first sizable crowd of the day: 300 people at a Republican rally at a Holiday Inn here. They heard Mr. Forrester predict that he would surprise the pundits and pollsters by winning on Tuesday.
Frank R. Lautenberg, who has led in virtually every poll since he became the Democratic nominee last month, was also greeted with polite but hardly overwhelming welcomes at campaign stops. Mr. Lautenberg said he was optimistic about his chances, but he did not dispute the notion that the public seemed more numbed than energized by the race.
With the Senate race at the top of the ballot, some New Jersey political analysts predicted that the turnout could be an all-time low.
Such indifference seemed unlikely two months ago, when Senator Robert G. Torricelli, who was admonished by the Senate Ethics Committee in August, was still furiously seeking re-election. The race was closely watched by party officials in Washington and was considered one of a handful that might determine whether Democrats keep their single-seat margin in the Senate.
After Mr. Torricelli withdrew on Sept. 30 and a weeklong legal battle cleared the way for Mr. Lautenberg to enter the race, polls have swung in his favor, but the race has generated little enthusiasm.
"It was like an opera that starts out with a bland overture and reaches its peak in the middle," said Ross K. Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers. "By the time it's over, everyone has sung their songs and are lying dead on the stage."
Mr. Forrester's campaign advisers said they believed a low turnout would give him a chance at an upset. Most polls have indicated that Republicans are more highly motivated than Democrats, and because Mr. Lautenberg is a former three-term senator, Mr. Forrester's aides said Mr. Forrester would win a large majority of the undecided voters.
"Our people are motivated," said Bill Pascoe, Mr. Forrester's campaign manager. "After 18 years in public office, people know Frank Lautenberg, so the undecided are really saying that they don't want to vote for him, and I think they'll be the difference that allows us to win."
Mr. Lautenberg said he thought the lethargic tone of the campaign's final days was attributable, in part, to uncertainty about the economy.
Walking from table to table at a campaign stop at a diner in Cherry Hill this afternoon, he received cordial handshakes and words of encouragement, but little of the raucous enthusiasm that comes at the end of many hard-fought campaigns.
Some Republicans were gleeful that only 500 or so people attended a Lautenberg rally on Saturday in Newark, though it featured former President Bill Clinton, the Democrats' biggest star.
Mr. Lautenberg said he felt that the low-watt ending to the race was a sign that his campaign had succeeded in informing voters that Mr. Forrester's positions on issues like gun control, the environment and abortion rights were more conservative than those of most New Jersey voters.
"People know where he stands, and that's why I feel optimistic that the outcome is likely to be very good for us tomorrow," Mr. Lautenberg said.
He ended his day with a rally at Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton, attended by about 350 people.
While the 13 members of New Jersey's House delegation face re-election, only the race in the Fifth District, where Marge Roukema retired after 22 years in office, has generated much attention. There, Assemblyman E. Scott Garrett, a Republican, is facing Anne R. Sumers, a Democrat.
Two county executive races will also be closely watched, in part because they have been dominated by debates over whether New Jersey should build a sports arena in Newark. In Essex County, Candace Straight, the Republican, has tried to harness sentiment against the arena and use it against Joseph N. DiVincenzo, a Democratic freeholder.
In Bergen County, where some residents and business owners worry that the economy will suffer if the Nets and Devils sports teams move to Newark from the Meadowlands sports complex in East Rutherford, both Dennis McNerney, a Democratic freeholder, and State Senator Henry P. McNamara, a Republican, have often competed over who could register the strongest objection to the plan.

HEADLINE: Fresh Groceries Right Off the Assembly Line 

BYLINE:  By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
FOR the last four months, FreshDirect, an elaborate new online food delivery service, has been gradually working its way into ZIP codes in New York City. And some of those who are still beyond its reach are eager to try it. 
 "I logged on and found out that it would not be in my neighborhood in Brooklyn until February, and I was so disappointed," said Gabriela Meriles, a publicist who works in Manhattan. "I hate going food shopping so now I'm waiting with bated breath." 
 On the face of it, what is tempting her sounds like nothing new. But FreshDirect is unlike the defunct delivery services Kozmo and Urban Fetch. It is also more than just a supermarket taking orders online, like Albertson's and Safeway on the West Coast, Marsh in Indianapolis, Hy-Vee in Des Moines and D'Agostino in New York. And it is entering the New York market on tiptoe, instead of starting full steam ahead like Webvan, a similar company that failed after three years. 
"E-groceries are becoming part of the consumer's lifestyle," said Mark Hamstra, the retail and financial editor of Supermarket News, a trade publication. He added that the services are generally not profitable.
Three years and $100 million in the planning, FreshDirect has its own warehouse in Long Island City, Queens, with a 15,000-item inventory of proportionately more perishable items than in supermarkets, often of higher quality and at lower prices. Fragile Comice pears ($1.39 a pound), perhaps the trickiest item that this reporter ordered a couple of weeks ago, were ripe, buttery and unblemished.
Still, as Nicholas D'Agostino Jr., the chairman of the D'Agostino supermarket chain, suggested, "What's a ripe banana to me might not be a ripe banana to you." 
Christopher Bonanos, an editor at New York magazine who lives in Murray Hill and has ordered from FreshDirect several times, said he thought the service was superior to what's in supermarkets. "Just how fresh everything was stunned me," Mr. Bonanos said. "There's a loss of the experience of choosing your tomato, but it's clear that the stuff they sell hasn't been sitting around for a week. And the prices are terrific." 
Fish was the biggest surprise. It's generally on a par with what is sold in some of the city's fine fish markets and can be even better. FreshDirect's fillet of cod, for example, at $8.99 a pound, was pearly moist and silky after cooking. A lovely halibut steak was $12.49 a pound. Citarella charges $12.99.
Many of FreshDirect's customers say they are using the service because food shopping in Manhattan can be agonizing. But the question is whether discerning food shoppers will trust it.
"Does the foodie want to shop this way?" asked Joseph Gurrera, the owner of Citarella. "The business we do by telephone is minimal but thousands of customers come into our stores."
Joseph Fedele, the founder and chief executive officer of FreshDirect and a former partner at Fairway in Harlem, said shoppers could learn to rely on the quality of his merchandise and to forgo the rituals of looking, squeezing and sniffing. "Nobody really learns anything when they pick up a cantaloupe and smell it," he said. "And most of the time if they want cantaloupe they'll buy it no matter what."
Michael Coskun, an owner of the Garden of Eden stores, is not convinced. "We're dealing with a very demanding, very picky clientele, a customer who wants to see what they buy," he said. "I wish them luck."
In fact, not everything from FreshDirect was like those incomparable pears. Some of the Italian prune plums in this reporter's order were too soft, an avocado took several days to ripen, beautiful green beans had no flavor, and rather mangy bunches of grapes were overripe, falling off their stems.
Many of FreshDirect's prices for name-brand groceries are lower than in local supermarkets, but the choices, especially for nonfood items, are far fewer. On the Web site yesterday, a 15-ounce box of Cheerios was $3.79, compared with $4.49. Muir Glen organic tomatoes were $1.99 for a 28-ounce can, instead of $2.49. But a half-gallon of Organic Valley milk was $3.59, compared with $3.39 in a local deli. FreshDirect has its own bakery, but its decent-quality bread is shipped parbaked and frozen. 
Mr. D'Agostino questioned the economics of delivering food from a centralized warehouse. "We fill Internet orders but from the individual stores that deliver in the neighborhood," he said.
But what sets FreshDirect apart is that it is not just sending out boxes of merchandise pulled off supermarket shelves. Mr. Fedele said that 83 percent of FreshDirect's orders are for fresh food: produce, seafood, meat, dairy, delicatessen and prepared food from its own kitchens. Supermarkets, he said, which typically have 20 percent of their space refrigerated, are not set up to sell as much fresh food.
Even Peapod, a grocery delivery company that says it is profitable in four of its six markets, sells mostly supermarket-quality food at supermarket prices, about 50 percent of it fresh. It was acquired by Royal Ahold, a Dutch company that also owns the Giant chain in the Washington area and has a warehouse system in Chicago, its original market. In Washington, it uses the Giant warehouse. The company delivers in the Northeast through Stop & Shop, another Royal Ahold company.
Mr. Fedele has bragging rights when it comes to refrigeration. He has 12 refrigerated zones that occupy more than three-quarters of FreshDirect's 300,000-square-foot warehouse. Fish goes to one of seven refrigerated receiving docks directly from the producer, without stopping at a wholesale market. It is stored in a 29-degree room and is portioned to the customer's order by one of 65 fish cutters. It then goes into a refrigerated truck, so it is kept cold until it reaches the customer. Meat is also handled carefully. In terms of food safety, especially avoiding cross-contamination, the warehouse is state of the art. Produce is stored in several temperature zones, up to 65 degrees for bananas and tomatoes that need ripening. 
More than 1,000 men and women work in sweaters and coats from about 1 a.m. to 7 a.m., pulling orders off computers, then cutting and packing the meat, bagging the produce and putting the orders in boxes. (Some customers have complained about having to dispose of those big boxes.)
Each customer has a bar code. It's Amazon.com with lettuce and mayo, down to suggestions of other items to accompany an order. Some Roquefort with those pears?
When an order is placed, the customer selects a two-hour delivery window, starting at 4:30 p.m. Earlier deliveries are only made Saturdays and Sundays. The order has to have been placed by midnight the night before, eliminating any notion of last-minute shopping. There's a $40 minimum per order and a $3.95 delivery fee. New customers get discounts.
Mr. Fedele said he has 8,000 customers, 78 percent of whom have reordered, and is adding 500 new ones a day. The average order is about $100.
FreshDirect's Web site is user-friendly and informative, and the options for custom-tailoring are almost mind-boggling. How the meat is to be cut, what rubs or marinades to go with it, whether the whole fish is to be split or not, with or without head and tail, are just a few. It provides recipes, too. Coffee, which is roasted and ground to order and costs about $5.99 a pound, can be custom-blended. 
There are glitches. This reporter's recent order, which included Braeburn apples, was confirmed by e-mail just an hour before delivery. When it arrived at 5 p.m. there were no apples. Two chocolate chip cookies, baked on the premises, were sent instead -- small compensation to a cook who planned to whip up an apple crisp that night.
But Mr. Fedele acknowledges that the service is still being fine-tuned. FreshDirect is being rolled out gradually, starting with the parts of the city closest to its warehouses and offices. First Roosevelt Island, then Battery Park City, a neighborhood that can be easily reached from the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, then other parts of Queens and then, about a month ago, Murray Hill. Two weeks ago, the service was extended to parts of Midtown, east of Fifth Avenue and as far north as 59th Street, as well as the Gramercy Park area.
Mr. Hamstra of Supermarket News said, "E-groceries will only work in a densely populated market like San Francisco or New York." 
For now, customers have praised the promptness of FreshDirect's deliveries. But it remains to be seen whether that will continue once a few more ZIP codes, on the Upper West Side, for example, or Riverdale in the Bronx, are added. Not to mention the effect of winter storms or basic New York gridlock.

HEADLINE: ARTS IN AMERICA; 
Sedona, Ariz., Takes on the Big Boys of Sculpture

BYLINE:  By Patricia Cohen

DATELINE: SEDONA, Ariz. 

 BODY:
Like a lot of artists who first encounter the sprawling vermilion-and-indigo landscape and soulful Native American carvings, Gary Allen Brown was taken with the Western aesthetic when he moved to the northern Arizona desert four and a half years ago from Chicago. "I went to a Navajo reservation" he said, studying ancient rock carvings and drawing Kokopelli, the Indian fertility symbol whose silhouette can be found in almost every hotel lobby, tchotchke shop and gas station.
 "I went through that stuff and I realized that was absolutely not me. What do I know from bear claws? I'm just a Jewish boy from the North Side of Chicago." 
 After that false start, Mr. Brown, who had come here to reinvent himself as a sculptor after 17 years in the sign business, began creating sinuous wood and metal sculptures.
That he was displaying his work for the first time at the annual Sedona Sculpture Walk in October is curiously appropriate, for the sculpture festival is also trying to reinvent itself. For 14 years the exhibition has essentially been a small, local affair aimed at wealthy tourists interested in the upscale equivalent of a T-shirt or key chain souvenir.
But last year, the new executive director of the Sedona Arts Center, Karen Ely, decided to take the festival to a new level, hoping to turn it into the nation's largest, most successful juried sculpture exhibition.
How to define success, though, isn't obvious. The art shown at the Sculpture Walk represents an enormous body of work that is made and bought by millions of people but is mostly ignored by newspapers, art magazines, critics and museum curators. Many art critics dismissively categorize much of the work as kitsch. Yet there are hundreds of these sorts of exhibitions, art fairs, festivals across the country, and they account for a sizable portion of the art that is produced and loved in the United States.
To the organizers of the Sedona Sculpture Walk, success is defined not only in quality but in dollars also. What's the take at the end of the show? Thus, transforming a local festival into a nationally known event is as much about marketing as about art.
The problem facing the organizers is like that of the first-time job seeker who needs experience to get a job, but can't get experience without a job. Without serious buyers, it's tough to get top-notch artists; and vice versa.
"We're looking for the real arts patrons," Ms. Ely said bluntly. "We want people who are going to buy."
To find moneyed art lovers, the arts council hired a marketing firm to spread the word in New York, Chicago, Boston and Los Angeles.
They also moved the festival to the new Sedona Cultural Park, a large outdoor amphitheater and grounds with a spectacular background of towering red rock buttes and mesas. The inconvenient location was a virtue: attracting art lovers who would go out of their way to see the show was more important than racking up many tourists who happened to be strolling by.
Organizers also timed the exhibition to coincide with a big draw concert: Tony Bennett.
Right away, Ms. Ely realized that they had to exhibit many more kinds of sculpture, she said: "We had a plethora of figurative bronze and cowboys and Western themes. I wanted more diversity in the style and the medium." So a call went out to artists in art magazines and sculpture periodicals, a Web site was set up, and organizers started visiting shows and galleries, seeking new artists. Ms. Ely traveled, for example, to a sculpture symposium in the aptly named Marble, Colo., famous for the milky white rock that was used in the Washington Monument and the Tomb of the Unknowns. There she signed up eight artists.
The model is Loveland, Colo., something of a mecca for bronze sculptors in particular, with two world-class bronze foundries. The annual sculpture festival there is the largest outdoor juried sculpture exhibition in the country and attracts more than 180 sculptors and 20,000 to 25,000 visitors, said Polly Juneau, the president of the board of the Loveland High Plains Art Council. Sales for the two-day show typically run over a million dollars.
Clearly, Sedona has a way to go.
The number of participants grew from 67 in 2001 to 90 this year, with 30 percent from northern Arizona, 50 percent from the four corners area where Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico meet and the rest from elsewhere. More than 3,000 visitors attended. But sales were disappointing. Ms. Ely said she had hoped the total would top $200,000. Instead, a preliminary total of $60,000 worth of sculptures were sold.
"It was nowhere near where we hoped," she conceded, blaming the recession and the doddering stock market. "That was pretty disappointing. But we also feel we got the right people there, the right buyers."
While Ms. Ely did manage to attract one ceramic artist, one neon and two glass sculptors, much more common under the taut white tents were bronze sculptures of Indians in full headdress and cowboys reeling back on horses, miniature coyotes and mammoth frogs and all manner of bronze cherubic children and maidens on a swing.
Veteran favorites like Joe Beeler, a founder of the Cowboy Artists of America -- a boys-only club that is committed to the Western tradition of Charles Russell and Frederic Remington and is considered the most prestigious organization of Western artists in the country -- shared a tent with the group's newest inductee, John Coleman. There one could see the familiar figure of Kokopelli, backpack slung over a shoulder, flute in hand, executed by Mr. Coleman with much more grace and skill than the usual fare.
What was striking amid the professionals was the number of people who turned to sculpture late in life. Joyce Killebrew, 55, was a firefighter with the Forest Service. When she was stationed in a watch tower in the early 1990's, she began taking clay with her and started sculpturing. After a Colorado forest fire on Storm King Mountain killed 14 people in 1994, Ms. Killebrew created a larger-than-life memorial of three firefighters.
Charles Taube built doors and gates before an accident in 1997 left him with only 30 percent use of his left hand and arm. Now he fashions snakelike coils of wood. Sedona is his first exhibition and though he hasn't sold anything yet, he did find a gallery interested in displaying his work. "I just sat it on the desk," he said, and the owner said, "O.K."
And then there is Andreas Schwab, who was raised in Switzerland and was an automobile mechanic here. He had tinkered with the Jaguar and the Mercedes owned by Charles Loloma, a renowned Hopi jewelry craftsman. Mr. Schwab remembers showing Mr. Loloma one of his sculptures of an Indian. "They're old Europeans in feathers," Mr. Loloma told him, urging him to study the facial features of Native Americans closely. "I've been working on it ever since," Mr. Schwab said.
The same could be said of the Sculpture Walk itself; it's a work in progress.

HEADLINE: Out of the Kitchen, Into the Vineyard 

BYLINE:  By HUGO LINDGREN 

DATELINE: MATTITUCK, N.Y. 

 BODY:
ABOUT three years ago, David Page had a life-altering brainstorm. It happened in the basement of his restaurant Drovers Tap Room, an offshoot of Home, the West Village place he and Barbara Shinn opened in 1993 and had run ever since.
 It was summer and humid, and miserable in the basement. The air-conditioner was out; the garbage, piled nearby, was going rank. Mr. Page was talking on the phone with a man about running the little vineyard he and Ms. Shinn had just bought on Long Island, the next piece of their Home mini-empire. They were talking salary. 
 "I suddenly realized," Mr. Page said, "that I was going to pay this guy to have a better life than I had." 
So changes were made. And that's why a few weeks ago, instead of working the line in the tiny kitchen at Home or punching figures into a calculator, Mr. Page found himself contentedly driving a green John Deere tractor, hauling a load of bright yellow lugs packed with merlot grapes. Ms. Shinn, who might have been running the front of the house at Home, as she did for almost a decade, was directing a 10-member crew in meticulously handpicking grapes.
This was the first harvest for Shinn Vineyards, and besides representing a shift in lifestyle for Mr. Page and Ms. Shinn, it marked the beginning of their quest to be part of the North Fork's evolution into a major wine region.
The founders of the Long Island wine industry, Alex and Louisa Hargrave, established Hargrave Vineyard, in Cutchogue on the North Fork, in 1973. They planted 17 acres of classic European grapes -- cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir and sauvignon blanc -- in potato fields and soon went on to make commercially acceptable wine. Hargrave was followed by Lenz and Pindar, both in 1979, and Bedell, among others, in 1980.
These early producers set their sights high. Their idea was not only to create successful wines and wineries but also to lay the foundation for an entire wine region. 
Which is where Mr. Page and Ms. Shinn enter the picture. Much as they adore the dusty splendor of North Fork farm country, they did not move there to hang out and make O.K. wine, just as they did not open Home to hang out and make O.K. food.
In their view, the variations in the maritime climate and topography of Long Island can be exploited to make subtle and complex wines that can stand up to wines from almost anyplace in the world.
Mr. Page is 44 years old, and Ms. Shinn is 40. They met in Berkeley, Calif., 15 years ago; he was a cook, she was an artist and a waitress. They moved to New York together in 1990. They had little money and no prospects but a faith in traditional American cuisine that bordered on the evangelical.
They are a deeply earnest couple, like characters in a Robert Redford movie, and they arrived in New York at just the right moment. They scrounged enough cash to open Home on Cornelia Street, then a seedy lane in a city crawling out of recession, and set about educating their little part of the world in the wonders of skillet-fried chicken and homemade ketchup. Some scoffed, found it overly cute, but Home became a beloved institution, albeit a small one, with 30 seats indoors and 30 outdoors.
The economy picked up, comfort food became a fad and Mr. Page and Ms. Shinn were out ahead of it. They began to diversify, opening a takeout shop, Home Away From Home, and Drovers, a bigger, louder, cheaper version of Home. They wrote a cookbook, "Recipes From Home," bought North Fork farmland and entered negotiations to buy a motel and restaurant nearby.
And then they stopped dead in their tracks and ended the negotiations. "As excited as we'd been to get to New York, we just ended up almost losing ourselves, these crazy workaholic days," Ms. Shinn said.
"New York is like a machine," Mr. Page added. "And we became part of it without even knowing we had."
Shortly after coming to New York, they visited the North Fork, fell in love with the produce and wine and started promoting both at Home. In 1996 they were married in a sauvignon blanc block at Paumanok Vineyards in Aquebogue.
Deciding that winegrowing was their future, they sold Drovers and the takeout place, and Mr. Page's brother, Chris, moved to New York from Wisconsin to manage Home. "We needed to hold on to that," Mr. Page said. "It's our cash cow."
Their 22 acres are tucked between Long Island Sound and Route 48 in Mattituck. They sold the development rights to the town of Southold, ensuring that the land would never be built on, and used the money to plant grapes: cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, malbec, petit verdot, semillon, two clones of sauvignon blanc and five clones of merlot.
They have planted 16,000 vines, and hope their first harvest will yield about 500 cases of wine, a tiny amount, which they plan to sell through a mailing list. Though they hope to rise to 2,000 cases within a decade, they will still be a boutique operation, the vineyard equivalent of Home. Ms. Shinn, who served a field internship at Bedell, is the vineyard manager.
This growing season had plenty of what passes for drama in the agricultural world. There was no plague of locusts, but it was a little too dry, and birds and wasps damaged some grapes. When autumn arrived and the fruit got too wet, mold became a prime concern, though not much developed.
"It's like a restaurant -- you know something is going to go wrong; you just don't know in advance what it's going to be," Ms. Shinn said. "The advantage of the vineyard is that it's mother nature -- you can't control it. You just have to relax."
Harvest work is extremely tedious, particularly when you avoid the labor-saving benefits of a picking machine, a choice Mr. Page and Ms. Shinn made: machines don't differentiate between good and bad grapes. 
At dawn, they collected their workers, mostly Guatemalans, from a parking lot in Greenport, 11 miles eastward. They gave each one clippers, and the crew worked down the rows, checking and cutting each cluster and gently laying them into the lugs. Ms. Shinn worked alongside them with her own clippers, occasionally spacing out the workers so that they talked less and picked more. Her Spanish isn't too good; neither is their English. The harvest ran from mid-September through Sunday.
Mr. Page collected the filled lugs, stacked them on a flatbed truck and hauled them to the nearby Lenz Winery, where their winemaker, Eric Fry, works. Eventually, Mr. Page hopes to be his own winemaker, but developing a palate and technical knowledge takes time. So for the foreseeable future he and Ms. Shinn will depend on Mr. Fry, who consults for a dozen vineyards.
Mr. Fry's technical ability is greatly admired on the North Fork. He has worked there for 14 years, and his wines -- red, white and sparkling -- have been quite successful. He is 50 years old, wears a shaggy beard and long hair and is often seen in overalls and shredded Champion sweatshirts. His lack of pretense is so complete that it is practically a pretense. It is on his faith in Long Island that Mr. Page and Ms. Shinn base their own.
"I have a bias against everything Californian," Mr. Fry said with a provocative air. "Those big, clumsy, awkward wines with too many tannins and too much alcohol, I don't care for them. What we're able to do here with our cooler climate is make a subtler wine, with less alcohol and more fruit expression. It's better."
When Mr. Page brought one morning's worth of merlot over to Lenz, the grapes were dumped into a destemmer, which mashed them. The mixture -- juice, skins and seeds -- was pumped into a stainless-steel tank, where yeast was added and the journey toward wine began. After fermentation, it would be transferred to barrels, where it would spend months and maybe years, monitored by Mr. Fry. 
If all goes well, Shinn Vineyards' first vintage should be ready for consumption in late 2004 -- about five years since that epiphany in the Drovers basement.
After his trip to Lenz, Mr. Page loaded the lugs on the flatbed and drove back to his farm. He talked about the mini-empire he had owned in the city and why he didn't miss it.
"What I remember from opening night at Drovers was how many people came up to me and asked what I was going to do next," he said. "It was as if we were at a party to mark the closing, not the opening. I didn't know what to say. But now if anyone ever asks me that question ever again, I can point to the vineyard and say, This is it, nothing comes next."

HEADLINE: U.S. Port Security Plan Irks Europeans 

BYLINE:  By GREGORY CROUCH 

DATELINE: ROTTERDAM, the Netherlands, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Tom Ridge, the United States homeland security director, arrived here today, hoping to shore up support for a program intended to fight terrorism. Instead, he wrestled with disclosures that the European Union was considering disciplining member countries that are taking part in the American program, fearing that it could create havoc in the shipping industry.
 The European Union is concerned about two-country agreements that the Bush administration has reached with eight nations in Europe and Asia, allowing United States Customs officers to select cargo containers for the inspection of hazardous material before they are shipped to the United States. 
 Some of the program's elements, the Europeans fear, could put exporters at a disadvantage and increase congestion and shipping costs on the Continent, according to correspondence between European Union and United States officials. 
Mr. Ridge said the container security initiative by the customs service was intended to prevent terrorists from smuggling a destructive weapon in one of the six million sea containers shipped into the United States each year. He said he was working to resolve some of the issues raised by the European officials.
The European Union is considering the possibility of beginning infringement procedures against countries that have signed on to the initiative, including the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and France, according to Mr. Ridge and union officials. 
"We regret this action because these are our friends and allies," Mr. Ridge said. 
Some European Union diplomats are described as annoyed that the Bush administration chose to approach individual countries to take part in the antiterrorism program instead of making it a Europe-wide effort.
"Customs policy in Europe," Jonathan Todd, a union spokesman, said, "is coordinated by the European Commission."
Mr. Ridge said the Bush administration negotiated agreements with individual countries because this was more expedient. He recalled a conversation with Clifford M. Sobel, the United States ambassador to the Netherlands.
"I've got the port, I've got the government, give me a day or two and we'll make it happen," Mr. Ridge quoted Mr. Sobel as having said, adding that it took a bit longer than that to reach an agreement with Dutch officials.
The Bush administration says the container initiative is a top priority because a nuclear or chemical attack originating in a cargo container could paralyze global shipping, possibly even crippling the world economy for a time.
"This is an issue of national security," a United States Customs spokesman, Dennis Murphy, said. "Our objective is to get this done as quickly as we possibly can. We don't have the luxury of time here."
Rotterdam is the first city to play host to United States Customs officers. Four are currently working alongside Dutch inspectors, developing risk profiles and screening procedures to turn up possible shipments of radioactive substances, biological agents or chemical weapons. 
The inspectors sometimes use a large X-ray device to examine the interior of a container without having to open it. Since the customs officers arrived in September, Mr. Ridge acknowledged, they had yet to find anything.
European Union officials are concerned that the program's incentives favor those ports that sign the agreements and penalize those that either refuse or are too small to take part. For instance, once a cargo container has cleared United States and Dutch inspections in Rotterdam, it is more than likely to have a quicker ride through customs in the United States. But cargo leaving a French port like Marseille, which is not a party to such agreements, can expect to face potential delays when it reaches American shores.
A result, some European officials say, is that companies shipping goods to the United States will start rerouting their cargo to ports like Rotterdam, depriving others of business and potentially creating bottlenecks in some shipping regions.
Customs officials indicated that another European country had agreed in principle to sign the initiative. An announcement could come as early as this week.
A Dutch customs official said his country realized that the United States agreement was not just a way to prevent terrorist attacks. "It's good for business," she said.

HEADLINE: California Pours on the Yield To Draw Investors to Its Bonds 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The difficult part of the biggest municipal bond sale ever finished without a hitch yesterday as the State of California offered investors very high yields on the new bonds.
 The $6.3 billion in California municipal bonds, which is part of a $11.3 billion issue, will pay interest rates on its highest-rated triple A bonds that are as much as a quarter of a percentage point higher than an index of comparable triple A municipal bonds. 
 William M. Fitzgerald, head of fixed-income investing at Nuveen Investments in Chicago, said J. P. Morgan, the lead underwriter, "came out with some higher yields to make sure the deal was going to get on the radar screen."
When asked if the high yields were a lot for California to pay, he said, "Yes, that is a lot. But that is the reason we found it attractive." Nuveen ordered several hundred million dollars of the California bonds. 
Mr. Fitzgerald said that California had to offer a nice premium to buyers because of the difficulty of attracting enough capital to such an enormous bond sale. In addition, he said a higher yield was necessary to overcome investor distaste for the complex structure of the bonds.
The new municipal bonds, issued by the California Department of Water Resources, are needed to pay for electricity bought during the energy crisis of 2000-2001. At the time, the money to pay for the electricity was borrowed from the state's general fund.
The sale of the $6.3 billion part of the bond issue began on Friday with orders from brokerage firms that want to sell the bonds to individual investors, who are likely to be interested in the high tax-exempt yields. The 4.57 percent yield on the uninsured 10-year note in the issue is half a percentage point higher than the taxable 4.07 percent yield on the Treasury's 10-year note. The after-tax yield for an investor in the 30 percent tax bracket is 6.53 percent.
The retail orders totaled $1.5 billion, $775 million for the insured bonds that are rated triple A and $750 million for the bonds that have lower investment grade ratings of A3 from Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ from Standard & Poor's.
Last week, California sold $4.25 billion in floating rate municipal bonds and on Thursday the state will sell the last part of the issue, $715 million in taxable municipal bonds.
Yesterday, J. P. Morgan sweetened the deal a little to attract enough institutional investors to complete the sale of insured and uninsured bonds. So, for example, the 5.14 percent yield on the bond maturing in 2018 offered in the retail sale was raised to 5.21 percent for institutions. Because the demand was so high, that yield was lowered to 5.20 percent in the final pricing.
"The difference between last Friday's yield and today's reflected overall market conditions declining" as interest rates moved higher, said Peter J. Hill, head of public finance at J. P. Morgan. He said that retail investors will get the higher yields set yesterday.
The fees for the underwriters will be $55 million to $60 million.
The interest and principal on the California bonds will be covered by a monthly surcharge on customers of the state's investor-owned utilities. One risk is that there are several lawsuits challenging how the surcharge will be set.
In the Treasury market yesterday, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 4.07 percent, from 4.04 percent Monday, as the price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 6/32 to 102 15/32. The downturn in the bond market came as stocks rose and investors awaited a widely expected interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve today.

HEADLINE: News Corp. and Its Fox Units Have Solid Quarterly Results 

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
The News Corporation reported strong quarterly results yesterday, propelled by torrid growth at the company's cable and broadcast television operations.
 Results at both the News Corporation and its separately traded Fox Entertainment subsidiary, which includes most of the company's United States operations, surpassed analysts' expectations as the companies' television units profited from trends including a modest rebound in the advertising market. 
 The results of all media companies, including the News Corporation, were hurt in the period a year earlier because of the effect of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. That weakness is helping make the latest batch of quarterly results from many media companies appear especially strong. 
The weakness, however, did not obscure the strong performance at each of the company's three main United States television operations: the Fox network, its local broadcast stations and its pay-television channels, which are distributed by cable television and satellite systems.
This summer, the company's Fox broadcast network reversed its ratings slide of recent years with its hit program "American Idol." While the network is still unprofitable, the unit's operating loss narrowed to $8 million in the company's first financial quarter, ended Sept. 30, from $43 million during the quarter a year earlier. The network's revenue increased by 32.5 percent, to $424 million from $320 million in the same interval.
Earlier this year, the News Corporation's Fox News pay-television channel surpassed AOL Time Warner's CNN in the ratings. Led by Fox News, the company's pay-television channels continued to add subscribers even as the company charged cable and satellite operators higher monthly rates for the use of its networks.
Those two trends combined to generate 27.6 percent revenue growth at Fox Entertainment's pay-television operation, to $523 million from $410 million. The unit swung to an operating profit of $83 million in the latest quarter compared with a $16 million operating loss in the period a year earlier.
As the company acquires more local broadcast stations, it is able to consolidate them into local "duopolies" and cut costs. Combined with a resurgence in the advertising market, that strategy pushed operating income at Fox Entertainment's local station group to $209 million, more than double the $78 million figure in the period a year earlier.
"We're extremely pleased with the performance of both the television network and the local stations in the quarter," Peter Chernin, president of both the News Corporation and Fox Entertainment, said through a spokesman yesterday. Mr. Chernin is largely responsible for the companies' day-to-day television operations.
"They both benefited from a stronger advertising environment as well as stronger programming on the network and the benefits of our duopoly strategy in local markets," he said.
Most of the News Corporation's other units did not fare as well as its United States television operations.
The company's filmed entertainment sector, which includes the Fox film studio, reported operating income of $100 million, down from $122 million in the period a year earlier. In the year-earlier quarter, the company released the blockbuster film "Planet of the Apes" and had no comparable hit in the latest quarter.
Operating income declined at the company's newspaper operation, largely because of a price war in Britain.
"The first-quarter results resoundingly confirm the strength of our company," Rupert Murdoch, chairman of both the News Corporation and Fox Entertainment, said in a statement yesterday.
"It is this strategy that saw us through the difficult economic times of the past two years and that now positions us for robust and sustained growth going forward," he added.
For the company as a whole, the News Corporation reported that revenue increased 11.8 percent, to $3.8 billion from $3.4 billion in the period a year earlier. Earnings soared to $162 million, or 12 cents an American depository receipt, from $73 million, or 6 cents an A.D.R., in the quarter a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had predicted earnings of 10 cents a share.
The News Corporation announced its results after the close of the markets in New York. During regular trading, the company's American depository receipts rose 5 cents, to $25.65.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Investors Return to the Office Building Market

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
Investors are pouring more money into commercial real estate this year. But, in an unusual economic environment largely created by the confluence of low interest rates and poor fundamentals, they are concentrating their spending on a narrow universe of well-located office buildings with stable leases. 
 A collective tunnel vision has divided the country into two real estate markets. One market, concentrated mostly in Manhattan and Washington, has high demand for buildings with existing leases that will keep them occupied no matter what happens to the economy over the next few years. The other is characterized by paltry demand for buildings where the leasing market has been deteriorating. 
 The goal is to buy a steady, though not necessarily particularly lucrative, stream of income, according to investors, brokers, money managers, lawyers and analysts who specialize in commercial real estate transactions. 
The trend is evident in a comparison of the changes in the median price per square foot for office buildings nationwide, which has risen only about 2 percent the last year, and the average price per square foot, which has risen about 9 percent, according to data from real estate research firms and interviews with specialists. Sales of prime properties like 399 Park Avenue in Manhattan, which was sold for $1.06 billion this year, skew the average number higher but leave the median largely unaffected.
"Leased buildings are going for higher prices, unleased buildings are almost illiquid," said Steven A. Means, a principal of Means Knaus, an office building investor and developer that is based in Dallas and operates nationally. What buyers want, he said, is a "building leased for an amount of time that people perceive will take them through the dip."
When the change in office building prices is measured by median price per square foot it is evident that "estimates of cash flow are lower, therefore pricing hasn't jumped up as much," said Robert M. White, the president of Real Capital Analytics, a consulting and research firm based in Manhattan that tracks and tries to identify the buyers of properties worth $5 million or more.
The median price per square foot has risen to $154.50 in the nine months ending in September for the 768 building sales tracked by Real Capital Analytics from $151.61 for the 939 buildings tracked in the comparable period a year earlier, an increase of 1.9 percent. When measured on an average price per square foot basis, however, the difference is much greater. The average price per square foot in central business districts rose to $206 in the nine months ending in September from $188 in the comparable period the year before, an increase of 9.5 percent. A similar increase occurred in the suburbs, where the average price per square foot rose to $143 from $132, an increase of 8.3 percent. The building on Park Avenue sold for $630 a square foot, a number that greatly altered the average because the building has 1.25 million square feet of office space.
"It's only for well-located, well-leased, institutional quality properties," said Richard T. Leider, a private developer in the Pacific Northwest. "But for those properties that meet the criteria, there's a lot of demand."
One Boston Place is a fitting example of investors' willingness to pay escalating prices for stable leases. When the Blackstone Group of New York and Walton Street Capital of Chicago bought the 770,000-square-foot office tower in Boston for $184 million in September 2000, 13 percent of the space was vacant, and asking annual rental rates were $60 to $80 a square foot. TIAA-CREF, the large pension system, agreed to buy the building in August for $267 million, an $83 million profit for the previous owners, at a time when 19,250 more square feet had been leased and the building was only 10.4 percent vacant. The sale went through even though rental rates had fallen to $40 to $55 a square foot, dampening the buyer's rate of return.
Private partnerships and local investors have been the most aggressive buyers, according to Real Capital Analytics.
Among real estate investment trusts, SL Green Realty, which concentrates nearly all its investment around Grand Central Station, Penn Station and Times Square, one of the most robust leasing markets in the country, has spent the second most amount on acquisitions. It has bought $483 million of office property so far this year, compared with $339.6 million in all 2001. Only Boston Properties, the buyer of 399 Park Avenue, has spent more, a total of $1.2 billion.
The income that office buildings in general generate has steadily declined in the same period. Nationally, office vacancy rates have risen to 17.2 percent, including sublease space, from 15 percent in January and 9.2 percent in January 2001, according to research by Merrill Lynch. That has pushed average annual asking rents down to $32.18 a square foot, from $33.67 six months ago and $35.65 a year before that.
The firm expects vacancy rates to rise to 17.9 percent by the end of the year and expects rental rates to decline another 5 to 10 percent over the next year and a half.
Investors are clearly eager to get into the office building market, keeping prices stable and rising in those few places with solid leasing fundamentals, like Midtown Manhattan, where opportunities to buy buildings come about infrequently and much of the recent construction has been built for big, solid tenants like Bear, Stearns and Conde Nast, and Washington, where the expanding federal government soaks up more space. Analysts and brokerage firms said there had also been demand for certain buildings in Boston, Miami, San Diego and Philadelphia.
"What's not clear is what's going on elsewhere," said Leonard G. Sahling, a real estate analyst for Merrill Lynch, noting that there have been too few transactions in other markets to make investors' intentions evident (unless the lack of transactions does, in itself, make investors' intentions evident).
Timothy J. Welch, executive managing director of the commercial real estate services concern Cushman & Wakefield, said a market for less well-leased properties was beginning to form as buyers and sellers were coming to accept that the doldrums in the leasing market were lingering and pervasive.
"You can get sellers to sell at prices below what they were holding out for," Mr. Welch said. "Buyers, on the other hand, there's simply more of them."
One reason for the increased investment in office buildings over all is the decline of stock prices. But the primary impetus is low interest rates. What is lost in future income, the theory goes, can be made up in low borrowing costs.
"Because it is a tangible asset, unlike dot-coms, people have more comfort," said Jeffrey A. Moerdler, a real estate lawyer in New York with the firm Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris & Popeo. "People are bidding up the purchase prices by being willing to take a lower rate of return."
Lack of supply has also driven prices higher for certain buildings, analysts said.
"While there's been greater investor demand, there haven't been a lot of properties out there to buy," said Mr. White of Real Capital Analytics. "The prices finally got interesting to sellers, and they're rushing to get office buildings out there."
There were only $15.8 billion worth of office buildings on the market in the first half of this year, compared with $19.1 billion in the period in 2001. In the third quarter of this year, though, $11.6 billion in new offerings emerged.
Patrick J. Corcoran, an analyst who covers commercial mortgage-backed securities and real estate loan and credit issuers for J. P. Morgan Chase, views the escalating prices of certain office buildings as a reward to property owners and developers for suffering the caution of their lenders for the past decade. "Pessimism always rewards you," he said. "The market can look and see that the only problem we've got is a recession, and that is a problem we can fix."

HEADLINE: North Korea Says It May Restart Missile Tests After Talks Fail 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
North Korea warned today that unless relations with Japan are quickly normalized it would resume its testing of ballistic missiles. 
 The thinly veiled threat was issued by an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman less than a week after the first high-level talks between the countries in two years, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, ended in an angry stalemate. 
 The statement today said the "relevant organs" would "reconsider the moratorium on the missile test-fire in case the talks on normalizing the relations between North Korea and Japan get prolonged without making any progress, as was the case with the recent talks." 
North Korea shocked this country in 1998 with a surprise test of a Taepodong intercontinental ballistic missile, which over flew Japan. North Korea said the test was a satellite launching and has refrained from testing for several years. It reaffirmed a self-imposed moratorium on missile testing six weeks ago in a meeting between North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan. 
Mr. Koizumi, who is attending a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, today dismissed the warning, saying it did not figure in any government-to-government communication, and expressed confidence that Japan's diplomatic engagement with the North would bear fruit. "I believe North Korea will not do anything to trample the spirit of the Pyongyang declaration," he said. 
During Mr. Koizumi's one-day meeting with Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader pledged not only to continue to observe its missile test moratorium, but also to abide by all international obligations regarding nuclear weapons. 
The meeting seemed to put the countries on a fast track toward establishing diplomatic relations. Since the demise of the Soviet bloc, North Korea has suffered famines and increasingly severe economic hardships. In preparatory negotiations, Japan offered large financial incentives to the North to change its repressive, militaristic behavior, promising a major aid package in case of normalized relations. 
Since the Sept. 17 meeting, the United States announced that North Korea had acknowledged the existence of a uranium-based nuclear weapons development program, which the United States says violates international commitments made by the North in 1994. 
The principal issue separating Japan and North Korea had been North Korea's kidnapping of 13 Japanese citizens, beginning in the late 1970's, for use as language trainers in a spy program. Washington's insistence that North Korea eliminate its secret weapons program before receiving Japanese economic assistance has revived tensions. 
The five survivors among the 13 kidnapped Japanese, who are now visiting Japan for the first time in a quarter century, have become a political and emotional football. 
Following the stalemated talks with Japan, North Korea has resumed calls to the United States to normalize relations, saying it will surrender its nuclear program if the United States will guarantee the North's security. 
Even as it sends out feelers like these, however, North Korea's official media continue to issue belligerent statements. 
Washington's position means that if North Korea "puts down arms, it will receive sugar," the Workers' Party daily said in an editorial, adding, "This is an unbearable insult."

HEADLINE: Cablevision Speeds Up Access To Digital-Television Service 

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Cablevision Systems, the nation's No. 7 cable provider, announced yesterday that it had significantly accelerated its deployment of digital-television service and that a New York City investment firm had agreed to invest $75 million in the company.
 While Cablevision has been one of the industry's leaders in introducing high-speed cable modem access in recent years, the company has been a laggard in introducing digital service, which can provide additional channels, superior sound quality and on-demand video services. 
 Of the 4.3 million homes the company can serve, barely 1.5 million had access to digital television before last month. Cablevision announced yesterday that it extended its digital capability to 750,000 additional homes last month and plans to offer the service to close to 1 million more homes this month. By the end of November, it plans to offer digital television to about 3.3 million homes in its service area, in and around New York. 
Apparently, that sort of growth attracted the Quadrangle Group.
Cablevision announced that Quadrangle, a private investment firm, had agreed to make its investment in the company in exchange for preferred stock. People close to the deal said that the interest rate associated with those securities had not been determined and that the investment would give Quadrangle the equivalent of less than 2 percent of the company's equity.
Steven Rattner, who was a reporter for The New York Times in the early 1980's before becoming an investment banker, is now one of Quadrangle's managing principals. He is to join Cablevision's board.
"We think the market has grievously undervalued the cable industry in general and Cablevision in particular," Mr. Rattner said in an interview yesterday. "We think Cablevision has great assets and that the market has not realized that." The stock, which traded as high as $76 early last year, closed yesterday at $12.99.
In what appears to be a coincidence, Quadrangle last year tentatively agreed to invest in the new YES cable network, which carries Yankees games, before pulling out of that deal at the last minute. Now, Cablevision is the only cable provider in the New York area that is not carrying YES.

HEADLINE: Sharon Calls for Israeli Elections Within Next 90 Days 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced today that Israel would hold elections early next year, eight months ahead of schedule, as he reluctantly invited an intense political contest that Israeli officials said was likely to freeze any diplomacy on the Palestinian conflict for now. 
 "Everything -- everything -- is now on hold until after the election," a senior Israeli official said. That would include the "road map" for achieving peace and a Palestinian state in 2005 that President Bush recently submitted to Mr. Sharon and the Palestinian leadership. 
 Mr. Sharon's announcement resounded like a starter's pistol, sending adversaries sprinting to microphones and television cameras. Israel's politics, relatively stable through 19 months of unity government, convulsed in a campaign over the country's security and limping economy -- all against the backdrop of a possible attack by the United States on Iraq. 
Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Sharon's chief right-wing rival in the forthcoming elections, who earlier said he was accepting a previous offer to become Mr. Sharon's new foreign minister, criticized Mr. Sharon's stewardship of the economy but refrained from a direct attack on his security policies. 
The leader of the Labor Party, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer, continued to make an issue of the expansion of settlements at the expense of the poor, the reason he gave for leading Labor out of the government last week. "There will be no peace without taking down settlements," said Mr. Ben-Eliezer, the defense minister in the unity government. 
Trying to position himself at the center of Israel's politics, Mr. Sharon criticized rivals to the right and the left as irresponsible or self-interested, forcing him to choose elections as the "least bad option."
Mr. Sharon gave up his attempt to form a majority government five days after the left-of-center Labor Party bolted from his coalition. He accused his potential right-wing allies of making demands to harden policy toward the Palestinians that would have jeopardized Israel's relationship with the United States.
Mr. Sharon also repeated criticism that Labor broke the coalition out of political ambition. Mr. Ben-Eliezer is in a tough three-way race to hold on to his leadership of the party, in a primary set for Nov. 19.
Last week, while trying to tighten his depleted coalition, Mr. Sharon offered the Foreign Ministry to Mr. Netanyahu to shore up his right-wing support and to blunt Mr. Netanyahu's political threat by turning him into a subordinate. 
But Mr. Netanyahu volleyed the political dilemma back at the prime minister by conditioning his acceptance on Mr. Sharon's calling early elections -- accepting the post, in other words, on condition that Mr. Sharon put his own job at risk, and saving the government while ensuring its demise. 
Today, Mr. Netanyahu said his condition had been met. 
From the high-profile platform the prime minister has now given him, Mr. Netanyahu will fight Mr. Sharon for leadership of their party, the Likud. Mr. Netanyahu supports exiling Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, and he opposes creating a Palestinian state.
Mr. Sharon has endorsed the eventual creation of a Palestinian state, and while in favor of exiling Mr. Arafat he has said he is constrained from doing so partly by a promise to Mr. Bush not to harm the Palestinian leader.
Before Mr. Netanyahu formally accepted the Foreign Ministry, Mr. Sharon drew an implicit contrast between his rival and Shaul Mofaz, a former chief of staff who has agreed to serve as defense minister. "He rallied to the flag without preconditions," Mr. Sharon said of Mr. Mofaz. 
Under Israel's parliamentary system, each voter selects a party, not a candidate, in casting a ballot. Seats in the Parliament are then awarded to each party based on their proportion of the national vote. After the election, Israel's president, Moshe Katsav, will select one member of the Parliament -- most likely the leader of the party with the most seats -- to form a new government and serve as prime minister. 
As coalitions have formed and shattered, Israel has had five prime ministers in the last seven years. The first, Yitzhak Rabin, of Labor, was assassinated, shot in 1995 by a Jewish extremist opposed to his efforts to reach peace with the Palestinians. Mr. Ben-Eliezer echoed a campaign theme of Mr. Rabin's from 10 years ago when he said today that it was time for "a change in priorities."
One potential problem for Mr. Ben-Eliezer is that, as Mr. Sharon's defense minister for 19 months, he was a partner in expanding settlements as well as a supporter of Mr. Sharon's other priorities. Israel's left has been all but moribund since February 2001, when Mr. Sharon soundly defeated Ehud Barak, the former Labor prime minister, after Mr. Barak tried and failed to make peace with Mr. Arafat.
Mr. Ben-Eliezer dwelled today on the state of Israel's economy, which is emerging as the foremost issue in the campaign. Buffeted by the worldwide technology collapse and a devastating loss of tourism dollars because of the conflict, Israel is suffering an economic contraction and an unemployment rate above 10 percent.
On Sunday the government issued a report that nearly one in five Israelis and more than one in four Israeli children were living in poverty. The poverty line was set at a monthly income of $934 for a couple with two children.
Mr. Ben-Eliezer's competitors for the Labor post are Haim Ramon, a seasoned politician, and Amram Mitza, the mayor of Haifa and a former general. Both have staked out positions to Mr. Ben-Eliezer's left.
Mr. Sharon is popular nationally, but Mr. Netanyahu, who speaks American-accented English and has cultivated a slashing debate style, has made himself a formidable challenger on the right. 
Mr. Netanyahu was careful to declare today that he did not want "to say anything bad" about the prime minister. But he perhaps did so by implication when he talked about his own plans to run for prime minister, saying, "I intend to form a government of solutions."
Mr. Netanyahu also stressed the state of the economy. "The country is facing imminent economic collapse," he said.
The date for the Likud primary has not been set. But by late December each party must submit to the Parliament its list of those it wants to occupy any seats it wins in the elections, ranked according to the party's preference. The primary must take place before then to establish the rankings. Mr. Sharon and Mr. Netanyahu are competing for the first ranking on the list.
By law, the elections must take place within 90 days. They are expected in late January or early February.
Labor's departure deprived Mr. Sharon of 25 seats in Parliament, leaving him with a minority of 55 seats and vulnerable to a majority vote of no confidence.
Mr. Sharon survived three votes of no confidence, but he faced a future of perpetual dickering in the Parliament to erect other temporary bulwarks against such threats, including a new no-confidence motion filed by Labor over the poverty report. 
Mr. Sharon had tried to turn his new coalition into a slender majority of 62 seats by bringing in the seven seats of the National Union--Israel Beiteinu faction led by a radical nationalist, Avigdor Lieberman. But that effort failed. Mr. Sharon referred bitterly today to a speech on Sunday by Mr. Lieberman in which he said no new unity government should be formed after the elections.
"I will not surrender to political blackmail from any party," Mr. Sharon said, alluding to a "long list of demands" from Mr. Lieberman.

HEADLINE: A Low-Cost Model Is a Big Headache for Ford 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
The Ford Focus might be the most error-prone car in the industry.
 The low-cost car, which was introduced in 1999, has had a total of 11 safety recalls and is the subject of five defect investigations by federal regulators. And two new recalls this week, including a wiring problem that could, in worst-case situations, cause engine fires, raise even more questions. 
 The five pending investigations into the Focus account for at least 7 percent of the entire defect investigation caseload of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, according to official documents. The two most serious investigations involve a suspension problem that causes a loss of steering control and a problem with the fuel tank that leads to stalling. 
Officials at the Ford Motor Company say the two latest recalls, which they initiated, will address some of the problems, including the suspension defect. Company executives have acknowledged that the Focus has had problems since it was brought over from Europe in 1999, but they say newer versions of the car are much improved. 
"It didn't do as well as it should have when it came over from Europe, but we concentrated a lot of resources into improving the quality and reliability," said Todd Nissen, a Ford spokesman. The number of warranty repairs has fallen 40 percent since the car came to the United States, Mr. Nissen added, and one Ford measure says defects are down 35 percent. To reassure new customers, Ford has started offering five-year, 100,000-mile power-train warranties for 2003 models. (The standard bumper-to-bumper warranty is three years, 36,000 miles.)
"Early on it had problems," Mr. Nissen said. "We are still dealing with those problems. These recalls affected the first two model years, but we've improved since then."
Clarence Ditlow, the director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer advocacy group, said Focus was the second-most recalled automobile in the industry's history, after the General Motors X-Car in the 1980's, though Ford officials questioned his calculation. The traffic safety agency does not compile recall data that way.
Mr. Ditlow also believes Focus could potentially be vulnerable to aggressive "lemon laws" in Arkansas, Kansas and Ohio. 
"When you have a car that has so many safety recalls that it might fall within lemon laws, you have a seriously defective vehicle," he said. "It is one of the worst launches of all time."
Problems for the Focus add to Ford's troubles, from plummeting market share to the ravaging effects of a price war, a sinking stock price and lowered credit ratings. It is also trying cut billions of dollars in annual costs while restocking its product lineup and mending its battered reputation on the quality front.
Focus, the 11th-best-selling automobile in the nation last month, is a cornerstone of Ford's product line. William Clay Ford, Jr., the chief executive and Ford family scion, made a personal pitch for Focus in one of his recent TV spots, comparing it to none other than the venerable Model T.
The company pitches Focus as a first purchase for young people, but for some young buyers it has not made a good impression.
Two years ago, Scott Robinson, a 30-year-old intern at an architectural firm in Hawaii, bought a green 2001 Focus ZX3. It was his first new car. 
"I knew it was out in Europe and got really good reviews," he recalled. "I test-drove it and it handled real nice and drove real nice and it seemed like a real nice car. But it turned out to be the car from hell."
His Focus is due back in the shop this week; his visits are so commonplace he is on a first name basis with his dealer. First, there was "the classic brake problem, squealing."
"Then there was the stalling problem," he said. "It stalled twice on the highway. Then I was having problems with the fuel economy. I was only getting 175 miles a tank as opposed to 250 or 300."
He continued. 
"My front disc brakes, my first set wore out in 12,000 miles and now I'm going on my second set and I only have 24,000 miles on my car. Then my front rotors warped; I had to get those changed. And the suspension is making weird noise. But that's the second time I've been in for that."
After all that, Mr. Robinson said that when the car worked "it's a really fun car to drive." 
Indeed, many customers and reviewers praise Focus for ride and handling beyond its starting price of less than $13,000.
"This is one of only a few economy cars we look forward to driving," wrote Csaba Csere, the editor of Car and Driver magazine, in a review that named Focus one of the 10 best cars in the industry. 
For Ford dealers, plenty of problems with Focus mean extra profits from repairs, with Ford paying the bill for recalls and warranty work. But that hardly means they are content. 
"Going back to Firestone, the dealers made money on the recalls," said Jerry Reynolds, owner of Ford dealerships in Texas and Oklahoma and former chairman of the Ford National Dealer Council. He was referring to the safety problems involving Ford Explorers and Firestone tires.
"But also, that's not the way you want to make your money," he added. "You lose customers over it, and you have to do a lot more selling when customers come in to convince them these cars are good cars."

HEADLINE: War and Politics 

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: CAIRO, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
The perception that Washington remains hostile toward Islam is helping drive the victories of some religiously oriented parties across the Islamic and Arab world, experts in the region said today.
 Most Islamist parties have been gradually gaining supporters for years as secular parties have failed to solve grinding economic and social problems. 
 But their sudden gain in votes in recent elections in Pakistan, Bahrain, Morocco and Turkey is being viewed as a sign that voters -- at least in those few countries that actually allow free elections -- want to assert pride in their faith to the outside world.
"The population in Turkey, the population in Pakistan or the population in Morocco did not vote for Islamic parties just because they believe they have the capacity to solve social and economic problems," Muhammad Darif, a professor of political science at the Hassan II University law school at Mohammedia, Morocco, said in a telephone interview. 
"Arab and Muslim populations think the war against terrorism is nothing but a war against Islam, the culture of Islam, the Arab culture," Professor Darif added. "The Islamist parties have been able to exploit this."
The recent election results may serve as an opportunity or a risk for the United States, the experts said. They said working with moderate Islamic groups could give Washington credibility it lacks, while opposing them would only fertilize already blooming anti-American sentiment.
"If the U.S. considers anyone who talks about Islam a criminal and pushes the Turkish military to suppress them, it will deprive itself of an ally," said Abdelmonem Said, the director of Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo, speaking of the victorious Justice and Development Party in Turkey.
Although no single pattern fits all four countries, the results in each of the elections gave religiously oriented parties far larger margins than expected. 
In Turkey, the winning party is likely to be the first in years to be able to govern without a coalition partner, as it is expected to take more than 360 of the 550 seats in Parliament.
Voters in Pakistan and Bahrain last month also gave religious parties a significant voice in their Parliaments. Islamist candidates took 78 of 392 seats in Pakistan's Parliament, while such parties control about half of the 40 seats in the newly elected assembly in Bahrain.
In Morocco, Islamist groups took 42 of 325 seats in elections in September, up from 14 in the last election.
In Bahrain, most of whose people belong to the Shiite branch of Islam, Parliament -- the first elected in nearly 30 years -- would most likely have been completely run by Islamist candidates but for a boycott by the widely popular Shiite organization. It urged voters to stay away to protest constitutional changes that widened the king's powers.
Although the United States Navy fleet for the Persian Gulf region is headquartered in Bahrain, the presence of the base was not even raised as an election issue.
"The government's bad management and poor performance gave the chance to the religious groups to operate and get support," said Sawsan Shair, a columnist for the daily Al Ayam in Bahrain. "Their members have been operating for almost 10 years -- building clinics, sponsoring orphans, distributing aid and food and medicine."
The same is true to an extent in Pakistan, although there hostility toward the American presence in the region, and Gen. Pervez Musharraf's support for Washington's campaign against terrorism, were open campaign issues for the religiously oriented parties.
"Issues of identity and Islamic pride are there, and the war on terrorism was a contributing factor," said Rasul Bakhsh Rais, a professor of political science and international relations at the Lahore University of Management Science. But he and others asserted that it was not the main factor.
"There is a deep sense of betrayal among all Muslim people that their elites, their governments, their institutions have all failed them," Mr. Rais said. "People have moved away from the mainstream parties hoping that the religious political parties will provide them with a better alternative."
In Morocco, the most ardent Islamist groups are banned, so those candidates running were allied with the government and unlikely to attack it outright for any links to the West. But they did manage to get the message across in a subtle way by talking about the need to preserve Islamic identity and protect the Muslim world.
That issue seemed to play little role in Turkey, where the overwhelming sentiment among voters was an ardent desire to throw out of office anyone associated with the country's collapsing economy. 
The Youth Party, for example, which actually ran something of an anti-American, anti-International Monetary Fund platform, failed to make the threshold of 10 percent of the vote needed to get into Parliament.
The victorious party in Turkey, led by men who recast themselves from Islamists to social conservatives, has taken moderate foreign policy positions. It favors continuing membership in NATO and joining the European Union.
Those would be anathema to more radical religiously oriented groups in the region, especially the Muslim Brotherhood, the root stock of all such groups in the Arab world.
"They are isolationist, parochial," said Mr. Said. "Their point of view is that we have to keep in mind that we are in permanent conflict since the time of the Crusades until now."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: CONNECTICUT; 
Rowland Defeats Curry and Wins a Third Term

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Wednesday, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Gov. John G. Rowland won a third consecutive term Tuesday night, a feat not achieved in Connecticut in more than 180 years, defeating his Democratic challenger, William E. Curry Jr.
 At 1 a.m., unofficial returns showed Mr. Rowland ahead by 12 percentage points, 56 to 44, with 97 percent of the 771 election districts reporting. 
 The governor, a moderate Republican, ran a campaign that portrayed him as an experienced, steady executive dedicated to improving the state's relatively high-performing schools, and as a reasonable negotiator who could work with a Legislature led by Democrats but, as he so often put it, "hold the line on spending."
At 10:45, Governor Rowland declared victory to a crowd of supporters at the Hartford Hilton and praised his campaign as "probably the most positive campaign in the United States of America." The 45-year-old governor promised to continue making education a priority, particularly for the 300,000 children he said were born in Connecticut during his last term.
"What we need to do over the next four years is to make sure these 300,000 kids have the best education in the country," he said. "This is a time for us to raise expectations and understand that we can be the best in the country. My commitment to the people of the state is that I will never, ever, let you down." 
Mr. Curry, 50, a former state comptroller who lost to Mr. Rowland by three percentage points in the 1994 race for governor, had attacked his opponent as corrupt and not the right leader for the kind of honest, reform-minded government Connecticut voters really wanted. Mr. Curry's major promises were a $730 million property-tax cut, increased education aid to cities and towns and a clean government free of the kind of insider favors and politics that he accused Mr. Rowland of perpetuating.
Looking bitterly disappointed, Mr. Curry addressed supporters before 10 p.m. Tuesday night at the Polish National Home, a club in Hartford, and said he was deeply proud of his campaign. "I ran on the issues I wanted to," he said. "I wouldn't take back a second of it." 
Despite a solid victory for the governor, experts said Mr. Curry might have had a real chance of beating Mr. Rowland this year -- especially with the state and national economies in turmoil -- had he been able to get his message out to more people, more often. 
However, having raised just $1.3 million -- only one-fourth of Mr. Rowland's campaign treasury and less than even Connecticut's secretary of the state raised for her re-election effort -- Mr. Curry could not compete in the all-important theater of television advertising. 
Mr. Rowland saturated local and even some New York City airwaves with commercials stressing a positive, tranquil message about a Connecticut a step ahead of other states, while Mr. Curry was barely on the screen at all. His last television commercial aired weeks ago, leaving Mr. Curry to run an essentially anachronistic campaign of kissing babies and shaking hands. 
"He never really was able to match Rowland's television ads, and that put him constantly in catch-up mode," said Scott McLean, associate professor of political science at Quinnipiac University, in Hamden. 
Other political experts said Mr. Curry squandered early chances to offer voters alternative to the governor's track record on taxes, urban revitalization, education and health care. 
"If you asked Bill Curry where he stood on some issue, you would hear a five-minute ramble with an answer in there somewhere," Professor McLean said. "He wasn't quotable in ways that would lead Democratic voters to get excited about his campaign." 
Recent polls showed that Governor Rowland had built a consistent 15 to 18 point lead over Mr. Curry in the weeks after the anniversary of 9/11. In early September, Mr. Curry had pulled within 9 percentage points of Mr. Rowland, polls showed, but that was when Mr. Curry's few television commercials were still running, and before the Rowland campaign had spent the majority of its money on October television ads.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: THE VOTERS; 
Guns and Butter and a World of Worries at Ballot Boxes Across the U.S.

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: SALINA, Colo., Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Election Day in this gold-rush town in the Rocky Mountains seemed like a journey to another era. The polling place was a one-room schoolhouse built in the 19th century. Voters greeted one another with hugs, passed around a tin of ginger cookies and did a lot of catching up around a potbellied stove. Outside, the season's first snowfall sparkled beneath the ponderosa pines.
 But when people got talking about politics, the quaint setting was lost to cold calculation and a litany of worries about what was to come. They expressed fears about an attack against Iraq, an economy that seemed stuck in neutral and a federal government that was so deeply divided on critical issues that there might not be a right choice at the ballot box. 
 "If you don't have a strong home, you have no business messing with your neighbor," said Bret Gibson, chief of the volunteer fire department, who worried that the country was too conflicted on domestic matters to take on Iraq. 
"It is easier being the fire chief here because my wife is very supportive," Mr. Gibson said, "but if she weren't, I would have to work on that before going to fight fires far from here."
Colorado was one of those states with a tight Senate race that might help tip the balance of power in Washington. People here, like voters in a half-dozen or so other states with tight matchups, said that significance weighed heavily upon them as they made ballot choices today. 
Mr. Gibson voted for Senator Wayne Allard, a Republican, because he did not like the Democrat, Tom Strickland. But he said he had seriously considered Mr. Strickland because of the possible impact of the race on the Senate. Though a Republican, Mr. Gibson said he wanted to see the Senate remain in Democratic hands in the hope it would prevent President Bush from attacking Iraq. He finally convinced himself that control of the Senate would not come down to the outcome of the Colorado contest.
It was that sort of Election Day across the country. Voters weighed issues, but also played the odds. Some remained true to their partisan leanings; others sacrificed ideology to some larger good or strategy. Still others, worn weary by the back-and-forth on the national stage, narrowed their focus to strictly local matters. As they have in the past, people almost everywhere complained about negative advertisements and the absence of substance in the political debate.
"I'm not sure anyone, Republican or Democrat, has an answer," said Joel Wexelman, who cast his ballot early this morning in a suburb of St. Louis. "The problem is the lack of overall focus on addressing problems. Not the party line."
The Senate race in Missouri was one of the most watched in the country, as Senator Jean Carnahan, the Democrat, faced a fierce challenge from Jim Talent, a former congressman who had the strong backing of Mr. Bush. Despite predictions that cold rain would keep voters away, polling stations reported a high turnout most of the day.
Susan Newman, who voted at Wydown Middle School in Clayton, a suburb bordering St. Louis, said she was drawn to the polls by Mrs. Carnahan. The senator was appointed two years ago after her husband, Gov. Mel Carnahan, died a few weeks before the election but still finished first. Ms. Newman said she wanted to preserve Mrs. Carnahan's "centrist voice" in the Senate and also keep the Carnahan imprint on Missouri politics.
"I'm here because I'm concerned that people have a general anxiety about what's happening in our country today, the economy, 401(k)'s, the possibility of war," Ms. Newman said. "People are anxious but not angry yet. Anxiety paralyzes you. You sit back and let it happen. It's too easy to let the status quo sweep over you."
At the same polling place, Tom Currier described himself as a regular voter who had planned to cast a ballot today no matter what the national significance of the Carnahan-Talent contest. But Mr. Currier expressed fatigue with politics and what he characterized as "secrecy in Washington." He was especially upset that Vice President Dick Cheney's dealings with Enron, the troubled energy company, had not been fully disclosed.
But like many voters, Mr. Currier was not immobilized by his worries. He said he was passionate about some local ballot measures that would affect taxes on cigarettes, home rule in St. Louis and policies related to the construction of power plants. 
"The hot-button issues to me are the environment and the economy," he said.
In many states there were competitive statewide races, but not the neck-and-neck Senate contests found in Colorado and Missouri. That gave voters more leeway to consider other priorities when marking their ballots.
In Burlington, Iowa, the coffee shop in the Hy-Vee grocery store was a popular stop for voters. The discussions over biscuits, gravy and cheese omelets were not about power brokering in Washington. Instead voters moaned about plant closings, job layoffs, the high cost of medical care, illegal immigration and a general sense of insecurity since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.
"I voted for a lot of nonincumbents, just because I am sick of the ones that are in there," said Randy Augustine, a construction worker. "I don't care who they are, either party. I think we need to get some new faces in there. Get rid of these guys."
Bill Cook, clerk at a furniture rental store, was among a group of retirees and near-retirees that talk politics at the coffee shop every morning at 9. It being Election Day, the chatter was especially intense. They pulled several small square tables together to make the conversation easier.
Mr. Cook said he almost always voted a split ticket. "I try to find the merits of each candidate and go from there," he said.
In this election, Mr. Cook and his friends were influenced mostly by state and local issues, especially the problems with the slumping economy in Iowa. "Me being a working man, they pushed me toward the Democrats," Mr. Cook said. "Since big business seems to be abandoning our area, I support the Democrats."
Across the country in New Hampshire, the race to succeed Senator Robert C. Smith was one of those considered too close to predict. Political calculation was certainly at work for some voters, but so was the memory of the presidential election in 2000. Gregory Burks, a waiter in downtown Concord, said that that election had convinced him to vote after he had sat out many elections.
"Before, it was just voter apathy, but Florida cured that," Mr. Burks said. "Now it's part of my civic duty."
Mr. Burks listed three priorities in the election: abortion rights, state taxes and school reform. Based on those issues, he voted for Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, the Democrat for Senate, and for Craig Benson, the Republican for governor.
But like many other voters who were interviewed today, Mr. Burks said he worried that the issues most important to him would be overshadowed by the possibility of war with Iraq. He suggested that politicians in Washington were using Saddam Hussein as a convenient distraction.
"The reason we will attack Iraq is to keep domestic issues at bay," he said. "If they can focus your attention somewhere else, you will forget what is really going on."
That sentiment was echoed in the one-room schoolhouse here in Colorado. Gretchen Acharya, an art teacher, said she was voting against "government by diversion." Ms. Acharya's mind was mostly on her 20-year-old son, a student at a nearby community college. "I am not willing to send him off to die," she said.
Bill Jones, a Republican poll worker at the schoolhouse, had a much more menacing view of Saddam Hussein, likening him to Hitler and suggesting he needed to be stopped. Mr. Jones said he voted along party lines, mainly because he is a member of the National Rifle Association, and the organization backed the Republicans. Even so, he said he was also suspicious of the war talk in Washington, and he hoped the election would be close.
"A one-vote majority either way would not be bad," he said. "I guess I am a cynic, but I don't trust any of them."
Vanessa Reich-Henbest, who turned 18 on Sept. 11 and was voting for the first time today, described the election process as exciting if flawed. She had not thought much about Iraq but said the hardest part was getting straightforward information about the candidates. Money played too big a role, she said, and advertisements were nasty and deceptive.
In the end, those drawbacks were not enough to keep Ms. Reich-Henbest from voting. Elsewhere, though, the negative campaigns were believed to have soured voters and even lowered turnout.
In Apopka, Fla., Sandra Green, who is retired, said she voted for Gov. Jeb Bush and favored a Republican majority in the House and Senate. But Ms. Green said she was disappointed that none of the candidates seemed to speak to her concerns, including prescription drugs.
"The candidates should stick with the issues and not run everybody down," she said. "It hurts when they do that."
In North Carolina, where Elizabeth Dole, the Republican, and Erskine B. Bowles, the Democrat, slugged it out for the Senate, Rhonda Harmon said she would have nothing to do with it.
She sat out Election Day.
"All of it was negative, it was just, 'He did this,' 'She did this,' " Ms. Harmon, a collections agent for Bell South, said while eating lunch with friends in Greensboro. "I still don't know what they stand for."

HEADLINE: S.E.C.'s Embattled Chief Resigns In Wake of Latest Political Storm 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Harvey L. Pitt resigned tonight as the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission after a political firestorm over his selection of the head of a new board overseeing the accounting profession.
 Mr. Pitt announced his resignation just before 9 o'clock as polls were closing nationwide. For days, he had insisted he would continue to serve as long as he had the confidence of the president. At the same time, White House officials strained to try to keep the growing crisis at the agency from becoming a political issue that would remind voters of Washington's response to corporate scandals. The officials publicly voiced support for him but privately expressed deep anger about his stewardship. 
 Administration officials said tonight that Mr. Bush had not requested Mr. Pitt's resignation but that White House officials welcomed it, particularly because Mr. Pitt had created a new round of political difficulties for Republicans in the days leading up to the election. 
Mr. Pitt's leadership of the agency had grown increasingly tenuous in recent months with a series of political missteps, including a widely ridiculed effort over the summer to insert a provision in the corporate antifraud legislation that would raise his pay and elevate his status to that of cabinet level. 
His hold over the agency cracked last Thursday with the disclosure that he had failed to tell either the White House or the four other commissioners at the S.E.C. that he had known that William H. Webster, the new accounting board chairman, had headed the audit committee of a company accused of fraud. Mr. Webster, who was recruited for the post by the White House, was approved by the commission 10 days ago in a bitterly divided vote in which two of the five commissioners said he was unqualified for the job.
The disclosure that Mr. Pitt withheld information about Mr. Webster's ties to the ailing company, U.S. Technologies, led to the immediate start of three investigations into Mr. Pitt's handling of the selection of the new board, including a Congressional inquiry that was preparing for three days of Senate hearings this month. A fourth inquiry, by the S.E.C., is examining Mr. Webster's work for U.S. Technologies, which is virtually insolvent and the subject of a criminal investigation. 
"Unfortunately, the turmoil surrounding my chairmanship and the agency makes it very difficult for the commissioners and dedicated S.E.C. staffers to perform their critical assignments," Mr. Pitt said in a letter to President Bush. "Rather than be a burden to you or the agency, I feel it is in everyone's best interest if I step aside now, to allow the agency to continue the important efforts we have started.
A woman who answered the phone at Mr. Pitt's residence this evening said, "I'm sorry, we're not taking any calls right now."
A White House spokeswoman, Claire Buchan, said "this was his decision," speaking of Mr. Pitt's decision to step down. She added that no interim successor had been selected. 
In his letter, Mr. Pitt said he would leave "as soon as I can help your staff ensure a smooth transition of leadership."
Among the people being considered to succeed him are Richard C. Breeden, a former S.E.C. chairman under the first President Bush; Michael Chertoff, the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division at the Justice Department; James Doty, a securities lawyer who was S.E.C. general counsel under Mr. Breeden and represented George W. Bush before he became governor of Texas; Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor; Joseph A. Grundfest, a former S.E.C. commissioner who now teaches at Stanford Law School; Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma; and Frank Zarb, the former chairman of Nasdaq. 
Mr. Pitt is only the second chairman of the S.E.C. to resign abruptly because of political turmoil. In 1973, G. Bradford Cook resigned 74 days after taking office during part of the Watergate-related scandals. He had been accused of deleting references from an S.E.C. injunction to a secret $200,000 cash contribution made by the financier Robert L. Vesco to the Committee to Re-elect the President.
Mr. Pitt's announcement tonight was an embarrassing ending for his government career. He was the 26th chairman in the agency's history, was unanimously confirmed by the Senate last year and was widely praised as one of the most experienced securities lawyers in the nation.
"It's a terrible personal tragedy but the appropriate thing for an agency that he and so many people love," said Joel Seligman, the dean of the law school at Washington University in St. Louis and author of a history of the commission. "It's important for the economy that the agency not be a target of ridicule but that it get back to work and restore investor confidence in the markets."
Mr. Pitt had served the agency in the 1970's with distinction, rising as a protege to Stanley Sporkin, one of the legendary prosecutors at the agency, to become the youngest general counsel in the commission's history. He left in 1978 to lead one of the most lucrative private practices on Wall Street as a partner at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson.
But his close ties to the accounting profession that he once represented, his slow response to the growing crisis in the markets and a series of political gaffes eroded his support and ultimately caused the White House to lose confidence in him.
Neither the first or even second choice of Mr. Bush, Mr. Pitt assumed office in August 2001, a few weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center prompted a crisis by forcing the major markets to shut down. He was widely praised for moving swiftly to help coordinate the reopening of the markets.
But a few weeks later, he outlined a conciliatory approach to the American Association of Certified Public Accountants, and his words came back to haunt him when a series of accounting frauds led to the collapse of some of the nation's largest companies, including Enron and WorldCom.
After Enron's collapse put auditors in the spotlight, Mr. Pitt called for the commission to create a new accounting oversight panel to replace an ineffective one already in place. But Mr. Pitt failed to tell that board's members about his plan before discussing it with leaders of the accounting industry. The angry board resigned in January, and some members accused Mr. Pitt of being too protective of the accounting industry.
The missteps continued.
Last April, Mr. Pitt met privately with the chief executive of the accounting firm KPMG while it was being investigated by the S.E.C. for the work it did for Xerox.
In July, he privately urged lawmakers to elevate his office to cabinet rank, on a par with the secretary of state and attorney general. The plan, which was ridiculed by Democrats, was quickly disavowed by the White House, which apparently had been unaware that he had planned to propose it.
The latest furor began early last month, when Mr. Pitt backed away from naming John H. Biggs, a widely respected chief executive of the investment plan TIAA-CREF and vocal advocate for stricter accounting rules, to head the new accounting panel. Mr. Biggs has said Mr. Pitt vowed in September to support him. But he said Mr. Pitt backed down after members of the accounting profession complained that he was too aggressive.
When senior Congressional Democrats reacted angrily to reports about Mr. Biggs's treatment, Mr. Pitt breached political protocol by attacking them with uncharacteristic bluntness.
"Their facts are wrong," he told reporters in Brussels. "They don't know what they're talking about." 
Ignoring his critics and making no effort to find a consensus candidate, Mr. Pitt selected Mr. Webster to fill the top post on the audit panel. But officials said he then failed to tell the commission, and the White House, about Mr. Webster's experience at U.S. Technologies.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 22, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Nov. 6 about the resignation of Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, omitted attribution for quotations critical of Democratic lawmakers that Mr. Pitt made during an October trip to Brussels. They were from The Wall Street Journal.

 Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican completing his first term, defeated his Democratic opponent, Charlie Matulka, a construction worker who lacked money and name recognition. Mr. 
Hagel has established himself as an expert on foreign policy, a conservative who speaks his mind, as he did when he said President Bush appeared "hellbent" on war with Iraq and needed to focus on economic problems. 
 Gov. Mike Johanns, a Republican, won re-election, defeating Stormy Dean, the Democratic candidate. In a low-key style, Mr. Johanns guided the state through fiscal difficulties. He opposed casino gambling in the state, while Mr. Dean pushed for expanded gambling, saying it would reduce property taxes.

New Jersey has more money than most states, more corporate headquarters, and more M.B.A.'s and S.U.V.'s, status symbols long associated with a Republican world view. But this year they have symbolized the rise of New Jersey's Democrats. 
 In defiance of patterns that were once political gospel, New Jersey has become more Democratic as it has become wealthier, more suburban and more educated. 
 Today, the state gave Frank R. Lautenberg a resounding victory as his Republican opponent, Douglas R. Forrester, lost nearly all the advantage he had built when he was running against Senator Robert G. Torricelli just a few months ago. 
That was no surprise in a race between a well-known former senator and a political newcomer chosen by a state Republican Party in such disarray that it could not persuade its most popular leaders to run. Mr. Lautenberg had the mantle of incumbency, even though he had been retired for two years, and limited scrutiny in his 35-day campaign.
But his victory also reflected bigger changes in what John B. Judis and Ruy Teixeira, the authors of "The Emerging Democratic Majority," have called "the nation's pre-eminent suburban, post-industrial state." 
New Jersey is, they say, one of many increasingly suburban states where the Republican franchise is weakening, a trend in the Northeast, the West Coast and parts of the Midwest, including Illinois, largely because of Chicago's ever-expanding suburbs.
But New Jersey is "exhibit No. 1" in the changing politics of the Northeast, said Mr. Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a liberal research group. "A lot of these places are on the knife's edge, but New Jersey is not," he said. "It's pretty far gone." 
That much was clear a year ago, when the Democrats took over the governor's office and the General Assembly and won half of the State Senate seats. Trenton had been dominated for eight years by Republicans, led by Gov. Christie Whitman, but at the same time the party was struggling in national and Congressional elections.
After voting for Republicans in six straight presidential elections, New Jersey gave Bill Clinton a slim margin in 1992 and 54 percent of the vote in 1996. In 2000, Al Gore won 56 percent of the vote, to 40.6 percent for George W. Bush. The state continued to elect Democrats to the Senate, as it had done since 1972. 
Many of those Democratic votes have come, as always, from Newark, Jersey City, Camden and the other urban areas where the party was perfecting its already formidable get-out-the-vote machinery. They are largely responsible for the Democrats' registration advantage, 25 percent to 19.6 percent for the Republicans, across the state. 
But many other Democratic votes have come from relatively new arrivals in formerly Republican strongholds, said James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "As a consequence of sprawl and of new populations moving into the counties that were once rural and Republican," Mr. Hughes said, "there's been a gradual transition to a more diverse political base." 
Mr. Hughes, who writes extensively on New Jersey's demographic trends, sees the most pronounced changes in the fast-growing central counties that he calls "the wealth belt." The boom there, led by growth in the pharmaceutical industry, has helped give New Jersey the nation's highest median household income.
It has not made these formerly Republican counties more Republican, however. Rather, Mr. Hughes notes, they have drawn affluent, well-educated voters very likely to be among the 56 percent of New Jerseyans who are politically unaffiliated. 
"It's not that they're in love with Democratic candidates," he said. "But the Democrats have put the specter out there: if you give Republicans full control of the federal government, those are policies far to the right of most New Jerseyans." 
Those suburban voters, it turned out, were especially concerned about the issues that Mr. Lautenberg, and Senator Torricelli before him, advertised like a three-part cheer: abortion rights, gun control and environmental protection.
Mr. Teixeira said that with the state's economic boom, "all of North and Central Jersey were becoming one big ideopolis" -- a term that he and Mr. Judis coined to identify an urbanizing area with a common political culture. 
"Professionals were playing a much bigger role in politics and the economy," Mr. Teixeira said, and were joined in their Democratic voting tendencies by "a coalition of women, minorities and more progressive blue-collar workers." 
Cliff Zukin, the director of the Star-Ledger/Rutgers Eagleton Poll, has an additional explanation: Younger people joining the electorate are increasingly Democratic in their allegiances. "We call it generational replacement," he said, and it has gradually expanded the party's base. 
Of course, these shifts have not routed the state Republican Party, however discombobulated it is right now. State Senator Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr., the state party chairman, pointed out tonight that the party still has "half of the State Senate seats, nearly half of the Congressional delegation, half of the county boards of chosen freeholders."
Senator Jon S. Corzine, who ran far behind Mr. Gore in 2000 even while outspending his Republican opponent by more than 10 to 1, pointed that out as he celebrated tonight.
"I don't think Republicans in New Jersey stand with Trent Lott," he said. "When the Republicans put up a moderate candidate in New Jersey, I think we have very competitive races."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: THE FLORIDA VOTE; 
Bush Wins 2nd Term With Surge

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Gov. Jeb Bush today became the first Republican governor in Florida history to win re-election, after a campaign that seemed to have as much to do with his brother, the president, as it did with his own first term in office. 
 With 97 percent of the vote counted, the governor was leading his opponent, Bill McBride, 56 percent to 43 percent. 
 Mr. McBride called Governor Bush to concede, and President Bush called to congratulate his brother. 
In declaring victory, Governor Bush said: "Fifteen minutes ago, Bill McBride called me and graciously conceded the election, and I told him that he ran a hard race and that I look forward to working with him to build a better Florida. Now is the time to unite us as a state, and I appreciate Mr. McBride's contribution to the political process.
"I want to thank my mother and dad for being my inspiration in life. And I want to thank our great president of the United States for coming down and lending a hand to his little brother."
The governor pledged to diversify the state's economy, improve child support for working mothers, reduce domestic violence and protect the developmentally disabled in his next term.
"I will not let you down," he said. "I will work as hard as I can."
Mr. McBride said he had wished Mr. Bush well and added: "What I talked about all during this campaign is consensus building and family and treating Florida like a family. This was an election about choosing the head of the Florida family for the next four years. And I want all of you to consider that and consider your support and your help because the new head of the Florida family, this governor, needs support."
Despite fears that electoral problems seen in 2000 and in the Democratic primary this year would be repeated, voting went smoothly.
Frequent campaign visits by top Republicans and Democrats, including President Bush and former Vice President Al Gore, revived memories of the election debacle in 2000 and pointed to the state's importance in 2004. But voters today said they were looking beyond the hanging-chad chaos of the 2000 election and were instead focused on education, the economy and terrorism. 
Florida voters handed the governor a huge challenge by approving an initiative to limit class sizes in the state's public schools. The initiative passed, 53 percent to 47 percent. 
The measure, Amendment 9, would change the Florida Constitution to require the state to give schools enough money to reduce substantially the number of students in classes over eight years. Mr. Bush opposed the measure, contending that it had a price of more than $27 billion and that Florida could not afford it. Mr. McBride supported the measure, but provided few details about how he would pay for it beyond a 50-cents-a-pack cigarette tax that would have only generated about $1 billion a year.
In an unguarded moment in the campaign, Mr. Bush said he had a "devious plan" for dealing with the class-size issue if the measure was approved. He later apologized for the remark. 
Anita McCann, a saleswoman from West Palm Beach, said she voted for Mr. Bush because of the education issue. "I realized during the last debate in Orlando McBride doesn't know where he's going to get his money." Ms. McCann said. "That made me turn."
Mr. Bush will also have to contend with a potential shortfall in the state budget, pressure from older-citizens groups for more aid to pay for the rising costs of prescription drugs and a host of environmental issues affecting the Everglades and the state's coastline.
The campaign had been viewed by the national Democratic and Republican Parties as somewhat of a preview of the 2004 presidential race 
"It's the beginning point for 2004, on everything from voter turnout to issues," said Susan MacManus, a political scientist at the University of South Florida. "Neither party feels they can win the presidential election without Florida's electoral votes."
In Governor Bush's hotel suite, Mr. Bush and his parents, former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, monitored the election results and played a bit of political family trivia.
Jim Towey, a friend of Jeb Bush and director of the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, was looking at county-by-county numbers for the 2000 presidential election and he and the governor were comparing how George W. Bush did in 2000 compared with the governor's performance this year.
"Does it mean that you're better than George," Barbara Bush asked.
"No, it means we're using him as a benchmark," the governor replied.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: THE GOVERNOR; 
Pataki Coasts to a 3rd Term; McCall Is a Distant Second

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki, a pragmatic Republican who ran a campaign intended to appeal as much to liberals as to conservatives, was elected to a third term yesterday with a solid majority, ending the quest of the Democratic challenger, H. Carl McCall, to become the state's first black governor.
 In other New York races, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer obliterated his Republican opponent, Dora Irizarry, to win a second term, firmly establishing himself as one of the brightest young stars in the state Democratic Party and a possible candidate for governor. 
 The closest statewide race in New York was for comptroller. Alan G. Hevesi, the Democratic nominee and a former city comptroller, squeaked by John J. Faso, the former Republican leader in the State Assembly, winning with 50 percent of the vote to Mr. Faso's 47 percent. 
In New Jersey, Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democrat, was elected to the Senate by a comfortable margin, and in Connecticut, the Republican governor, John G. Rowland, was returned to office easily. Pages B1 and B16. 
Mr. Pataki declared victory at 11:15 p.m. and profusely thanked all 18 million New Yorkers for their confidence in his policies.
"There are no stronger, better people than New Yorkers," Mr. Pataki said, as supporters cheered. "And when we are united, when we stand together, we can accomplish miracles. And it's been my goal as governor not to be the governor of some, but to be the governor of all."
His victory makes him only the third Republican to win more than two terms in New York, putting him in a class with Thomas E. Dewey and Nelson A. Rockefeller. 
Mr. McCall went down in defeat after running a campaign that failed to raise enough money to mount a viable challenge to Mr. Pataki and could not hold onto the traditional Democratic base. Mr. McCall also made several pivotal mistakes in the final weeks of campaigning that kept him from cutting Mr. Pataki's lead, political strategists said.
Although Mr. McCall wanted to make history as the first black governor, he came dangerously close last night to making history in another way, as the Democratic candidate who received the smallest percentage of total votes in modern history for a statewide race. That record was held by Peter F. Vallone, who got 33 percent of the vote four years ago in the governor's race. The only major party candidate to do worse in modern times was Pierre Rinfret, the Republican candidate in 1990, who got 21 percent of the vote.
With 98 percent of election districts reporting, Mr. Pataki had 50 percent of the vote, Mr. McCall 33 percent and Tom Golisano, the Independence Party candidate, 14 percent, with minor party candidates picking up another 3 percent. The Liberal Party failed to get the 50,000 votes it needed to automatically remain on the ballot for future elections.
The race was the most expensive in the state's history, with the major candidates expending more than $131 million. 
Mr. McCall, 67, conceding defeat last night, said that while he wished the governor well, the schools and flagging economy still needed attention. "If we could just put the same effort and the same level of passion and energy and funding into governing as we put into campaigning," he said, "things would be a lot better."
Mr. Golisano, 60, a Rochester billionaire who has run three times for governor, spent more than $65 million of his own fortune and came in third. He said before the polls closed that he felt he had won a moral victory by attacking what he considers inertia, waste and fraud in state government.
He conceded shortly after 11 p.m., but did not congratulate the governor in his speech. "If we achieved anything," he said, "it's for the next several years, the two-party system in this state has got to keep their eye out on us, because we're going to be watching them."
Mr. Pataki, who is 57, coasted to a third victory by taking credit for cutting income taxes, winnowing the welfare rolls and reducing crime. He talked up several liberal programs that expanded under his watch, among them health insurance for poor children and their parents.
Yet the governor did not offer an agenda for his next term as governor, an office with an annual salary of $179,000. Nor did he present concrete plans for confronting the deep financial crisis the state faces next year, including a yawning $5 billion budget gap. He stressed his experience instead, saying he had handled a similar crisis in 1995 and could be trusted to do so again.
It remained unclear whether Mr. Pataki had achieved the kind of crushing victory that could transform him into a contender for national office. He won with 54 percent of the votes in 1998 against Mr. Vallone, but he faced a much more formidable campaign this year by Mr. Golisano.
The election was a defining moment in the career of an adaptable politician who has evolved over his first two terms. He first ran in 1995 as a conservative who promised to slash income taxes, revamp welfare and restore the death penalty. But he has taken on more and more liberal causes over the years, championing tight gun-control laws, an equal-rights bill for homosexuals and expansion of Medicaid benefits to cover indigent children, to name a few.
He won this year in part because of his aggressive pursuit of traditionally Democratic voters, especially Latinos and union members. At the Hilton New York Hotel in Midtown last night, several hundred happy Republican campaign workers and Pataki supporters stood around the ballroom, eagerly awaiting the governor's anticipated victory speech. Some danced to loud rock music or shrieked with pleasure as the returns rolled in. "The bottom line is people know him, they like him, they trust him," Michael McKeon, the governor's chief spokesman, said.
The mood was more subdued at Mr. McCall's headquarters in a union hall downtown, where prominent Democrats were taking some solace in the thought that their candidate had run a good campaign with the resources he had.
"I think it's very important to recognize that no campaign is perfect, no winning campaign is perfect," said former Mayor David N. Dinkins, a longtime friend of Mr. McCall. "We should not be so quick to condemn this campaign."
Yet other McCall supporters also talked of betrayal by the National Democratic Party for not pumping more money into the New York race, and were already second-guessing campaign strategies, even as they praised their candidate.
The race failed to inspire many voters, as turnout across the state was light to moderate. In New York City, some Democrats expressed disappointment with Mr. McCall's candidacy even as they voted for him.
Lacking a big campaign treasury, Mr. McCall had turned to his Democratic allies for help and support, especially Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, who has been Mr. McCall's mentor for decades. 
Bill Clinton and his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, both campaigned hard for Mr. McCall in the closing days. Senator Charles E. Schumer endorsed Mr. McCall early on and appeared in an advertisement, warmly recommending him to voters. So did Mr. Clinton. 
In a sense, Mr. McCall ran an old-fashioned partisan campaign, laboring to persuade moderate Democrats who support Mr. Pataki to come back home. 
But the governor presented himself as a nonpartisan liberal, despite having run as a tax-slashing conservative in 1994. He rarely mentioned his party on the hustings, but repeated a mantra about unity and wanting to be "the governor of all the people." He attracted a significant number of prominent Democratic supporters to his camp. 
Mr. Pataki also benefited from history. The governor's popularity soared after Sept. 11, as New Yorkers, and Americans across the country, rallied around their leaders. What had seemed a winnable race for the Democrats became much tougher overnight, strategists said.
Mr. Pataki seldom spoke of his high profile role after the attacks, but other Republicans praised his leadership frequently at campaign rallies, and he often appeared in front of a giant American flag. 
Toward the end of the campaign, Mr. Pataki adopted a frontrunner's strategy, issuing no position papers and refusing to debate unless the full slate of candidates for governor were included. 
Mr. McCall, meanwhile, tried to run on two main themes: that the governor had failed to improve the state's schools and had not had any success lifting the upstate economy from the doldrums.
Last night, Mrs. Clinton praised Mr. McCall, saying he had set a wonderful example. "This is a man," she said, "that you should tell your children and grandchildren about."

BYLINE:  Nichole M. Christian, John H. Cushman Jr., Sherri Day, Sam Dillon, Neil A. Lewis, Robert Pear, Terry Pristin, Philip Shenon, Jacques Steinberg and Leslie Wayne contributed to this report.

 BODY:
In a state long dominated by Republicans, the incumbent senator, Larry E. Craig, defeated his Democratic challenger, Alan Blinken, ambassador to Belgium in the Clinton administration. This will be Mr. 
Craig's third Senate term. 
 One of the more conservative members of the Senate, Mr. Craig stumbled briefly during the campaign when he said he believed that terrorists of Al Qaeda were in Idaho. Still, he went into the election with polls showing him with a 30 percentage point lead. 
 Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, the Republican incumbent was also re-elected by a comfortable margin, overcoming a feisty challenge from Jerry Brady, an Idaho Falls newspaper publisher.
Governor Kempthorne ran advertisements showing himself shoulder-to-shoulder with President Bush, while Mr. Brady, who inched up in the polls in the final days, blamed the governor for Idaho's economic woes.

Ex-Steward Of Olympics Wins Governor

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney, a Republican businessman who was in charge of the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics, was elected governor of Massachusetts today, defeating Shannon O'Brien, the Democratic state treasurer.
 With 66 percent of the precincts counted, Mr. Romney had won 52 percent of the votes to 43 percent for Ms. O'Brien, 763,153 votes to 640,423. 
 Mr. Romney, 55, won after the most expensive political race in Massachusetts history in which the two candidates had been in a virtual dead heat in the polls for the last week. 
Mr. Romney emphasized his business experience as the leader of Bain Capital, an investment firm, and his success in the 2002 Winter Olympics, appealing to voters as a political outsider who could fix a huge state budget shortfall and bring jobs to Massachusetts. 
"We took on an entrenched machine and we won," Mr. Romney said in his acceptance speech.
In winning, Mr. Romney overcame two handicaps. He ran as a Republican in a largely Democratic state, and he is a Mormon in a heavily Roman Catholic state.
Mr. Romney's victory was also a personal vindication after he lost a race for the United States Senate in 1994 to Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Mr. Romney's father, George Romney, was governor of Michigan who made an unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1968.
Some Democrats initially expressed skepticism that Mr. Romney would serve out his term as governor of Massachusetts and was simply using the election as a steppingstone to become Republican candidate for vice president or even president. But these doubts did not seem to influence voters, and Mr. Romney carried even such urban Democratic strongholds as Brockton and Quincy.
Mr. Romney will replace Jane M. Swift, the acting governor, a widely unpopular Republican who inherited the job when Gov. Paul Cellucci resigned after President Bush nominated him to be United State ambassador to Canada. Ms. Swift, who had been lieutenant governor, had been expected to run as the Republican candidate for governor this fall until Mr. Romney, sensing her weakness, returned from Utah after the Olympics and drove her out of the race.
Mr. Romney will face a severe state budget crisis, with tax revenue taking the biggest plunge in 50 years, said Michael J. Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a nonpartisan research group backed by businesses.
After a decade of rapid economic growth, Massachusetts legislators had embarked on ambitious programs combining tax cuts with increased spending for education and health care. But with capital gains and income tax revenue in free fall, the new governor's main task will be to slash state spending and try to balance the budget.
In television advertisements, Mr. Romney said his business experience would help him balance the budget and cut state taxes while attracting new businesses and jobs. Ignoring the fact that Republicans have been governor of Massachusetts for the last 12 years, Mr. Romney also promised to "clean up Beacon Hill," the location of the statehouse.
Ms. O'Brien, the daughter of a political family from western Massachusetts, has been a state legislator as well as state treasurer and has close relations with the Democrats who control the Legislature. In her campaign, Ms. O'Brien was strongly supported by traditional Democratic groups, including labor unions and public school teachers.
But she was hurt by Mr. Romney's attacks on her husband, who is a lobbyist, and she lost votes to the Green Party candidate, Jill Stein.

Senate Seat Stays Republican As Sununu Defeats Governor

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Nov. 5 

 BODY:
The Republicans won the battle for the Senate in New Hampshire tonight as Representative John E. Sununu defeated Gov. Jeanne Shaheen in what had been one of the tightest races in the country.
 Polls showed the two New Hampshire political heavyweights neck and neck until Election Day. But in the end, Mr. Sununu appeared to pull out a decisive victory. With 96 percent of the precincts reporting, Mr. Sununu had 51 percent of the vote while Ms. Shaheen had 47 percent. At 10:30 p.m., Ms. Shaheen conceded the election. 
 "I called John Sununu and congratulated him on his win," she said. "It is now important to all of us that we succeed by working together."
She added, "This election is over, but important battles remain, to get our economy working again, to assure seniors a secure retirement and our children a clean environment."
In his victory speech, Mr. Sununu said: "We were outspent in this election but we weren't outworked. This was a tremendous grass-roots effort."
He added: "At the end of the day, I want the people of New Hampshire to know I will stand up for the issues important to them. I won't be afraid of ideas. I won't be afraid of leadership."
Mr. Sununu, a three-term congressman and son of John H. Sununu, the former governor of the state and chief of staff to the first President Bush, had outrun the incumbent senator, Robert C. Smith, in the Republican primary.
Ms. Shaheen, a three-term governor and longtime state senator, is a moderate Democrat whose past electoral success was attributed to her siding with Republicans on issues like taxes and capital punishment, views that appeal to New Hampshire's growing number of independent voters, who tend to lean Republican.
Those voters were crucial in today's election, and the candidates promoted themselves by citing the instances in which they had differed with their parties.
"The underlying political landscape in New Hampshire is pro-Republican, and any Republican running for statewide office has a natural advantage," said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which conducted polls showing that the race was too close to call. "To counteract that, what a Democrat has to do is run as a moderate Democrat, have an excellent statewide campaign, and then it still may not be enough."
Mr. Smith's latest poll indicated that even a tiny percentage of Smith supporters who planned to write in his name or sit out the election could sway the outcome to Ms. Shaheen. Figures on the write-in voting were not expected to be available until late tonight.
During the campaign, the candidates squared off on issues like taxes, abortion, Social Security and the economy. Ms. Shaheen accused Mr. Sununu of supporting big business and privatization of Social Security to the detriment of small businesses and the elderly. Mr. Sununu fired back that Ms. Shaheen would be a tax-and-spender and accused her of failing to solve the state's education funding problem.
Ultimately, said Constantine Spiliotes, a government professor at Dartmouth College, many voters felt so overwhelmed that they just made "a gut-level decision of who's going to be a better leader for the state."
He said: "Shaheen, being a chief executive, was open to charges that she's had weak leadership. Sununu, as one out of 435 congressmen, is open to charges that he's just concerned about his party caucus."
The contest, along with a governor's race here, propelled a record number of voters to the polls, said William M. Gardner, New Hampshire's secretary of state.
"It will be the most number of votes cast in this state in a midterm election," said Mr. Gardner, who has predicted that the numbers will reach 385,000, about 60,000 more than the previous midterm election record. In Ward 1 in Manchester, election officials watching the voting at the Webster School said that by 9 a.m., one-third of the precinct's 5,460 voters had already turned out.
Voters interviewed outside the polling place appeared equally divided between Shaheen supporters and Sununu supporters. A number of independent voters, however, said that they had difficulty making up their minds.
"It was a tough choice; it really was," said Melissa Fortin, 39, a freelance architectural designer. "I saved all the campaign literature from both sides, and at the last minute I ruffled through it."
She said she finally decided to support Ms. Shaheen because of her opposition to big corporate tax breaks and her policies on education, and because "she's a good person."

Greenspan on Liberal Arts

BYLINE:  By Karen W. Arenson

 BODY:
 When ALAN GREENSPAN, chairman of the Federal Reserve, was in New York last week, he talked not about interest rates but about the value of a college education. "An economist can scarcely fail to notice the advantages that we have accrued in this country by having the marketplace work efficiently to guide our educational system, defined in its widest sense, toward the broader needs of our economy," said Mr. 
Greenspan, who was at a dinner to receive the Stephen P. Duggan Award for International Understanding from the Institute of International Education. Mr. Greenspan also spoke of the value of the liberal arts, and warned that in the face of increasing scientific knowledge, "our universities are going to have to struggle to prevent the liberal arts curricula from being swamped by technology and science."

President's Risks Are Rewarded at Polls

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

 BODY:
Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, said it early in the evening, "I see a Republican breeze blowing," and a few hours later he was proved right.
 If it cannot yet be declared a cyclone, it was still powerful enough to give President Bush, who had risked much of his political capital, a highly satisfying night. 
 Early this morning, the Republicans took control of the Senate and assured themselves of keeping the upper hand in the House of Representatives. 
It appeared more than possible that the Republicans would gain seats in the House -- something achieved by the party holding the White House only twice since the Civil War, and never by the Republicans. 
President Bush did his utmost to personalize the campaign, appealing for allies to help him push through his program, especially his domestic security bill, and raising a record amount of money. Campaigning widely, if less so than Mr. Bush, former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore also sought to nationalize the race, with much less success. 
Two years ago, Mr. Bush exhibited no coattails at all. In the intervening months, he clearly developed some.
Mr. Bush's impact was especially notable in the South, where he helped Representative Saxby Chambliss oust Senator Max Cleland, a war hero who lost both legs and an arm in Vietnam. Mr. Cleland apparently paid the price for voting against the President on domestic security. Mr. Bush also rode to the rescue of his brother Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and helped elect several new Southern governors, in states like Georgia and South Carolina.
His handpicked nominee in the Missouri Senate race, former Representative Jim Talent, defeated Senate Jean Carnahan to put the Republicans over the top.
Elsewhere, the campaign remained more a mosaic of many minicampaigns than a unified overall picture, with no overarching themes to unite the pieces. Taxes dominated some races, education others and health care still others.
Against the general trend, the Democrats succeeded in ousting Senator Tim Hutchinson, a Republican, in Arkansas, and Representative Constance A. Morella of Maryland, one of the last liberal Republicans, on Capitol Hill. A famous political name helped Mark Pryor, the victor in Arkansas, and her age (70), her independence and a redrawn district worked against Ms. Morella.
For the president, three races mattered most: the Senate contest in South Dakota, where Senator Tim Johnson, a Democrat, was seen as a surrogate for his colleague, Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, and Representative John Thune, a Republican recruited by the White House, was seen as a surrogate for Mr. Bush; the governorship contest in Florida, where Mr. Bush's brother Jeb, is seeking re-election as governor, and the governorship contest in Texas, where Rick Perry, a Republican who served under Mr. Bush in Austin as lieutenant governor, this year sought election as governor in his own right.
The President got his way in the two governors' races, but the outcomein South Dakota remained in doubt. In Florida, Mr. Bush helped raise $13 million - and that apparently helped Jeb Bush to victory.
Two years after the most bizarre presidential election in American history was decided by the Supreme Court, 14 months after the unspeakable horror of terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, the nation voted in a mood of evident disenchantment and curious disconnection from the political system.
The American public is faced with a series of potentially life-altering issues, including the prospect of war with Iraq, the possibility of further assaults on national security at home, the reality of a prolonged slump in the stock market and the uncertainty of the economic outlook.
With pep rallies devoid of pep and stump speeches that stirred few voters, the campaign that led up to the balloting was nevertheless notably lifeless and cheerless. But the electorate sent a clear enough message.
In an early sign of the tide, Representative Anne M. Northup, a Republican, easily carried her district in the Louisville suburbs, which had been rated by experts as a toss-up. Democrats had hoped to win it.
Perhaps more significant, the Republicans' drive to recapture the Senatewas aided by their success in holding every single one of the five open Republican Senate seats, from New Hampshire in the northeast to Texas in the southwest. One of the sweetest victories for the Republicans came in North Carolina, where Elizabeth Dole, whose campaign had seemed to be slipping in recent days, won by a considerable margin.
An unusual number of Senate races went down to the wire. In sum the country appeared every bit as evenly divided as it was in 2000.
Norman Ornstein, a political scholar at the American EnterpriseInstitute, argued that even if the Republicans made a breakthrough in the Senate, "We're still going to be in single digits, and we're still going to be in age of parity, perhaps unique in American history and likely to be with us for some time to come." If final results bear him out, CapitolHill may well be in for an unproductive couple of years.
"With parties so closely matched," said Anne Wexler, a Democratic lobbyist who worked with Congress during the Carter administration, 'it's hard to make any meaningful policy. It's all but impossible to create coalitions. It's all but impossible to impose any party discipline.Everyone is worrying about his or her own seat and about the next election, so you have 535 different free-lance operations up there."
But in symbolic terms, controlling the White House and both houses of Congress would count for a lot. And even if pushing some major legislation through remains beyond the President's capacity, he will no doubt take yesterday's voting pattern as a mandate to pursue his goal of ousting President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, by force if need be. Control of the Senate would also give Mr. Bush a better shot at winning confirmation for any conservative nominees he may choose in the event of Supreme Court vacancies.
Two years from now, yesterday's contests for governor may seem to have been more important than those for Congress. Excluded for years from the governor's mansions in many of the states with large blocks of electoral votes, the Democrats regained several of them, which should greatly assist their 2004 presidential campaign. Democrats swept back into power in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois, the kind of Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states that have formed the engine-room of American politics for generations.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: THE SENATE; 
Republicans Regain Control of Senate, With a Victory in Missouri

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM and ALISON MITCHELL 

 BODY:
The Republicans' razor-thin reversal of fortune in the Senate removed the Democrats' sole power base in Washington and breathed new life into President Bush's stalled domestic agenda in Congress, from contested judicial nominations to deeper tax cuts and a new Department of Homeland Security that has been blocked by disputes over workers' rights.
 But in a body where 60 votes are required to cut off debate, the Republicans' narrow new working majority also fell far short of the margin needed to avoid Democratic filibusters on a range of contentious major issues from Social Security to health care, all but guaranteeing another two years of contentious partisan wrangling. 
 In a strong showing from New England to the South, the Midwest and the Rocky Mountains, the Republicans held on to all but one of their closely contested seats, and knocked off enough Democratic incumbents to foil the Democrats' attempts to keep control. The Democrats' sole pickup, the victory of Attorney General Mark Pryor of Arkansas over Senator Tim Hutchinson, was not enough to offset Republican gains elsewhere.
Shortly after 2 a.m. Eastern time, Senator Jean Carnahan of Missouri sealed the Democrats' fate, conceding to supporters that she had lost to Representative Jim Talent, thus making it impossible for Democrats to retain control, whatever the outcome of close contests in Minnesota and South Dakota. 
"As always, others will come to lift the fallen torch," said Mrs. Carnhan, who was running to fill the unexpired term of her husband, Mel, who died just before Election Day two years ago but won anyway; she was appointed to fill his seat temporarily. "The fire will not go out."
Mr. Bush campaigned hard all year to regain control of the Senate, which the Republicans lost last year with the defection of Senator James M. Jeffords to independent. He raised money and stumped repeatedly for handpicked candidates in close races, and his efforts paid off.
Leaving his office in the Capitol last night at 10:30, the Republican leader, Senator Lott of Mississippi, said: "The signs are very encouraging. Things are looking good."
By early this morning, Democratic Party officials had all but conceded they could not win all the bitterly close contests they needed -- in Missouri, South Dakota and Minnesota -- to retain control. Moreover, Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, was forced into a December runoff election because she received less than 50 percent of the vote, making her seat a fat target for national Republicans then.
Upset victories went to Representative Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, a Republican who defeated the Democratic incumbent, Senator Max Cleland, and to Mr. Pryor.
But the Republicans staved off two of the Democrats' best prospects, Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Tom Strickland, a former United States Attorney in Colorado. They also easily rebuffed Democratic candidates for open seats in North and South Carolina held for decades by Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond, who are retiring, and claimed victory in open seats in Tennessee and Texas. Elizabeth Dole, the former cabinet secretary and presidential candidate, won the North Carolina seat.
In New Hampshire, Representative John E. Sununu, the son of the former Republican governor and White House chief of staff, appeared before cheering supporters at 10:40 p.m. to claim victory. He had defeated the incumbent Republican, Bob Smith, in a bitter primary that left the Democrats hopeful that Ms. Shaheen might take the seat.
"This is your victory," Mr. Sununu said. "We were outspent, but we weren't outworked."
The election capped a tumultuous two years in which partisan control of the Senate shifted to the Democrats with Mr. Jeffords' switch. But both parties struggled to find clear advantage on issues from the economy to terrorism.
Until the death of Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota in a plane crash 11 days ago, the Democrats held only a single-vote working margin in the Senate, so any one of a handful of tossup races held the power to shift control of the chamber.
In Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, a Republican who has recently drawn attention as chairman of an antiterrorism subcommittee in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, declared victory over Mr. Cleland, a decorated, disabled Vietnam veteran. Mr. Chambliss, who received major support from President Bush, told cheering supporters, "Something like this never happens without a lot of hard work."
Mrs. Dole, a former secretary of labor and transportation who abandoned her Republican presidential bid more than two years ago, comfortably defeated Erskine B. Bowles, a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, to win the North Carolina Senate seat held for 30 years by Mr. Helms. Mr. Bowles, a millionaire businessman, spent heavily on his own behalf and Democrats had hoped a strong black turnout might let him eke out a victory in a state that favors Republicans.
With her victory, Mrs. Dole dispelled some lingering doubt about her electoral viability and positioned herself for a potentially prominent future role in national Republican politics. She and her husband, the former Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, now join former Senators Howard Baker of Tennessee and Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas in a select club of married couples who have served in the Senate from different states.
"I am just as thrilled as you are," Mrs. Dole told her supporters last night. "We'll never forget this night, will we?" She reached out to hold her husband's arm, pronouncing him "the best surrogate" a campaign could have.
In South Carolina, Representative Lindsey Graham, running to fill the Republican seat vacated by Mr. Thurmond, who at 99 is the Senate's senior member, handily defeated his Democratic opponent, Alex Sanders, a former president of the College of Charleston.
Former Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, recruited at the last minute to take the place of the Democratic incumbent, Robert G. Torricelli, who dropped out under an ethical cloud, kept that seat for the Democrats.
In Tennessee, former Gov. Lamar Alexander handily won the Republican seat being vacated by Fred Thompson, the former prosecutor and part-time actor who decided not to seek re-election after the death of his daughter and who now has a regular role on the popular television series "Law & Order."
In Texas, John Cornyn, the Republican nominee, claimed victory in incomplete returns over his Democratic opponent, Ron Kirk, to hold the seat being vacated by Phil Gramm.
Both parties made extraordinary efforts to turn out voters in close contests, and by last evening, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the head of the Democrats' Senate campaign committee, said that turnout was unusually high in some states, comparable to that for a presidential election year.
"We are very confident that at the end of the day, it will be a good day for Senate Democrats," she told reporters.
But in other ways, much was business as usual, with at least 18 Senate incumbents returned to office without serious challenge. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who staged a losing battle against efforts to overhaul campaign finance laws to bar the parties' use of so-called soft money, trounced his Democratic challenger, Lois Combs Weinberg, to become the first Republican in his state to win four full Senate terms.
With 34 of the Senate's 100 seats at stake, Democratic incumbents drove to safe victories in Delaware, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, Rhode Island and West Virginia, while Republicans held onto their seats in Alabama, Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, Virginia and Wyoming.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: THE OVERVIEW; 
G.O.P. RETAKES CONTROL OF THE SENATE IN A SHOW OF PRESIDENTIAL INFLUENCE; PATAKI, JEB BUSH AND LAUTENBERG WIN

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Republicans swept to victory in the United States Senate last night, assuring Republican control of the White House and Congress for the next two years, and thrusting President Bush into a commanding position for his legislative agenda.
 The Republican Party also maintained -- and possibly solidified -- its hold on the House, in an election that amounted to a major drubbing for the Democratic Party. 
 The results mean that a single party, the Republicans, will once again control both houses of Congress and the White House. The party lost the Senate in June 2001, when Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont switched from the Republican Party and became an independent, though mostly voting with the Democrats.
Republicans captured high-profile Senate races from North Carolina to New Hampshire, winning contests in governors' races in Democratic states. 
"We made history tonight," said Representative Thomas M. Davis III, chairman of the Republican Congressional Campaign committee. "It was a great win for the president of the United States."
The outcome of marked a break with historic patterns in which the party that controls the White House almost invariably lost, rather than gained, seats in mid-term Congressional elections.
The result signaled a major change in the way Washington does business, in particularly, removing what Mr. Bush had repeatedly complained in recent days was Democratic opposition that had prevented him from winning confirmation of his judicial nominations and such measures as a permanent tax cut and a homeland security bill.
The result was a huge lift for Mr. Bush, who spent much of the past two weeks campaigning across the nation on behalf of Republican candidates for the House, the Senate and for governor. At the time, Democrats said that Mr. Bush was gambling his prestige on the outcome of the race. That was one bet that the president clearly appeared to have won last night.
Gov. Jeb Bush survived the fallout from his brother's disputed election in 2000 to win a second term in Florida, drawing an early-evening congratulatory call from the White House. In Maryland, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a Democrat and a daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, lost her bid for governor to Representative Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. -- the first time a Republican was elected governor of that state since Spiro Agnew was elected in 1966. Voters in Massachusetts, another of the most Democratic states, elected a Republican as governor, Mitt Romney.
Democrats were able to claim a handful of victories, like the one by Frank R. Lautenberg, the retired Democratic senator who reappeared on the political stage last month after Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey was forced aside by an ethics investigation. In one of the few dark moments for Republicans yesterday, Mark Pryor, the Democratic attorney general of Arkansas, toppled Senator Tim Hutchinson from office, while Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, won re-election.
The Democrats recaptured the governorships in Illinois, Pennsylvania and Michigan, important states in that could have significant bearing in the 2004 presidential race.
Still, the evening was more than a little discouraging for Democrats. In what would amount to biggest upset in Senate races, Representative Saxby Chambliss unseated Senator Max Cleland, a celebrated war hero and a Democrat from Georgia. Elizabeth Dole, a two-time cabinet secretary and Republican candidate for president in 2000, was elected senator from North Carolina, and Representative John E. Sununu Jr. won the Senate race in New Hampshire. Both Republicans withstood spirited challenges from Democrats, assuring that those two states remained in the Republican column.
The Republicans also sent Representative Lindsey Graham to fill the South Carolina Senate seat that was being vacated by Senator Strom Thurmond, while former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a two-time presidential candidate, kept that state's Republican Senate seat.
"What a great night -- what a great victory," Mr. Sununu shouted to a crowd ecstatic that he had triumphed over the state's popular governor, Jeanne Shaheen.
In Louisiana, Senator Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, was forced into a runoff because t she drew less than 50 percent of the vote. The runoff, which would not be held until Dec. 7, could conceivably determine control of the Senate.
Democrats tried to put the best light on the outcomes last night, arguing that they had faced a tough task from the beginning because of Mr. Bush's high approval rating and the financial advantage enjoyed by Republicans. It was particularly distressing news for the Democratic leaders of the House and the Senate -- Senator Tom Daschle and Representative Richard A. Gephardt. They are viewed as prospects for president and could be tarnished by the outcome.
"What you've got to look at is the incredible amount of special interest money that was on their side," said Mr. Gephardt, the House minority leader. "There were races where we were outspent 4 to 1, 5 to 1, the pharmaceutical companies probably spent $60 million across the country."
"And you've got a president at 65 percent approval," he said. "I think part of that comes from 9/11. The whole country's rightful reaction to the horrible attack on our country, that whole cluster of issues are still out there."
Republicans were potentially on the verge of a historic achievement. The party that controls the White House almost invariably loses House seats in off-year elections. Democrats broke that trend when Roosevelt was president in 1934, and when Bill Clinton was in the White House in 1998. But the Republicans have never gained seats in the House when a Republican was president.
Similarly, the party that controls the White House generally loses seats in the Senate, with a handful of exceptions, including 1962 under Kennedy and 1970 under Nixon.
The results came on what was, at least by virtue of the number of candidates on ballots in all 50 states, a huge day of voting, with potentially deep significance for how the nation is governed over the next two years as well as the dynamics of the presidential election of 2004. Margin of control in both the Senate and the House had not been this tight going into an election since the first term of the Eisenhower administration.
But it was also an occasion of unaccustomed suspense because of the collapse of the system of surveying voters leaving polls that has made early calls standard for elections for more than three decades.
The Voter News Service, a consortium of news organization that surveys voters to offer running forecasts of the outcomes of races, announced yesterday afternoon that its system had failed.
Governor Bush's defeat of over Bill McBride, a Tampa business executive, was not only welcomed by the White House, but was also a significant personal victory for Mr. Bush, who had returned repeatedly to Florida on behalf of his brother. For much of this campaign, it had seemed that Jeb Bush might pay in defeat for the contested victory of President Bush in Florida in 2000. It loomed as a particularly unwelcome development for the combative chairman of the Democratic Party, Terry McAuliffe, who had singled out Mr. Bush as his No. 1 target of the campaign.
The early results seemed to confirm what had been a Democratic concern in the final days of the campaign: the Democrats had failed to capture the political agenda and make a case against the Republicans on the economy.
For much of the campaign season, members of the House and the Senate were pulled off the campaign trail by the debate in Washington on President Bush's request for authority to remove President Saddam Hussein of Iraq from power. By early this week, Democrats were acknowledging that no matter the final outcome, any hope they had of, in effect, nationalizing the election had not been realized.
The race to succeed Mr. Torricelli was one of a dozen contests that were being closely watched by Democratic and Republican leaders anxious to see if the Democrats would retain what had been, until the death of Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, in a plane crash last month, a one-seat edge in the Senate. There were close races being fought for Mr. Wellstone's seat and in Missouri, Colorado, South Dakota and Arkansas.
The Democrats held periodic news conferences yesterday complaining about episodes of voting irregularities, but there was no indication of the degree of problems that tainted the presidential election in 2000 in Florida, or the Democratic contest for governor there earlier this year.

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: THE GOVERNOR RACES; 
G.O.P. May Retain Its Lead in Statehouses

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
Republicans scored upset victories last night in governor's races in Maryland, Massachusetts and Georgia, where an obscure former state senator named Sonny Perdue became the first Republican elected governor since Reconstruction.
 On a grim night for Democrats nationally, the party's candidates won the governor's offices in Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, throwing four populous potential roadblocks in the way of President Bush's drive to re-election in 2004. 
 But they failed to unseat Mr. Bush's brother Jeb as governor of Florida or the president's successor as governor of Texas, Rick Perry.
Republicans fared surprisingly well in the Northeast, easily winning re-election in New York and Connecticut while picking up the New Hampshire seat being vacated by Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat who chose to run for the Senate. 
They also recaptured the governorship of South Carolina, where Jim Hodges, a Democrat, was ousted after one term by former Representative Mark Sanford, who had attacked him over the state's lagging educational performance and economic fortunes.
While Democratic victories in the Midwest and the Southwest appeared likely to translate into a net gain in the number of governors' offices held by the party, Republican upsets in the South and the Northeast nearly offset those advances and may have preserved the Republican edge in control of the nation's statehouses. Heading into the elections yesterday, the Republicans held 27 governorships, the Democrats 21, and independents 2, in Minnesota and Maine.
In perhaps the most shocking upset of the night, Mr. Perdue, a onetime veterinarian who had made the football team as a walk-on at the University of Georgia, stunned Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat who had amassed a huge campaign war chest and led in every poll.
In Massachusetts, the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics organizer, defeated State Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien, a Democrat.
In Maryland, Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., a conservative congressman, ran as a moderate and became the first Republican elected governor since Spiro T. Agnew 36 years ago. Mr. Ehrlich defeated Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who was criticized for a lackluster campaign.
An unusually large turnover of state chief executives, a result of term limits in most cases and retirements in a few, put more governor's offices within reach of the opposition party than at any other time in at least three decades. Democrats were hoping to recapture a majority of governorships for the first time in eight years.
But in Texas, Mr. Perry defeated Tony Sanchez, a petroleum tycoon who was on course to spend $70 million of his own money on his race.
And in Florida, Mr. Bush prevailed over Bill McBride, a lawyer who had beaten former Attorney General Janet Reno for the Democratic nomination. The closely fought and costly Florida campaign had drawn the president back to the state again and again to raise money and rally support for his brother.
"I want to thank our great president of the United States for coming down and lending a hand," Governor Bush said last night after being introduced to supporters by his father, the 41st president.
Republican incumbents also won in Nebraska, where Gov. Mike Johanns defeated a dark-horse Democrat, Stormy Dean, and in Ohio, where Bob Taft handily beat Tim Hagan, a former Cuyahoga County commissioner. In Colorado, Gov. Bill Owens turned back a challenge by Rollie Heath, a Democratic businessman. 
Republicans in Rhode Island retained the governor's office in a race between two business executives: Donald Carcieri, the winner, and Myrth York, the losing Democrat. 
Another Republican, Gov. Kenny Guinn of Nevada, easily won re-election over Joe Neal, a state senator who, with H. Carl McCall in New York, was one of two black candidates for governor nationwide. Republicans were successful in Idaho as well, where Gov. Dirk Kempthorne easily won re-election over Jerry Brady, a newspaper publisher from Idaho Falls. 
In South Dakota, where Gov. William Janklow was term-limited, a fellow Republican, former State Senator Mike Rounds, defeated Jim Abbott, president of the University of South Dakota. And in Arkansas, the Republican incumbent, Mike Huckabee, withstood a late surge by State Treasurer Jimmie Lous Fisher.
In the Vermont race, yet another Republican, State Treasurer Jim Douglas, led a field of 10 candidates. But he was short of 50 percent of the vote, meaning the race will be decided by the General Assembly, the state's legislature.
Much more was at stake in the three dozen contests for governor than the stewardship of state finances in a time of shrinking tax revenue and soaring deficits, issues that dominated all but a handful of campaigns.
Were there to be a wholesale shift in control of the nation's statehouses, it could carry enormous consequences for the 2004 presidential race, as governors oversee vast armies of party workers and priceless party infrastructure. Republican governors allied with Mr. Bush played a critical role both in his effort to capture the 2000 Republican presidential nomination and in the fall campaign against Al Gore.
In addition, governors dominate fund-raising at the state level, which is about to become far more important as a new campaign finance law limits the ability of political parties to raise money through their national committees.
Further, any Democratic gains in gubernatorial elections could give rise to a new crop of presidential contenders, just as the avalanche of new Republican governors in 1994 -- when the party captured a majority of governors' offices for the first time in a quarter-century -- created a farm system of candidates and cabinet officials.
A spate of new Democratic governors would also give the party new laboratories for policy experiments, just as Republican governors in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and elsewhere led the way in reshaping welfare programs and setting spending priorities as states raked in record surpluses throughout the 1990's.
To that end, Democrats did win important electoral territory in the industrial Great Lakes yesterday, including governor's offices in Illinois and Pennsylvania. 
In Illinois, Representative Rod R. Blagojevich defeated State Attorney General Jim Ryan, whose campaign was hampered by association with the Republican incumbent, George Ryan, leaving office under a cloud of scandal involving the trading of contracts and driver's licenses for campaign contributions.
In Pennsylvania, Edward G. Rendell, former mayor of Philadelphia and onetime Democratic national chairman, easily defeated Mike Fisher. The incumbent governor, Mark Schweiker, a Republican who succeeded Tom Ridge last year, did not seek election to a full term.
And in Republican-rich Kansas, the Democratic nominee, State Insurance Commissioner Kathleen Sebelius, defeated State Treasurer Tim Shallenburger, a conservative who had prevailed in the Republican primary over two moderates.
Democrats also made steep inroads in staunch Republican territory in the Southwest, winning governorships in Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma, and in the race for the open seat now held by a Republican in Tennessee.
In Arizona, where Gov. Jane Dee Hull was term-limited, State Attorney General Janet Napolitano defeated former Representative Matt Salmon. Bill Richardson, energy secretary in the Clinton administration, was elected governor of New Mexico, defeating John A. Sanchez, a state legislator. 
One of the biggest Democratic upsets of the night was State Senator Brad Henry's victory in Oklahoma over former Representative Steve Largent, a Republican seeking to succeed the term-limited Gov. Frank Keating.
In Tennessee, the Democratic nominee, Phil Bredesen, former mayor of Nashville, defeated the Republican, Representative Van Hilleary, in a close race in which both candidates attacked the Republican incumbent, Don Sundquist, nearly as much as each other.
Democrats also captured the governor's office in Maine, where Gov. Angus King, an independent, was term limited. In that race, Representative John Baldacci defeated Peter Cianchette, a former state legislator.
Of the five Democratic incumbents, Tom Vilsack of Iowa had the only easy re-election battle. He comfortably defeated Doug Gross, a lawyer and lobbyist, after what many had considered an exceedingly competitive race.
In his victory speech in Des Moines, Mr. Vilsack declared that "democracy is best when people work at the grass roots," and said the Democratic effort that helped elect him should be celebrated as a "return to grass-roots organizing."
Though the battle for Congress dominated the political scene throughout the year, the fight for power at the state level was no less pitched. The 36 races for governor produced 21 extremely competitive contests. 
While campaigns for the House and the Senate focused on terrorism, Social Security and health insurance costs, governors' races were shadowed by the nation's stalled economy, as incumbents or their chosen successors were kept on the defensive about budget deficits, squeezed spending for education and health care, and tax increases lurking around the corner. Members of Congress may bear little individual responsibility for the mounting federal deficit, after all, but governors are responsible for managing, and balancing, their budgets. 
Republicans have held a majority of governors' offices since 1994. But their past successes meant the party had more ground to defend this year: 23 of its 27 governors' offices were up for election.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: Preston Bailey; 
A Single Rose Will Never Do

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON

 BODY:
PRESTON BAILEY is quite an arrangement.
 Mr. Bailey, 53, an event designer who specializes in flowers, was wearing Versace (top), Armani (bottom) and Prada (boots) on Monday, sitting in a cream-colored club chair in his living room on lower Lexington Avenue, surrounded by flowering bougainvillea trees that had been tweezed like eyebrows until they were nothing but tropical leis wreathing the air -- ocean breezes with blossoms. 
 Mr. Bailey was giving a party for himself and a thousand guests the following night at the Rainbow Room, on the occasion of the publication of "Preston Bailey's Design for Entertaining" (Bulfinch, $45), his first book. But Mr. Bailey typically gives four or five parties a week for clients, working with event planners, so he didn't appear to be breaking much of a sweat. He was as natural as a pruned bougainvillea as he spoke. 
"I'm one of those people who believe more is better," he said, angled in his armchair as though he were wearing that, too. "If somebody's going to send me Champagne, send me a case. Twelve bottles, not one."
Mr. Bailey let out a high extended melodic tone that sounded like someone calling in a herd of goats, which is how he punctuates surprise or approval or just makes a point. He also likes to slap the arms of his chair, bounce himself a foot into the air and then land on the hip he wasn't using before he launched.
"I think 'over the top' is the most fun thing in the world to do," he said, which is good, because that's what Mr. Bailey does.
Mr. Bailey is the man who recreated czarist Russia (in winter) at the Plaza Hotel in 1998 for Joan Rivers, for the wedding of her daughter, Melissa, to John Endicott, which included a cathedral aisle of 20-foot-tall birch trees painted white with a "snowfall" of 30,000 white flowers hand-tangled into the blue-lighted branches. The bill for Mr. Bailey's decorations was $300,000. The couple separated this year.
Mr. Bailey designed the inauguration party for O, the Oprah Winfrey magazine, in 2000, with 12-foot-tall orchid trees and several thousand red flowers making a big "O." He has done fashion shows for John Galliano, and he did Liza Minnelli's Halloween party last week, with white not black. Mr. Bailey also designed Ms. Minnelli's wedding to David Gest this year. He has married as many people as a Las Vegas judge.
Anyone not from New York could fairly assume that Mr. Bailey lives in the grand ballroom at the Pierre, or in the penthouse at the St. Regis, or in the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- the city's great party spaces. In fact, he rents a two-room apartment, where he lives with Michael Speir, a graphic designer, and two cats, including a deaf 22-year-old calico.
Mr. Bailey, who started his event designing informally in 1980, is self-taught. He had a men's clothing store on Third Avenue, which went out of business in 1977.
"We sold very tight French suits," he said. Two friends, Vicente Wolf and the late Bob Patino, interior designers, put him to work providing flower arrangements for their Park Avenue clients.
"I absolutely did not know what I was doing," Mr. Bailey recalled. "I can't tell you the amount of mistakes." That means a lot of dead songbirds, so to speak, when you are working the exotic in flowers. Mr. Bailey bought flowers from retail florists to cover the attrition when clients walked into party setups, to check on them, just as the arrangements were starting to die. A money-losing venture initially, Preston Bailey Entertainment and Set Design now has an office of 15 employees on West 25th Street and annual billings of $2 million to $3 million.
"With thousands and thousands of flowers, it's a matter of timing it very carefully," Mr. Bailey said. "With experience, you realize that you have to get the flowers, you have to open them and you have to treat them properly." Peonies take two to three days to open, for example, and the temperature of the water you put them in will slow or speed the process. If you're having a dinner party, get started on the flowers at least the day before. If you live in New York, buy in the flower district, in the West 20's, on Tuesdays or Thursdays, when most of the imported flowers arrive.
"Clean the bottom leaves, and cut the stem, with an angled cut," Mr. Bailey said. "Make sure you give a flower clean water. Allow it to drink water -- flowers start becoming themselves when they've drunk a day's water."
Mr. Bailey also had advice on whom -- or what -- to follow home from the flower market.
"Roses," he said. "Romantic. If they like red, you know that they're hot, passionate people, so keep that in mind. If it's quantity, then you're really in -- three dozen at least. I have no use for the one-rose type."
Mr. Bailey was born in Panama. He moved to New York City at 19 to study accounting at Pace University. He has never lived anywhere else.
"This is hooooome," he said. (Goat-herding call, high bounce.) "I just couldn't wait to get out." He was raised in the countryside. "I don't need a country house. I'm very happy being in the city."
New York in 1969, when Mr. Bailey showed up, was "lots of drugs, lots of fun," he said. "I had just escaped from Panama. I didn't speak the language. Oh yes, I've been around."
Mr. Bailey, who is 6-foot-2 and built like an athletic dancer, said he has been sober for 12 years.
"I had a drug problem," he said. "Coke, alcohol, you name it. I went through the entire 'almost lose your home' kind of a thing." His therapist intervened, threatening to drop him as a patient if he didn't clean himself up.
Mr. Bailey said he thought the event design field was largely a New York phenomenon at the over-the-top level.
"Robert Isabell -- he is the grandfather of this entire industry," he said, speaking of the designer based on West 13th Street, who has his own line of perfumes. "Philip Baloun, and Renny. Well, Renny's an institution." Renny is Renny Reynolds of Renny, who got his start decorating Studio 54, the 1970's discotheque, every night, to keep it fresh for habitues like Halston and Liza Minnelli.
Mr. Bailey can tell the history of New York with flowers.
"It was the high-tech single-flower look in the 70's, and then it segued into the Hawaiian look," he said, as though he were reciting the alphabet. "Everything was very hard-stemmed -- birds of paradise, heliconias. Then the French and English abundance kind of a thing, much softer, much richer." This means roses and hydrangeas. Mr. Bailey was asked about irises.
"Seventies," he said. The 80's "went wild -- you couldn't get enough flowers." Then what happened?
"The recession happened!" he said. (Goat call, no bounce.) "We went back to the 'single' look. Simplicity, candlelight. We're still with it."
Mr. Bailey's corporate clients have scaled back their entertainments this year, or canceled them. Budgets in some cases have dropped by half; designs are strictly conservative, if that's possible in a world like Mr. Bailey's. The social side of the operation is still strong.
"People want to party," he said, something that became apparent last December, after the two chilling months succeeding Sept. 11.
On Tuesday night, Mr. Bailey stood on the revolving dance floor of the Rainbow Room, welcoming well-wishers. His evening arrangement: black Jean Paul Gaultier (top), Armani (bottom) and Prada (slippers).
Outside the famous windows, New York City at night looked like something Mr. Bailey might have designed. Inside, there were green baby elephants made of mums, with red rose saddles.
There is a difference between outrageous and fabulous, as Mr. Bailey explained on Monday, a distinction perhaps he and his adopted town understand better than most.
"You can decide to be outrageous," he said. "But you have to be crowned fabulous."
Ms. Minnelli and Mr. Gest walked down the stairs. Mr. Bailey's court was assembling.

HEADLINE: Global Accounting Panel to Seek an Options Standard 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The International Accounting Standards Board, along with accounting regulators in Britain, Australia and New Zealand, will propose a rule today that would force companies to record the value of stock options issued to executives and employees as an expense. 
 The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets United States accounting rules, is expected to seek comment on the proposed international rule, with a view toward adopting it. Approval by the American board would produce the same accounting treatment in virtually all leading countries. 
 "We are saying that options are an expense," said Sir David Tweedie, the chairman of the international board. "All around the world, people are moving in the same direction." 
The proposed international standard calls for calculating the value of options in a way that is similar to the method now in use in the United States, which requires companies to make the calculation but gives them the choice of whether to deduct the expense from their income. But in the case of companies that are not yet public, the proposed international rule would call for a significantly higher value for the options -- a step that is sure to provoke opposition in high-technology industries.
The proposed rule is subject to public comment until March 7, 2003, after which the board is likely to hold hearings before adopting a provision. Sir David said the goal was to approve a rule in 2003 that would be effective at the end of that year, but said delays were possible.
American companies, led by high-technology businesses, which are the heaviest issuers of options, have long opposed rules to require the treatment of options as an expense. The American board was poised to do that in 1994, but retreated under heavy political pressure that was applied most directly by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, who argued that lower reported profits would make it harder for such companies to raise capital.
Many companies are gearing up to oppose the international rule as well. A group called the International Employee Stock Options Committee, supported by groups including the Business Software Alliance, Financial Executives International and the Nasdaq stock market, argued this week that "there is no accurate, reliable and meaningful method today to value stock options," and that valuations created by existing models are "inaccurate and misleading."
Sir David said that the board was open to proposals on better ways to value options, but he noted that the board had talked to numerous experts, including Myron S. Scholes, who won a Nobel Prize in economics for his work on options pricing. 
Kimberley Crook, a project manager at the international accounting board, acknowledged that measurements of options values are inexact. But Ms. Crook added, "People use this argument to say we should never put anything in the accounts."
She said "zero is never" going to be right.
One reason critics say that models do not reflect the value of employee options very well is that such options are not publicly traded. But Sir David said that the board's calculations take that into account by basing the calculation on a forecast of how long the option would remain outstanding, not on its maximum life. By reducing the 10-year life of most options to 4 or 5 years, the values will be reduced.
Another major component in options pricing models is volatility, with higher volatility translating into higher values. The proposed international rule would allow companies to assume that volatility will be lower in the future than it has in the past, but they would have to disclose how much lower the estimate was and give reasons for thinking that future volatility would be lower.
While the international board's proposal provides somewhat more leeway in valuing options than the current American rule does, and differs in some details, it is likely to produce similar values.
An exception is options offered by companies whose shares are not publicly traded. The American rule allows companies to effectively assume there is no volatility, and to value the options based only on the value of being able to delay paying for the stock. The international rule would require companies to estimate volatility, perhaps by looking at the trading of shares in similar companies.
That would lead to far higher values -- and to lower reported profits for companies preparing to make initial public offerings of their shares.
As in the American rule, the value of the option would be estimated on the date it was granted. It would be treated as an expense over the period until the option became vested -- that is, until it could be exercised -- but the value shown as an expense would not change even if the option was clearly very valuable, or virtually worthless, by the time vesting occurred.
One small change is that in the American rule the value of options that do not become vested are not charged to earnings, and if need be they are credited to earnings in later years to reverse earlier charges. For example, if a worker was granted options on 300 shares of stock, all to become vested in three years, the income statement would be charged with the value of 100 options in each of the three years. If the employee quit after two years, meaning that the options would not become vested, the value of the options already listed as an expense would be added back to profits.
Under the proposed international standard, the company would estimate the likelihood that the options would not become vested, and reduce their value based on that assumption. But the amount charged to expenses would not be affected by how many options did become vested.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
If the rich are becoming richer, are they also buying relatively more stuff?

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the author of "The Future and Its Enemies" and is writing a book on the increasing importance of aesthetics in the economy and society. E-mail: vpostrel@dynamist.com

 BODY:
THIS economic downturn seems weird. Business spending has dropped sharply, but consumers keep buying. That baffles a lot of analysts.
 Why don't consumers stop spending? Don't they know the economy is in bad shape? Is America just a nation of free-spending fools? A recent study of an entirely different subject -- income inequality -- suggests a rational explanation. 
 Economists generally agree that since the late 1970's, income inequality has increased in the United States. Top earners account for a larger percentage of total income, and college-educated workers command an increasingly large premium.
Equally striking, there is a broader spread of incomes among people of the same education, occupation, age or sex.
But the usual measures look at current income: what everyone is making at a given moment in time, not what people can expect to make (and spend) over their lifetimes.
"Looking at the distribution of current income is probably not a good enough measure of what you're really interested in, which is the distribution of well-being, the distribution of resources among Americans," says Fabrizio Perri, an economist at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
There are really two different components of income inequality: permanent differences and temporary fluctuations. People tend to base their spending on what they expect their long-term prospects to be.
Poor graduate students spend more than equally poor waitresses, because they can expect higher incomes later. Conversely, professional athletes have to save some of their big bucks to finance a comfortable life after sports.
To see how well-being is distributed, consumption provides a better long-run picture than income. In a paper titled "Does Income Inequality Lead to Consumption Inequality?" Professor Perri and Dirk Krueger, an economist at Stanford, look at the distribution of consumption from 1972 to 1998. The article, now a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, can be downloaded at http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/fperri/research.htm.
If the rich were becoming richer in the 1980's and 90's, were they also buying relatively more stuff? And if the poor were becoming poorer, were they buying less?
"We wanted to see whether this rise in income inequality had in fact given rise to an increase in consumption inequality," Professor Krueger said. "We were fairly surprised that it hadn't."
The economists expected consumption to fluctuate less than income, since people can save in good times and borrow in bad times. But the results were far more marked than they anticipated: Even as the distribution of income changed significantly, the distribution of consumption barely budged.
A common measure of how spread out the income distribution is (the standard deviation of the log of after-tax labor income) increased 20 percent, while the same measure for consumption rose only 2 percent.
To take a single comparison, the poorest 20 percent of Americans made about 6 percent of all income in 1972-73 but only 4 percent in 1997-98. That substantial drop did not show up in their spending, however. It stayed flat, at about 9.2 percent of total consumption.
Or consider the ratio between the top and bottom. In 1972-73, the top 10 percent of earners made about five times as much as the bottom 10 percent. In 1997-98, they made more than nine times as much -- a sharp increase that, again, barely shows up in spending. The top 10 percent of households spent about three times as much as the bottom 10 percent in 1972-73, a ratio that inched up to 3.35 in 1997-98.
These results are particularly striking because the income figures include only wages and government benefits. Spending, by contrast, can come from all sources of money, including the stock market returns and other investment income enjoyed mostly by the wealthiest Americans. The high investment returns of the 1990's do not seem to have notably widened the spending gap between rich and poor.
It is hard to see the effects of increasing income inequality in how people actually live. In a theoretical model that fits the trends of the last two decades, the economists propose an explanation: Permanent income differences have increased just a little, while short-term fluctuations have increased a lot. What looks like increasing income inequality turns out to be mostly increasing income instability.
As incomes have become more unstable, consumers have benefited from more efficient ways to borrow and save. Better credit markets have kept consumption from becoming as lopsided as current income.
"The permanent inequality tends to push up consumption inequality," Professor Perri explained, "but the income instability would tend to push it down."
"People react by saving more and by borrowing more," he said, "so there's this development of credit markets."
In particular, it is much easier for consumers to borrow with credit cards or home equity loans than it was 20 years ago. Middle-class earners also have access to many more ways to save and invest.
When credit markets are well developed, people having a good year can save, providing money to be lent to people having a bad year. And the penalty for default -- being turned down for future credit -- is more serious, deterring careless borrowing.
How consumers react to economic news depends largely on whether they think it portends a permanent change in their incomes. That may explain, then, why consumers have kept spending despite the sluggish economy. They may be making less money, but they do not expect that situation to last forever -- and they have their credit cards to tide them over.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 6, 2002

 CORRECTION:
The Economic Scene column in Business Day on Nov. 7, about trends in consumer spending, referred incorrectly to ratios between top and bottom income groups from 1972-73 to 1997-98. The ratios, which rose sharply for income but only slightly for spending, measured the difference between people at the 90th percentile of income and those at the 10th percentile, not all those in the top 10 percent and the bottom 10 percent.

HEADLINE: Label Mania Lends Dazzle to Humble CD's 

BYLINE:  By ROB FIXMER 

 BODY:
MARK SMITH, the owner of a small record store in Philadelphia, produces and distributes his own dance music on compact discs.
 In her home office in Bath, Ohio, Ann DeVilbiss creates customized demos of her video productions on CD's for potential clients. 
 Bill Isaacson, the Dallas-based regional manager for a large manufacturing concern, hands out CD-ROM's with full-color copies of his company's catalog in Microsoft Word format.
 And in Manhattan, Alex Dranovsky, a 22-year-old student at the School of Visual Arts, spends many hours creating compilation CD's of trance music to share with friends. 
 All four of these people represent typical users of computer CD burners, and each will tell you that what gives a home-brew CD a visceral appeal in business and social circles is less the disc or its contents than the label affixed to it.
 "A good label says it's a serious professional product," said Mr. Smith, who recently won a label design contest.
 The look is so important, in fact, that Mr. Isaacson, the Southwest regional manager for the Armorcast Products Company, a maker of equipment enclosures, said he "would never consider sending a customer a CD of my catalog if the label was even slightly off center."
 No longer just a paper ID with adhesive backing, the CD label has morphed into a cultural artifact, a medium for aesthetic expression ranging from simple colored backgrounds for directories of songs, photos or files to ambitious graphical designs, a sort of digital folk art for the new millennium.
 In fact, software developers say that designing or copying CD labels and inserts is now by far the most common use of desktop publishing by amateurs. Small businesses account for much of that volume for simple economic reasons: professional CD duplication services are costly and often require a run of several hundred or even 1,000 discs.
 But the most numerous users of CD labels today are consumers like Mr. Dranovsky, whose designs are motivated by a love of music rather than by business needs. Among this group's members the label has become an icon of legitimacy.
 "It's all about fun," he said of his label designs for the compilation CD's he shares with friends. But he also asserted that a label design says as much about a compilation as the musical selections and maybe even more about the person who compiles it.
 "When somebody gives me a CD, if it doesn't have a label, chances are I'll put it on the back burner and look into it three or four months later," he said. "But if they give it to me with a nice label, it definitely piques my interest. It says, 'Hey, I made this and I'm proud of it, and I want to do a little extra to give it a little pizazz.' If you give somebody a label with just a scribble on it with a Magic Marker, it shows you don't really care that much."
 Participants in a recent MSN chat about swapping MP3 files said they too took pride in the label designs of the CD's they made. "It's not cool to write on a disc," a participant declared. "If you're serious, you design your label from scratch, and it has to say something about the music."
 Several other participants in the chat room, an anonymous gathering place for college-age and high-school-age users of MP3 file-swapping services, were more divided about the correct labeling protocol for copying a commercial music CD. Some insisted that the label had to have a unique design; others preferred to scan in the original label and often the jewel box inserts as well.
 People without scanners often acquire exact copies of commercial CD labels by visiting Web sites like CDCovers.cc (www.cdcovers.cc), which bills itself as "the world's largest cover archive." The site offers free downloads of labels and jewel case inserts for nearly 120,000 audio CD's and thousands more labels for DVD's, videocassettes and game media. 
 Most of the labels and inserts have been scanned from originals by users of the site. Another site, the Mega-Search service (www.mega-search.net), says that its database directs users to 450 online sources for prescanned labels with a combined inventory of more than 500,000 CD covers. (Matt Oppenheim, who represents the Recording Industry Association of America in legal matters, warned that uploading or downloading such images is illegal because cover designs are included when record companies register the copyrights for CD's.)
 For do-it-yourselfers, there is also a wide and growing choice of CD labeling products. All of the market leaders offer startup kits with a few sample sheets of labels; design software that ranges from simple but limited to powerful but complex; and an applicator, typically a plastic spindle on a spring for aligning the label to the disc.
 Label choices have evolved into an expansive product family that includes glossy high-resolution photo-quality stock, solid colors, transparent film and metal foil. A few companies offer confetti and glitter backgrounds, which are marketed as "holographic" labels because they produce a three-dimensional illusion if you squint.
 "As a designer, I think it's awesome," said Ms. DeVilbiss, who designs motion graphics for television commercials. She distributes demos of her creations in Quicktime format on 8-millimeter "pocket" CD-ROM's. "I'm 42, but I see young kids out there doing MP3 CD's and they're making these wonderful labels," she said. "It's just great."
 Label manufacturers encourage the trend by sponsoring design contests.
 "This wasn't even a business a few years ago," said David Kennough, vice president for sales for the Neato division of Fellowes, which sponsored the competition won by Mr. Smith. This year, Mr. Kennough anticipates that he and his major competitors -- Avery/Stomper, Memorex and SureThing -- will sell more than 500 million CD labels.
 In fact, secondary label markets are already springing up. At least a dozen small developers offer software for designing and printing CD covers and other labels. An entrepreneur who goes by the online name 70's Dude now offers a small selection of generic "indie labels" at cut-rate prices at www.labels-cdrs.com.
 Beyond aesthetics, there are practical reasons to label a CD. First, contrary to popular belief, it is the top of the disc, not the bottom, that is most vulnerable to scratches and other damage that make a CD unreadable. A label helps protect the surface.
 And in an age when drivers are continually changing home-brew CD's in car stereos, a label can make disc changing easier.
 "It's harder to read writing than it is to recognize an image," Mr. Dranovsky said.

HEADLINE: Ferrer Agrees To Take Over Banana Kelly Housing Unit 

BYLINE:  By ALAN FEUER 

 BODY:
The state attorney general's office announced yesterday that Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, would assume control of the Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association, a Bronx neighborhood redevelopment group that has struggled in recent years amid questions about its finances and management practices.
 Under an out-of-court settlement negotiated with the attorney general's office, Banana Kelly's chairwoman and chief executive, Yolanda Rivera, as well the agency's board of directors, will step aside for Mr. Ferrer and others, including Harold DeRienzo, Banana Kelly's founder. Mr. Ferrer, Mr. DeRienzo and three new board members have agreed to serve until at least April 30. 
 Banana Kelly, a nonprofit organization that once owned or managed dozens of buildings in the South Bronx, has been under investigation by the attorney general for nearly two years.
The group became a much-studied model for neighborhood redevelopment after it was formed more than two decades ago by some South Bronx residents but has in recent years been more a model of disarray. Its buildings and finances became poorly maintained, and questions were raised about its oversight and management practices.
"In the past few years, this historic organization has fallen on hard times," said Mr. Ferrer, who is president of the Drum Major Institute for Public Policy. "Banana Kelly's residents and the community deserve better."
Under the settlement, the state investigators will discontinue their investigation into Ms. Rivera, who assumed control of Banana Kelly's day-to-day operations in 1991, and the current board. The attorney general's office, however, will continue to investigate Banana Kelly. The charities bureau of the office will work with the new board to conduct an internal review of Banana Kelly's finances and programs.
Last year, the group sold the management contracts to the last 25 buildings it controlled, although it has kept the title to the buildings and remains a provider of social services like rental assistance and mental health programs.
Some board members and former employees have raised questions about how government money has been used and about how Ms. Rivera is compensated. She failed to respond to several messages left at her office yesterday.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan will continue to investigate Ms. Rivera, the attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said.

HEADLINE: North Sea Cod Crisis Brings Call for Nations to Act 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: GILLELEJE, Denmark, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
The cod are disappearing from the deep gray waters that stretch to the horizon from this gull-festooned town, a stark reminder that there is a finite number of fish in the sea and that man's growing appetite for seafood, if left unchecked, could eventually drive many species to extinction.
 Scientists warned last month that unless almost all commercial fishing in the North Sea was banned, the cod stocks might soon collapse, meaning that the number of cod necessary to repopulate the overfished region could fall so low that the popular food fish might never recover. 
 "The cod are now so depleted we're not really sure of their population dynamics," said Henrik Sparholt, a fisheries assessment scientist at the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, which has advised closing the North Sea to most fishing indefinitely.
Mr. Sparholt said the number of North Sea cod was at its lowest level ever and was half of what was considered the minimum for assured propagation. 
The cod crisis is one of many facing the international community as countries compete for thinning stocks in the world's once fish-thick seas. Fish are the last food source hunted on a large scale in the wild, and the United Nations warns that the world's 17 main fisheries are fished at or above sustainable levels.
None of the endangered species of fish affects so many countries and so many people or has such historic significance as cod. Once known as "beef of the sea," it is the world's most popular food fish and was a driving force in the development of the global economy.
Thanks to their lethargic swimming style, cod are easy to catch and have the whitest flesh of all white-fleshed fish. The meat is low in fat, high in protein and easily filleted.
The low fat content makes it easy to cure and made it the perfect fish for marine provisions and international trade before the invention of refrigeration. The Massachusetts Bay Colony was established, in part, to make money by selling cod to England.
Cod stocks have collapsed before. The fish was once so abundant off the northeastern coast of North America that the Italian explorer John Cabot reported catching them with a bucket in 1497.
But after 500 years of increasingly intensive fishing and repeated warnings that the cod were endangered, they suddenly all but disappeared more than a decade ago. Despite a fishing ban, they have yet to come back in significant numbers.
Thinning cod stocks in the North Sea have worried scientists for years now, and though the European Union has fiddled with quotas and the sizes of net holes -- larger holes let younger fish survive until they can spawn -- it has been slow to offer the fish adequate protection. 
Part of the problem is that harsher measures would devastate the economies of towns like Gilleleje, where cod fishing is the biggest industry.
"I'm 57, and I have to work another 10 years because I have no pension," said Peter Andersen, winding a heavy green net onto the winch of his 56-foot blue and white trawler docked at the town's nearly empty harbor. "I wouldn't earn a living if I couldn't fish cod."
Hunching against a bitter wind, Mr. Andersen says increasingly restrictive quotas on cod catches have already shortened his annual fishing season from 10 months to 5. He supplements his income by catching lobster but says too many fishing boats are doing the same for the lobster to last if the cod industry is shut down.
Demand for cod rose sharply in the early 1900's after Clarence Birdseye developed his method for freezing food and the fish industry began filleting fish by machine. Then, in 1962, the owner of a McDonald's franchise in Cincinnati invented the Filet-O-Fish sandwich for Catholics who did not eat meat on Friday. Demand for cod surged again.
Today it is eaten in almost every country in the world. To meet demand, competing Danish and Scottish fishing fleets use nets that drag across the seabed and can sweep a mile or more of water free of fish in a matter of hours.
There are some areas where cod remain plentiful -- around Iceland and in the Barents Sea -- but the rest of the world's major stocks, relatively distinct populations of the fish that live in a particular region, are thinning rapidly or are already depleted. In the early 20th century it was not unheard of for fishermen to catch man-sized, 200-pound cod, but such old fish are rare these days.
Last year the European Commission put forward a plan devised to help North Sea cod stocks recover, but the fishery ministers of European Union members countries have bickered over the plan because it uses limits on the length of time that fishermen can spend fishing cod instead of quotas on the quantity they can catch.
The switch, intended to combat the chronic underreporting of catches, is unpopular because it could leave some countries with less fish than others if their fishermen were unlucky.
While the ministers argue, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea says the situation has grown increasingly dire. The council, which makes policy recommendations to its 19 member countries, advised last month that until the cod recover, fishing should be banned altogether for most fish in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and the waters west of Scotland.
Because many cod are caught as a "bycatch" by crews fishing for other species in the region, the council's scientists want the ban extended beyond cod.
Franz Fischler, the European commissioner responsible for agriculture, rural development and fisheries, has blasted the European Union's fishery ministers for letting the situation go so far.
"It is galling after repeatedly warning of the dire consequences of inaction," he said in a speech delivered after the council made its advice public, "to see our worst fears realized."
Mr. Fischler said that if the European Commission's own scientific committee backs the council's advice when it delivers its report on cod stocks next Monday, he will propose a ban on cod, haddock and whiting fishing in the area, and substantial reductions in the quotas for other fish, until the ministers can agree on a longer-term solution.
But many marine biologists worry that politicians lack the will to sacrifice jobs for cod. With stocks so low, Mr. Sparholt says, anything less than a total, indefinite ban may leave the cod population vulnerable to nature's periodic environmental shocks, like changes in water temperature or a sudden drop in the food supply.
Such environmental variations are blamed in part for the failure of cod to rebuild their numbers off the North American coast. Scientists suspect that dwindling schools of capelin, a tiny fish eaten by cod, have hurt the cods' fertility there when its numbers were already reduced.
"You have to manage the stock so that it can cope with what nature has given before and will give in the future," Mr. Sparholt said over a plate of pickled herring in one of Copenhagen's canalside restaurants.
But even if the North Sea cod are saved, the pressure will likely move to other fisheries to meet the voracious appetite for fish sticks, fish and chips and fried fish sandwiches -- or it will go to other species. The more plentiful pollock, for example, is increasingly being used as a substitute for cod.

HEADLINE: Fed's Statement on Cutting Interest Rates 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Open Market Committee, reduced its benchmark rate by half a percentage point:
The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 11/4 percent. 
In a related action, the board of governors approved a 50 basis point reduction in the discount rate to 3/4 percent. 
 The committee continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with still-robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing important ongoing support to economic activity. However, incoming economic data have tended to confirm that greater uncertainty, in part attributable to heightened geopolitical risks, is currently inhibiting spending, production and employment. Inflation and inflation expectations remain well contained. 
 In these circumstances, the committee believes that today's additional monetary easing should prove helpful as the economy works its way through this current soft spot. With this action, the committee believes that, against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects for both goals in the foreseeable future. 
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J. McDonough, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jerry L. Jordan; Donald L. Kohn; Robert D. McTeer Jr.; Mark W. Olson; Anthony M. Santomero and Gary H. Stern. 
In taking the discount rate action, the Federal Reserve Board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas and New York.

 BODY:
Among the Democrats to take a governorship from the Republicans was Jim Doyle, the state attorney general, who will assume office on a platform of balancing the state's budget and putting an end to the political corruption that led to charges against leaders of both parties in the State Legislature in the last year.
 Mr. 
Doyle ousted the incumbent, Scott McCallum, who was filling the two-year vacancy created when Tommy G. Thompson, the popular and influential former governor, was brought into President Bush's cabinet as secretary of health and human services. Mr. McCallum had held state office since 1976, when he was just 26. But his brief tenure as governor came at a tough time, and he seemed to take the blame for high unemployment and a big budget deficit. 
 The two candidates and their supporters spent an estimated $20 million on the race, a record for the state, and much of the money went into negative advertising. The technique did little for Mr. McCallum, who never got much traction in the polls. His effort late in the campaign to link Mr. Doyle to the state scandals, calling him "crooked," appeared to backfire. Perhaps because voters were unhappy with the nasty tone of the race, Mr. Thompson's brother, Ed Thompson, running on a Libertarian ticket, made a strong showing as a third-party candidate.
The state's entire House delegation was re-elected, returning three Republicans and four Democrats to Washington for two more years. None of the races were close.

 BODY:
Neither Kathleen Kennedy Townsend's middle name nor her support for gun control, an issue whose importance grew quickly during the recent sniper attacks, could help her beat her Republican challenger, Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. He was elected the state's first Republican governor in three decades. 
 From the very start of his campaign, Mr. Ehrlich said Ms. Townsend, the state's lieutenant governor, was as much to blame for its economic problems as the departing governor, Parris N. Glendening. Mr. Ehrlich painted himself as a fiscally conservative antidote to Maryland's problems. 
 Paul Herrnson, director of the Center for American Politics and Citizenship at the University of Maryland, said one of the smartest things Mr. Erlich did as a Republican in a heavily Democratic state was to link Ms. Townsend to Governor Glendening. "He was a very unpopular governor who became like an anchor around Townsend's neck," Mr. Herrnson said.
An eight-term incumbent, Representative Constance A. Morrella, a Republican, lost her race to Christopher Van Hollen Jr., a 43-year-old state senator.

 BODY:
After Senator Jean Carnahan, the Democratic incumbent, conceded that she had lost to Jim Talent, a conservative Republican from the suburbs of St. Louis, Republicans nailed down control of the Senate. 
 Mrs. Carnahan, who was appointed to the Senate two years ago after her husband's death in a plane crash, did well in St. Louis and Kansas City, but that was not enough to overcome Mr. Talent's strength elsewhere. 
 The two candidates raised a total of more than $18 million. President Bush visited the state five times to assist Mr. Talent, while prominent Democrats, including Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, showed up for Mrs. Carnahan.
Republicans suggested that Mrs. Carnahan, who had never held elected office, was not up to the Senate job. Mr. Talent, a former four-term congressman who served eight years in the State House of Representatives and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2000, said he had more experience. Mrs. Carnahan said she could handle the responsibility, as another Missourian, Harry S. Truman, did when he became president after the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Mr. Talent promised tax cuts to stimulate the economy and create jobs. Mrs. Carnahan, who portrayed herself as a centrist, won support from labor unions and women's groups. She promised to resist cuts in Social Security while providing prescription drug benefits under Medicare.
A staunch supporter of his party after Republicans took control of the House in 1994, Mr. Talent softened the sharp edges of his political persona in this year's campaign.

HEADLINE: Tiptoeing to Defeat 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The Democratic Party is like an army that dutifully goes off to battle but leaves its ammunition and its principles behind. It's bad enough to lack the firepower that you need to win. It's worse to not even know what you're fighting for.
 Despite the economic burdens that the middle and working classes are shouldering, despite the two million jobs lost and the scandalous concentration of wealth and income in the precincts of the very rich, the Democrats have yet to offer a compelling alternative to the reverse Robin Hood policies of the G.O.P. 
 Throughout this year's campaign, the Democrats let the president bang the cynical war drums on Iraq whenever and however he wished. Other important issues -- the economy, employment, the administration's appalling environmental record, the threat to abortion rights and civil rights posed by the president's federal court nominees -- were largely pushed aside, to the delight of Republicans nationwide. 
Republicans didn't win control of the Senate on Tuesday. The clueless Democrats lost it.
There was a time when Democrats had some fire. "I never give them hell," said Harry Truman. "I just tell the truth and they think it's hell." That was then. Now the Democrats proceed on tiptoe, always afraid they might say the wrong thing, vote the wrong way, get burned. The party of Roosevelt, Truman and the Kennedys has morphed into the party of timidity.
Consider the fiasco in Minnesota. Many of the Democrats who loudly lamented the loss of Senator Paul Wellstone in a plane crash had for years considered his fierce commitment to principle to be, at best, a little weird. He had an agenda and there was room in it for working people and the poor. Democrats have come to think of that as dangerous terrain. 
But when Senator Wellstone died, the national Democrats, panicked at the prospect of losing their one-vote hold on the Senate, were quick to exploit the sympathy factor in an effort to save his seat. And that backfired.
When a televised memorial for the senator turned into a now-notorious campaign rally (at which Democrats were cheered wildly and some Republicans were booed), voters were turned off in large numbers. It was a fiasco that extended beyond Minnesota. Not only did the Democrats lack a message, they seemed also to lack class. 
The bottom line: Paul Wellstone was actually ahead in the polls at the time of his death. Walter Mondale, who was dusted off and sent out to run in his stead, was defeated.
In New York, which should be Democratic heaven given the party's lopsided registration advantage, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Carl McCall, lost to the Republican incumbent, George Pataki, by 16 points. Mr. McCall, a decent, affable man, did little more in the campaign than wave his resume. He rallied no one and he lost big time.
The leadership void among Democrats is dangerous for both the party and the nation. The courts are being shaped by right-wing Republicans for decades to come. And there is a particular need for elected officials willing to fight for the interests of ordinary families and individuals who are struggling to keep up with such fundamental expenses as mortgages and tuition.
Affordable housing is a huge national issue, and alarms that are increasingly loud are summoning our attention to the problems of hunger and homelessness. These are issues that get incredibly short shrift in a plutocracy. They are Democratic issues. Or at least they were when the Democrats had some fire.
A fresh start is needed. New voices and new strategies must be heard. It's time for Democrats everywhere to look in the mirror and determine who they really are, and what they really stand for. Those who favor what the Republicans favor are not really Democrats.
Lyndon Johnson is not held in very high esteem at the moment, which is too bad. He never ran away from the poor and working people. He brought us Medicare and Medicaid and student loans and Head Start and Upward Bound and consumer protections and housing assistance -- just a whole litany of those sorts of things.
But that was another era, when Democrats had energy and ideas and values they believed in and the courage to lead.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
An Address on Fifth, but She's No Hothouse Flower

BYLINE:  By JOYCE WADLER 

 BODY:
"MY friend Elizabeth -- a very nice lady -- once told me, 'We have to work harder than anyone else to be taken seriously,' " Lynden B. Miller, designer of public gardens, is saying while heading down Fifth Avenue after a garden tour. The tiniest pause. "Because of the way we look."
 This is an ambiguous phrase, and there is a possibility that she is referring to the "lady gardener" look. The miniature watering can hanging from a string around her neck; the two "New Yorkers for Parks" pins; the holsterlike leather belt that holds her clippers. In short, a wacky tree hugger, an assumption, if you hear Ms. Miller describing the Conservatory Garden as her third child or referring to the "gloooo-rious" chrysanthemums, you might make. 
 But, one senses, this is not the look to which Ms. Miller, with the Social Register listing, is referring. 
You're talking about an "address on Fifth Avenue" sort of bias, Ms. Miller?
She gives a closed-mouth reply and a sidelong glance of the sort one gives when confirming something one would prefer not to discuss: "Mmmmmmmm." 
That, Ms. Miller quickly adds, was 20 years ago and she has worked very hard to be taken seriously, which, of course, she now is. Credited with rescuing the Conservatory Garden, at Fifth Avenue and 105th Street, in the 1980's, Ms. Miller, 63, runs a design firm from her home and is paid for her work. She has designed the gardens of some of New York's loveliest parks: Bryant in Midtown and Wagner in Lower Manhattan. 
She was a painter for many years and talks of parks as a collage, but spending a few hours with her is also reminiscent of being with a politician on a stump. Ms. Miller grew up in Washington, and returned there after graduating from Smith and to work for a senator. Her husband, Leigh M. Miller, was the deputy assistant administrator in the Agency for International Development in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. Her son Gifford Miller is City Council speaker.
Ms. Miller has a platform, and she hammers it home: Parks make everyone feel better. They bring down crime. They're good for the economy. The finest have been paid for with private funds; the city should step up to the plate, for in poorer neighborhoods, private money is wanting.
It was Ms. Miller who conceived of last year's Daffodil Project, in which a million bulbs were planted around the city in commemoration of Sept. 11. 
NEXT week, as co-chairwoman of New Yorkers for Parks, an advocacy group, she will be inaugurating the Daffodil Project as an annual event. Her organization will also be honoring Hans van Waardenburg of B & K Bulbs, the Dutch businessman who contributed the bulbs, and Adrian Benepe, the city's parks and recreation commissioner. But, truth be told, it was Ms. Miller who masterminded the gift and the style of a practiced hostess, and back in the Fifth Avenue apartment, where rooms with richly colored walls melt into rooms with richly colored walls, and a once feral Conservancy Garden cat lolls on chintz, she tells the tale.
The Dutch benefactor? "Ah, the divine Hans, the bulb guy," Ms. Miller sings out. 
Then, "Sept. 11, I was mourning Wagner Park," Ms. Miller says. "I was sure Wagner Park was dead. I didn't know anyone who died, but I grieved for Wagner Park." 
When a fax arrived from Mr. van Waardenburg, Ms. Miller answered it with a handwritten fax of her own, in big, loopy writing, which, while it may be sexist to call women's college script, is hard to imagine coming from a fellow:
"Isn't it awful?! I think Wagner Park is probably destroyed, though I don't know that. I have an idea that we could plant bulbs all over the city in memory of this in all the parks -- (1,700 parks). Do you think that the Dutch bulb growers would donate any? I could also try to raise $ --."
Pretty smooth, she is told.
"I was being very subtle. I didn't want to ask him directly, because I knew how generous he was."
It sure sounds like she asked him directly.
"I did, but I was subtle; this is me being subtle," Ms. Miller says. "What I didn't want to do was put him on the spot."
Whom she doesn't mind putting on the spot: politicians. As a board member of the Parks Council, which has since become part of New Yorkers for Parks, she worked toward making increased funds for parks an issue in the 2001 mayoral campaign. She speaks proudly of a rally in Union Square, which had representatives of 1,000 city parks, she says. The organization also convinced five out of six candidates to sign a pledge to "work to restore the funding of the parks to 1 percent of the city budget." It was not a firm commitment, and many thought it too ambiguous, but Ms. Miller considered it a victory.
Then came Sept. 11, Ms. Miller says, and there went that. No matter, her organization will continue to work. You doubt her ability?
"I helped get a son no one had heard of elected," she says. "I've worked in campaigns."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: THE ELECTORATE; 
Familiar Results Belie Voting Bloc Breakdown

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
In three successful runs for governor, George E. Pataki's share of the total vote has barely changed -- 49 percent in 1994, 54 percent in 1998 and 49 percent on Tuesday.
 That looks like a static electorate, but those numbers disguise dramatic changes in where the Republicans' and Democrats' votes are coming from. Tuesday's election added a new chapter to what may be the most significant long-term story in New York politics: the breakdown of geographic and ethnic voting blocs whose party allegiances were once bred in the bone. 
 "Every part of the state is more competitive than it used to be, and every group of voters is more up for grabs," said Michael McKeon, the governor's communications director. "Neither party can take anyone for granted any more." 
The traditional patterns are still there, but weaker, and they show themselves in legislative races and statewide contests that draw little attention. Tuesday's election for state comptroller was a perfect example: the Democrat, Alan G. Hevesi, won overwhelmingly in the city; the Republican, John J. Faso, won easily upstate; and they were competitive in the suburbs.
But in high-profile contests, that template is less true each year.
In three elections, the share of the New York City vote won by Mr. Pataki, a Republican, rose from 28 percent to 33 percent to 39 percent -- the latter being the best showing by a Republican candidate for governor in the last half-century.
The trend for Mr. Pataki in upstate New York, the longtime Republican stronghold, has been in the opposite direction, from 62 percent to 57 percent to 51 percent.
Mr. Pataki benefited from New York City voters' growing willingness to go with Republicans, a trend that has produced three successive Republican mayoral victories for the first time in the city's history. But he also shrewdly nurtured that trend, courting labor unions and Hispanics, normally Democratic pillars.
With legislative deals worth billions of dollars to raise worker salaries, the governor cemented his relationships with the two most politically powerful labor groups, 1199/S.E.I.U., the health care workers union, and the United Federation of Teachers. He won the endorsements of those and other unions, giving him access to thousands of foot soldiers in the city who ordinarily would be in the Democratic camp.
The health workers union sent more than a million pieces of mail to its members urging a vote for Mr. Pataki, and on Election Day it had 4,000 volunteers on its get-out-the-vote effort and 80 people calling voters from dawn to dusk.
Mr. McCall, who won 53 percent of the vote in the city, also had union backing, but not as potent as the governor's. Democrats traditionally rely on the unions for much of their get-out-the-vote effort, and union leaders on both sides said that the effort for Mr. McCall was anemic.
The split among unions kept the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., the umbrella group for all of them, from taking sides, an important factor in marshalling Election Day resources. "A Democratic candidate is traditionally at 70 percent or higher in New York City, but when the unions are split, and some are neutral, you can't do that," said Denis M. Hughes, president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O.
The governor's political advisers have said that the key to the Republican Party's survival in an increasingly Democratic and nonwhite state is to win over the Hispanic population. Mr. Pataki methodically chased that vote for the last two years, learning some Spanish and using it frequently, building alliances with Hispanic officials, becoming a vocal opponent of naval bombardment on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques, and visiting Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republican.
No exit polls are available yet from Tuesday, but John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University Graduate Center, analyzed votes by election district and estimated that Mr. Pataki won 38 percent of the Hispanic vote, to 56 percent for Mr. McCall. That is a marked change from 1998, when Mr. Pataki won 25 percent.
Mr. Mollenkopf said his analysis showed that Mr. Pataki fared better than ever among Jewish voters, but that black voters kept to their traditional support of Democrats, with well over 90 percent voting for Mr. McCall, who is black.
Mr. Pataki's biggest improvement by county was in the Bronx, the state's most Hispanic county, where he won 31 percent of the vote, up 8 percentage points from 1998. In the heavily South American communities in central Queens, he won an outright majority.
Mr. Pataki's declining vote upstate is partly a product of the growing appeal of Tom Golisano, the Rochester billionaire running on the Independence Party line, who won 22 percent of the upstate vote. But the Republicans' grip on upstate has clearly slipped in recent elections, and Mr. Golisano's success there can be read as a protest vote against the governor in a region where people are suffering from economic stagnation.
Mr. McCall took 24 percent of the upstate vote, a showing that is stronger than it appears. He was badly outspent in a three-way race, and split the anti-incumbent vote with Mr. Golisano. His counterpart four years ago, Peter F. Vallone, won just 17 percent upstate, and Mario M. Cuomo, in 1994, took only 33 percent and nearly won the election.
Traditionally, the downstate suburbs have been a political battleground, with a Republican leaning. A long string of elections for county offices, legislative seats and other posts shows the suburbs becoming more fertile terrain for Democrats.
But Mr. Pataki has established an absolute stranglehold on the region, meaning that a huge number of voters now regularly split their ballots. He won 49 percent of the suburban vote in 1994, 62 percent in 1998, and 59 percent on Tuesday.
"It really does look as if a lot of the demographic voting patterns are breaking down," Mr. Mollenkopf said, "and I'd guess that will continue."

HEADLINE: FED CUTS KEY RATE BY ONE-HALF POINT IN AGGRESSIVE MOVE 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate today by half a percentage point, an aggressive move to ward off renewed economic weakness at a time when threats of terrorism and an impending confrontation with Iraq are weighing down business and consumer confidence.
 As the political parties in Washington digested the economic policy implications of Tuesday's Republican victory in the midterm election, the Fed put aside internal differences over the need for further rate cuts and voted unanimously for the half-point reduction. The step was intended to stimulate business investment and consumer spending by lowering borrowing costs. 
 But the Fed also hinted that it does not plan to cut rates again when it next meets in five weeks, reflecting a view at the central bank that rates are now low enough and that it is in any case running out of room to reduce them much further. 
Economists said the United States would now have to rely increasingly on stimulative fiscal policy -- some combination of tax cuts and increased government spending -- to give the economy a boost if it does not bounce back soon.
With Republicans now in control of the Senate as well as the House and the presidency, analysts said Congress is likely to take up a package of new tax cuts early next year.
The Fed's action today generated a mixed response on Wall Street, where stock prices first rose right after the announcement, then fell sharply before gaining ground again as investors sought to sort out the economy's prospects and the altered political landscape. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,771.01, up 92.74. The Nasdaq composite index rose 17.82, to close at 1,418.99.
The central bank cut its federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 1.25 percent, its lowest level since July 1961, from 1.75 percent, where it had been for 11 months.
It also cut its discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system by half a percentage point, to 0.75 percent from 1.25 percent.
The reductions will put downward pressure on interest rates for some types of business and consumer loans, especially those tied to the prime lending rate, which fell at many banks today in lock step with the Fed's move. The effect is likely to be less pronounced on mortgage rates, which depend largely on movements in longer-term bond prices.
It is not clear how much of a boost the economy will get from the rate cut. While lower interest rates have supported automobile sales and helped homeowners by encouraging waves of mortgage refinancing, they have had little effect on what is perhaps the biggest problem afflicting the economy: the reluctance of businesses to invest in new plants and equipment at a time when they are laden with overcapacity and face uncertain demand for their products.
After having cut the federal funds rate by 5.25 percentage points in less than two years, the Fed also now faces the question of whether to conserve the limited monetary ammunition it has left as its main rate effectively approaches the zero point, a consideration that has troubled the Japanese for years.
The Fed's decision came after several weeks in which economic indicators were weak or declining, leading some forecasters to predict that growth would slow to a crawl in the fourth quarter. 
But it also came after a weeks-long recovery in stock prices that seemed to reflect a judgment by investors that the worst for the economy might be past or soon would be. 
In the end, the Fed's decision seemed to be as much about addressing unsettled investor, consumer and business psychology as about reacting to hard numbers, reflecting the belief of Alan Greenspan, its chairman, that human nature is as often as not the main variable in times of economic stress.
It amounted to a a sharp turnaround from the Fed's last meeting, in September, when it held rates steady despite calls from at least 2 of its 12 voting members for an immediate rate cut.
"This was a 'feel-good' policy action," said Kenneth T. Mayland of ClearView Economics, a consulting firm. He noted that sectors of the economy sensitive to interest rates, like housing and automobiles, are already vigorous and that the Fed's rate cuts ripple through the economy with long lags rather than providing a quick boost.
Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm, said the Fed's real intention was "to calm the nerves of the market" until the economic indicators begin to improve.
In a statement explaining its action, the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee was careful to avoid suggesting that the economy had any deep-rooted problems that might lead it to stall again a year after emerging halfheartedly from the first recession in a decade. It emphasized that interest rates are already low enough to support an economic rebound, and that in the long run the economy is benefiting for an upturn in productivity, or business efficiency.
Instead, the Fed characterized the economy as being held back by a lack of confidence, linked in part to the possibility of a war and further terrorist attacks. Suggesting that it will not rush into further rate cuts, the Fed shifted its outlook for coming months to neutral from its previous assessment that the economy was at risk of a slowdown.
The statement said today's rate cut "should prove helpful as the economy works its way through this current soft spot."
In moving to a neutral outlook, the Fed said the risks to the economy were now balanced between a return of inflation and further economic weakness, a formulation that seemed to minimize any concern that the economy was on the brink of deflation, or a generalized decline in prices. 
Still, by cutting rates half a percentage point today, a bigger step than many analysts had expected, the Fed was following the playbook it has developed for dealing with a situation in which deflation is a risk and interest rates do not have much further to fall.
In an internal staff paper written earlier this year, the Fed concluded, based on a study of Japan's failure to deal effectively with a similar situation, that central banks should cut rates early and aggressively when confronted with deflation, even if official short-term rates are already approaching zero.
Acting aggressively now, however, gives the Fed that much less flexibility to cut rates next year, should the economy suffer a big shock like a spike in oil prices related to a war with Iraq.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "The Last Rate Cut?"The Federal Reserve yesterday cut its target rate one-half point to 1.25 percent. But it shifted its view about the balance of risks from a worry over economic weakness to a neutral stance, suggesting that the Fed may not cut further unless the economy suffers another setback. Graph shows the Fed funds target rate with the balance of risks (inflation (higher rates), weakness (lower rates), neutral) since 1999. (Source: Federal Reserve)(pg. C12)

HEADLINE: National Urban League's Chief Is Stepping Down After 8 Years 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Hugh B. Price, who has been among the nation's most outspoken civil rights advocates in his eight years as president of the National Urban League, said yesterday that he would step down by mid-April.
 Mr. Price, 60, a lawyer, told its board in a memo: "I believe very strongly that leaders of national organizations like the League should not cling to their positions interminably." 
 In an interview, he said he was seeking a new professional challenge and wanted to "recalibrate the balance between my professional and personal lives" after a grueling regimen of travel for the league, which kept him away from his Westchester County home during 38 weeks and 19 weekends in the last year.
Michael J. Critelli, the chief executive of Pitney Bowes Inc. and chairman of the league's board, said in a news release that he would name a committee to seek a new president. He praised Mr. Price's "legacy of strong leadership."
The league, based in Manhattan, was founded in 1910 and has affiliates in more than 100 cities. When Mr. Price was appointed president in July 1994, it was under financial pressure and was forced, like other civil rights organizations, to re-examine its focus in light of the changing economic and political status of African-Americans.
Mr. Price graduated from Yale Law School in 1966 and from 1978 through 1982 was a member of the editorial board of The New York Times, where he wrote about issues like public education, welfare and telecommunications.
He was a vice president of the Rockefeller Foundation when he became the league's chief executive, making organizational changes and working to improve its finances. He helped to recruit several senior executives at large corporations to serve on the league's board. And according to his memo, the league has operated with budget surpluses for six years.
He has also maintained cordial relations with the Clinton and Bush administrations, while criticizing their policies on education, capital punishment, support for the United Nations and other issues.

Eighteen hours after the polls closed in the tightest statewide election in New York, John J. Faso, a Republican assemblyman, conceded yesterday that he had lost the campaign for state comptroller to his Democratic opponent, Alan G. Hevesi.
 Although early unofficial results showed that Mr. Hevesi, the former New York City comptroller, was more than 110,000 votes ahead, Mr. Faso did not concede the race on election night, with aides saying it was too close to call. 
 Yesterday morning his aides still spoke of waiting for the official vote tally, which is to be tabulated next week. 
But by midafternoon Mr. Faso announced that he had called Mr. Hevesi to congratulate him on his victory. Mr. Faso said in a statement that a review of the election results made it clear that in all likelihood, "Neither the ballots remaining to be counted nor the recanvass could alter the results as they now appear to be."
The concession capped a political comeback for Mr. Hevesi, 62, who spent 22 years as an assemblyman representing Queens and 8 years as city comptroller before he was soundly defeated last year in his bid to become mayor of New York.
Behind the scenes, the race revived the intense political rivalry between Mr. Hevesi and Rudolph W. Giuliani, who helped derail Mr. Hevesi's mayoral ambitions last year by questioning his ethics. Mr. Giuliani was Mr. Faso's campaign chairman.
The race was much closer than many political analysts had expected. Public opinion polls just before the election showed Mr. Hevesi with comfortable double-digit leads.
The latest unofficial results compiled by The Associated Press indicated that he won by just 3 percent, with 50 percent of the vote to Mr. Faso's 47 percent.
A preliminary breakdown of the vote shows that Mr. Hevesi carried New York City by a commanding 3-to-1 margin, but lost in the suburbs and upstate. 
Mr. Hevesi's aides said that he would move ahead with preparations to assume his new office.
"The transition is going to be very informal and very low key," said Hank Morris, his campaign consultant, saying that Mr. Hevesi was intimately familiar with the job.
"This is going to be a transition from one comptroller to another comptroller."
Early yesterday morning, as he gave a victory speech to a group of bleary-eyed supporters at a Midtown hotel after a long and edgy night of watching the returns trickle in, Mr. Hevesi said he would use his new position to invest and spur investment in the state and New York City, both of which are facing large budget deficits.
"The state and city are in deep trouble," Mr. Hevesi said.
"We are going to be heavily involved in economic development, both as an adviser, marketing the state, putting business together with capital, creating new technologies and, prudently and carefully, doing what we did in New York City: leveraging pension funds to create jobs and build housing and provide for the improvement of our communities."

HEADLINE: THE 2002 ELECTIONS: FLORIDA; 
Bush Looks to 2nd Term As Analysts Point to 2004

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
The morning after a big night for the Bush brothers, Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida looked ahead today to a second term that will be as much about the 2004 presidential race as about his own goals for leading the state in the next four years.
 Upbeat but sleep deprived after a historic night of family victories, Governor Bush emerged from a Miami hotel suite to present his goals for a second term, one he said would be defined by improved reading scores, a more diverse economy and a renewal of the spirit of community. 
 "I want to continue to improve access to government for the average Floridian, especially through technology," said Mr. Bush, whose 13-percentage-point victory over the Democrat Bill McBride made him the first Republican governor in Florida history to win re-election. "And education will continue to be our highest priority." 
But political analysts said his second term would also be measured by his ability to hold the state's 25 electoral votes for his brother George. 
"Everything he does will be viewed in terms of the 2004 presidential election," said Lance de Haven-Smith, a political science professor at Florida State University. "The road to the White House runs right through the middle of Florida."
Still, Mr. Bush will have to focus on education as never before. The voters handed him a huge, unwelcome challenge by approving a measure to reduce class sizes in the state's public schools over the next eight years. Mr. Bush opposed the measure, saying it would cost the state at least $27 billion and require tax increases.
Instead, he said, he wants to focus on improving reading skills, diversifying Florida's tourism-driven economy and and helping families in crisis through programs related to domestic violence, child support and the developmentally disabled. Mr. Bush said he would assemble a transition team to seek advice on policy, coordinate staffing and conduct a review of state government "from an outside perspective."
Jim Kane, director of the Florida Voter Poll, a political news and polling service, said the transition planning might lead to a more bipartisan administration, and added, "By reaching out to Democrats and independents, he prevents the other side from becoming organized and successfully opposing his brother in the next election."
For now, voters in Florida have given Mr. Bush an enormous vote of confidence. On Tuesday, he won 56.3 percent of the vote to Mr. McBride's 42.9 percent.
Voter turnout in Florida was remarkably high for a midterm election: 42.9 percent, up from 36.5 percent in 1998 and 41.5 percent in 1994, according to the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, a research group based in Washington.
"Turnout was higher among Republicans and much lower among Democrats," Mr. Kane said. "You would think Democrats, because it was Jeb, would have voted no matter what. But you have to give credit to the Bush campaign. They managed to create enough doubt in voters as to whether McBride would be a good governor that many decided that staying home was better."
Republican leaders were more blunt. "For four years, the Democrats, liberal special interests and union bosses have thrown everything but the kitchen sink at Governor Bush and our Republican Legislature, and recently the national Democrat Party elite labeled our governor as their top target," said Al Cardenas, Florida's Republican chairman. "But on Election Day, Florida voters proved they know how to vote -- physically and philosophically."
Democrats said Mr. Bush should take care not to overstep his mandate. "If they want to take the state to the far right, then they do that at their own peril," said Ryan Banfill, a party spokesman. "Florida, no matter what the results say, is philosophically a divided state." 
Mr. McBride, a wealthy Tampa lawyer, had won the Democratic nomination by upsetting the early favorite, former Attorney General Janet Reno. He put up a good fight but was outgunned from the start, Mr. Banfill said, adding: "You had the president of the United States flying into Florida a dozen times. He effectively turned Air Force One into Jeb Force One."
Mac Stipanovich, a Republican strategist in Tallahassee, said that while Governor Bush was doubtless thinking about returning the family favor in 2004, his primary motivation was improving Floridians' lives. "He definitely feels more pressure than the governor of Idaho," Mr. Stipanovich said. "But I think this governor believes in what he does and does what he thinks is right."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Yankees' Tier a Bargain Basement

BYLINE:  By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
You can buy a grande caffe mocha and an oatmeal cookie at Starbucks or a fitness magazine that promises amazing abs, or drive across the George Washington Bridge (with E-ZPass), all for about $5. Or you can buy a ticket to a smattering of Yankees games next season for the same price. Five bucks to see the Yankees? That sounds as believable as the Yankees' adopting the rally monkey, but it's true.
 The Yankees raised ticket prices by 7 percent for next season and cited the new collective bargaining agreement that will end up costing them about $55 million in luxury taxes and revenue sharing. It was no surprise that the Yankees increased their prices after setting a franchise attendance record, 3.465 million, last season. The fans keep flocking to Yankee Stadium, and they will be asked to help support George Steinbrenner's burgeoning payroll and the escalating costs of owning the Yankees. 
 But the Yankees have also showed creativity by introducing several discount plans for next season that are designed to make the games more affordable for the fan not inclined to pay $72 for a box seat with waiter service. The most intriguing of these plans -- which received an ad-libbed, and unpublicized, test run in 2002 -- involves eight games in which the great majority of seats in the massive upper deck will be sold for $5, instead of $10 to $35, a concept as foreign as the two-and-a-half-hour game.
"It's a sign of the times," said Dan Migala, the executive editor of Team Marketing Report, a sports marketing publication. "It's not a minor league idea. It's creative. It's out of the box. It fills a need. It's a nice, subtle way to get a few people back in the ballpark."
The Yankees are not the first or the only team to offer truly affordable tickets in a bid to lure fans to the park. The Arizona Diamondbacks have always sold 300 game-day tickets for $1 and also offer 7,500 more seats for $6. The Los Angeles Dodgers sell 10,500 seats for $6. The Kansas City Royals have 6,343 seats in a $5 section. The Cincinnati Reds are opening the Great American Ballpark in 2003, and it will include about 1,700 $5 seats. The Chicago White Sox discount more than one-third of their tickets. All of these teams and others offer the low-priced tickets all season. The Yankees are offering the $5 tickets for one-tenth of their schedule.
But what makes the Yankees' adoption of the $5 ticket noteworthy, even for eight games, is their recent history. The Yankees have drawn 13.25 million fans across the last four years, a major league best, and have also won four World Series championships since 1996. If there is one team with a product attractive enough not to mark it down, it is the Yankees. Instead, they increased the prices for the expensive seats, figuring that those fans can better handle it, and might have half the Stadium filled with $5 ticket-holders on a handful of nights.
"I kind of applaud them for it," said Scott Brubaker, senior vice president of marketing and sales for the Diamondbacks. "It's not a Yankee-type move. I'm going to be interested to see how it works out. They may be on to something."
Another wrinkle that baseball executives expect to become more and more prominent is variable ticket pricing. The Colorado Rockies have been one of the teams at the forefront of this policy: charging more for tickets to certain games against elite opponents, or on important dates. Several teams are adding or considering variable pricing. The Cleveland Indians, who have seen their attendance plummet by more than 800,000 since 2000, have reduced prices on four ticket types. But the Indians also added 10 "showcase" games for which they will charge $5 extra per ticket.
Back in the Bronx, one five-spot gets you at least nine innings of baseball. In those eight games, the Yankees are offering 24,706 of their 57,468 seats for $5. But do not get greedy and expect to see the Red Sox or the Mets for $5 and do not be silly and think that you will see the sweat on Derek Jeter's neck because your seats will be close to the on-deck circle. Be realistic about what $5, even in a sweet deal, gets you.
The one weekday and seven weeknight affairs the Yankees have singled out run from April to August and include games with the Minnesota Twins, who advanced further than the Yankees this postseason; the Royals; the Tampa Bay Devil Rays; the Baltimore Orioles; and the Toronto Blue Jays, who will be the opponents for a cheap date in the Bronx on four occasions. The $5 seats include 3,745 in the tier box seats along the right- and left-field lines, which usually sell for $35; the entire tier reserved section of 15,562 seats, which go for $20; and all 5,309 bleacher seats, which usually cost $10.
The Yankees actually offered a similar total of $5 tickets for eight games last season, but did so in impromptu fashion, not as a policy, and a number of those games came at the tail end of the season. Although the Yankees were second in the major leagues in attendance in 2002, they still wound up having over a million empty seats. So, in the games that are known as "dog games" in the industry because a club knows it will have difficulty attracting many fans, the Yankees are trying to fill those seats, generate more revenue and paint themselves as being fan-friendly.
"We have extra inventory," Lonn Trost, the Yankees' chief operating officer, said.
"We don't really sell out," he added, referring to the Yankees 43,323 average attendance last season. "We still have inventory. We thought it would be a great idea to make them available and affordable."
It is an interesting approach by the Yankees to remain affordable, in some capacity, to most fans, while also putting more people in the park. More fans means more concession and souvenir sales. No business wants to charge $5 for something on Monday that it sells for $35 on the other six days of the week, but Trost does not feel the $5 tickets devalue the product. Others agree.
"It's the equivalent of seeing a matinee or a big Broadway show at night," Migala said. "It's still the production of a Broadway show and all the amenities, but it's not the pizazz you'd see on a Saturday night."
Rick Cerrone, a spokesman for the Yankees, added: "A family of four can come to the game for $20, and they can bring their own food if they keep it in a bag. Why not give people a chance to go to a game at affordable prices?" 
After the Yankees lost to the Anaheim Angels in the division series in October, Trost said the Yankees studied their operating costs and the new and uncertain world in which the team will share a lot and be taxed a lot. General Manager Brian Cashman has stressed the need to cut a $135 million payroll. One way to make money is turning an empty $20 seat into a filled seat, even for a lower amount.
The Yankees are also offering $20 tier reserved seats for $14 on Tuesdays, except when they oppose Boston on May 27. They are also offering the same discount on selected games Monday through Thursday. All tickets for children 14 years old and under will be half-price if the child is with an adult. For seven games, 4,000 senior citizen tickets will be sold for $5. The team is also offering discounts for tickets purchased in advance. Tickets go on sale Dec. 13.
The Mets will announce their ticket policies in a few weeks. But Dave Howard, their senior vice president for business and legal affairs, said any price increase would be modest.
"Fans are clamoring for cheaper tickets," John O'Brien, the director of ticket operations for the Reds, said. "Even though N.B.A. seats are $120, everyone wants a cheaper baseball ticket. You have to find a happy medium between what to charge and being able to put a good product on the field." 
Brubaker, the Diamondbacks executive, called the $5 tickets part of "a very astute marketing plan" by the Yankees. He said he doubted that offering about 200,000 such tickets during the season would diminish their product. Brubaker laughed and said, "It's hard to take 26 world championships and say, 'Hey, that's not worth anything.' "
But, in this ever-fluctuating economic environment, even the Yankees realize they must do more than point to their 26 flags to entice fans. 
"Now it's a drive to get the average fan back," Migala said. "These are the people who are going to come to see the Blue Jays in freezing weather in April. I think you're definitely going to see more of it."
