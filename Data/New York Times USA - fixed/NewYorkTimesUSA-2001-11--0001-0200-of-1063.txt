HEADLINE: An Estate Lives On, Thanks to Apples 

BYLINE:  By DINITIA SMITH 

DATELINE: CLAVERACK, N.Y. 

 BODY:
FROM Route 9H, you can just glimpse Talavera, a yellow, Greek revival mansion with white trim and fluted columns. The house, serenely overlooking the Catskills and the Berkshires, seems deliberately hidden as you wind your way up a long driveway. Only as you reach the foot of the spacious lawn does Talavera reveal itself in all its faded elegance, subject to the inroads of time but occupied in unbroken succession by the Van Ness and Philip families for nearly 200 years. 
 Every fall, some 2,000 city dwellers and suburbanites make their way to the orchards around back, where descendants of the original owners are making ends meet by running a pick-your-own-apple business. Apples cost $14 to $16 a bushel, depending on the variety, which includes McIntoshes, Northern Spy, Mutsu and Jonagolds. The family also sells heritage tomatoes and pears -- among them Anjou, rare on the East Coast, and Harrow Sweet. 
 "My great-great-aunts would have died to see me in pants and down there taking money," said Leila Philip, 40, an English professor at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y. "But it's an important job that needs to be done. I enjoy the people, and I feel it connects me to a long history." 
The Philip family's once extensive land holdings in Columbia County -- 294 acres in 1732 -- have diminished to 125 acres. In 1992, when Ms. Philip's father, John Van Ness Philip Jr., died, it looked as though the family might lose the place forever. The cost of labor, machinery and materials had risen drastically in recent years, and apples could be raised more cheaply outside the United States. 
But the family -- five adult siblings and their mother, Julia Willis Philip, 76 -- decided to save Talavera.
"People said, 'You're crazy,' " Ms. Philip said. " 'You should sell it!' " Instead, the siblings agreed to maintain Talavera for agricultural use. They also created a trust fund for the property, a fund to be dipped into in case of calamity. The agreement will last until three years after their mother dies.
To remain competitive, the Philip family had to become modern apple growers. They are replacing the larger trees with smaller ones that will yield more fruit to the acre, a task their father began.
They recognize that just one bad harvest could tip the balance. In 1970, there were 89 apple farms in Columbia County. Today, according to the State Agriculture and Markets Department, there are fewer than half that number. An orchard across Route 9H from Talavera, owned by the Hotaling family, recently went out of business. Today, Philip Orchards is one of the last commercial orchards in town.
Ms. Philip's mother lives at Talavera and manages the farm. The siblings help out on weekends and vacations. At apple picking time, which is just ending, the whole family takes cash from customers. Leila Philip is married to the artist Garth Evans and has a son, Rhys, 4. She comes down from Hamilton regularly to assist with the "bug checks" (looking for pests) and with pruning. Every year, she and her mother attend "fruit school," run by the Cornell Cooperative Extension, where they learn about new apple breeds and pest control regulations.
John Philip, a lawyer and actor in New York, cares for the formal gardens and the heritage tomatoes. In the summer, William Philip, a linguistics professor in the Netherlands, arrives to help out. Thomas Philip, a construction project manager in New York, oversees building projects. Another sibling, Katherine Chansky, a librarian in Saratoga Springs, cares for the main house.
The family has struggled to repair the house and to make the orchards profitable. "Without that kind of involvement, it would be impossible," Leila Philip said.
Her involvement has also included delving into the family's attic -- the diaries, trunks and boxes -- and local records, a search that turned up renegade aunts, ne'er-do-wells, Civil War heroes and a secret love child, the result of a relationship between her grandfather and a maid at Talavera. Ms. Philip, who previously wrote "The Road Through Miyama," about her apprenticeship to a master Korean potter in Japan, then sat down to write "A Family Place: A Hudson Valley Farm, Three Generations, Five Wars, One Family," published by Viking Press. A review in Publishers' Weekly called it "an exquisite rendering of a Hudson Valley family farm, as detailed and colored as a Persian miniature." 
The book begins with a scene that evokes the powerful hold of the house upon the family: "Before me stood Talavera, but all around was darkness," Ms. Philip writes. "Light was spewing out from so many of the tall windows that the house could have been a ship sailing the night sea." 
Elsewhere she calls the house "that grand vessel of the past." Ms. Philip's family arrived in America in 1669, when a Dutch admiral, Adrian Van Ness, settled near Albany. His descendant Willem founded the family farm in Claverack, with a Dutch-style farmhouse. 
Over the years, the Van Nesses married into Hudson Valley aristocracy, the Livingstons, the Philipses of Philmont, the Stottses of Stottville. In 1807, Willem's grandson, William W. Van Ness, a judge in the New York State Supreme Court, built Talavera, named after the Battle of Talavera de la Reina in Spain, Napoleon's famous land defeat by the British.
Talavera was built in the neoclassical style favored by the English, instead of the reigning Dutch style in Claverack. Its formal gardens were laid out like an English estate, with a gradual flowing of park land into farmland. Trees were planted deliberately to create areas of light and dark. A lilac walkway and a cedar walk were added.
Today, the estate has been reduced to less than half its former size. And despite the Philip family's effort to support Talavera through selling apples (and selling off a Gilbert Stuart portrait of Ms. Philip's ancestor Gen. John P. Van Ness), the 15-room house is something of a grand ruin. The wallpaper is peeling, the upholstery on the furniture is torn, the rugs are threadbare. Some parts of the house, including the dining room, still have no electricity.
Ms. Philip rationalizes that doing work on the house could risk destroying Talavera's historical integrity. "Sometimes the worst thing you can do to an old house is repair it," she said. "Everything needs to be done by people who have a historical background. There are not that many carpenters who even know how to put a base on the big columns on the front." 
The house's very authenticity led the New York company of Brunschwig & Fils in the 1980's to copy the 1812 French wallpaper in the dining room. In exchange for the copyright on a design the company called Talavera, it gave the Philip family enough wallpaper to do the dining room. (Beige Talavera wallpaper is still available from Brunschwig for $47 a roll.) Much more remains to be done for Talavera, including rewiring, replastering and new plumbing.
Friends have pitched in to help. In May of last year, at the family's annual apple blossom picnic, one friend presented the family with a copy of the Gilbert Stuart portrait, to hang in the dining room, right where the original once hung.
The family is struggling to decide what to do when Mrs. Philip is unable to run the farm anymore. In the event of her death, "then, we are at a critical juncture," Ms. Philip said. The agreement among the siblings could be broken, the land could be sold.
Still, this year there was a good apple harvest, she said. "The economics are definitely year by year. But we've learned we can get through a really hard time," she said, "and we're still here."

HEADLINE: Afghan Art Dispersed by The Winds Of War; 
A Nation Loses Its Heritage To Smugglers and Dealers

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
On a recent visit to a London antique dealer, David Kamansky, director of the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena, Calif., was presented with a shoe box. Inside, covered with flimsy paper, were fragments of a 2,000-year-old ivory casket, decorated with intricate Indian carvings, unmistakably part of the famous Begram collection that once belonged to the Kabul Museum in Afghanistan.
 "For someone like me, it was like being handed the 'Mona Lisa' in bits," Mr. Kamansky said. "Here were some of the great treasures of mankind in a shoe box, wrapped in toilet paper." 
 Knowing that trading art from a museum collection is illegal under United States law and a host of international treaties, Mr. Kamansky refused the piece, which was priced at several hundred thousand dollars. That was the last he saw of the Begram ivories. "Where they are now, I don't know," he said. "I've heard they were in New York somewhere for sale, but I have no idea." 
Long before the latest war began, the fabulous art treasures of Afghanistan -- deposited there by overlapping Greek, Buddhist and Islamic civilizations -- were presumed gone, destroyed by 20 years of war, economic desperation and, most recently, by the Taliban's fundamentalist brand of Islam.
And yet during the last decade, much of the art has made its way out of Afghanistan to North America, Western Europe and, in particular, Japan. These places are the end of the road for smuggling pieces that are plundered by the warring factions in Afghanistan, pass into Pakistan or the former Soviet lands to the north, and make their way onto the international art market. 
The Taliban's war on "false idols," which culminated in March in the dramatic destruction of two giant Buddhas at Bamiyan, has added urgency to the trade in antiquities from Afghanistan, heightening demand and prices. Alarmed by the Taliban's actions, Unesco, an important international arbiter on cultural property, relaxed, in the case of Afghanistan, a 30-year policy that discouraged the unsanctioned export of cultural patrimony. The move, however, was intended to safeguard the objects for eventual return, not drive them into the private market.
Edward Wilkinson, an assistant vice president at Sotheby's and an expert in Indian and South Asian art, said that prices for Gandharan sculptures -- representing one of the great civilizations of ancient Afghanistan -- have increased by an average of 30 percent during the last year.
Since March, Mr. Wilkinson said, he has fielded weekly offers, mostly from Pakistan and India, to sell objects from Afghanistan. His standard reply, he said, has been to suggest that the dealers call a museum. "These are not things we can offer for sale," he said he has told callers. "Period." 
"After the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas, dealers tried to make a killing," said Nancy Hatch Dupree, a resident of Peshawar, Pakistan, and vice chairwoman of the Society for the Preservation of Afghanistan's Cultural Heritage. "I received offers of 300 statues 'from Bamiyan' for a mere $1.5 million." In an e-mail from Peshawar, Ms. Dupree added that the dealers had had the pieces for years but had been unable to sell them.
Artworks from the region, including ones with uncertain provenance, do make it onto the market. Some come into the United States and Europe via Japan, where collectors and museums have been willing and unquestioning buyers of Buddhist art from Afghanistan. 
A major difficulty in determining the provenance of a piece is that ancient civilizations straddled modern-day borders. One such civilization is the Buddhist Gandharan Empire, from the first century A.D. to the fifth, which stretched into the northern Pakistan of today. Last month, Christie's in New York sold a 38-inch-tall Gandharan figure for $374,000; it had been in a Japanese collection since 1990 according to Christie's. 
"Luckily a lot of Gandharan art has come out to Japan in the last two decades," said Hugo Weihe, an international specialist for Indian and South Asian art for Christie's in New York. "For the Japanese this is very important because it was through the Silk Road that Buddhism came to Japan." He added that the figure sold last month was believed to be from Pakistan.
At the International Asian Art Fair in March in New York, the John Eskenazi gallery of London offered a Gandharan head of Bacchus that was identified as coming from northeast Pakistan but was remarkably similar to stucco heads found in Afghanistan, said Dr. Vishakha N. Desai, director of the Asia Society's museum in New York.
The Metropolitan Museum of Art expressed interest in buying the head, said Kate Cook, a director at John Eskenazi, but the piece eventually went to a private collector.
Only John Eskenazi, the gallery's owner, could answer questions about the provenance of the piece, and he was traveling in Italy, Ms. Cook said.
The smuggling of Afghan antiquities, which experts say has accompanied the trade in weapons and drugs, involves virtually all sides in Afghanistan's complicated and shifting civil wars. Experts say that the illicit trade also has involved high-ranking members of the previous government in Pakistan. 
Robert Puffer, an American who lived in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, and who by his own admission acted as a go-between for antiquities dealers, said that smugglers routinely did business with Nasirullah Babar, who served as interior minister in the former government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
During the 1990's, Mr. Babar made no effort to hide his rich collection of Afghan art, and even showed it off in 1997 to a visiting correspondent from The New York Times. But Mr. Babar insisted that he was holding the precious ivories, gold coins and Hellenistic heads for safekeeping.
During the Bhutto era, Mr. Puffer said, antiquities from Afghanistan "flowed through Pakistan like a river." Mr. Puffer claimed he once saw a precious bronze bowl from the Kabul Museum holding fruit in one dealer's house, and in another, an animal figure whose legs and antlers had been broken off by rough handling.
According to more recent reports, the antiquities trade has slowed somewhat under Gen. Pervez Musharraf, whose presidency has instituted stricter controls at Pakistan's borders.
The destruction of Afghanistan's cultural heritage is directly linked to the country's wars. Since the 1979 Soviet invasion, hundreds of important archaeological sites have been dug up, some by bulldozers and tanks. The Kabul Museum was hit by a rocket in 1993, and since then it has been overrun by warring clans of mujahedeen. Recent visitors said all that was left of what was once an exquisite collection of centuries of Central Asian culture was a simple one-room exhibition of Islamic art.
One unsolved mystery is the fate of a collection of more than 20,000 gold objects, known as the Hoard of Bactrian Gold, which was excavated by a joint Soviet-Afghan team on the eve of the 1979 Soviet invasion. The gold, which had been found in five tombs at Tillya Tepe, an archaeological site in northern Afghanistan, was taken to Kabul and later stored in a vault at the royal palace. Where it is now, no one seems to know. 
The trade in Afghan art has raised perplexing questions about how best to care for art that has been put under a death sentence in its homeland. "I think in the 21st century, relationships between the world community and national heritage have to be rethought," said Dr. Desai of the Asia Society. "Before Bamiyan, the argument was toward national heritage. Now I am feeling that some new solutions have to be found."
When Unesco relaxed its policy protecting national cultures in their country of origin, the chief beneficiary was the Afghanistan Museum, a small institution in Switzerland. It paradoxically was created by the Taliban government and leaders of its opposition, the Northern Alliance, who in the late 1990's sought a safe haven for Afghanistan's cultural heritage. Supported by donations and a $10,000 Unesco grant, this museum in Bubendorf, a village outside Basel, has been holding the objects for safekeeping and has seen its collection grow from several hundred items to more than 2,000.
Most are historical or ethnographic objects, but Paul Bucherer, a Swiss architect who is the director of the museum, said that during the last six months he had received several donations of items that had once been in the Kabul Museum.
Among the donations were Gandharan relief carvings with Buddhist images, which arrived by mail from Hong Kong; a gravestone from Ghazni; and some fragments of Begram ivories, which were donated by a Western European dealer. All these, Mr. Bucherer said, were being kept in a bank vault, because the museum lacked an adequate security system. The original idea behind the museum, as envisaged by its Afghan sponsors, was to create a place where national treasures could be held until Afghanistan returned to some form of normal life.
Everything has been donated; nothing is bought, Mr. Bucherer said. "We are behaving like a basket," he said. "Everybody who is ready to give can put what they have in the basket, but we are not climbing up a ladder to get the apples out of the tree."
Much art from Afghanistan is being left in limbo -- too hot for the international markets and too valuable to be donated to the museum in Bubendorf. Some works are finding their way back into Pakistan.
Mr. Kamansky, at the Pacific Asia Museum, says he has tried to convince collectors and museums to buy objects on the black market and hold them for a future Afghanistan. 
That approach has worked in some cases. Ms. Dupree says a museum in Tokyo that acquired a marble foot, identified as being from Ai Khanum, a Hellenistic city built by Alexander the Great in what is now Afghanistan, has exhibited it with the pledge to eventually return it to Afghanistan.
But most museums are not willing to acquire artworks on a temporary basis, Mr. Kamansky said. Yet, like others, he believes antiquities belong somewhere other than in a shoe box. "If the museums buy, we were arguing that they should recognize that they belong in a future Afghanistan," he said of the region's art objects. "Nobody wants to hand them back to the Taliban."
In 1989, Afghan officials challenged the Metropolitan Museum of Art, saying that a 1,700-year-old Gandharan head of a Buddha, best known for its garnet eyes, which the museum had acquired in 1985, had been looted from a storeroom of a Jalalabad museum.
The Met argues that the piece is better off in New York. "If it was in the storeroom, then the storeroom was destroyed in the fighting," said Harold Holzer, the museum's vice president for communications. "So in a way, the Met has fulfilled its role of safeguarding treasures of world culture." Besides, Mr. Holzer added, referring to the absence of a credible government in Kabul, "there is no active claim for the piece."

HEADLINE: Anxiety Infuses November Art Sales 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Christie's offices in Europe began getting panicked telephone calls two weeks ago from alarmed collectors who had received envelopes from Christie's in New York containing a mysterious white powder. A woman from Lausanne, Switzerland, was so concerned she called the police.
 It turned out that the substance was crushed hard candy attached to a promotional announcement of Christie's contemporary art sale. The mailer featured one of the star works, an installation piece by the Cuban-born artist Felix Gonzalez-Torres composed of 325 pounds of candy, the pieces individually wrapped in blue cellophane. 
 The candy had been pulverized going through the mail sorters in Europe. 
The incident was no laughing matter for Christie's amid an already jittery art market worried about the impact of the events of Sept. 11 and a shaky economy on the multimillion-dollar November sales that get under way in New York on Monday night.
Complicating matters, Thursday will bring the opening of the trial of A. Alfred Taubman, Sotheby's former chairman, who was indicted last year on charges that he fixed commission fees to thousands of customers with his counterpart at Christie's. Anxiety levels at Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips de Pury & Luxembourg are running high. To draw business, all three auction houses have invested millions in guarantees to sellers, but Phillips has the most at stake, because it has invested the most money.
Will the trial and negative publicity surrounding past auction house practices have an effect on business? Will the European collectors who have dominated art buying over the last six months feel like traveling to New York for the sales? And perhaps the question most frequently asked, will people feel like buying art?
"It's impossible to predict the market," said Simon de Pury, chairman of Phillips. "It's like focusing the lens of a camera. At first the image is blurry. But the closer the sales get, the sharper things come into focus. On one hand they're just around the corner. On the other so much can happen before then. Auctions are all about the mood of the moment."
Experts have been comparing these sales to auctions during other troubled times, particularly the early 1990's during the Persian Gulf war, when the real estate market nose-dived and the art world froze.
Bargain hunting will be rife this season, most experts say. Dealers openly admit they hope to cash in on wholesale prices; passionate collectors say they will be on the lookout for undervalued material. To encourage buying this season the auction houses, in most cases, have kept estimates as low as the sellers will allow.
This season features several unusual 20th-century art collections. Christie's may have the surest winner among them on Tuesday, when it offers $40 million worth of art from the estate of Rene Gaffe, a Belgian perfume mogul and newspaper owner. In the 20's and 30's Gaffe bought newly finished works from masters like Picasso, Leger and Miro. Proceeds will go to charity, and everything is being sold without reserves, the secret minimum price generally agreed upon by the seller and the auction house. Most of this high-quality collection has not been seen publicly for 70 to 80 years. 
Gaffe died in 1968, leaving his collection to his wife, Jeanne. Before she died in October, she designated Unicef as the beneficiary. Among the collection's stars is Leger's "Motor" (1918). A post-Cubist painting completed after Leger's return from World War I, it is based on the structure of an engine that drives a propeller of an airplane or ship. It is estimated to sell for $4 million to $6 million.
The collection also features several rare Picassos. A 1908 gouache, "Nude in a Forest," which is expected to sell for $4 million to $6 million, depicts a nymph with her legs spread, drawn in massive, flattened planes. It was once owned by Gertrude Stein and relates closely to Picasso's "Demoiselles d'Avignon." A Picasso sculpture, "Head of a Woman (Fernande)" is one of the great examples of modernist sculpture. The original cast was produced in 1909, and this bronze version is thought to have been made shortly thereafter.
Sculpture has been exceptionally popular for the last several seasons because it is one area of the market that is still undervalued and because buyers have begun to broaden the kinds of art they purchase. This month there will be more sculptures than have been for sale in recent memory. At Phillips, sculpture accounts for half of the 72 works of 20th-century art from the collection of Nathan and Marion Smooke of Los Angeles.
The Smooke collection, which is being auctioned on Monday, was bitterly fought over by the three auction houses. Phillips won, dipping into the deep pockets of its parent company, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, to offer the Smooke heirs a guarantee, an undisclosed amount promised to a seller regardless of the outcome of the sale. At the time it was announced that the collection would go to Phillips, people close to the negotiations said the auction house had given the Smooke heirs a $185 million guarantee, far more than the $80 million to $100 million estimate experts at Phillips have now put on the collection. 
During the final negotiations, about $15 million worth of the art -- small but rare works by Matisse, Picasso, Ernst and Derain -- were removed from the auction. When the auction catalog came out, rumors began circulating that most of this art had been bought by Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, for the museum he is building in Paris. 
"It's totally untrue," Mr. de Pury said. "All the works from the collection that are not in the sale have been retained by the family." 
Mr. Smooke, who died in 1991, was the president of Wellman Properties, an industrial real estate concern and a founding board member of the Los Angeles County Museum, where the collection was shown in 1987. The Smookes formed their collection over 25 years, buying art from dealers like John and Paul Herring in New York and the Lefevre Gallery in London as well at auction. 
Known as collectors who were always looking for a bargain, the Smookes often bought works that had failed to sell at an auction, getting the pieces at lower prices. For sale are Picassos from different periods in his career, the work of several major Fauvre artists like Vlaminck, and a number of German Expressionist paintings. 
Among the rarest is a 1916 Modigliani portrait, "Almaisa," depicting one of his favorite models, with large almond-shaped eyes and an elongated nose that recall the facial distortions of an African mask. It is estimated to sell for $6 million to $8 million. There is also a Modigliani sandstone sculpture of a woman's head, one of only 25 sculptures he made, which is expected to fetch $2 million to $3 million. A landscape by Egon Schiele, "Suburban House With Washing," from 1917, is estimated at $8 million to $12 million.
For collectors interested in German art there are several collections spanning the entire 20th century. Early masters by Emil Nolde, Max Liebermann and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff are part of a collection Phillips is selling on Monday. 
These works come from the holdings of Diethelm Hoener, a German investment banker who died this year. One painting in particular comes with an unusual history. Schmidt-Rottluff's "Reader" (1911) was saved from the Nazis in 1937 by a Berlin collector named J. A. Benkert. When Phillips experts removed the painting from its frame, they found the following inscription: "Former possession: Museum Erfurt. Saved from burning in the Kopenicker Street. Exchanged for my Courbet. Proprietor: J. A. Benkert, Berlin, Charlottenburg, Reichs 99."
The painting was held by the Nazis in a depot in Berlin to be burned when Benkert, realizing its importance, traded it for a Courbet in his collection. "It's only one of four portraits of that early period by the artist that survived," said David Breuer-Weil, the international specialist at Phillips. 
More contemporary German art is also up for sale this month. "Germany is one of the strongest collecting countries," said Brett Gorvy, international head of postwar art at Christie's, "and many of these collectors are getting to an age where they want to refine their collections. Other sellers have seen prices rising higher even than those in 1989 during the boom market."
Mr. Gorvy was referring to a $12.5 million collection Christie's is selling on Nov. 13 as part of its postwar sale. This one, spanning 1945 to the present, features contemporary stars like Sigmar Polke, Georg Baselitz and Anselm Kiefer. The collection is being sold by Hans Grothe, a 70-year-old German real estate developer who began collecting in the early 1970's and who is selling some of his 400-work collection in order to develop other art projects. Among the highlights of the collection is "The Shepherd," a Baselitz painting from his hero series. It is estimated to bring $1 million to $1.5 million. 
Like Phillips, Christie's had to give Mr. Grothe a guarantee in order to get the collection. Experts close to the auction house say it is $10 million, although no one at Christie's would comment. 
Sotheby's has also opened its pockets. On Nov. 14 it will sell 31 works from the collection of Douglas S. Cramer, the television and theater producer. Mr. Cramer, who has been buying art for 40 years and has come to know many of the most important American artists. This sale, too, is guaranteed. For sale will be a selection of works by Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Ellsworth Kelly and Brice Marden. 
Sotheby's has used the artists even more than the art to promote this collection. The catalog's cover, for instance, is unusual because it features not a single artwork but rather photographs of the artists.

HEADLINE: U.S. Imposes a Second Duty On Canadian Lumber Imports 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
The Commerce Department accused Canadian lumber producers of unfair trade practices today and imposed a double-digit duty on their exports to the United States. 
 The department said today that it would impose antidumping duties averaging 12.6 percent on imports of softwood lumber, flooring and siding from six Canadian producers. The duties, which range from 5.9 percent to 19.2 percent, are the second imposed in the last three months. 
 A countervailing duty of 19.3 percent was imposed on Aug. 17. Canadian lumber, used mainly in housing, has about a third of the American market. Imports last year were valued at $6.38 billion, the Commerce Department said.
The latest duty is a response to complaints by American producers that Canadian companies have flouted international trade rules by exporting lumber at prices below their production costs, a practice known as dumping.
The earlier countervailing duty, the Commerce Department said, was intended to offset the benefits of subsidies to Canadian sawmills, such as low fees for harvesting trees in government-owned forests.
Both duties are preliminary, with final determinations expected next March after further discussions with the affected parties. 
American homebuilders and other lumber users criticized the antidumping duty, saying it raised the cost of material at a time of weakening demand. Michael Carliner, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, said today that the pain that it caused the customer was greater than the benefit to producers in the United States.
The Canfor Corporation, a leading softwood lumber producer in Vancouver, British Columbia, has set aside 11.5 million Canadian dollars ($7.3 million) after taxes in the third quarter to cover its potential liability for countervailing duties. The chief executive of Canfor, David Emerson, said today that the company would be forced to mothballed a third of its sawmilling capacity by the end of the year.
Any assessment of the effect of the duties is complicated by the downturn in the housing sector and the weakening demand for lumber. Prices, as measured by the framing lumber composite price compiled by Random Lengths, a trade publication based in Eugene, Ore., slipped to $275 for a thousand board feet last week, from a high of $402 in May.
Burrle Elmore, editor of Random Lengths, said although the duties have raised costs for Canadian mills, everyone is feeling the pain because of the soft market for lumber. 
Failing a negotiated settlement, the Canadian producers have said they would appeal the Commerce Department decisions to the courts and invoke the dispute settlement provisions of the North American Free Trade agreement and the World Trade Organization. 
The six companies hit by the antidumping duty are Canfor, Abitibi-Consolidated, Tembec, West Fraser Timber, Slocan Forest Products and the Canadian unit of Weyerhaeuser.

HEADLINE: Argentine Leader in Talks to Avert Default on $132 Billion Debt 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
President Fernando de la Rua held intensive negotiations today with opposition governors, national labor leaders and legislative leaders in an effort to find support for a new economic plan and debt restructuring to prevent a default on Argentina's $132 billion public debt.
 The stakes are high. Argentina's debt represents 25 percent of all emerging-market bonds. A financial meltdown here would almost certainly draw neighboring Brazil into a crisis and put severe financial pressure on countries as far away as South Africa and Turkey. 
 "We will not default and we will not devalue," Mr. de la Rua said after reports that the United States Treasury would not seek a new rescue package from the International Monetary Fund to avert what a growing consensus of Wall Street economists view as a likely default.
In recent days, the Argentine bond and stock markets have plummeted, and bank deposits have dropped as the government has delayed policy announcements and appeared to be adrift.
The "zero deficit" policy of cutting deficits by reducing government workers' salaries and pensions has failed to improve finances or bring down interest rates. Declines in tax receipts, consumer sales and manufacturing have quickened at alarming rates over the last two months.
The slowdown has put enormous pressure on local governments to pay teachers and other public workers, forcing Buenos Aires Province to begin printing scrip to meet its bills and other provinces to suspend vital services. 
Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo has assembled a package of policies to stimulate consumer spending, with subsidies for poor families and sales-tax breaks for consumers who buy with credit cards. But the government has delayed announcing the plans until it puts together a broad coalition to support the measures to assure the support of the opposition-controlled Congress. 
The powerful opposition governors of Buenos Aires, Cordoba and Santa Fe have withheld support until there is a settlement with Mr. de la Rua over more than $520 million in central government funds owed to the provinces. Behind closed doors, the governors and president discussed today formulas to distribute the funds in cash and bonds.
"The central government has to find a way to enable the provincial governments to conserve the social peace and comply with their obligations," Gov. Carlos Reutemann of Santa Fe, a leader of the Justicialist Party, said before meeting Mr. de la Rua.
Last weekend, senior officials acknowledged that they would seek to renegotiate payments with foreign and domestic creditors, emphasizing that any swap of bonds for financial instruments with lower interest rates would be strictly voluntary. But international credit agencies have characterized any such renegotiation as effectively a default. 
A renegotiation would probably need international guarantees for investors. Mr. Cavallo traveled to New York last week seeking support from the Bush administration and officials of several lending agencies, but appeared to fall short of his objectives.
The I.M.F. put together a $40 billion rescue package in December and a second package, of $8 billion, in fresh money and loan guarantees in August. A few months ago, Argentina negotiated a complex $30 billion bond swap to push interest payments into the future. But each maneuver won just a few weeks of stability, before a new crisis emerged.

HEADLINE: A Rare Leader Tries to Save Mexico's Fallen Party 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 30 

 BODY:
Her party may be near collapse, but Beatriz Paredes refuses to indulge in eulogies. 
 In a year in which the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, is out of power for the first time in seven decades, a recent memorial for the party's founder, Plutarco Elias Calles, felt like a funeral. Battle anthems sounded and wreaths of chrysanthemums adorned the podium. 
 Then Ms. Paredes, the president of Mexico's lower chamber of the Parliament, took the microphone. Blending respect for the PRI's past with reproach for its many misdeeds, this rare woman at the top of Mexican politics said with surprising clarity that if her party wanted to be a credible opposition force, it must embrace calls for change, and not feel threatened by them. 
"Circumstances oblige the party to change its methods," she said. "This is not only about winning elections and taking power. A real party, with ethics and vision, understands that power can bring moral legitimacy when it is exercised for the good of its citizens and for justice." 
Ms. Paredes, 48, has emerged as one of the prominent architects of the reformed PRI. Her politics forged in the trenches of Mexico's peasant movements, she is at once representative of the party's past and its potential future. 
The PRI lost last year's presidential elections when women and young people jettisoned the party in droves, and it has gone down to defeat in most of the state elections since.
The party has been close to collapse, with its factions fighting over everything from whether to give the party a new name to the rules for electing a new leader to replace Dulce Maria Sauri, the current party president. It was on her watch that the PRI lost the presidency, and she is widely associated with the party's past mistakes.
Some analysts have even pronounced the PRI dead, its coffin sealed by a long record of corruption, violent repression and impunity.
Ms. Paredes is trying to rally both the party faithful and potential new supporters, and she is seen as someone who could draw women and young people back to the PRI. 
Her support for feminist causes and her authority in political circles that are still dominated by men have helped raise her popularity among women. Young people see her political style -- marked by colorful Indian clothing that honors her ancestry, speeches infused with references to literature, and a deft sense of decorum -- as a powerful contrast to the conservative, pro-business forces led by President Vicente Fox.
But before the party can expand its base, Ms. Paredes says, it must first end its mourning over losing the presidency and set its sights on winning back Mexico's poor, a traditional power base.
In her current position, roughly equivalent to speaker of the House in the United States, Ms. Paredes is well-placed to try and rally the PRI. She has said that she wants Mexico's Congress to act as a check on the once all-consuming powers of the presidency, and sees the legislature as the perfect staging ground for her mission to reconnect the PRI to the people's causes.
She has drawn attention both for her speeches and her actions, notably unifying her party, which for years had battled the Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, behind an effort to allow the rebels to address Congress last spring.
Recently, she has hinted that she would not support President Fox's sweeping tax reforms, which include new taxes on food and medicine. President Fox has said the reforms are critical to battling recession. But with nearly half of Mexicans living in poverty, the reforms have been widely opposed -- even by legislators from Mr. Fox's own National Action Party. And PRI leaders see the current economic turmoil as a chance to gain support among the poor.
In an interview, Ms. Paredes called herself a center-leftist and a feminist. Some of her priorities include equal rights for Mexico's Indian minorities, higher wages for unskilled workers, financial support for the nation's principal public university and programs to help lift poor farmers out of poverty, malnutrition and illiteracy.
"I believe more in the militants than the elite of the PRI," she said. 
In contrast to Mr. Fox, who is a former marketing executive who once ran Coca-Cola's Mexican operations and a Roman Catholic who puts his faith on display, Ms. Paredes embraces the workers' and peasants' causes on which her party was founded, and staunchly defends her party's traditional insistence on separating church and state. 
She is not, however, an automatic opponent of the president. Since Sept. 11, she has broken with PRI leaders who denounced Mr. Fox for supporting America's war with Afghanistan. A foreign policy adviser to Ms. Paredes, Maria Emilia Farias, said she "understands Mexico's role has to be one of solidarity in the fight against terrorism."
In November, the PRI will hold its first national convention since its defeat in July 2000. Some 11,700 delegates from across the country are to vote on numerous reforms, including rules for electing a new party president. Convention organizers have said they hope half the delegates will be women and 30 percent under 30.
Jose Antonio Crespo, a political analyst, said Ms. Paredes could mend relations between traditional party leaders, known in Mexico as dinosaurs, and Ivy League-educated technocrats, accused of tearing the party away from the poor.
Her long history in the party has won respect from traditional sectors. And in recent years, she has supported the aspirations of technocrats in the PRI, including its defeated presidential candidate, Francisco Labastida.
But perhaps the main reason for Ms. Paredes's popularity in her party is her loyalty to it.
"We have no reason to denigrate ourselves," she said at the memorial ceremony, stirring the crowd to ovation. "We have been builders of this nation."
In the newspaper Reforma, the columnist Guadalupe Loaeza suggested Ms. Paredes would make a "splendid candidate" for the presidency of the PRI.
"Beatriz is not afraid of anything or anyone," Ms. Loaeza wrote. "Her hand never shakes. She always speaks her mind. And she never beats around the bush."
Ms. Paredes has been speaking her mind since she was in high school, when she interrupted her acceptance of a national oratory award to complain about overcrowded classrooms to President Luis Echeverria. It was a moment that not only earned the high school a new classroom, but also set Ms. Paredes on a career path that even she described as meteoric.
She was a legislator in her home state, Tlaxcala, at 21, a member of Congress at 27 and the second woman to serve as a governor in Mexico at 33. From there, she served in several high-level posts, including deputy interior secretary and ambassador to Cuba.
She is the granddaughter of peasant farmers who spoke an Indian language rather than Spanish. Her mother, who came from Mexico City, taught Ms. Paredes to love music and literature. A graduate in sociology from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Ms. Paredes plays guitar and infuses her public speeches with lines from the poetry of Octavio Paz.
Ms. Paredes is not married, has no children and at times expresses flashes of vulnerability: she is careful about how she is photographed and about saying anything about her private life. In an interview with Mexican journalists, she said that women "are still judged harder on personal issues." 
Some have expressed concern that Ms. Paredes retains bad political habits learned in the years of the PRI's monolithic control of Mexico. She served as secretary general of the National Campesino Confederation, once a part of the PRI political machine more interested in keeping poor farmers under control than in helping them prosper. At times, Ms. Paredes seems so preoccupied with political protocol that she appears rigid and archaic.
"In political circles, she is known as a very capable woman, who understands how to exercise authority," said Raul Jimenez Guillen, a political expert at the Autonomous University of Tlaxcala, recalling her time as governor, "but who can also be authoritarian."
She famously admonished legislators who interrupted Mr. Fox's first State of the Union address and defended the legitimacy of his presidency. "For me, it was important to transmit to my colleagues the dignity of being a legislator," she said, "and to convey to the Mexican people that I understand that they want us to change."

HEADLINE: U.N. Acting to Keep Somalia From Becoming a Terrorist Haven 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
The United Nations, fearful Somalia could deteriorate into a terrorist haven, scrambled today to find ways to help restore peace and security to the deeply splintered northeast African nation.
 A formal statement approved by the Security Council asked Secretary General Kofi Annan to come up with ideas on how the United Nations could help demobilize Somalia's sparring militias and train the police to firm the grip of the transitional national government on the capital, Mogadishu. 
 The council also asked Mr. Annan to carry out an in-depth assessment of the security situation in the hope of clearing the way for the establishment of a political peace-building mission in Somalia. 
To the consternation of many of Somalia's neighbors, Mr. Annan has for the past year declined to set up a mission, concluding from security assessments conducted from nearby Nairobi, Kenya, that the government could not ensure the safety of United Nations staff members.
The object of a failed joint United Nations and United States peacekeeping mission between 1993 and 1995, Somalia has had a transitional government in place since August 2000.
But the government controls only sections of Mogadishu, with most of the country still dominated by warlords and clans, who have been fighting each other since ousting President Muhammad Siad Barre in 1991.
Diplomats speculate that Somalia's lawlessness makes it a potential hide-out for Osama bin Laden, the top suspect in the Sept. 11 terror attacks against the United States, should American bombing raids make it impossible for him and his backers to stay in Afghanistan.
Earlier this month, Ali Khalif Galaid, Somalia's prime minister, came to United Nations headquarters to urge the organization to help put his country together again and help fight terrorism in an effort to prevent Somalia from becoming a haven for clandestine networks.
But on Monday, Somalia's Parliament passed a vote of no confidence in the transitional national government, giving President Abdiqassim Salad Hassan 30 days to nominate a new prime minister.
Members of Parliament said they were unhappy over the government's failure to bring security to the country and bring down rampant inflation after a year in office.
In its statement approved today, the Security Council urged world governments to scrupulously comply with a United Nations embargo on arms sales to Somalia and to help it combat international terrorism.
The statement also urged neighboring countries to help Somalia rebuild its shattered governmental institutions while keeping out of its internal affairs.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Rich nations have been too insensitive to poverty for too long; the situation can no longer be ignored.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and a collection of essays, "Unconventional Wisdom: Alternative Perspectives on the New Economy." He teaches at Cooper Union and the New School. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
FEW would dispute that terrorism and violent religious fundamentalism, however complex their causes, grow best in the soil of poverty. The Sept. 11 attacks raise this issue to a new level of importance. More than any other single event, the attacks show how interconnected the world truly is. High on the new agenda has to be attention to the world's poor.
 But in recent years, a sense of futility has developed. Despite glowing optimism 20 years ago, the rich nations' record in raising the developing world to a minimal level of material well-being has been nothing short of disaster. In 1983, the World Bank predicted that developing nations' average gross domestic product would grow 3.3 percent a year over 15 years. In fact, it barely grew at all. 
 The extent of poverty remains shocking. There has been a modest decline in the portion of those who are poor, but in absolute numbers, they have risen sharply. About a third of the world lives on the equivalent of about $2 a day. In 1820, the richest country had only three times as much income per person as the poorest; today, the richest nation has 30 times the income.
Rich nations are shamefully stingy about aiding the poor, but none more so than the United States. In 1999, the World Bank reported that the United States gave 0.1 percent of its economic output for development, or $9.1 billion, the lowest proportion among the 30 or so wealthiest nations. Japan gave more than $15 billion -- still skimpy, but 0.35 percent of its output. Moreover, America stipulates that about two-thirds of the $9 billion must be spent on American products.
Some critics say that money is not the issue, that the record of poor nations is an inevitable result of debilitating cultural attitudes. Time and again, such cultural stereotypes have been defied. Malaysia, a Muslim nation, is a great economic success. Catholic France has a higher standard of living than Anglican England, with its celebrated Protestant work ethic. China has grown rapidly, but it essentially eschews private property.
Far more likely, development policies in the last few decades have repeatedly been wrongheaded. In a recent controversial book, "The Elusive Quest for Growth" (MIT Press), William Easterly, a World Bank economist, traces the history of these failures.
To take just one of Mr. Easterly's many examples, capital investment in plant and equipment was once thought to be the main source of growth for developing economies. Both Nigeria and Hong Kong dutifully raised their investment in capital stock per worker by 250 percent from 1960 to 1985. But Nigeria's output per worker, or productivity, rose only 12 percent, while Hong Kong's soared 328 percent. Clearly, something else was also driving growth.
About that something else, however, economists have long been divided. In the early 1980's, the World Bank insisted the failures had to do with inflationary and protectionist policies. They insisted that countries to which it lent adopt reforms -- "neo-liberal" policies like restrained government spending to control inflation, free trade to foster competition and deregulation to allow free markets to allocate resources.
The average record of success was poor. Mr. Easterly says the reason is largely that the bank lent money regardless of whether the reforms were made. Nations that adopted reforms, he maintains, did fairly well.
But there is an alternative body of literature that asserts that neo-liberal policies are at best only part of the answer. A new book, "The Rise of 'the Rest' " (Oxford University Press), by Alice H. Amsden, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, asserts that the recent success of many developing countries required an extensive role for government in supporting business.
Similarly, neo-liberal policies have done damage. Lance Taylor, a professor at New School University, has edited a new volume of case studies, "External Liberalization, Economic Performance, and Social Policy" (Oxford University Press), which says that neo-liberal policies have not merely had mixed results but almost invariably led to more income inequality.
Indeed, Argentina was a textbook example of a country that adopted neo-liberal policies a decade or so ago. For a while, they seemed to work, but now the country is reeling from recession and is in danger of defaulting on its international debt.
Perhaps the best-known critic of overreliance on market policies to stimulate economic growth has been Joseph E. Stiglitz, the former chief economist of the World Bank and one of three winners of this year's Nobel in economic science. In a series of speeches at the World Bank, many of which are collected in a new volume, "The Rebel Within" (Anthem WorldEconomics), Mr. Stiglitz argues that a broad range of factors affect economic growth, including education and the quality of financial institutions, which often require financing and regulation by government.
What is important, however, is that even though all these critics now acknowledge that economic development is harder than many once thought it was, none think it is futile. Rather, two important lessons have been learned in the last two decades. Sound economic development cannot depend solely on markets or solely on government. Mr. Easterly agrees. Both effective market incentives and social programs supporting health, education, infrastructure and poverty reduction are usually required.
Second, each country is different. There is no fixed recipe of ingredients that will assure growth. In some, an investment in education is a priority, in others investment in health or transportation infrastructure, in still others a reduction in taxes or government policies to promote export industries will matter most at a given moment.
The real danger is not a lack of good ideas, but a refusal to try them. Here there are two important limitations. First, although both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have tempered their advocacy of neo-liberal policies, they are still inclined to demand a single set of reforms from most nations. This lock on policy must be broken.
And, second, finance. Those who think that money for development cannot be spent wisely, says Mr. Easterly, merely lack imagination -- tragically so, I would add.
It's time for the rich world to cough up some serious money for the poor.

The Minister's Misfortune: Not-So-Civil Servants

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
After the headaches of being Japan's foreign minister, Makiko Tanaka was looking forward to a perk: attending the annual fall garden party held at a palace here on Thursday by Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko. 
 Then Ms. Tanaka, the first woman to run the ministry, discovered that her personnel director had failed to put aside tickets to the event for her and her husband, a congressman. 
 Furious, Ms. Tanaka locked herself in an office of the offending bureaucrat, Akitaka Saiki, for 90 minutes Monday night and tried to badger one of his secretaries into typing her boss's letter of transfer. 
After the secretary wailed, "I do not have the authority to do that," a reporter listening outside the door heard the minister rail: "Idiot! Idiot! Type now what I order! Fool!"
Once again, Japanese were front-row spectators in one of their more entertaining real-life dramas: a political minister wrestling with mandarin bureaucrats. 
The fiery Ms. Tanaka managed to alienate much of the Foreign Ministry staff shortly after taking over in April. After snubbing visiting envoys of major powers, the neophyte minister then committed the truly capital crime of interfering with ambassadorial appointments. The bureaucrats then plotted slow political death by 1,000 leaks. 
Snippets of the minister's confidential conversations appeared in front-page newspaper articles. Skipped meetings and perceived slights were similarly fed to reporters by ministry insiders.
After the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington, the Japanese press criticized her for talking publicly about United States State Department security measures, a minor slip that did not seem to bother American diplomats here. 
Although Mrs. Tanaka is a happily married 57-year-old, newspapers here have run rumors, some attributed to Foreign Ministry "sources," suggesting her amorous interest in various Western foreign ministers. Mysteriously, a photo of Mrs. Tanaka and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell emerged last summer from a foreign ministers' skit in Hanoi that was closed to the press.
"This series of so-called blunders have been prepared by groups opposed to her," said one supporter, Noriko Kimoto, a television commentator. 
As the bureaucratic intrigue continues, Ms. Tanaka has complained about being reduced to a figurehead, getting information late and going into meetings poorly briefed or missing meetings entirely. 
In the Parliament, enemies within her Liberal Democratic Party forced her to let a career diplomat replace her at meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group in Shanghai. Similar maneuvers are being prepared to keep her from going to New York for a United Nations general debate session.
"I think it is a problem that the vice minister has told me I should not go to these meetings," Ms. Tanaka complained, baring to reporters a deep split with one of her top civil servants, Vice Foreign Minister Yoshiiji Nogami. Ikuo Kabashima, a political science professor at Tokyo University, said, "She is stressed and frustrated."
In the latest highly public spat, the incident on Monday, Ms. Tanaka told reporters, "The personnel division director is making mischief."
After the secretary refused to follow her orders to type a transfer document, Ms. Tanaka appealed to her ministry's top two bureaucrats at a news conference on Tuesday, adding the word "please." Once again, the public saw that bureaucratic mandarins rule supreme over their nominal superior, an elected congresswoman.
Later that day, she told reporters that she had been trying to get the personnel director switched to another job for 10 weeks.
Tonight, the Foreign Mnistry spokesman, Norio Hattori, expressed skepticism that the transfer would go through. Briefing reporters about his nominal boss, he said, "The document she prepared is not according to the standard format."
With Ms. Tanaka's powerlessness in her ministry as clear as the fall weather in Tokyo, the prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, stepped in today, saying of both sides in this highly public battle, "I feel that one is as bad as the other."
"This kind of conflict should be settled as soon as possible," continued Mr. Koizumi, who partly owes his election last spring to Ms. Tanaka's supporters. The minister and her bureaucrats "must create right away a framework in which the focus would be on diplomatic affairs."
Lost in the shuffle is the fact that little progress has been made by the Koizumi administration to improve Japan's chronically poor relations with neighboring countries that are still resentful of Japan, almost six decades after World War II. 
Japan's career diplomats may tout their smooth and harmonious ways, but Japan has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, and has yet to sign a World War II peace treaty with Russia. In September, Mr. Koizumi, leader of Asia's largest economy, was publicly snubbed in attempts to meet with leaders of China and South Korea, the second and third largest economies of Asia. The meetings took place only after Japan made repeated, and open, requests.
After watching six months of leaked memos, public outbursts and bureaucratic intrigue, Japanese public opinion of the first woman to be foreign minister still seems to split along gender lines.
"I don't like her, she is too noisy," Satoshi Yoshimura, 58, a self-employed man, said of Ms. Tanaka, whose father, Kakuei Tanaka, was prime minister in the early 1970's. "How can a woman living in that huge house with a pond filled with colorful carp share the feelings of wives with unemployed husbands? Ha ha. She was brought up like a princess. The problem is she still is a princess." 
Chieko Okuno, a 75-year-old who leads a physical education course for older homemakers, had another view. "I like her because she discloses what is happening behind the scenes at the Foreign Ministry," she said, referring toa series of financial scandals unearthed over the summer. "I like her because she speaks directly."

HEADLINE: Pushing Limits, Finding None; 
Bold Rising Star at Lockheed Is Point Man on Prize Contract

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: FORT WORTH, Oct. 28 

 BODY:
To some of his colleagues at the Lockheed Martin Corporation, Charles Thomas Burbage seems to have come right out of the pages of "The Right Stuff," Tom Wolfe's homage to the test pilots who broke the sound barrier and took the United States into space.
 Mr. Burbage, after all, used to push Navy fighter jets to the limit just to see how much stress they could take as they landed on a swaying, sleet-encrusted aircraft carrier. And the tall and trim Mr. Burbage, 54, is still striking enough to turn heads as he confidently walked though the lobby of the Worthington Hotel here for an interview. 
 What really makes him a hero these days at Lockheed Martin, though, is his leading role in snaring the richest prize ever awarded by the Pentagon. With a $19 billion down payment to oversee the development of the next generation of combat fighter jets -- in a project expected to total more than $200 billion in the next four decades -- Mr. Burbage, director of Lockheed's Joint Strike Fighter program, has become one of the most important executives to watch among military suppliers today. 
And with good reason. The Pentagon has finally cast aside its failure four decades ago to develop a single plane to serve different roles for the military branches, and it is counting on Mr. Burbage and Lockheed to produce 3,000 or more cost-effective, workhorse fighters for the Navy, Marines and Air Force based on a common design.
"He is a rising star," said Vance Coffman, Lockheed's chief executive. "We wanted Tom's leadership."
Needed it may be more to the point. Only a year ago, Mr. Burbage -- a 21-year Lockheed veteran whose father was a career Navy pilot who survived the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor -- was asked to take over the four-year-old Joint Strike Fighter project for Lockheed.
"They asked me to go over to J.S.F. and make sure we won," Mr. Burbage said matter of factly over the clatter of breakfast dishes being washed in the kitchen of the Worthington's cafe.
Last year, as the deadline approached, Lockheed executives suspected that they had trumped their competitor, the Boeing Company, on the jet's design. But the overall management of the Lockheed project was foundering, a notion since reinforced in interviews with Boeing and Lockheed executives as well as Pentagon officials since the decision was announced on Friday.
Enter Mr. Burbage. A graduate of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, he not only served as a Navy officer for 10 years but also worked at Lockheed's corporate offices in Washington. There he made a considerable number of contacts among important lawmakers on Capitol Hill and at the Pentagon. And Mr. Burbage already got along well with procurement officials at the Air Force, including Darleen A. Druyun, its tough-minded chief of acquisition. He worked closely with her on Lockheed's F-22 fighter jet program in the mid-1990's.
Since starting the job, Mr. Burbage has spent barely two weeks in the tiny apartment he keeps in Fort Worth, where the joint strike fighter will be built.
"I'm either always in Washington or on international travel," Mr. Burbage said. "I'm just not here that much."
What distinguishes Mr. Burbage, though, from the typical fighter jock or military executive is a kind of "new economy" sensibility he brings to an industry defined by a molasses-like pace of change and an unyielding hierarchy that mirrors the military itself.
Mr. Burbage has taken to calling a trio of particularly bright executives on the Joint Strike Fighter team the wizards -- despite their eye rolling and shoulder shrugging.
"They haven't accepted me calling them the wizards yet," Mr. Burbage said with a laugh. "We told them we were going to put all their offices together and call it Oz. That's kind of foreign. It's foreign to this business. You don't know if you should talk about it, but that is the image you want to project."
On the evening of Oct. 16, 10 days before the Pentagon planned to announce the fighter contract winner, Mr. Burbage gathered from around the world more than 80 project leaders for Lockheed and its key partners, Northrop and BAE Systems. Before a two-day management retreat, he wanted his team to relax at a Mexican restaurant near Fort Worth's stockyards. But he also invited representatives from the Air Force, a break with tradition that sent shivers down the spines of some executives, he said, "who did not want to bare their souls in front of the customer."
After dinner, Mr. Burbage pulled out an oversize mock cover of Fast Company, a new-era management magazine favored mostly by young high-technology executives. Dated January 2005 and adorned with photographs of the three versions of the plane, the cover's main headline read, "The Joint Strike Fighter Program Takes Off." There were other headlines, too, including "How Did They Do It?" and "Stock Market: Defense Is In."
Mr. Burbage said he was trying to get the team leaders to consider the project's legacy and their role in it. What would such an article say, Mr. Burbage asked them. How would it be written? What did they want to be remembered for?
"His openness is refreshing in the defense industry," said Byron Callan, a Merrill Lynch aerospace analyst.
Born in San Diego in 1947, Mr. Burbage was the second of six children. He grew up there and in Virginia as his father moved to different stations. "All I wanted to do was to play football or fly airplanes," he said. "That's all I wanted to do."
At the Naval Academy, he did both. He met his wife, Ellen, then, too, and after graduating in 1969, he married her the next year. In 1971 he received a master's degree in aeronautical systems from the University of West Florida.
Mr. Burbage, who was nicknamed Boomer at the academy, specialized in testing the limits of Navy fighters. One test required stopping a jet in midflight, its underside caught on a thin wire, then slamming into the tarmac to see how much damage the plane could withstand. Tracing an "X" on his chest, Mr. Burbage showed exactly where the safety straps he wore had left bruises.
"It's fairly violent," he said. "If you're the co-pilot and you are not actually controlling the plane, it's a high-anxiety event."
He officially left the Navy in 1980, staying in the reserves for another 14 years. His three daughters "were getting to the point they didn't know who I was because I was gone so much," he said. Continuing the family tradition, one of his daughters attended the Naval Academy, too.
A friend suggested that he apply for a pilot's position at Lockheed's test center in Palmdale, Calif. But no flight jobs were available so Mr. Burbage instead joined the marketing and business development team in Burbank, a suburb of Los Angeles. Despite the demands of his job, he found time to earn an M.B.A. from the University of California at Los Angeles.
Almost from the start, Mr. Burbage had an aptitude for navigating political minefields, both at the Pentagon and closer to home. In 1988, Mr. Burbage said, he got his break when he was asked to move to Washington to reorganize Lockheed's offices there. The staff was rife with infighting and petty jealousies. No one welcomed the new boss, he said. So Mr. Burbage invited the feuding executives to a secluded country retreat in West Virginia for a weekend of arguments and bonding. Within a few weeks, morale improved.
He moved to Lockheed's Atlanta office in 1990, taking over the troubled F-22 fighter jet program in 1995. At that time, it was dangerously close to being canceled by the Air Force because of huge cost overruns. That is where Mr. Burbage honed his reputation as a persuasive negotiator.
"I don't want to say he's a fix-it guy," said Mr. Callan, of Merrill Lynch. "But Tom's kind of been through the disaster areas of Lockheed. It's nice to know how not to do things in order to understand how they should be done."
John J. Young Jr., assistant secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisitions, remembers sparring with Mr. Burbage in the 1990's over the F-22's price tag when Mr. Young was an aide on the Senate Appropriations Committee. "He was able to articulate why the costs were what they were and how they planned to achieve savings," Mr. Young said. "Tom helped me gain a greater confidence they were getting it under control."
Lockheed was the clear favorite in the winner-take-all contest to build the joint strike fighter, but its program was plagued by the same problems the F-22 had faced: cost overruns and grumbling at the Pentagon that Lockheed was not listening to its concerns. So last November Frank J. Cappuccio, who was then heading the team for Lockheed, stepped aside. He continued to work on the company's overall proposal but made way for Mr. Burbage to manage the project.
"Frank brought a level of order and structure that maybe wasn't perfect, process-wise," Mr. Young said. "Tom added to that because he had a next-step vision, a next-step maturity that made the program have a more confident feel."
Mr. Burbage will not say how long he expects to lead the joint strike fighter team. But he is a logical candidate for a future appointment to a high-level position at the Pentagon or elsewhere in government, predicted Ted Samples, a longtime friend who works with Mr. Burbage at Lockheed. "He would like that," Mr. Samples said.

HEADLINE: OPEC President Says Cartel to Cut Output Starting on Jan. 1 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Underscoring the growing resolve among the largest oil-producing nations to shore up declining prices, Chekib Khelil, the president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said today that the group would reduce daily oil output starting on Jan. 1.
 Mr. Khelil, at the United States-Africa Business Summit here, confirmed comments by other OPEC oil ministers over the weekend and Monday that OPEC would move to decrease exports at its next meeting, on Nov. 14 in Vienna. Those ministers, however, declined to say when such a reduction would go into effect. 
 Mr. Khelil, who is also Algeria's oil minister, could not specify how great the reduction would be, but he left no doubt one was imminent. Most industry analysts expect OPEC, which produces about 35 percent of the world's oil, to pare back exports by 700,000 to a million barrels a day. The group has already pulled back production three times this year by a total of 3.5 million barrels a day, or about 13 percent.
"It will be the same haggle," Mr. Khelil said, when asked whether the decrease would be a million barrels. "We will want to decrease a little, others will want to decrease a lot. If there is a cut, it will go into effect 40 days or so after; so, Jan. 1."
Oil industry analysts said Mr. Khelil's estimate was credible, given that as president of OPEC he is in constant contact with all 10 voting members. Waiting until Jan. 1 would permit OPEC to monitor what Iraq will do in December, when the United Nations oil-for-food program undergoes periodic review. Typically, Iraq has halted its exports of 2.1 million barrels a day during such talks to press the United Nations, and if that were to happen again, OPEC would need to gauge how to respond.
After the Sept. 11 attacks sent the global economy into a tailspin, oil demand dwindled rapidly and prices plummeted. OPEC has so far refrained from cutting production despite the millions of dollars members have lost because of lower prices. But prices have stabilized at about $21 a barrel, and Mr. Khelil said OPEC was determined to nudge them up to $25 a barrel by reducing output and restraining the rampant overproduction among its members. OPEC countries have been pumping far more than their official quotas to take advantage of current prices, but recent data show that such cheating has been trimmed.
Some economists worry that oil at $25 a barrel may prolong the global downturn. But Mr. Khelil reiterated the conviction within OPEC that much lower prices for oil would not accelerate an economic recovery.
"I don't think $25, $20, $30 oil is damaging to the world economy," he said. "I don't think a reduction of oil prices by 10 percent will have the same effect as reducing taxes by 10 percent. I think President Bush is doing the right thing by putting money back into consumers' pockets."
It remains to be seen whether OPEC will succeed in bolstering prices. Besides the overproduction within its own ranks, major non-OPEC producers like Mexico, Russia and Angola have said they will not reduce exports to bolster prices, despite OPEC's entreaties. Mr. Khelil said he hoped they would come around once they realize that greater supplies of oil would drive prices down for everyone and ultimately diminish revenue. But when pressed, he conceded that OPEC had little control over the decisions of others.
"We can't go on trying to convince people to help out if they don't want to," Mr. Khelil said. "We have to make our own decision at some point."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Wall Street is stunned and angered by the Treasury's action on long-term bonds.

BYLINE:  By Gretchen Morgenson 

 BODY:
WITH fears mounting that nine interest rate cuts in almost as many months may not be enough to rev up the United States economy, the Treasury Department added some high-test yesterday to the Federal Reserve's fuel mix. Unfortunately, Wall Street got run over in the process. 
 Treasury officials said that their decision to halt the issuance of 30-year bonds was intended to save the government money. But traders scoffed at that explanation, viewing the move as an almost desperate effort to push down long-term interest rates, which had remained stubbornly high, and prod both corporate and individual borrowers to spend again. 
 "Without a doubt the thing that the Fed really wants to do is get mortgage rates and corporate rates down," said Peter McTeague, government bond market strategist at Greenwich Capital Markets, a brokerage firm in Greenwich, Conn. "But mortgage rates weren't falling as much as people hoped because they are more driven by the long end of the yield curve. So they're trying every little trick in the basket. If the Fed funds rate isn't going to do it, let's see if we can do something else."
The predicament for the Fed has been that even as it slashed interest rates from 6.5 percent at the beginning of the year to 2.5 percent last month, longer-term borrowing costs for corporations and individuals had not fallen as hard. For example, yields on the 10-year note, the benchmark for many mortgage rates and corporate bond issues, began the year at 5.1 percent and fell only to 4.5 percent by the time the Fed lowered rates for the ninth time on Oct. 2. By last week, 10-year yields had actually risen to 4.64 percent.
Yields on the 30-year bond rose even as the Fed cut short-term rates. Starting the year at 5.45 percent, yields on the long bond hit 5.9 percent in May. 
In an interview yesterday, Peter Fisher, the Treasury's undersecretary for domestic finance, said that "today's decision is in no way an attempt to manage long-term interest rates. That is not what motivated us."
But there is no doubt that the sticky nature of longer-term rates has exasperated policy makers. This is especially the case with mortgage rates, since consumer spending has been the only prop supporting the economy in recent months. Keeping consumers feeling flush has, therefore, become a top priority. One way to do this is by lowering mortgage rates, encouraging people to refinance their home loans and put more money in their pockets. 
The case may have become even more compelling after the report on Tuesday of a plunge in consumer confidence and other recent reports that home buying has started to slip. While mortgage refinancing activity has soared since Sept. 11, the Mortgage Bankers Association's index of home buying activity has instead stumbled. Existing home sales dropped 5.2 percent in September from a year earlier and 11.7 percent from August. But the plunge yesterday in yields on government securities will bring mortgage rates down significantly and soon.
The Treasury's announcement stunned Wall Street firms. To be sure, the government had been reducing the amount of long-term bonds in the market by buying back issues periodically and not issuing new ones. But traders had come to believe that because the federal budget surpluses have all but vanished, the government would have to resume heavy borrowings to finance deficit spending. And the Treasury gave Wall Street none of the usual warning signs that come in the form of trial balloons floated before a policy shift as big as this one. 
When Treasury prices surged on the news of the bond's demise, most major brokerage firms were caught with significant losses. Investors rushed to buy soon-to-be extinct issues. Prices of long-term bonds soared, and their yields plunged, falling from 5.21 percent on Tuesday to 4.88 percent yesterday. It was the biggest single-day move since investors fled to the safety of government securities during the stock market crash of 1987. 
Traders who had sold long-term Treasuries short to hedge their holdings in corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities got crushed. "This was a complete blind siding," one trader said. "They would have accomplished the same thing just by signaling it. But they decide not to signal it, and everybody on the Street got slammed."

HEADLINE: Restoring Confidence in Air Travel 

 BODY:
With many Americans still too worried about the level of airport security to resume flying, and Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta acknowledging "intolerable" lapses nationwide, the House of Representatives has an opportunity today to help restore the public's confidence in the nation's aviation system. It ought to pass legislation identical to the aviation security measure passed unanimously by the Senate on Oct. 11. 
 The House Republican leadership is pushing for a weaker alternative that allows private companies to continue staffing airport security checkpoints. The Senate version would make airport screeners federal employees, akin to Border Patrol and Customs agents. Only the Senate approach will reassure Americans that Congress is willing to set aside partisan politics to protect them. 
 Making the screeners federal employees got bipartisan support in the Senate, where the bill passed 100 to 0 three weeks ago. That was not surprising. Contrary to assertions by House Republican leaders, charging the government with the vital law enforcement task of keeping terrorists off airplanes is hardly a controversial, left-wing notion. 
Lobbyists on both sides of the issue have been engaged in a bizarre debate over the extent to which private companies are involved in airport security everywhere from the Netherlands to Israel, with some conservatives revealing a newfound admiration of foreign ways. But Senator John McCain got it right when he said that Americans properly viewed keeping air travel safe as a law enforcement function that the government must assume. 
Except for the issue of airport screeners, the two competing bills scheduled for consideration today are similar. They expand the sky marshal program, require the fortification of cockpits and impose other security measures, to be paid for by a new surcharge on ticket prices. 
Today's House vote is expected to be a close one, due to the leadership's arm-twisting and White House lobbying for the weaker bill. It is understandable that members of Congress do not want to cross their president during wartime, particularly on a matter related to national security, but moderate Republican congressmen should not be deterred from backing the stronger measure. Voters will applaud them for insisting that the White House do more, not less, to protect the aviation system. And to his credit, President Bush has not said he will veto the Senate version if it prevails.
Secretary Mineta was properly forceful on Tuesday when he vowed that federal inspectors would crack down on continued security lapses at airports, even if it means closing down terminals and grounding flights for a time. Unfortunately, on the same day the administration was lobbying for a continued reliance on the same security companies that have proved so inadequate. 
Seven weeks after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, it is time for Congress to act decisively to restore confidence in the aviation system, an economic lifeline of crucial importance to the nation. Creating a federal force to protect it is not the whole solution to the security challenge, but it is certainly a part of any meaningful one.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will End Regular Sale Of Long Bond 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The United States retired the old faithful of the bond market yesterday, ending the regular sale of 30-year bonds after a quarter of a century.
 The Treasury Department said that despite the prospect of federal budget deficits this year and next, it expects surpluses to return soon. With that in mind, borrowing for 30 years is too costly and imprudent, it said, because shorter-term debt can be issued to cover its needs at lower rates. 
 The announcement, which inadvertently appeared on the Treasury Web site 10 minutes before the planned release at 10 a.m., caught bond traders and analysts flat-footed. With the economy slowing and the government spending more in the war on terrorism, they had anticipated the return of deficits and generally concluded that the 30-year bond would survive a while longer even though it had been slated for extinction when budget surpluses were growing. 
Many traders and dealers were angry about the lack of warning from the Treasury. Others suggested that the Treasury might be trying to push down long-term interest rates, which plunged yesterday, in an effort to encourage mortgage refinancing and aid an economic recovery.
Though fewer bonds had been issued the last few years, the elimination of 30-year bonds will require changes by bond professionals, institutions and individual investors. Investment alternatives include government agency and corporate bonds. Corporate bonds served investors quite well before regular sales of the 30-year bond began in February 1977.
In explaining the Treasury's decision, Peter Fisher, the undersecretary for domestic finance, said, "We do not need the 30-year bond to meet the government's current financing needs, nor those that we expect to face in coming years."
"The 30-year bond," he said, "no longer maintains a position of significance in the financial markets." 
Mr. Fisher added that "today's decision is in no way an attempt to manage long-term interest rates."
Reflecting the fact that 30-year bonds will now be scarce, the price jumped 58/32 points, about seven times more than a normal daily move. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, plunged from 5.20 percent Tuesday to 4.87 percent, the lowest since the bonds were regularly issued.
The demise of 30-year bonds, including those indexed for inflation, will increase demand for the 10-year note. Its price rose sharply yesterday, while the yield fell to 4.23 percent, near its record low in 1998.
The sharp moves in the bond market were exacerbated by investors and dealers who scrambled to reverse trades that suddenly became losers after the announcement.
"I think injecting this change into the market, particularly in a time of crisis, is not smart," said Charles Parkhurst, managing director of government bond trading at Salomon Smith Barney. "If the Treasury said that the February bond would have been the last and the market would get to to bid on it, the decision would have been more acceptable."
The outside committee of bond market professionals that advises the Treasury on policy had recommended the retirement of the 30-year bond. Those advisers met with Treasury officials on Tuesday about other decisions that the Treasury announced this morning at its regularly scheduled quarterly announcement. But the committee was not consulted on the 30-year decision.
When asked why the Treasury did not instead decide to cancel the 30-year bond after the next scheduled sale in February, the chairman of the committee, James R. Capra, said "that's a good question."
Micah Green, the president of the Bond Market Association, supported the Treasury's decision, although the association opposed the elimination of the 30-year bond in a statement in January.
"The Treasury Department's decision today to suspend issuance of the 30-year bond is reasonable and understandable based on its conclusion that the cost of continuing issuance of these bonds in the current market is not justifiable," he said.
Since 1977, $564.4 billion of regular 30-year bonds have been sold to the public. About $40 billion of inflation-protected 30-year bonds have been sold since 1998. The 30-year yield quickly became the benchmark interest rate for the U.S. bond market and for other countries' markets.
But as government budget deficits shrank and then gave way to surprisingly large surpluses, the Treasury scaled back the amount of securities it sold and wondered if the cost of 30-year bonds was just to high.
Though the 30-year bond is cherished by many bond dealers at the core of the Treasury market, the advisory committee recommended its retirement in January and repeated the recommendation in July. The issuance had already been cut to $15 billion a year, from almost $47 billion in 1991.
With the diminishing role of the 30-year bond, the 10-year note has become the benchmark for the Treasury market. Longer-term debt of government agencies, like Fannie Mae, is vying for the role previously served by the 30-year bond. Dealers were already adjusting how they traded and how they hedged against risk, some using bond futures instead of Treasury bonds. Investors will probably substitute agency debt or corporate debt for 30-year Treasuries, though there is additional risk in such securities. Long-term corporate debt, like that of AT&T, filled that role in the past.
The issue of savings for the taxpayer, one reason for the elimination of the 30-year bond, is simple. The yield on the 30-year bond, before yesterday's announcement, was 5.20 percent. The comparable yields were 4.41 percent on the 10-year note, 3.58 on the five-year note and 2.44 percent on the two-year note.
Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson Associates, has advocated the demise of the 30-year bond for some time. His analysis of borrowing in the early 1990's showed that the government made significant savings in interest costs by choosing to sell more short-term debt, even with 30-year bond yields near historic lows.
The Treasury's decision seems to be an implicit bet that the budget will move back into surplus soon. Mr. Fisher said that if deficits persist, it would be easy for the government to return to selling 30-year bonds. In the interim, he added, "it is still likely that our decision to suspend 30-year borrowing at this time will have saved the taxpayers money."
Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, has criticized the Bush administration's surplus projections as being too optimistic but still supports the decision to shift to shorter-term debt. "I can understand the logic of doing this even if I disagree with the administration's 10-year budget projections," he said.
The Treasury also announced yesterday that it would curtail, but not discontinue, its program of buying back higher-interest rate debt with 20 or more years to maturity. Since March 2000, the Treasury has bought back $57.5 billion in old debt. It will proceed with the scheduled buybacks of $6.5 billion of debt in November and December but do none in January. Beginning with February, it will announce each quarter whether it will do buybacks, depending on its cash flow and borrowing needs. Mr. Fisher said this meant there would be buybacks in some quarters and not in others.
The Treasury also said it would sell next week $16 billion of new five-year notes and $7 billion of the existing 10-year note, which matures in August 2011.

HEADLINE: Bridgeport Mayor Indicted on Corruption Charges 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Joseph P. Ganim, the mayor of Bridgeport and until recently a leading Democratic candidate for governor of Connecticut, was indicted today on a raft of federal bribery, extortion, mail fraud and racketeering charges. 
 Specifically, the government's 24-count indictment charges Mr. Ganim, for 10 years the popular mayor of Connecticut's largest city, with receiving more than $425,000 in cash, meals, tailored suits, jewelry, home landscaping services and bottles of what the United States attorney, John A. Danaher III, called "investment quality wine" -- all from friends and former members of his administration over the last six years. 
 In return, the government said, he pressed businesses that received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of city contracts to pay small fortunes in "consulting fees" to those friends and associates, including his former chief of staff and his former campaign manager. 
Minutes after Mr. Danaher announced the charges at the federal court building here, Mr. Ganim, 42, appeared behind a lectern outside his office at Bridgeport City Hall and, eyes afire and finger pointing, denied all of them. He characterized the indictment as a conspiracy concocted by those he knew to blame him for the corrupt practices of his current and former associates. 
"I have done nothing wrong, I have not taken one dime as part of any conspiracy," Mr. Ganim said, glaring into a sea of reporters, cameras and, behind them, 100 or so city workers who repeatedly cheered him like a winning candidate.
"Like you," Mr. Ganim went on, "I have sadly learned that people who were close to me used that relationship for their own gain, and in doing so, betrayed me and betrayed the City of Bridgeport."
Although Gov. John G. Rowland, a Republican, issued a statement today calling for the mayor's resignation, Mr. Ganim rejected any notion of stepping down.
Since June, nine people and one Connecticut trucking company have pleaded guilty to federal charges that they either paid or received bribes connected to the scheme that prosecutors now say Mr. Ganim orchestrated. 
In 1999, according to today's indictment, Mr. Ganim and Paul J. Pinto, his close friend and former political fund-raiser, were each paid about $156,000 after the mayor awarded a contract to a company to manage the city's wastewater treatment plants. The payments were from Mr. Ganim's former campaign manager, Leonard J. Grimaldi, who paid the two men from the consulting fee he received, the indictment says. 
Mr. Pinto and Mr. Grimaldi rewarded Mr. Ganim with wine, clothing, a $1,600 pair of diamond earrings and $4,450 worth of kitchen appliances, among other items, for awarding the contracts, according to the indictment.
Prosecutors said Mr. Ganim also used city funds to buy himself a $1 million life insurance policy, and approved a plan to extend the city's sewer lines to his newly built house in the city's affluent Black Rock section.
Among those who pleaded guilty this year to cashing in on the scheme are Patrick O. Coyne, the mayor's former chief of staff; Frank W. Sullivan, who was a vice president at Salomon Smith Barney; and Mark Trinkley, a project manager in Connecticut's Department of Economic and Community Development. 
Mr. Ganim has tried his best to keep the downfall of his associates from destroying his own public image as a mayor who had helped revive Bridgeport, a gritty city with a long history of municipal corruption. As the guilty pleas began to accumulate this summer, tightening the investigative noose around him, the mayor took the unusual step of naming himself as the man Mr. Danaher was ultimately after, though prosecutors had long refrained from identifying the "top elected official" referred to in court documents. And on Tuesday, Mr. Ganim even told reporters that he expected to be charged at any time.
Mr. Ganim's defiance has also prevented him from giving up the idea of running for governor in 2002. 
"He's not withdrawn his name," said Connecticut's Democratic Party chairman, John W. Olsen. "He's kind of suspended his fund-raising, but he has not indicated to me that he is not a candidate."
Mr. Olsen said the indictment of Mr. Ganim, a rising political star who sat next to Vice President Al Gore at the state Democratic Party's annual fund-raiser last year, would not hurt his party's efforts to wrest control of the Capitol from Mr. Rowland, a popular two-term governor. "Democrats don't have to walk around with our heads down," Mr. Olsen said. "I mean, look, Phil Giordano is still the mayor of Waterbury."
Mr. Giordano, a Republican who ran against Joseph I. Lieberman for United States Senate last year, was charged in September with raping two girls, ages 9 and 10, but, proclaiming his innocence, refused to give up his job as mayor. He negotiated a deal with the City Council to serve the remainder of his term, which expires in December, from the prison where he is being held.
But few of Mr. Ganim's supporters expect him to go to jail. Though he has not received a single campaign contribution in the last three months, Mr. Ganim remains popular in some quarters. 
"The man has given me no indication that he was corrupt or anything else," said Bridgeport's Democratic committee chairman, Mario Testa, at his family-owned Italian restaurant today. "He still has my total support, personally and politically."
Before his appearance today, Mr. Ganim had staff members deliver thick packages to reporters that included the results of a recent independent poll, paid by the city, reporting that more than half of 306 registered city voters who were questioned still thought highly of the mayor, and only 16 percent thought he was guilty of "criminal wrongdoing." 
Mr. Ganim is scheduled to be arraigned in Federal District Court in New Haven Friday at 2 p.m. before Judge Janet Bond Arterton. 
At today's rally, waving a copy of the government's indictment, Mr. Ganim's lawyer, Richard Meehan Jr., dismissed it as "nothing more than circumstantial evidence." 
"You can be assured," Mr. Meehan added, "that Mr. Ganim will plead not guilty."

HEADLINE: Amid Trade Agenda Talks, Sharpened Focus on Rich-Poor Disputes 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
With only a week to go before trade ministers are scheduled to gather in Doha, Qatar, to try to set the agenda for a worldwide trade accord, actions the United States has taken since the terrorist attacks appear to have widened the gap between rich and poor nations and persuaded some negotiators that the meeting could become a casualty of war.
 The Bush administration's tussle with Bayer A.G. -- in which Washington forced the company to sharply reduce the price of its anthrax drug Cipro -- has emboldened developing countries to insist on a broad "public health" exception to international patent rules for other drugs, like those used to keep AIDS victims alive. 
 India, Nigeria and many others are also arguing that if the United States can cede special trading rights to Pakistan's textile and apparel makers to help a frontline ally, it should ease barriers for clothing makers in all poor countries.
Disputes over patent rules and textile quotas have been around for years. But the exigencies of fighting terrorism have cast the matter into stark relief and set off a heated debate in Geneva, where negotiators for 142 nations in the World Trade Organization had hoped to be narrowing their differences ahead of the meeting. 
The 11th-hour standoff has raised the possibility that trade ministers will converge on Qatar only to have the talks collapse, as they did in Seattle two years ago. Such a failure would be especially bitter because many officials say they fear for their safety by convening in the Persian Gulf region even as war rages in Afghanistan.
Still, Bush administration officials expressed confidence that the trade talks would conclude successfully, meaning that ministers would agree to a new, several-year round of negotiations to eliminate barriers and unify rules of global trade.
But the risks are arguably greater than they were in Seattle. The leading industrial nations are experiencing a rare simultaneous economic slump. World trade flows are shrinking for the first time in two decades. A trade agreement has been viewed as vital to opening new markets and spurring business investment.
Moreover, some analysts say the future of the World Trade Organization, formed six years ago to promote trade and resolve disputes with more authority than previously allowed, would be in doubt if its second attempt to advance global trade talks is again stillborn.
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said this week that liberalizing trade was an urgent priority to avoid giving nations an excuse to revert to protectionism. "The meeting in Doha needs to get the W.T.O. back on track," he said.
Like any trade negotiation, the coming talks depend on resolving a number of disputes under a single umbrella. Removing barriers to trade in farm products is a top American priority while limiting the use of antidumping rules to block low-price imports has become a major concern of Japan and many developing nations. Both matters are proving especially hard to resolve.
At the same time, tensions are rising between rich and poor. Brazil and India are leading a coalition that wants trade rules rewritten to make it clear that nations can violate patents and save money on, for example, AIDS or malaria drugs when they face an acute health crisis.
They argue that poor countries often cannot afford vital medicine. Industrial nations, they say, often seek to punish them if they buy or produce knockoff versions of the drugs.
Paulo Teixeira, director of Brazil's anti-AIDS program, told reporters this week that the United States' efforts to reduce the price of Cipro, under threat of breaking Bayer's patent, mimics similar strong-arm tactics that Brazil has used. Washington threatened at one point to file a W.T.O. case against Brazil on behalf of American drug makers.
"They are doing exactly what we did," Mr. Teixeira said of the Bush administration's position on Cipro. "It is inconsistent to then oppose making that an option on a global level."
But that argument has run into stiff opposition from delegates representing Switzerland, Canada and Japan, as well as the United States, who are fighting hard to preserve protection of intellectual property. The two sides are still far apart.
The Bush administration has proposed a compromise that it says ensures that poor countries could gain access to drugs during emergencies. Mr. Zoellick said he supports giving developing countries more time to come into compliance with intellectual property rules. 
But the administration has dug in its heels on amending patent protection. Officials argue that Brazil and India, which both make generic versions of leading drugs, have used the American response to terrorism as an excuse to increase sales.
"They want a huge 'get out of jail free' card any time you use the words 'public health,' " an American trade official said.
Disputes on textiles have also become more pointed since Sept. 11. Developing countries have been arguing for years that industrial nations, especially the United States, have been unwilling to open their doors to clothing and textile products, which along with farm products are the leading exports of many poor countries.
When the Bush administration last week broached the possibility of reducing tariffs or increasing the quota allocations on Pakistani textiles, the concession to a war ally resonated loudly in Geneva. There, American negotiators have been fighting to preserve the right to shelter the politically powerful domestic textile industry. 
Developing countries have been arguing that they will not compromise on other issues until they see more evidence that barriers to the textile trade are being eliminated.
The negotiations, the Nigerian trade delegation said in a statement today, "are empty of contents on the issues of interest to developing countries."

HEADLINE: Casino Bill Was Passed After Big Push By Lobbyists 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA and JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Gambling interests mounted one of the broadest, most expensive lobbying campaigns in the state's history this year, pressing for the aggressive expansion of gambling that Gov. George E. Pataki made law today.
 That campaign included dozens of different interests hoping to grab a piece of what they expect will be billions of dollars wagered each year -- Indian tribes seeking to build casinos, developers and casino managers who want to become the tribes' partners, makers of gambling machinery and various elements of the horse-racing industry. 
 Together, they have spent well over $2 million so far this year to lobby the Legislature and the governor, far above the $1.5 million spent in all of last year, according to records filed with the state's Temporary Commission on Lobbying, and some of the interests were heavy campaign contributors. Six of the top seven lobbying firms in Albany represented major gambling interests. 
"This was probably the biggest lobbying effort I've ever seen, and I've been around a long time," said James Featherstonhaugh, one of Albany's most influential lobbyists. From January to August, the period covered by the most recent lobbying reports, Mr. Featherstonhaugh's firm received more than $300,000 from clients supporting the gambling bill, including Park Place Entertainment, the Mohawk Indians' partner in a Catskills casino project; Gtech Corporation, the world's largest supplier of computerized gambling systems for lotteries and casinos; the Western Regional Off-Track Betting Corporation; and the Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association, the major horse owners' group.
The most striking evidence of this year's climate is the large number of groups that did little or no lobbying last year, then became major Capitol players this year, including several racetracks and off-track betting corporations.
The Seneca Nation of Indians, who stand to gain three casinos in western New York, had no lobbyist as recently as January. But through August of this year, the tribe had spent $400,000 on lobbying, seeking passage of the gambling bill here and regulatory approval in Washington for its casinos. 
The tribe signed Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, the top Washington firm that includes former Representative Bill Paxon of western New York, to represent it for more than $500,000 a year, the biggest lobbying contract ever registered with the state lobbying commission. The Senecas also hired as lobbyists Patricia Lynch, a former top aide to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, and Clarence Rappleyea, former Republican leader in the Assembly and former chairman of the New York Power Authority.
The list of lobbyists illustrates the revolving-door nature of power here, where former officials often become lobbyists, trading on their closeness to decision-makers. Mr. Rappleyea and Ms. Lynch left state service just last year, as did David Dudley, former chief counsel to the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and now a lobbyist for Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts and a company that owns racetracks. Among the other lobbyists this year for gambling interests were Arthur J. Kremer, once a powerful assemblyman; Paul D'Onofrio, a former lawyer for the Assembly on gambling issues; and Frank Sanzillo, a former top Senate aide.
Since taking office in 1995, Mr. Pataki has repeatedly promoted legalized gambling but has usually been thwarted by the Legislature. Since the spring, when waning state revenue persuaded many lawmakers to take a second look at gambling and the governor announced the outlines of a deal with the Senecas, it seemed that this year the dam would break. The destruction of the World Trade Center helped the package sail through, 52 to 8 in the Senate, and 92 to 41 in the Assembly.
The stunning breadth of the bill would make New York the Eastern state with the most legal gambling if it all survives the expected legal challenges. The law allows for three Seneca casinos, three more Indian-run casinos in the Catskills, video lottery terminals at racetracks, and New York's enlistment in the Powerball multistate lottery.
Mr. Pataki, joined by Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno, held bill-signing ceremonies today in Niagara Falls, Syracuse and Monticello. "We fought for this new measure because it will provide a major boost to the western New York economy, bringing new jobs, thousands of tourists and new private-sector investment to the area," he said in Niagara Falls.
The governor supported new forms of gambling long before the lobbying campaign geared up. Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver gave their support more recently and more reluctantly, but they insisted that it was the state's need for revenue, not lobbyists and campaign contributions, that persuaded them. 
While pro-gambling forces were on the march this year, the bill's most potent foe, Donald J. Trump, largely retreated from the field. He spent $150,000 on lobbying in Albany the first eight months of this year, a far cry from the $540,000 he spent last year. He spent less than $14,000 on campaign contributions in the first six months of this year -- big numbers for most donors, but small for Mr. Trump, who has sometimes contributed more than $100,000 a year.
Mr. Trump does not want competition in New York for his three Atlantic City casinos, and he has used his influence and his deep pockets to help defeat past gambling efforts here. In an interview last week, Mr. Trump declined to explain the decline in his lobbying and campaign contributions. Some of his associates say that because his company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, is experiencing financial trouble, he was distracted.
Several companies that stand to gain from gambling spent generously on political campaigns as well as lobbying, often giving more than they did last year, though 2001 is not a state election year.
From November through July, Park Place Entertainment, the Mohawk casino partner, gave $15,000 to the Assembly Democrats, $15,000 to the state Republican Party and $10,000 to the Assembly Republicans. The company also paid several lobbyists a total of $250,000 over the first eight months of this year.
Gtech, whose systems run the state's electronic lottery games, gave $35,000 in the first six months of this year, including $25,000 to the state Republican Party, and spent $160,000 on lobbying in the first eight months of the year. Robert K. Vincent, vice president of Gtech Holdings Inc., the parent company, said that as the year began, its primary interest was in the renewal of Quick Draw, the electronic lottery game. 
The Delaware North Companies of Buffalo, owner of several racetracks and a betting equipment firm, is seeking to develop a casino with the Senecas, and along with its subsidiaries spent $75,000 on lobbying through August. The companies and their owners, the Jacobs family, gave $19,000 to state campaigns the first half of this year, including $8,000 to Mr. Pataki.
David M. Flaum, a Rochester developer who said he was close to a deal with an Indian tribe to develop a casino in Sullivan County, gave Mr. Pataki $12,000 this spring.
"This bill wasn't just one issue, it was a dozen different issues, all wrapped together," said Michael Vacek, a lobbyist for Yonkers Raceway. "It was one of those rare occurrences when the sun, the moon and the stars were lined up, and everybody got involved, from the Indian tribes to the harness tracks to the casino developers."

Bloomberg Sees Business As Key to City's Revival
Michael R. Bloomberg, the Republican mayoral candidate, said in an interview that the city's looming financial crisis, while serious, was not unmanageable and that private businesses, not aid from the federal government, would ultimately determine how well the city came through it. D1


Mr. Bloomberg accused the Democratic candidate, Mark Green, of not disclosing campaign finance information and he suggested that Mr. Green was behind publication of a 1998 deposition in which Mr. Bloomberg said he would need "an unimpeachable third-party witness" to believe an allegation of rape at his company. Mr. Green described Mr. Bloomberg's comments as "disappointing, ill-informed and insensitive." D1

HEADLINE: In America; 
Hungry and Jobless

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
"Our members," said John Turchiano, "have never been in this position before."
 Mr. Turchiano is a spokesman for the Hotel and Restaurant Workers union in New York City. On Monday four tractor-trailer trucks from the group Feed the Children pulled up outside the union's health center in Elmhurst, Queens. Nearly 500 union members and their families lined up for canned goods, baby food, toothpaste and other items that might be helpful for families suddenly thrown into an economic crisis. Worried expressions were the norm. Some of the union members wept. 
 Even as they boldly confront each daunting new day with whatever reserves of toughness and cockiness remain, New Yorkers are struggling with two particularly debilitating kinds of fear. The first is the continuing terror associated with the attack on the World Trade Center and the anthrax attacks that have followed. (I watched a woman break down on the subway yesterday when an announcement was made that, because of a police action, the Sixth Avenue line was temporarily shut down. And there were reports of New Yorkers bursting into tears when they learned that Kathy Nguyen, a 61-year-old employee of the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, had died from inhalation anthrax.)
The second type of fear is linked to the growing economic insecurity that is spreading in hideous waves across the entire city. New Yorkers by the hundreds of thousands are either out of work or are saddled with the realistic expectation that they will soon be out of work. Mr. Turchiano said nearly 4,500 members of his union had been laid off, and 1,000 others are working reduced hours. He said nearly all the layoffs were directly or indirectly related to the trade center attack. 
We are only beginning to glimpse the economic toll. An enormous number of low-wage workers, many without health or unemployment benefits, have been caught in the downdraft. In the worst cases, families that until recently were enthusiastic, if not highly paid, participants in a remarkably high-flying economy are finding themselves confronted by the horrifying parlay of hunger and imminent eviction from their homes.
I think an awful lot of people are underestimating the extent of the disaster in New York City. All income groups are affected, but in the days and weeks and years to come the impact on the working classes and the poor is likely to be horrific.
There are no guidebooks available on the best way to bring a city back from the combination of emotional and economic devastation. We'll be winging it, just as we're winging it (with disappointing results) in the fight against terrorism at home and abroad. 
Estimates of the budget deficit the city will face next year are staggering -- $4 billion to $6 billion. And the state will be faced with its own multibillion-dollar deficit. If you assume that the city will not be skimping on public safety expenditures (an absolutely safe assumption in this atmosphere), and that it will be doing all it can to rebuild Lower Manhattan as swiftly as possible (another safe assumption), and that it will meet its minimal obligations to the school system and other mandated services, you quickly come to the conclusion that there will be precious little money left over for anything else.
Felix Rohatyn has said he believes the city is in greater economic jeopardy now than during the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's, and that "New York does not have the resources to recover on its own."
The fiscal crisis of the 70's resulted in horrendous service cuts that left their grim imprint on the city for many years. The danger ahead for New York -- psychologically as well as physically and economically damaged -- is potentially much greater.
In a conversation Tuesday Mr. Rohatyn stressed the need for long-term assistance from the federal government. "One of the things worth underlining is that the city and the state are essentially like Siamese twins," he said, "and if the city gets into deep trouble, so will the state. In 1975, when the city almost defaulted on its bonds, the state lost access to the public financing markets. I think most people forget that."
New York is functioning, but in a radically altered state. It's a big town in big trouble. And it could use some help with the heavy lifting ahead.

HEADLINE: Former Congressman's Son Opposes Councilman's Aide 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Campaigning outside a supermarket in a Queens neighborhood in the backyard of Kennedy International Airport, Joseph P. Addabbo Jr. seemed to have no trouble being recognized by a large number of shoppers. Many stopped to wish him well in his race for a City Council seat against Joann Ariola.
 "Occasionally, they even remember my father, which really makes me feel good," Mr. Addabbo said, smiling. He is a 37-year-old real estate lawyer; his father served in Congress a generation ago. "I think people know that I have a close link with this area. They know I understand the issues in this community." 
 That Mr. Addabbo has a family name with strong roots in the southern tier of Queens is clear. But less certain is whether that name and its history in Democratic politics will help propel him to victory in a close race in a district that has been represented for the last eight years by Alfonso Stabile, a Republican who is barred by term limits from running again.
In this highly competitive race in the 32nd Council District, Mr. Addabbo is facing Ms. Ariola, a onetime aide to Mr. Stabile who is also a Republican Party official in Queens. Ms. Ariola recently stepped down as an aide to City Councilman Noach Dear, a Democrat, to run for the Council seat.
Another factor in the race is Mr. Stabile himself, who, after some disagreements with his former aide, Ms. Ariola, decided to endorse Mr. Addabbo instead. "I only wish he had endorsed me four years ago," Mr. Addabbo said of an earlier, unsuccessful, campaign -- against Mr. Stabile.
The 32nd Council District includes a number of neighborhoods along Jamaica Bay, from the neat single-family homes of Howard Beach and Ozone Park, on what residents refer to as the "mainland," to the western half of the Rockaway Peninsula, extending out to Breezy Point.
Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the district by a margin of more than two to one. But it is also a district that has often voted overwhelmingly for Republicans, most recently for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki. Mr. Stabile himself won in 1993 by ousting Walter Ward, a Democrat who was then the Council's longest-serving member.
Ms. Ariola, 43, is clearly aiming to enlist the support of the so-called Giuliani Democrats by pointing to a career in which she has worked with both Republicans and Democrats.
"I have worked with everyone, regardless of party," she said. "I have firsthand knowledge of how city government works and how to make it work for the people of this district. I am extremely familiar with every issue of importance to the people of his district."
Ms. Ariola emphasizes issues that are highly neighborhood-oriented. She would seek, she said, to find ways to eliminate the $1.75 toll on the bridges linking the peninsula with the mainland. She would seek to find ways to restore economic vitality to such commercial thoroughfares as 101st, Jamaica and Liberty Avenues.
"And we need road-restoration work in many parts of the district, particularly in Ozone Park," she said. "Some of the potholes have not been repaired since 1993." She also would seek to place pressure on the federal government to prevent the supersonic Concorde jet from landing at Kennedy Airport, citing the increased pollution she said was caused by those flights.
Mr. Addabbo spends much time discussing his proposals for the city's schools, saying that the Board of Education should be restructured to provide for "more accountability and accessibility to the funding for each and every school." He talks about stricter oversight over school construction.
He has also advocated subsidized ferry service between the Rockaway Peninsula and Lower Manhattan and express bus service from the Rockaways to Manhattan. "It takes residents much too long to get to any other part of Queens, let alone going into Manhattan," he said.
This year's campaign represents Mr. Addabbo's second attempt to win the Council seat, after he lost to Mr. Stabile in 1997. He attributes that loss to the high popularity of Mr. Giuliani, saying that most voters stayed in the Republican column as they moved down the ballot and that many Democrats, anticipating a Giuliani landslide, simply stayed home.
"This year is different," Mr. Addabbo said. "The Giuliani coattails are not a factor, and Republicans might stay home if they perceive that Mark Green will win easily over Michael Bloomberg."
That is not particularly daunting, Ms. Ariola said, explaining that Democratic voters often vote for Republican and Conservative Party candidates (she is the candidate of both parties).
"People in this district will cross party lines," she said. "They don't go straight down any particular line, no matter what anyone tells you. They are well-informed voters. And, I think that helps me."

HEADLINE: Let the Cars Squeal 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "It's the Cars, Not the Tires, That Squeal" (Oct. 25): Electronic means of monitoring car use and driver behavior are to be welcomed, not feared. Automotive "black boxes" have reduced crash rates on fleet vehicles in Germany by more than one-third by making drivers accountable for speeding and other unsafe behavior. 
Deploying this technology here could save thousands of lives and make the streets less lethal for pedestrians and cyclists. 
 Similarly, mileage recorders could let municipalities switch road financing from "dumb" levies like sales and property taxes, which actually subsidize driving, to "smart" charges on vehicle miles traveled. Since fewer miles would mean lower taxes, many drivers would economize on car travel, cutting pollution, congestion and petroleum use.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: MEDICATIONS; 
Bioterrorism And Anxiety Are Swelling Prescriptions

BYLINE:  By TAMAR LEWIN 

 BODY:
In the period of anxiety and bioterrorism after the attacks of Sept. 11, many Americans have turned to prescription drugs, according to new data from IMS Health, the nation's leading supplier of pharmaceutical information. 
 The numbers bear out what became plain to many harried pharmacists: The run on Cipro and other antibiotics used to treat anthrax began in late September, even before the first case was announced in Florida on Oct. 4. 
 The IMS figures, reflecting activity through Oct. 19, show that sales both of sedatives and of antidepressants like Prozac and Zoloft also increased, although not so markedly as those of antibiotics. 
In the first full week after the attacks, the number of prescriptions filled for sedatives, like Ambien and Halcion, was up 4 percent nationally over the IMS benchmark, an average of the prescription volume from eight weeks this summer. And by the first week in October, sedative prescriptions were up 11 percent.
Prescriptions for antidepressants also peaked in early October, up 5 percent over the benchmark. 
Prescriptions for sedatives and antidepressants both declined afterward, though not to the benchmark level.
"Right after the attacks, a lot of our patients were very worried and scared, with all their old anxieties stirred up," said Dr. Vicki Lopachin, a Manhattan physician. "It seemed like nobody was sleeping. It's much better now. With the new bioterrorism, people are a little more anxious again, but nothing like those first couple of weeks." 
Much of the anxiety was funneled into demand for Cipro, even before anthrax attacks became a reality. In the week ended Sept. 28, the number of prescriptions for Cipro had increased 6 percent nationally and 37 percent in the New York area. 
And the following week, when the first case was announced in Florida, Cipro prescriptions were up 16 percent nationwide, 73 percent in New York and 53 percent in the West Palm Beach area, the location of the Florida infection.
The week after that, as other anthrax cases were identified, the numbers grew even faster. For that week, ended Oct. 12, Cipro prescriptions were up 45 percent across the country and more than 160 percent in New York and West Palm Beach.
In the early weeks, prescriptions for other drugs in the same therapeutic class, quinolones, rose even faster than those for Cipro. In the last week of September, prescriptions for other quinolones, like Levaquin, Avelox and Tequin, were 25 percent higher than over the summer, and the following week they were 32 percent higher. 
"The reason the other quinolones went up," Dr. Lopachin said, "is probably that as soon as there were reports of a run on Cipro, many doctors did what I did, which was to write prescriptions for one of the other quinolones in all the cases where they'd normally have written Cipro. You want to make sure it will be available."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Hardware: Chip Outlook Remains Dull 

BYLINE:  By Chris Gaither (NYT) (Compiled by Alan Krauss) 

 BODY:
 The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks deepened an already steep slide in chip sales for 2001, and any recovery in 2002 will be slight, a market research firm predicted. The firm, Gartner Dataquest, which is based in San Jose, Calif., said worldwide semiconductor revenue would be $147 billion this year, a 35 percent decline from last year, the industry's sharpest downturn ever. 
Even if demand improves, the report said, the average selling price of chips will continue to cut into sales through year's end. Gartner forecast mild growth next year of 3 percent, to $152 billion. An improved economy, pent-up demand for electronics and personal computers, and new technologies like next-generation cellular networks will lead the chip industry to 30 percent growth in 2003, Gartner said.

HEADLINE: National Briefing Midwest: Missouri: Welfare Fraud Sentence 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 A 29-year-old woman whose twin girls, adopted over the Internet, were the subject of an international custody battle, pleaded guilty to federal welfare fraud charges. 
The woman, Tranda Wecker of O'Fallon, entered the plea in Federal District Court in St. Louis and will be sentenced in January, when she could face as much as a year in jail. She was indicted on Aug. 30 by a federal grand jury on charges of defrauding a federal housing rent program and making fraudulent applications for unemployment checks and for food stamps. Her twin girls are with a foster family.

HEADLINE: N.F.L.: ROUNDUP; 
Owners Approve Labor Agreement

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
N.F.L. owners wrapped up their talks yesterday by ratifying a three-year extension of their labor agreement. The extension would push the salary cap through 2006 and would carry beyond the N.F.L.'s $17.6 billion television contract, which has four more years to run past this season. 
 The labor deal, worked out by the N.F.L. Management Council and the Players Association in June, still must be approved by the players union. Among the unresolved issues before the players can ratify it are how financial losses would be divided if games are canceled, and how the 2006 salary cap would be adjusted if the economy is in a downturn and TV revenues have decreased. 
 Owners also approved the latest deal to keep the Saints in New Orleans for the next 10 years and the roster-stocking plan for the Houston Texans as they enter the league.

49ERS RE-SIGN MIRER: Quarterback Rick Mirer, the former No. 2 overall draft pick out of Notre Dame who was cut by the San Francisco 49ers shortly before the regular season, re-signed with the club yesterday.
 Eight weeks after the 49ers released him in a cost-cutting move, Mirer was back at the team's training complex. He backed up Jeff Garcia last season, but San Francisco chose to drop him in favor of the second-year pro Tim Rattay, who has thrown one N.F.L. pass.

MINOR FINALLY GETS CREDIT: Miami Dolphins running back Travis Minor was credited with a touchdown yesterday, three days after the whistle blew.
 The Elias Sports Bureau changed the statistical ruling on a play in Sunday's victory at Seattle, when Jay Fiedler fumbled at the goal line and Minor recovered in the end zone. Fiedler was initially credited with the score, but it was changed after the game.

HEADLINE: Shopping Lists for Troubled Times 

BYLINE:  By LISA GUERNSEY 

 BODY:
THE day after the terrorist attacks in Manhattan, Ilene Walerstein, a 40-year-old marketing manager, was evacuated from her apartment because of a bomb threat at the Empire State Building nearby. Since then, Ms. Walerstein has made a few decisions about the technology she wants to purchase. "Larger electronics and appliances are just not a priority right now," she said. 
 But putting together a survival kit is. So last week Ms. Walerstein visited the AT&T Wireless store near Bryant Park to add an extra cellphone battery to the list of essentials she has recently decided to keep handy. 
 "I wanted an extra battery in case my cellphone dies," said Ms. Walerstein, whose family has set up a phone tree to keep in touch during crises. "I want to make sure the phone's available in case of emergencies." 
After the attacks of Sept. 11, there was speculation, and some evidence, that electronics shoppers were focusing on gadgets like cellphones that might offer them a lifeline. Now, with a continuing stream of unsettling news -- anthrax scares, military action, an economic downturn, the prospect of being homebound for the holiday season -- industry analysts, manufacturers and store owners are watching for signs of a longer-term impact on consumers' tastes and buying behavior. 
Are they going to shop as Ms. Walerstein is, buying small necessities and holding back on larger purchases? Are they going to spend the money they might have used for travel on items like cellphones, radios and computers, to help them stay better connected or better informed? Or are they going to shake off their anxieties and, with the holiday shopping season approaching, pull out their wallets as readily as they might have before? 
Interviews with shoppers suggest that all of these impulses might be in play at once, though perhaps anxieties are more pronounced around New York City than elsewhere. In Denver, for example, some shoppers appeared inclined to shrug off the uneasy climate and carry on as usual. "The Sept. 11 attacks haven't really affected me that much, or affected what I'm buying," said Dillard Rollison, a 44-year-old engineer who stopped at a Radio Shack in Denver on Monday to buy a 3.5-inch disk drive. 
On Friday afternoon on Fifth Avenue in New York, Joseph and Shelley Brooks of Manhattan said they were inclined to buy more electronics than usual because they thought the economy would slow further and their own finances would tighten after December. Ms. Brooks had just bought a fax machine for her home office, and a few weeks ago she bought cellphones for her two sons to give herself more peace of mind about their safety. (Her sons are adults, but that does not stop her, she said, from buying what she thinks they need.) Now, she added, she is thinking about getting them DVD players for Christmas. 
In the recent past, national crises have had a strong impact on sales of technology, and the historical data may argue against an optimistic forecast. During the Persian Gulf war in 1991, for example, the economy took a dive and the information technology market went with it, until jumping back to its previous levels in 1992. IDC, a market research company in Framingham, Mass., used that conflict as a model for examining what might happen to the technology industry in the coming months. Taking into account the technology slump that was already in progress before Sept. 11, the company concluded that consumers and businesses would proceed so cautiously that they would not purchase items like computers and software.
"I just can't really see any good news," said John Gantz, chief research officer at IDC.
Britt Beemer, the founder of America's Research Group in Charleston, S.C., said he was predicting that sales of consumer electronics would show a decline of about 3.5 percent to 4 percent from a year ago. Part of his research is based on national telephone surveys of consumers and store owners. His latest surveys, he said, lead him to believe that fewer people will be shopping and that many will avoid department stores and traditional retail shops in favor of discount stores.
"Sept. 11 may establish new normal levels," Mr. Beemer said, referring to sales at retail stores. "And I think the new normal level may be only 95 percent" of the levels seen before that day, he said.
Cellphones, however, may follow their own market trajectory. In the weeks since the attacks, many people have talked about finally buying a cellphone, or purchasing a second or third phone for family members as a backup. Before Sept. 11, the Yankee Group, a research group based in Boston, expected that the number of cellphone users in the United States would rise from 109 million in December 2000 to 128 million by the end of this year. Now the company expects an additional 2 million people, or 130 million in all, to subscribe to cellphone plans. 
In two surveys conducted after Sept. 11, America's Research Group asked parents what they might consider buying their children for Christmas. About 6 percent of parents said that cellphones were on their list. "When we've asked that in previous years," Mr. Beemer said, "cellphones barely make 1 percent of responses."
Those who already have cellphones say they are upgrading their services or repairing problems. "My phone broke last week," said Lauren Borish, a buyer for a department store in Manhattan, "and I literally ran to the phone store that day, instead of waiting a few days to get it fixed."
Large wireless companies like Verizon Wireless and Sprint PCS are not releasing figures on how many people signed up for cellphone plans after the attacks -- possibly because they want to avoid giving the impression of profiting from them. But Strategis Group, a telecommunications consulting company in Washington, said that several retailers around the country had told researchers that they were selling more phones -- in some cases three times as many as before Sept. 11. 
Purchases of a few other kinds of consumer electronics also jumped after Sept. 11, although some sales representatives said they expected the increases to be short-lived. In the first few days after the attacks, for example, technology shops in New York saw a surge in sales of pocket AM-FM radios. "We sold out," said Sunny Khan, a salesman at Video Camera City on 32nd Street at Avenue of the Americas. Sales clerks at other shops said that television sets were also a hot item as news watchers decided to upgrade. 
People who wanted even more information bought high-frequency radios and police scanners that pick up conversations between law enforcement officials. Radio Shack sales representatives said that the scanners were suddenly popular at their stores in New York City and around the country. So far, the same uptick in sales has not hit fax machines and computers, some sales representatives say, even though both are obvious alternatives to relying on the postal service amid fears of anthrax.
A few shoppers in New York are determined not to be swayed by recent events. George Majao, a pastry chef who lives in Brooklyn, said he bought a sports CD player on impulse last week, a move that would probably warm the heart of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has urged people to go out and shop. 
Tim Oxborough-Powell, a principal in I.B.M.'s security services division, said he had been "following Rudy's advice" and bought a few DVD's from The Wiz last week. "We are going out and spending money." 
The Consumer Electronics Association, an industry group of manufacturers, sees healthy demand ahead. "We've definitely seen an increase in interest in consumer electronics, which surprised us," said Sean Wargo, a senior analyst at the association. He said he expected a single-digit increase in holiday sales.
Predictions are always just that, of course. This year many shoppers say they are simply unable to gauge how they will handle the holiday shopping season given the news that is occupying their attention. 
Thomas Haddad, an art director from Cedar Grove, N.J., is feeling the weight of the news more than most. He and five of his colleagues were on the 89th floor of 1 World Trade Center that morning, and somehow they all escaped. Last week, he was at a Radio Shack in Manhattan, replacing lost items. He bought headphone splitters, for example, so that he and his wife could carry on their tradition of listening to music together on the bus ride home each evening. 
But in general, he said, he is just taking things slowly, hardly even thinking ahead to the holidays. "I can't even think that far in advance," he said.

HEADLINE: Carnegie Delays Opening of Additional Hall 

 BODY:
The opening of Judy and Arthur Zankel Hall, the new underground 650-seat concert space at Carnegie Hall, has been postponed nine months until September 2003, when it is hoped that the city's economic climate will be more receptive to it, Robert Harth, the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall, announced yesterday.
The opening had been set for the fall season next year, but Mr. 
Harth said that the economic aftermath of the terrorist attacks had made Carnegie Hall rethink its plans.
 "The landscape has changed significantly since Sept. 11, and the issue of ticket sales in the current economic climate is a significant consideration for all arts organizations right now," he said. "The introduction of 50,000 new tickets annually, which would result from a concert series in the new hall, would mean we would be marketing as soon as February for the subsequent season." 
 Originally budgeted at $50 million, the new hall is now expected to cost $69 million, or the bulk of Carnegie Hall's nearly completed $100 million fund-raising campaign. The rest of the money will go toward education and endowment.
The cost of building Zankel Hall increased as soon as excavation of the bedrock beneath Carnegie Hall began. "When you go down, you don't know what you are going to find until you uncover it," Mr. Harth said.
He said that the construction of the new hall under the 2,804-seat Isaac Stern Auditorium was more or less on schedule. The delayed opening will give Carnegie Hall time to prepare a 10-day festival to open it, he added.
With the addition of Zankel Hall, the original 1891 plan by Andrew Carnegie, which had three stages under one roof, will be restored.

HEADLINE: Left in Nasser's Exhaust at Ford 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Jacques A. Nasser, Detroit's New Economy chief executive officer, lasted longer than the new economy. But not much. 
 Mr. Nasser, who resigned as chief executive of the Ford Motor Company on Monday, had bold ideas, and many good ones. He worked his way up through Ford's international divisions and was a turnaround expert nicknamed Jac the Knife for his cost cutting. He presented himself as a chief executive in the mold of John F. Welch Jr., with a dash of Michael S. Dell. Like those men, he had no chief operating officer and chafed at delegating authority. 
 But he was undone by a tin ear for the politicking necessary to run a company of Ford's size -- with revenue last year of $170 billion -- and by a struggling economy that has unmasked the auto industry as an increasingly cluttered and difficult business that has passed its sales peak for the foreseeable future.
For William Clay Ford Jr., the 44-year-old chairman and Ford family scion who has assumed the role of chief executive, that means scaling back Mr. Nasser's ambitions and marshaling Ford Motor dealers, suppliers, managers and union workers for a difficult road ahead. Mr. Nasser's departure, which followed a meeting on Monday with Mr. Ford, came earlier than some had expected. Ford Motor has what will probably be a painful turnaround plan in the works. Why not let Mr. Nasser deliver the cuts before he left?
Part of the reason is that Mr. Nasser's presence could have made a bitter pill taste even worse. Mr. Nasser managed to anger almost every core relationship Ford Motor has.
The United Automobile Workers bristled when he tried to force a spin-off of the company's auto supply operation, Visteon, on terms that would match the deal the union had carefully negotiated with General Motors when it spun off Delphi Automotive. Mr. Nasser ended up getting a much less favorable deal.
"Ford at that time was making record profits and paying record bonuses and here was Nasser, who wanted to dump Visteon off the bus," said Sean P. McAlinden, director of the economics group at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. "It created a political, grass-roots firestorm," he added. 
Relations with the union will be critical to the turnaround plan, since real cost savings are achieved when factories are closed, but the current union contract forbids plant closings.
Ford dealers took it quite personally when Mr. Nasser championed the introduction of a dealership group that was run by Ford Motor, an idea also tried by General Motors. This was a good idea on paper. Most money made on cars is made after they leave the manufacturer, when they are sold, resold, leased, repaired and insured. But convincing the ranks of existing Ford dealers that Ford Motor should get a piece of their pie was not popular, to put it mildly. Neither was Mr. Nasser's initiative to sell cars on the Web. 
"That was the beginning of the dealer relation problems," said Jerry Reynolds, chairman of the Ford National Dealer Council and a dealer in Garland, Tex. 
"I begged him not to do this," he added. "He told me: 'We're going to do this. We think we can learn from this and it can be profitable.' Luckily, it failed."
A letter from the council, made public last month, said that a majority of dealers surveyed wanted change at Ford Motor to start with the departure of Mr. Nasser. 
Perhaps most important, Mr. Nasser appears to have thought that he could rule Ford Motor without sharing information with Mr. Ford, the representative of the Ford family, which controls 40 percent of the voting stock. Mr. Ford felt he was cut off from the flow of information and, in July, created a special office to share some power with Mr. Nasser. 
"This is an old school industrial company," said Rod Lache, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. "You have to be diplomatic. This is a big organization, and there are politics you have to deal with."
Mr. Ford said Tuesday that the time for barnstorming and changing the world had passed and that it was time to "get back to basics." 
"We have relationships that are very important to us, and a lot of those are either broken are not healthy," he said.
"I'm going to spend a lot of my personal time on those relationships: our dealers, the U.A.W., our white-collar employees, suppliers -- on throughout the constituencies -- Wall Street, government." 
Ford is in a weakened condition at a bad time. G.M. is leading a price war in which it, Ford Motor and Chrysler are all offering interest-free financing on their vehicles, inflating sales but narrowing profit at a time when there is no shortage of red ink. G.M. has a new lineup of sport utility vehicles and trucks, and foreign automakers like Toyota are already flooding that market. 
The turnaround plan, which is being devised by Nicholas V. Scheele, newly appointed as Ford Motor's president and chief operating officer, has already been delayed several times and might not be fully assembled until January. But cuts have been under way all year. No more free computers for Ford workers. No bonuses for executives this year. A reduction of about 10 percent of the white-collar staff, or 5,000 workers. Production cuts in the first quarter and again after Sept. 11, and other cuts, including more than 800 jobs at a truck assembly plant in Wayne, Mich. 
One might think that Ford Motor's bitter dispute with the Bridgestone/ Firestone Company was the beginning of the end for Mr. Nasser. But Mr. Ford said it was not a factor, and many analysts agree. 
"It's a combination of factors, but I don't think Firestone was even two or three," Mr. Lache said. He pointed to increased competition in the market for sport utilities and trucks, declining quality and the fact that Mr. Nasser "alienated many people with the choices he made, even if they were well intentioned." 
Mr. Reynolds of the Ford National Dealer Council said Mr. Nasser "did a fantastic job on the Firestone thing."
It was all the varied initiatives that took the focus off building good Ford cars that troubled the dealers, he said. 
"I wouldn't have said a word," he added, "if we had kept our house in order."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED -- AN OVERVIEW: OCT. 31, 2001; 
Plan for More G.I.'s on the Ground, Economic Slump, Anthrax Unease

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
 The United States shifted gears in its military campaign against Osama bin Laden and his Taliban protectors. Officials said that more teams of American advisers will be slipped into Afghanistan to work with rebel militias like the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance.

MORE HELP ON THE GROUND -- With some United States allies beginning to squirm at the relatively slow pace of events, the Pentagon seemed newly determined to help the rebels seize territory rather than leaving them to their own devices. Some American teams were already on the ground, and military officers credited them with allowing warplanes, especially warhorse B-52 bombers, to hit their targets with much greater precision.
 The latest bombings were called the most intense to date against Taliban forces in the field. Air strikes hit them both north and south, including Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold. One target in the round-the-clock operation was a building where Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, had been recently seen. Whether he stuck around for the bombs was not clear, though.
Taliban officials said that a nearby Red Crescent dispensary was hit, and they took foreign journalists (with women conspicuously uninvited) to inspect the damage. But there was no way to tell if anyone had been killed there, let alone the 11 people the Taliban said had died in the attack. The tour also did not include a hospital visit that might have shed light on how many were wounded, if any.
Some elements of this young war -- B-52's, the arrival of American advisers, Pentagon warnings about a tough and resourceful enemy -- carried echoes of the Vietnam War. So did the unhappy word "quagmire," which has entered some conversations in Washington and in European capitals. No one ever promised anything but a difficult fight against terrorism, administration officials said. Still, there were signs of European unease with the course of the war, even among staunch American allies like the Conservative Party in Britain.

CONTRACTING ECONOMY -- At home, to amend a famous remark by former President Gerald R. Ford, our long national sweet dream is over. Government figures confirmed what most people suspected: the longest economic expansion in the country's history seemed finished, and the Sept. 11 attacks had played a part.
From July to September, the economy shrank for the first time in more than eight years, at an annual rate of 0.4 percent. An accepted view among experts was that terrorism pushed an already-tottering economy over the brink. If that news wasn't grim enough, some analysts predicted that the last three months of 2001 would fare even worse. Indeed, times are tough all over, not just in the United States. "The global economy is slipping precariously toward recession," the World Bank warned.
For President Bush, the sorry statistics offered an opportunity to demand that Congress break a partisan deadlock and pass an economic recovery package before the end of November. The Republican-controlled House has approved a $99 billion stimulus plan, but the Democrats in charge of the Senate dismiss it as top-heavy with corporate tax cuts they deem ineffectual. Any package that they endorse, the Democrats told Mr. Bush, must include expanded unemployment benefits and money to help laid-off workers keep their health insurance. In turn, the Republicans bristled at the extra government spending. Simply put, the vaunted bipartisan spirit of the last seven weeks, while not tattered, seemed frayed at the edges.

ANTHRAX DREAD -- On the anthrax front, hope was in short supply. A 61-year-old New Yorker, Kathy T. Nguyen, died several days after becoming infected with inhalation anthrax, the most lethal form. She was the fourth fatality -- the others were in Washington and Florida -- and especially troubling was the mystery surrounding how she caught the germ.
Virtually all the other anthrax victims fell into a pattern. They were either government employees, notably postal workers, or they handled mail in the offices of news organizations. But Ms. Nguyen worked in the stockroom at Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital. Because she was too ill to speak, it is not known what happened to her, and because she lived alone, investigators had a hard time retracing her steps.
So there were only questions. Did she have contact with tainted mail, somehow, somewhere? Or, more worrisome from a public-health vantage, was she a harbinger of a new and scary turn in the anthrax threat? CLYDE HABERMAN

HEADLINE: Justice Department and Microsoft Are Seen in Tentative Settlement 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON with STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
The Justice Department and the Microsoft Corporation have reached a tentative agreement to settle the long-running antitrust suit against the company, people involved in the talks said today.
 The proposed agreement, some details of which were being resolved late this evening, was presented by Charles A. James, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, to a group of state attorneys general meeting in Washington for their consideration. In meetings expected to last through the evening, the state officials were pressing the Bush administration to impose tougher conditions on Microsoft than it had proposed. State officials were also assessing whether they would agree to a deal or break with the Justice Department and try to upset the preliminary agreement. 
 The agreement, which came after three weeks of mediation, cannot become effective unless it is approved by a federal court. Rival companies and consumer groups said tonight that they were certain to oppose it as ineffective.
A crucial issue is whether the 18 states that joined the Microsoft suit can be persuaded to agree to any settlement or will oppose it. The states have taken the hardest line against Microsoft, especially after the Bush administration inherited the case. An earlier effort under the Clinton administration to settle the case was scuttled under pressure from the states.
The tentative settlement calls for a five-year consent decree between the government and Microsoft governing the company's conduct, according to people involved in the talks, with the possibility of a two-year extension if the company violates the agreement. To try to ensure enforcement, a three-member advisory committee of independent experts would be set up.
But the people involved in the talks said some state officials were dissatisfied with the proposed settlement because it did not have adequate enforcement mechanisms. They were also concerned that the deal would not effectively prevent Microsoft from leveraging its monopoly in the operating systems market into computer servers and hand-held devices.
As part of the deal, Microsoft has agreed to eliminate restrictive contract terms and pricing deals with personal computer makers that in the past have effectively left the manufacturers little choice but to favor Microsoft products over rival software.
In theory, such a settlement would restrain Microsoft's use of its monopoly power and foster increased competition in the software business, thus benefiting consumers and the economy.
A Justice Department spokeswoman, Gina Talamona, declined to comment on the settlement talks.
Some of the states in the antitrust case, according to people involved in the talks, and Microsoft's competitors are concerned that the Justice Department has been moving toward too narrow a settlement. The opponents say any deal would have only limited effect on Microsoft's monopoly power and its ability to use its market power to gain an unfair advantage in the new markets of Internet services and commerce, from online shopping to music.
In pursuing a settlement, the Bush administration appears to have rejected proposals made recently by some Microsoft rivals, consumer groups and industry groups for other sanctions against the company. The recommendations, presented in papers and in meetings with Justice Department officials, included requiring Microsoft to "unbundle" software products like its Internet browser and media player from the Windows operating system; forcing Microsoft to place its browsing software in the public domain; and requiring licensing of Microsoft's monopoly product, Windows, to other companies that want to combine it with their products.
The intent of each of these industry proposals would be to make it more difficult for Microsoft to use its market power from Windows as a lever to gain advantage over rivals in new markets. Microsoft has strenuously resisted such steps, saying they would constitute an unwarranted confiscation of its intellectual property and inhibit the company's right to design its products as it sees fit.
The states are a party to this latest round of settlement talks, begun three weeks ago and overseen by a court-appointed mediator, Eric D. Green, a Boston University law professor.
If the states reject the deal, they can challenge it when it is presented to the federal court for public hearings, as required under the law. They can also attempt to continue their antitrust lawsuits against the company, although that could become difficult as a matter of legal procedure if the federal judge accepts the settlement first. California announced last week that it was retaining Brendan Sullivan, a prominent trial lawyer, on behalf of the 18 states in the Microsoft case. That move was widely seen as foreshadowing of a possible split between the Justice Department and the states.
The most significant element in the settlement proposal, industry executives said, is the requirement that Microsoft share the technical information needed for other software or hardware products to work smoothly with Windows. Microsoft's Windows runs on 400 million desktops today, and it interacts with multitudes of other software and devices. That list includes big data-serving computers and software made by I.B.M., Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard, hand-held devices made by Palm and Handspring, and all kinds of software that runs on top of Windows, from AOL's online service to Real Networks' media player.
In the antitrust case, Microsoft was found to have used technical information or the threat of withholding such information to protect its monopoly and disadvantage competitors. Requiring the company to share that technical information, industry executives say, could protect competition -- if effectively carried out and enforced.
Under the settlement proposal, Microsoft would be required to make that information available in a "secure facility," where representatives of software makers, computer manufacturers and others deemed qualified could study the Windows programming code and ask questions.
Carrying out the technology-sharing provision remains one of the sticking points in the settlement talks. The government wants to make sure it is effective, while Microsoft wants to make sure it can protect its intellectual property.
Previous attempts to resolve the case through settlement talks have met with stiff resistance from the states, industry rivals and consumer groups. They regard the consent decree that Microsoft signed with the Justice Department in 1994 as ineffective and easily sidestepped by the company.
"The issue is that Microsoft should not be allowed to use its Windows monopoly as a vehicle for dominating other markets," said Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group with many Microsoft rivals as members.
Mr. Wasch, who has met with Justice Department officials four times in the last two months, said: "The one thing that is clear is that they want remedies that are going to work. But a settlement has to be comprehensive because there is no single silver bullet that is going to solve this problem."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Technology Shares Rebound, With the Nasdaq Up 22.79

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
Desperate for good news, the stock market at first rallied yesterday after the Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross domestic product declined in the third quarter, but less than Wall Street economists and analysts had feared.
 Most of the gains, though, proved to be fleeting. "It's the kind of a market that's more of a wait-and-see type thing than anything else," said John O'Donoghue, co-head of listed trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. "There's no theme or huge direction one way or the other. The market is range-bound, and it will move up or down not on fundamentals, but based on hearsay and rumors. It's either a trader's paradise or a trader's nightmare." 
 Technology stocks, hurt the two previous days, managed to hold on to some of their early gains, and the Nasdaq composite index closed up 22.79 points, or 1.37 percent, at 1,690.20.
But the Dow Jones industrial average, which was up 100 points in early trading, closed down 46.84 points, or 0.51 percent, at 9,075.14. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended virtually unchanged, down 0.01 point, at 1,059.78. 
Market breadth was positive, with 1,940 issues higher and 1,182 lower on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was 1.367 million shares.
Investors initially took hope from the economic data. From July to September, the gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and services in the United States -- shrank at an annual pace of 0.4 percent, the sharpest decline in a decade, the Commerce Department's report said. Economists had expected a decline of about 1 percent. The decrease in consumer and business spending reflected some of the effects of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, although they occurred late in the third quarter.
In addition, the National Association of Purchasing Management in Chicago said its October index fell to 46.2 from 46.6 in September, a drop far smaller than to the 43.0 level some economists had expected. 
"It's a pleasant surprise that both the Chicago purchasing management index and the third-quarter G.D.P. were not as bad as expected," said Jack Shaughnessy, chief investment strategist at Advest. "It really just underscores how the market responds to good news or the lack of bad news."
Moderate interest in technology stocks was sustained in part by Sun Microsystems, which said that sales for its second fiscal quarter were still expected to be higher than in the first quarter. The company's shares rose 61 cents, to $10.15.
Some big computer-related stocks ended mixed. Microsoft fell 73 cents, to $58.15; Dell Computer closed up 74 cents, at $23.98; and I.B.M. declined 58 cents, to $108.07. 
Semiconductor and related stocks advanced briskly, with Intel up 88 cents, to $24.42; Maxim Integrated Products up $2.59, to $45.75; Xilinx up $2.04, to $30.42; and Linear Technology up $2.46, to $38.80. Texas Instruments, despite forecasting a decline in its fourth-quarter revenue, rose 72 cents, to $27.99. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index climbed 18.34 points, or 4.27 percent, to 448.02.
Communications equipment stocks were modestly higher, with Cisco Systems gaining 35 cents, to $16.92; Qualcomm up 43 cents, to $49.12; and JDS Uniphase adding 20 cents, to $7.99.
But Qwest Communications fell $3.05, to $12.95. The company posted a third-quarter loss on lower-than-expected revenue and warned that it would fall short of analysts' projections this quarter.
The Dow industrials were pulled down in large part by Eastman Kodak, which fell $2.23, to $25.57. Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday cut its debt rating for Kodak and warned it may lower the long-term rating again because of weak profits.
Among other Dow stocks, Philip Morris fell 90 cents, to $46.80, and Alcoa fell 75 cents, to $32.27.

PERSON: William M. Smith 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Union Chief's Battle Is With the Postal Service

BYLINE:  By ROBIN FINN 

 BODY:
WILLIAM M. SMITH, president of the New York Metro Area Postal Union, squints hard behind his aviator glasses and confirms that disgruntled is just the half of what he's feeling these days. George W. Bush is not, he huffs, the only president at war with "evildoers." 
 Middle-aged but hanging tough to a middle linebacker's frame that took him as far as semipro ball with the Philadelphia Bulldogs before the draft got him in 1968, Mr. Smith, a bearded brimstone Baptist, Sunday deacon and ex-Carolina farmhand, suspects he has a sort of jihad on his hands. 
 His enemy? Make that enemies. First, the United States Postal Service: Mr. Smith, 57, is suing his perennial foe, alleging that it is undermining the safety of its city employees. Also the United States government, and now those wishy-washy physicians at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "They've changed their tune 50 times," he complains of their much-revised anthrax policy. Rain, snow, heat, gloom: Mr. Smith's constituency of 10,000 workers is sworn to slog through them all, but nobody ever mentioned anything about weathering anthrax. 
Ask him if he thinks the postmaster general, John E. Potter, has any kind of handle on making the mails safe for messengers and recipients and his scowl becomes a smirk. "He's one confused man. He doesn't know an apple from an orange." 
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the city's post-disaster guardian angel, has let Mr. Smith down, too. "He's on the side of the Postal Service!" he hollers. It is apparent that if you're not with President Smith, you're against him. Sounds familiar.
He doesn't mean to yell, yet wishes his interviewer would: in the heat of "the big battlefield" with the Postal Service, he hasn't had time to get new batteries for his hearing aid. (Both eardrums were punctured in Vietnam.) He hasn't had time to get to his doctor to have his sugar diabetes checked, or to take an anthrax test, either. He can't be in two places at once, and suing the government in federal court this week to shut down the contaminated Morgan Station, where four sorting machines tested positive for anthrax last week, takes precedence. 
Nor has he had time to open the mail in his studiedly impersonal office at 350 West 31st Street -- bare walls, zero memorabilia, a banquet-sized desk completely covered by neatly stacked paperwork. Hence the postal pileup on a circular table where two union workers wearing see-through blue gloves are attempting to reduce the clutter. Some is pressing business, some not. 
There's even "junk mail" (his description) addressed to his predecessor, Josie McMillan, ousted by Mr. Smith in 1999 after a challenge that began in 1997 and went to court in 1998. Mr. Smith sold the last of his family property in Scotland Neck, N.C., to come up with the $13,000 required to finance his campaign. After running on an anti-fat-cat, anti-establishment platform, the first thing he did was cut the presidential salary from $142,000 to $95,000.
"The president of the union is nothing but a servant," asserts Mr. Smith, a postal worker since 1976. (He was in maintenance, never a mail carrier.) "I made $47,000 when I was on the work floor, and if I can't live off $95,000, then I need to starve."
MORNINGS he hauls himself out of bed in pitch blackness in Linden, N.J., where he lives with his wife, Barbara, catches the 4:36, clocks in by 5:15, runs a quick broom across the employees' lounge if he spies any crumbs (he's a neatnik), then puts on protective gloves and a surgical mask before getting a jump on his correspondence. That last bit is a recent addition to his routine. 
"I don't take chances," he deadpans. "The Postal Service might send some anthrax to me, the way they hate my guts."
Even before the machines at Morgan tested positive for anthrax spores, Mr. Smith demanded that the station be shut down. He has advised Morgan's 5,500 workers not to report until their building is certified anthrax-free and scoffed at the Postal Service's offer to supply 7,000 employees with antibiotics without first testing them for anthrax exposure. So far, there have been no reports of a Morgan employee testing positive. He claims the economics of keeping open a station that moves 12 million pieces of mail daily is taking precedence over human lives. 
"I realize that Morgan employees are not Supreme Court justices or senators or Congress, but they are God's children; they have the same right to life as the a-ris-to-crats," he says, each syllable a mini-indictment. "No one piece of mail is worth a human life." 
Mr. Smith grew up poor in rural North Carolina, where his grandparents owned the family farm and his father hired out as a sharecropper. There was always more work than money. He hoed the fields at age 6, and by 12 tended the livestock, hogs and cattle; he remembers winning blue ribbons at the local 4-H fairs with his cows. His mother was a disciplinarian who thumped more than just her Bible. "Spare the rod, spoil the child; she believed that," he says.
After high school, he followed his older brothers to New Jersey, stoked the furnaces in a refinery, played football whenever and wherever. He was closing in on a pro tryout when the Army sent him to Vietnam. Injured three times, he came home after nine months with scars and a medical discharge. He joined the postal system in Jersey City at the behest of the Veterans Administration; he recalls it as a "take the job or lose your benefits proposition." 
He took it.

HEADLINE: Tough Economic Times Ahead 

 BODY:
Yesterday President Bush bluntly encouraged Congress to "get to work" on an economic stimulus package and bring a bill to his desk by the end of this month. The matter is indeed urgent, and the combination of quick action by Congress and steady rates from the Federal Reserve offer the best hope for turning the economy around.
 Gross domestic product shrank by 0.4 percent in the third quarter of this year. That performance was better than most analysts expected, but still the worst in a decade. The economy is probably contracting even faster now, and the recovery many had hoped to see by year's end is not likely to arrive until well into 2002. 
 During most of this year, consumers were the engine that propelled the economy while businesses drew down inventories and pared unneeded output. Yet even before Sept. 11 that lone pillar had started to crumble. Personal bankruptcies reportedly jumped in August. Late payments and write-offs of credit card debt had been rising for seven months.
The trend will almost certainly continue, since the terrorist attacks alone may have drained as many as 500,000 jobs from the economy. Companies not directly affected by Sept. 11, including almost all the telecom giants, have also let thousands of workers go. Claims for unemployment benefits have reached levels not seen since 1991.
Those lost jobs and security fears sank consumers' confidence to its lowest level in seven years last month. Even without worrying about anthrax or hijackings, consumers would still be facing disheartening signs. Credit-rating firms expect a rash of bankruptcies among transport, travel and leisure companies over the next few months. Industrial production shows no sign of ending its long decline. Another potential problem is the housing market. Home sales fell more than expected last month, and further slackness would bring down prices. Because housing makes up the lion's share of most Americans' wealth, lower home values would badly hurt their willingness to commit to new spending.
The Federal Reserve can best help the economy with a long period of loose credit at stable rates. Short-term rates have already been cut drastically. If the Fed signals its intention to keep rates steady after any action at next Tuesday's meeting, it would encourage long-term interest rates to fall. That could enliven the housing market and make consumers more eager to purchase big-ticket items. 
For maximum effect, Washington's fiscal stimulus package should target those most in need, who are most likely to spend any money they receive from the federal government. Yesterday the president rightly called for rebates for low-income tax filers, expanded unemployment benefits and aid for laid-off workers who want to keep their health insurance. Help for the jobless who do not qualify for benefits, or whose companies did not offer health insurance, would also be welcome.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Stresses Private Business As Key to Revival 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

 BODY:
Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that the city's looming financial crisis, while serious, was not unmanageable and that private businesses, not aid from the federal government, would ultimately determine how well the city comes through it.
 Mr. Bloomberg, the Republican nominee for mayor, referred repeatedly to his experience running Bloomberg L.P., the big communications company that he founded in 1981, as his main preparation for the top job at City Hall. 
 In a breakfast interview with reporters and editors of The New York Times, Mr. Bloomberg frequently framed his view of New York City and its problems through the constructs of a successful entrepreneur who would approach the mayor's work with pragmatism and salesmanship gleaned from private enterprise. 
At one point, he even spoke about "the message I am selling" when he compared his record with that of the public advocate, Mark Green, his Democratic opponent.
Among the city's richest residents, Mr. Bloomberg, who is 59, spoke about his first attempt to enter public service in the context of some of New York's most storied political families. He expressed surprise with people who have accused him of trying to buy the election with his private fortune, which is estimated in the billions. According to the most recent campaign finance filing, Mr. Bloomberg has spent a record $41 million on his campaign. "It was an obligation to do public service in those days," Mr. Bloomberg said. "I don't know that Harriman or Lehman or Rockefeller needed more publicity or needed prestige or status."
Though acknowledging that he did not always communicate skillfully, he said he was taken aback by criticism of his candidacy in the news media. He said his campaign had been greeted with more suspicion than good will, unlike similar efforts by those other wealthy men from an earlier era.
"You asked what I've learned," he said. "What I haven't quite figured out is why I believe that the scrutiny of my campaign and everything I say has been different."
He went on to say, "And somehow or other, we're getting -- trying to turn it around where anybody that is willing to go and take time out of their lives to do something for others is -- vilified, isn't quite the right word -- but is looked at with suspicion and questioning their motives."
Citing the open-door policy at his company (Mr. Bloomberg and other executives there have no private offices), he pledged that his administration at City Hall would be accessible to the public and would be candid about everything from anthrax infections to possible cutbacks in the municipal work force.
"I would err on the side of disclosure," he said. "I've always done it in my company; I've always done it in my life."
Mr. Bloomberg provided some clues about what his style of mayoral management might be like. He indicated that he would rely heavily on the advice and expertise of people holding the city's highest-level jobs. In the recent case of anthrax found at a postal center, for example, he said he would not second-guess decisions made by the health authorities about whether to close it.
"You have professionals there to assess the risks and make decisions," he said. "That's what you have experts for. And if all of us think that we have the detailed knowledge, you're just wrong."
Mr. Bloomberg revealed the names of a few people that he would like to appoint to important posts at City Hall. Those included Bernard B. Kerik, the police commissioner; Edward Skyler, his campaign press secretary, and Patricia E. Harris, who oversees philanthropic operations at Bloomberg L.P.
He also mentioned Raymond W. Kelly, who was police commissioner under Mayor David N. Dinkins and commissioner of the United States Customs Service in the Clinton administration, as one of his advisers.
But he said he did not expect to bring many business executives into city government.
"You are not going to get a lot of people from the private sector," he said. "Private-sector people tend to have a lifestyle that they could not continue to support in the public sector."
In discussing the city's economic forecast, Mr. Bloomberg said he doubted that the city and state would get much more than the $20 billion in emergency relief already approved by Washington for New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania. But he did not criticize Gov. George E. Pataki's request for $53 billion or second-guess the governor for seeking the larger amount.
He predicted that beyond money for cleanup and transit repairs, the city would have to depend on private financing for most projects.
"I don't want to be a pessimist, but I think you have to be realistic," he said. "When it comes to rebuilding, that is much more likely to be done with insurance company money and with insurance payoff for the damage done, and with other private investment."
He also said it was unrealistic to expect the financial services industry to serve as the anchor of a revitalized downtown. Until new businesses are recruited, he said, reconstruction is unlikely.
"Nobody is going to build buildings on spec," he said. "You've got to find an industry that is going to be willing to go to the site, and they are going to have to sign leases before people start building."
Though he prefaced his remarks by saying there was really no way of knowing what next year might bring, Mr. Bloomberg appeared less pessimistic about the depth of the city's financial crisis than did Mr. Green in an interview on Tuesday. Mr. Bloomberg said next year's deficit would probably be comparable to the deficits of the early 1990's. Mr. Green had referred to the 1970's, when the city experienced its worst financial problems and nearly went bankrupt.
"I don't think we should declare bankruptcy, throw up our hands and say there's no solution to this problem," he said.
In coming up with suggestions about dealing with the expected deficit, Mr. Bloomberg said there would be a municipal hiring freeze that would apply to all city employees, including teachers, police officers and firefighters.
In some areas of law enforcement, he said, greater use of technology, like video surveillance cameras in parks, would help make up for the lack of additional police officers. But he left no opening for hiring more police.
Instead, he said the city's payroll should be directed at increasing the wages of those people already working for the city so that they do not leave for jobs in private business. He said he was particularly worried about losing police officers.
"My first priority would be to try to protect those that are already working for the city under the theory that they're the ones that can work you out of the problem," he said. "I think that you have to pay them more, but the savings have got to come through efficiencies and attrition. Because there just isn't any more money."
In that regard, Mr. Bloomberg said that he expected the city's unions to cooperate with his cost-cutting efforts because they realize there is nowhere else for the budget to give. 
He indicated that despite Mr. Green's long list of union endorsements, the union leadership privately recognizes that he would be a better mayor because "they need good management" in city government.
"I don't suggest for a second you're going to get very many labor leaders to look you in the eye and say that, and agree to that," he said. "But I think deep down inside that is the case."
Mr. Bloomberg, who trails Mr. Green in the polls, predicted that he would be elected the next mayor because voters recognized that Mr. Green's "experience in government is not germane to this job."
"I believe that the public is becoming convinced that the job retention and creation, the managing a city budget, providing security is best done by somebody with managerial and leadership experience," he said.

HEADLINE: Sizing Up Budget Cuts and Answering Criticism About Experience 

 BODY:
 Following are excerpts from an interview with Michael R. Bloomberg, the Republican mayoral candidate, conducted yesterday by reporters and editors of The New York Times. 

Q. If you're mayor of New York today, what are you telling the city about anthrax?

MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG -- We have to depend on the federal government for most of our information. We have to better coordinate with the federal government. We will keep you posted. In the meantime, go about your lives. We are taking the appropriate measures. Then, of course, we have to make sure that the city and the federal government are taking the appropriate actions. But in terms of the outreach to the public, you should not be -- but the problem you have is you don't have a lot of information. The public has a right to know. And the balance between cautioning them and urging them to exercise prudence in terms of what to look for in their day-in and day-out lives, has to be balanced with the potential to scare people so badly that they start staying home, not participating, not going on with a normal life. . . .

Q. Given that anthrax was found, and traces of it were found at the Morgan postal station here in Manhattan, do you think it should have been shut down?

MR. BLOOMBERG -- I'm not in a position to make that judgment, and I don't think any outsider is. You have professionals there to assess the risks and make decisions. That's not -- that's what you have experts for. And if all of us think that we have the detailed knowledge, you're just wrong.

Q. But say if you were the mayor today and you ----

MR. BLOOMBERG -- It's a federal facility, No. 1. . . . So I don't think the mayor can walk in and say the post office should be closed. . . . You certainly want to talk to the federal government and assure yourself that the federal government is taking what steps that they think are appropriate, because the mayor is going to be on television communicating with the public. But in terms of running the post office, in terms of tracking down anthrax in the post office, that's what we have professionals for. And if you have absolutely no confidence in them, then maybe we should replace them. But you can't sit there and second-guess every single security decision. I am in favor of disclosure to the public right up to the point where, for valid security reasons, in the middle of an ongoing investigation, you have to say government does withhold certain information. . . .

Q. The city that you inherit if you win this election is headed for all kinds of financial trouble. What should New Yorkers expect about their government?

MR. BLOOMBERG -- Well, No. 1, nobody's really sure how serious the economic downturn, how protracted it is going to be. Some facts are already in. Commercial vacancies in midtown are going up, and downtown it's a little bit harder to measure because of the severity of the disaster. But there's an enormous amount of space downtown. The great danger that we face is companies deciding just to leave, and the collateral damage, if you will, of any kind of downturn, particularly companies leaving, on small businesses. The people that are really getting hurt here -- and I'll come back to this -- are small companies where, when they can't withstand a temporary economic downturn, they lay off people. . . . But for the city as a whole, sales tax down, personal income tax down, companies leaving. Next year, Office of Management and Budget says $2.3 billion deficit. There are numbers in the paper . . . 4 billion, 6 billion. The bottom line is that nobody knows. Some things are coming back quicker than forecast, and some things are just not. . . .

Q. Is it possible the city is inflating or hyping the number to try to make a better case in Washington? You think that's what's going on?

MR. BLOOMBERG -- Well, the city always underestimates revenues because they have to negotiate with the unions. So there is that. I think that the outlook for federal aid is problematic. . . . I don't think we should declare bankruptcy, throw up our hands and say there's no solution to this problem. You cannot raise taxes. That is clear. If you raise taxes you will drive enough business and people out of this city. Your total tax revenues over a period of time would probably decline rather than go up. There are some efficiencies you can get. But the city is not so poorly run that there are enormous pockets of corruption or waste that you can say well better management will cut back. Yes, in a $40 billion budget you can certainly cut some things. You can find some efficiencies. And I've thought what you do is you have to get the unions involved in some kind of a saving-sharing plan where -- because other than that you will not get the cooperation you need. But you can do that to some extent. And there are also some revenue sources that we haven't tapped. If you could get the federal government to change the law, which you might be able to do, actually, so that we can refinance our debt more than once, we can save a little over $100 million in just that. . . . But then you get down to the either-or. We've got to go and say that if we don't have the money, we have to cut back what we're spending. And cutting back what we're spending . . . where half of it is in salaries and pension, there's just no question what has to give. . . .
My first priority would be to try to protect those that are already working for the city under the theory that they're the ones that can work you out of the problem. They are the ones you really need to have cooperate. And they are the ones we should have loyalty to. . . . And you put a hiring freeze in to try to hope that attrition will cut it down. . . . 

Q. So you think the teachers and firefighters and police should also be subject to a hiring freeze and salary freeze?

MR. BLOOMBERG -- . . . If you don't apply it to them, what are you talking about? . . . I think that you have to pay them more, but the savings have got to come through efficiencies and attrition. Because there just isn't any more money. But you have to stop the loss of the work force that you need. When it comes to teachers, probably the most disruptive thing in a classroom is the loss of the teacher in midyear. It would be nice to have smaller classroom sizes. We don't have enough wherewithal to keep the existing classroom size. So, you know, saying you'd like it is great. But you have to be realistic about what you can afford. And teachers are leaving . . . after two, three years because the job is very tough. They don't feel they get support, and they don't make enough money to live. And a young person, in the end, will want to go and say, "I've done my teaching for a while. I'd love to continue, I love kids, but I can get a job in the commercial sector." And that is also -- that exact same phenomenon is going to devastate the Police Department unless we do something. The police pension system is designed to force you out if you have a very good year. And the overhead this year -- the overtime this year -- is going to create an enormous incentive for anybody with experience that's been there a long time to go and to leave at the very same time that the demand on the commercial side for police officers is skyrocketing. What's the one business that everybody wants to hire people? The one part of their operation? Security. What better than hiring an N.Y.P.D.-trained guy with 20 years? So we're going to have a very big problem. . . .

Q. Your company is a privately owned company. You've talked about how you might distance yourself from that company once you're mayor. Could you talk a little bit about that?

MR. BLOOMBERG -- Just don't go -- I mean I'll put it in the private trust. . . . But short of that, we don't do any business to the city. I don't know what else I can do. As Mark Green said, he can't get rid of his brother. But you know, maybe he'd like to. I mean you put it in the private trust. We don't do business with the city other than it is a taxpayer in the city. There is no other contact. . . . I don't see any real conflict any more or less than me as a taxpayer in the city. I mean even if I were to sell it, I'm still going to be a taxpayer in the city. You just disclose what you're doing. . . .
What I haven't quite figured out is why -- I believe that the scrutiny of my campaign and everything I say has been different. You know, if you go back, it used to be that it was people were encouraged to go from private service to public service -- Leahman, Harriman, Rockefeller. It was an obligation to do public service in those days. And some how or other, we're getting -- trying to turn it around where anybody that is willing to go and take time out of their lives to do something for others is -- vilified isn't quite the right word -- but is looked at with suspicion and questioning their motives. I don't know that Harriman or Leahman or Rockefeller needed more publicity or needed prestige or status. That's not why they went into public service. . . . And I think more people should do it. I said from Day 1, somebody asked me at the beginning, why did you go into public service? And I said, everybody I've ever met who had worked in public service for a period -- whether I thought they were successful or not -- they all, when they recalled those days, had a gleam in their eye that they had done something wonderful. That they were a part of making government and the system and our civilization better. And I said back then, I had never had that experience. And that's more than anything what I wanted. I wanted the chance to go and do it. And I had the ability to do it. Why not go do it?

Q. But are you saying that you're being subjected to closer scrutiny?

MR. BLOOMBERG -- Well, everybody is fixated on where my money comes from. Just go take a look at where -- whatever candidate I happen to be running against -- where his money comes from. I don't see any stories about all that. Not any. But there are not a lot about sources of money and potential conflicts. You ask about the potential conflict with my company . . . and yet you don't focus on conflicts that others have where they take funds, refuse to disclose who even works for him. . . .

Q. I know this is not exactly what you're talking about when you talk about a closer scrutiny, but I have to ask you what your reaction is to this women in the workplace stuff that has bubbled up. Do you see that as an example of what you're talking about? And what's your reaction to that?

MR. BLOOMBERG -- We, in 20 years, have a record that I don't think you will ever find a company can match.

Q. Not we, I think probably you personally is what this stuff has been bubbling up about, isn't it?

MR. BLOOMBERG -- Well, it's just before the election, all of a sudden stuff bubbles up. I think you've got to put in perspective. Hopefully, the public understands that that's, you know, that's the same thing that happened in the runoff. At the last moment, all of a sudden, things come out, stories are spread, rumors are promoted.

Q. Are you saying it's not true?

MR. BLOOMBERG -- Oh no, no. I think that the case that you're talking about -- The Village Voice piece?

Q. Yes.

MR. BLOOMBERG -- The Village Voice piece was plain and simple. One of our employees alleged an event had taken place a year and a half before. Our H.R. department -- run by a woman who I have an enormous amount of confidence in, she's as professional as you can find -- tried to investigate. The complainant would not cooperate. There was a lot of evidence to the contrary. She then without ever talking to us filed a lawsuit. And the judge dismissed it with no evidence whatsoever. The story -- I haven't read it, but what was told to me -- the story in the Village Voice is they take one line out of a deposition, which if asked that -- I forget exactly how the question was phrased, but if you're asked what is the -- do you automatically believe any allegation? No, you have to -- everybody has rights. And you try to do a fair investigation. I didn't personally do it, our H.R. department did. And as I said, as far as I remember checking, they did exactly what was appropriate, exactly what was advised by all of the consultants that we use to ensure that we are a company where everybody can work safely and happily together. And the judge thought it was ridiculous.
But, you know, could I have made -- if you ask what you could do differently -- I suppose if I were running for office, I just would have paid some money up front even though we did nothing wrong. But I don't know how I would have lived with myself. We did nothing wrong, and we conducted ourselves honorably. . . . I couldn't be prouder of the ways that we have conducted ourselves and the environment that we have created for our employees. And the fact that we have 8,000 people and 100 offices and have less than 10 percent turnover says that it's a pretty good place to work. And what we do is appropriate. I don't know what else you can say to those things.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE WORLD ECONOMY; 
Entangled With War on Terror, Threat of Global Recession

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
For seven weeks now, President Bush has been preoccupied with managing a global war on terrorism. With the announcement today that the American economy shrank in the third quarter, he is faced with managing another complex and often intertwined crisis: The prospect of a global recession.
 The world's two largest economies -- the United States and Japan -- are in simultaneous retreat. Germany appears headed into the same morass, and Europe's growth is paltry. And one of the chief lessons of the 1990's, when successive economic crises rippled quickly around the world, was a simple one: the weakest economies are often the first pushed off the edge of the cliff. 
 So it is notable that in Pakistan, America's uneasy ally, exports to the developed world have nearly ground to a stop. Plunging world output means lower oil prices, which mean trouble for the Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia. At the Asian summit meeting in Shanghai 10 days ago, the hallways were filled with speculation about whether economic downturn could worsen social unrest, particularly in the Islamic world.
"This is a global recession, and the worst is yet to come," said Allen Sinai, the chief global economist of Decision Economics in Boston, who advises global corporations on trouble in the offing. "The stresses will be felt the most in the developing world and the emerging markets, which are the most fragile, and where frustrated workers and their governments will be looking for scapegoats. And you can see that the leading scapegoat is already the United States."
That may be unfair. In stronger times, the American economy pulled the world out of three major economic jolts in the last seven years, the first originating in Mexico, the second in Asia, the third in Russia. 
But in global economics, like global politics, perception is everything. And as one of Mr. Bush's senior foreign policy advisers noted a few days ago, the fact that America is no longer sucking in the world's goods the way it once did is making it "far harder for us to offer the salve of economic good times." 
How that plays into the politics of keeping together the fragile counterterrorism coalition is anyone's guess. But consider what has happened in recent days with Pakistan. Mr. Bush's foreign policy aides want to cut tariffs on Pakistan's main product, textiles. But the effort is hung up here, after complaints by American companies that they are already being savaged by the downturn, and that Mr. Bush should not be putting American workers out of jobs to keep his coalition together. The result is stalemate.
Mr. Bush has not uttered the words "global recession," and he has insisted that what is good for America -- quick Congressional passage of an economic stimulus package, and new authority for him to negotiate trade agreements -- will be good for the world. He may be right. But what is missing is a coordinated, global approach to what increasingly looks like a three-continent recession, a sharp departure from the way similar downturns have been dealt with in the past.
That is particularly worrisome because the evidence now is that the bad news will get worse and that America's troubles will spread. That message was reinforced today by the World Bank, which issued a troubling report about where things are headed.
"As 2001 draws to a close, the global economy is slipping precariously toward recession," the World Bank report said.
"The terrorist attacks in the United States, although it is still too early to evaluate them fully, have unleashed new and unpredictable forces that have substantially raised the risk of a global downturn." 
The crucial word there is "unpredictable." For if there was a lesson in the economic crises of the past few years, it was that a badly timed economic downturn could have both economic and political ramifications that no one could foresee.
At the State Department these days, some of those examining the staying power of the president of Pakistan, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, refer ominously to what they call "the Suharto factor" and wonder how it could play into Mr. Bush's war effort. When the Asian economic crisis started in 1997, President Suharto of Indonesia seemed like an unlikely victim. Yet once it became clear to his people that he had no control over the economy, his power base eroded rapidly. He was gone in months, and ever since there has been political chaos in Indonesia.
No one is predicting General Musharraf's fate. But in a world more attuned than ever to avoiding risk, Pakistan's export troubles, its political uncertainties and the bombing next door in Afghanistan may make it a poor choice for investors. So just as Mr. Bush is making the case that the new alliance with the United States can bring economic benefits for Pakistan, those benefits could be disappearing.
"You can lift sanctions and reduce tariffs every month," one of Mr. Bush's economic advisers said, "but under current conditions you can't convince Motorola, or anyone else, to build a plant."
Another unpredictable element of the equation is whether ordinary workers around the globe will blame their troubles on America either because it is bombing Afghanistan, or because it is not buying what they make. "Our slowdown has been exported," Jim Glassman, a senior economist for J. P. Morgan Chase, said today. "The irony is that the terrorist attack may boomerang worse for those who trade with us than for the United States itself."
Mr. Bush's other problem may be one of divided attention span. Even if his administration was more attuned to international economic trends, the need to conduct the war abroad and at home does not leave much time to think long and hard about how the economic problems of the United States, Japan and Europe may be feeding off one another, or radiating elsewhere around the globe. Moreover, this has never been Mr. Bush's favorite topic. Some other leaders at the Asian summit said they found Mr. Bush's arguments on terrorism to be impassioned and well grounded but that his discussion of the global economy was brief and shallow. 
But if the world is truly headed into a global recession, Mr. Bush may find that his current priority -- the war first and foremost -- may be involuntarily amended.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE PRESIDENT; 
Bush Sets Nov. 30 Deadline For Economic Stimulus Plan

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Confronted with the firmest evidence yet that the country has slipped into recession, President Bush demanded today that Congress break a partisan deadlock and send him an economic recovery package within the next month.
 Speaking to business executives at the White House after the government reported that the economy shrank in the third quarter -- the first quarterly downturn since 1993 -- Mr. Bush said he was "deeply concerned" about rising unemployment, declining consumer confidence and deteriorating business conditions. 
 "It's time for our government to act in a positive and constructive way," Mr. Bush said. "The Congress needs to pass a stimulus package and get it to my desk before the end of November." 
The president offered no new ideas about how to bridge the widening gap between Democrats and Republicans over how best to reverse a slowdown that began a year ago and intensified after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Instead, he used his speech to defend his approach, which is made up largely of tax cuts for individuals and businesses that Democrats have repeatedly rejected. Democrats said they would insist that any recovery plan be focused on helping low-income working people and the unemployed, proposals that Republicans have opposed as expensive and unwarranted expansions of government.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, said he had told Mr. Bush at a breakfast this morning that his party would not compromise on its call for the package to center on expanded unemployment benefits and financial help to allow laid-off workers to maintain their health insurance.
"I think I would go so far as to say we will not pass a bill that does not address those two critical needs," Mr. Daschle said. 
Mr. Daschle said that with efforts to reach a bipartisan agreement not getting anywhere, he planned to try to bring a Democratic stimulus package to the floor next week.
Saying they feared that partisan differences might keep Congress from agreeing on any stimulus plan this year, a bipartisan group of centrist senators met today to see if they could develop a compromise.
They discussed a proposal to deal with the issue of health insurance for the unemployed in a way that would be acceptable to Democrats and Republicans alike. Their proposal would create a temporary tax credit that unemployed people could claim to pay for as much as half of their health insurance premiums, up to $110 a month for single people and $290 a month for families.
The plan is intended to assure Democrats that adequate money would be available to deal with the problem without raising objections from Republicans about creating a permanent new welfare program.
But administration officials signaled on Tuesday that Mr. Bush would probably veto any bill that included a Democratic proposal to subsidize health insurance premiums under an existing government program that allows laid-off workers to maintain employer-provided health coverage.
The Democratic proposal "was a huge reach and change in policy, putting the federal government into a position where it's now going to create a new entitlement class," Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said in an interview.
Democrats appeared intent on pressing forward, with the Senate Finance Committee set to take up the party's own proposal, introduced last week by Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the committee's chairman, as early as Tuesday.
Mr. Baucus's plan would provide $16 billion this year to expand unemployment insurance to many part-time workers, extend benefits 13 weeks beyond the current 26-week maximum and increase the weekly payments. The plan calls for $17 billion this year to pay half of health-insurance premiums for unemployed workers.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE AID; 
U.S. Will Buy Asian Wheat to Give Afghans

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that it would spend $11.2 million on wheat and other food supplies from Central Asian countries for immediate shipment to Afghanistan to avert a worsening hunger crisis there. 
 With more than seven million people at risk of starvation, the United States Agency for International Development said it would buy $6 million in wheat from Kazakhstan through the United Nations' World Food Program rather than shipping wheat from the United States, which would take longer. 
 The rest of the aid package will be spent by other organizations on wheat and other commodities from Central Asian nations, also to be shipped to Afghanistan. 
The Office of Management and Budget had held up $50 million in disaster relief requested by the agency to buy food in the region, telling lawmakers that since the war was making it difficult to transport food into Afghanistan it would make little difference if relief groups waited for wheat from American farmers.
But lawmakers in Congress protested, saying the food was needed immediately and should be bought locally. Then last week, American warplanes bombed Red Cross warehouses outside Kabul for a second time, destroying enough food to feed 55,000 people for 200 days.
This morning, President Bush gave his final approval for the purchase of local wheat during a briefing by Andrew S. Natsios, the administrator for the Agency for International Development. 
"We're using every available means and every available route to get food to needy Afghans before the winter sets in," said Mr. Natsios after the meeting.
The money is part of the $320 million in aid promised by Mr. Bush.
Representative Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, pushed the administration last week to buy local wheat, saying speed was of the essence if the administration was to keep its promise to feed the Afghan people while waging war.
"I'm glad it's happening," Mr. Kolbe said today. "It's a step in the right direction."
Officials of the domestic wheat industry supported the emergency food effort. 
"We do not oppose using U.S. funds to alleviate the immediate crisis in that manner," said Alan Tracy, president of U.S. Wheat Associates. "The needs of starving people come before any parochial concerns." 
The United States was the largest foreign aid donor to Afghanistan even before the Sept. 11 attacks, providing more than 80 percent of all of the food aid for Afghans through the World Food Program. 
"We would encourage the administration to make good on their generous commitment as quickly as possible," said George Devendorf, of Mercy Corps, an American relief organization working in Afghanistan and refugee camps on its borders. "We are on the clock here and delays will translate into lives." 
Even by buying wheat from Kazakhstan, relief groups will be hard pressed to transport the 28,000 metric tons of grain into the country. Banditry has become commonplace in the Taliban-controlled areas. And the bombing campaign has blocked access to some of the more remote areas.
But the Pentagon is working with relief groups to avoid further accidents like the bombing of Red Cross warehouse and to insure clearer routes into the country.

 Planning and Diplomacy

MORE MILITARY ADVISERS -- The Pentagon is planning to expand the number of advisers working with anti-Taliban groups in Afghanistan, who will move with the resistance forces as they advance against Taliban troops. The deployment reflects a new determination by the United States to help the rebels, the Northern Alliance, seize territory. A1

UNEASE IN EUROPE -- Prime Minister Tony Blair began another diplomatic mission -- this time to the Middle East -- but in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, public unease with the course of the war in Afghanistan and its rationale was on the rise. B2

Bombs and the Rebels

PAKISTAN'S NUCLEAR SECRETS -- Pakistan arrested three of its leading nuclear scientists in connection with concerns that nuclear weapons technology could have found its way into the hands of the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan and Osama bin Laden. A1

HEAVY BOMBING -- An American B-52 bomber attacked Taliban bases on the front line north of Kabul, leading the heaviest day of bombing yet against Taliban positions. B3

A FAMILY'S CAUSE -- Two American brothers with lifelong ties to Afghanistan are engaged in a campaign to reshape that country's government. B3

The Civilians

THE DEATH TOLL -- As the bombing goes on in Afghanistan, it is hard to estimate the civilians killed. Taliban officials say 1,500 have died, a number the Pentagon calls highly inflated. B1

FOOD FOR AFGHANISTAN -- The Bush administration said it would buy $11.2 million of wheat from Central Asian countries for shipment to Afghanistan, which faces a food crisis. B4

ASSETS FROZEN -- Saudi Arabia has ordered a freeze on the assets of people and organizations identified as sponsors of terrorism. B4

A TELEVISION WAR -- The United States is fighting a propaganda war, reassuring Americans and trying to win over foreign, and especially Muslim, television audiences. B4

GAINING NEWS ACCESS -- Western reporters have entered the Afghan city Kandahar, sending out images of battle. B4

A Death in New York

WORKER DIES OF ANTHRAX -- Kathy T. Nguyen, 61, a hospital stockroom worker stricken by New York's first case of inhalation anthrax, died early yesterday. A1

A SEARCH FOR FAMILY -- Ms. Nguyen, the latest victim of anthrax, had lived quietly and alone; now her neighbors are looking for her family and planning her burial. B9

Looking Ahead

ECONOMY SHRINKS -- The longest economic expansion in American history has ended. The nation's economy shrank this summer for the first time in more than eight years, with businesses cutting investment while consumers increased their purchases only slightly. A1

RECOVERY PACKAGE SOUGHT -- President Bush demanded that Congress break a partisan deadlock and send him an economic recovery package within the next month. B6

RECESSION FEARS -- With the announcement that the American economy began shrinking even before terrorism struck, the president is now faced with another crisis: the prospect of a global recession. B6

The Quest for Security

KNOWLEDGE OF ATTACKS -- Attorney General John Ashcroft disclosed for the first time that the government had apprehended suspects who were believed to have had advance knowledge of the Sept. 11 hijackings. A1

AIRPORT PLAN FOUGHT -- President Bush and his allies are pressing moderate House members to defeat a plan to make 28,000 airport security workers federal employees. B1

STATUS OF DETAINEES -- Profound differences exist in the legal situations of the hundreds of people detained since the terror attacks, depending on their nationality, why they are being held, and where. B5

REPORTS OF THREATS -- Federal agents boarded a Northwest Airlines flight at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and removed two men in response to a biohazard threat. B5

The Biological Threats

TREATY ON TERROR -- The administration is discussing proposals with its allies that would make it a crime for individuals to buy or build a biological weapon for terror attacks. A1

ASSESSING DANGER -- Government analysts now agree that the threat of mass-casualty weapons wielded by terrorists is more serious than they ever imagined. A1

U.N. MEASURE REJECTED -- The United States rejected a proposal for United Nations condemnation of the anthrax attacks because the source was still not clear. B8

ANXIETY ABOUT OLYMPICS -- The threat of terrorism is causing officials and athletes around the world to become anxious about the Salt Lake City Olympics in February. B8

MAIL SEARCHED -- Nearly 70 tons of mail shipped to Ohio for decontamination will be trucked back to Washington and searched for anthrax. B8

CONCERNS ON FLU SHOTS -- Infectious-disease experts fear that if millions of healthy people get flu shots, they could keep the vaccine from those who need it most. B8

Public Health Response

A DAILY CHALLENGE -- Almost every day, health officials have to retool the way they are surveying and managing the anthrax threat. B10

ANTHRAX SYMPTOMS -- Experts in infectious diseases say a few clues may help distinguish the early stages of anthrax. B10

PRESCRIPTION-DRUG USE -- In the period of anxiety and bioterrorism after the attacks of Sept. 11, many Americans have turned to prescription drugs, a leading supplier of pharmaceutical information said. B10

UNION LEADER'S VIEW -- The president of the New York Metro Area Postal Union has some bones to pick with local government, the Postal Service and the C.D.C. D2

Aftermath of the Attacks

TRADE CENTER'S TROVE -- Firefighters and police officers are helping remove about $200 million in gold and silver, just part of the possessions stored beneath the ruins of the trade center. B1

SCALING BACK RECOVERY EFFORT -- New York officials are seeking to reduce the number of police officers and firefighters at ground zero, a decision announced amid new concerns about polluted air at the site. B11

AID FOR INSURERS -- House Republicans are preparing a financial assistance plan for the insurance industry that would have the government lend rather than give the insurers money for any future terrorist attacks. B11

INFORMATION SHARING -- New York's senators called for legislation to remove barriers to the F.B.I.'s sharing information on terrorism with local and state police. B11

POLICING A PARADE -- In the new security climate, law enforcement agencies in New York faced a daunting task: securing the Halloween parade in Greenwich Village, a raucous street celebration. D3

The Arts

AS BIG AS LIFE -- The images of 272 rescue workers, survivors and relatives of victims of the terrorist attacks have been captured on film using the world's biggest instant camera. E1

ARTISTS' BENEFITS -- The New York art world is raising money for victims of the trade center. E3

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: BELT-TIGHTENING; 
Numbers Prove U.S. Economy Has Retreated

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The longest economic expansion in American history has ended.
 The nation's economy shrank this summer for the first time in more than eight years, the government said yesterday, with businesses further cutting investment while consumers increased their purchases only slightly. The terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 played a key role, pushing an already-weak economy over the brink, analysts said, as travel temporarily stopped and spending briefly froze. 
 "The recession has begun," Stuart Hoffman, the chief economist of the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh, declared. "The fourth quarter will show an even deeper drop than the third quarter." 
President Bush, speaking to manufacturing executives yesterday, said the new evidence provided yet another reason for Washington to act quickly to pump money into the weakening economy. "People are having tough times in America," Mr. Bush said. "People are losing their jobs, and I'm concerned about that."
"My call to Congress is, get to work and get something done," he added. Page B6. 
In the three months that ended Sept. 30, the economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.4 percent, after adjusting for inflation. That is the only significant quarterly decline since early 1991, when the last recession ended, and the first drop other than a one-quarter downward blip of 0.1 percent in the spring of 1993.
While the nation will not officially be considered in a recession until the downturn has continued for another quarter, most analysts are now preparing obituaries for what turned out to be the broadest and most enduring expansion on record.
Ten years of essentially uninterrupted growth, including a boom in the second half of the 1990's, sent the stock market to record levels, pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest point in 30 years, produced unprecedented budget surpluses, and caused some starry-eyed executives and consultants to predict that recessions were a relic of the past.
In the last year, however, the economy has barely advanced, and few analysts believe healthy growth will return within the next few months because many companies still have more machines and employees than they can profitably use.
In hopes of shortening the downturn, the Republican-led House last week narrowly passed a $99 billion stimulus package, consisting mainly of tax cuts for businesses and more affluent taxpayers. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill yesterday used the latest economic data to press the administration case for passing the stimulus measures.
But Democratic leaders in the Senate, who met with the president at the White House yesterday, say the House bill will not adequately stimulate the economy because many of the corporate tax cuts simply return money to companies, rather than providing them with new incentives to invest.
The Democrats hope to win Senate approval next week for their own plan, which would offer greater benefits to lower-income taxpayers and people who have lost their jobs.
The contraction in the third-quarter was less severe than the 1 percent rate of decline many analysts had expected. Stocks shrugged off the report.
Bond prices soared yesterday, but that was attributed to the Treasury Department's announcement that it would no longer issue 30-year bonds, causing investors to scramble to buy the existing supply. Page C1. 
Consumer spending -- which accounts for about two-thirds of gross domestic output -- rose slightly in the third quarter, as pre-Sept. 11 increases outweighed the fall after the attacks. Business investment in new buildings and equipment fell sharply, but not as dramatically as in the second quarter.
Still, the overall economic picture looked grim.
The value of exports and imports each fell more than 15 percent in the third quarter, for the first time since 1975, when all of the world's largest economies were struggling at once and companies were failing to find any healthy markets eager to buy their goods.
Since the beginning of 2000, the growth rate of consumer spending in the United States has fallen to a meager 1.2 percent from a robust 5 percent, as layoffs and falling stocks have left people with more worries and less money.
In the third quarter, spending on durable goods -- expensive, long-lasting items like cars and appliances -- grew just 1.7 percent, down from 7 percent in the previous quarter.
Even as consumers were cutting back, they received more income largely because of the tax rebates the government mailed over the summer. But most of that was saved rather than spent.
Meanwhile, business spending on equipment and software fell 11.8 percent in the third quarter, placing the level below where it was at the end of 1999. In the late 1990's, such spending was growing more than 10 percent a year. Most economists now blame companies' misplaced optimism and zealous overinvestment during the final years of the boom for the current collapse.
The rapid cutbacks do offer one potential bright spot, however, since many companies have already reduced their costs and excess stockpiles significantly, clearing the way for an eventual upturn. 
"We've had nothing but declining production, employment, wealth and living standards all year long," Steven Wieting, a senior economist at Salomon Smith Barney, said. "The only good news is that we're fairly far along in the process."
In all, the American economy produced $10.2 trillion worth of goods and services in the quarter, the Commerce Department said.
Most economists do not expect growth to resume until next year, with many predicting that it will be weak until at least the middle of 2002, according to a survey by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter based in Kansas City, Mo.
The National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of academics based in Cambridge, Mass., is generally considered the official judge of the business cycle. With employment having peaked in March, some analysts believe that the bureau's recession-dating committee, when it eventually meets to review month-by-month data, will declare that a recession actually began before this summer.
Whatever the eventual date, the expansion of the last decade will surpass the previous record of eight years and two months in the 1960's.

HEADLINE: Even Now, A Skyline Of Twins 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
They were the two. But they were not the only.
While New York City lost its most famous twin towers on Sept. 11, the skyline is still punctuated with doubles. Twin towers are the defining feature of Central Park West and, in the spires of St. Patrick's Cathedral and the minarets of Central Synagogue, the glory of Midtown. They serve as a gateway to Harlem and frame the broad lawns of the United Nations.
 And more are on the way. In a remarkable coincidence, even as the remains of the World Trade Center are being cleared downtown, construction crews at Columbus Circle are building the most prominent twin-towered development in a generation: the 750-foot-tall AOL Time Warner Center. 
 New York, New York, has a penchant for saying things twice.
That is not to deny the sturdy, singular majesty of the Empire State Building, once again the city's tallest building. (Can you believe it?) But there is a certain loneliness to its solitary stature.
By contrast, the 110-story Trade Center towers were practically fraternal. Indeed, at the time of their construction in the early 70's, they were even dubbed Nelson and David, though disparagingly, after the Rockefeller brothers who championed their development, one as governor of New York, the other as chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank.
Anthropomorphism is irresistible when contemplating twin towers, as the term itself suggests.
They may be discerned as sturdy legs, like the Colossus of Rhodes. They may be imagined as arms raised to the heavens. They may be thought of as siblings or partners or husband and wife.
Or as sentinels.
That is one impression of the 35-story Schomburg Plaza apartments, built at Fifth Avenue and 110th Street in 1975, two years after the World Trade Center was dedicated. This octagonal, concrete pair can also be read as a pivot between black and Hispanic Harlem or as a monumental gateway to Harlem itself.
Despite many obvious differences, Schomburg Plaza, designed by Gruzen & Partners and Castro-Blanco, Piscioneri & Feder, bears similarities to the World Trade Center. Its slender towers rise straight up without setbacks and are offset from one another in both directions.
The offset enhances their visibility. The south tower, 1295 Fifth Avenue, is the visual anchor along 110th Street and Central Park North. The north tower, 1309 Fifth Avenue, plays the same role up and down the avenue.
Seen together, across Duke Ellington Circle or the Harlem Meer in Central Park, through a pale autumn haze that makes them appear far taller than they are, they inspire a gasp of recognition, recalling their lost cousins downtown.

Looking West
The actual inspiration was closer by, said Jordan Gruzen, one of the architects. "We were really looking across Central Park at the El Dorado and the Century and all the wonderful double-towered buildings," he recalled.
Unlike Schomburg Plaza, the Central Park West twins rise from substantial base buildings that account for about two-thirds of the overall height, with side-by-side towers to complete the composition.
They were shaped by the Multiple Dwelling Act of 1929, Steven Ruttenbaum wrote in "Mansions in the Clouds: The Skyscraper Palazzi of Emery Roth" (Balsam Press, 1986). That law capped apartment buildings at 19 stories but permitted extra floors if the building site was large enough and the tower portion occupied no more than 20 percent of the site.
Roth was the architect of the first Central Park West twin, the San Remo, between 74th and 75th Streets. "I do not think that there was any mystical design thought, just very good architecture based on the existing building code," his grandson, Richard Roth Jr., said recently. Emery Roth & Sons also worked with Minoru Yamasaki & Associates on the World Trade Center.

'A Lighter Skyline'
The San Remo was followed by the El Dorado, between 90th and 91st Streets, by Margon & Holder, with Roth as adviser; the Majestic, between 71st and 72nd Streets, by Irwin S. Chanin and Jacques L. Delamarre; and the Century, between 62nd and 63rd Streets, also by Chanin and Delamarre.
"The towers duplicated make a lighter skyline that a solid tower would not provide," Diana Agrest wrote in "A Romance With the City: Irwin S. Chanin" (Cooper Union Press, 1982). "In fact this helps make a skyline by generating a rhythm along the avenue, addressing now not the avenue but the city at large, creating a point of reference and visual link between the east and west side."
Mr. Ruttenbaum was equally celebratory, saying that the San Remo towers "convey a lyrical, uplifting feeling, similar to the religious aura of a medieval cathedral."

Spires to God
Not just any cathedral, though. Some of the most celebrated Gothic cathedrals had a single tower, while others had distinctly asymmetrical pairs.
The cathedral of Cologne, on the other hand, had truly twin towers. And after a 282-year hiatus, construction resumed in 1842, a project that fired the imagination of architects on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, including James Renwick Jr., who was working on St. Patrick's Cathedral. Its 330-foot spires were completed in 1888.
"The twin-towered facade differentiated it from New York's single-towered Protestant Gothic Revival churches," Edward F. Bergman wrote in "The Spiritual Traveler: New York City" (HiddenSpring, 2001). As envisioned by Archbishop John Hughes, St. Patrick's was to serve as a proud declaration of both faith and ethnic identity at a time of considerable anti-Catholic, anti-Irish sentiment in New York City.
Renwick lived to see the day in the early 1890's when St. Patrick's was on the verge of being overshadowed by office buildings. He proposed a 400-foot spire over a Lady chapel at the east end of the cathedral on Madison Avenue. A Lady chapel was eventually built, but with no spire.
Successor tower builders borrowed from the Gothic vocabulary, however. Pointed arches, finials and buttresses appeared in the Trinity and United States Realty Buildings of 1907 by Francis Hatch Kimball. These twins, not entirely identical, are massed like two monumental slices of toast, popping up over either side of Thames Street on lower Broadway.
In much the same way, the Hudson Terminal Buildings once rose along Church Street on either side of Dey Street. Designed by Clinton & Russell and completed in 1908, these twins were razed 60 years later to make way for another pair: the World Trade Center.
Between the era of the Central Park West towers and the construction of the World Trade Center, the most distinctive twins were probably 860 and 870 United Nations Plaza in 1965, designed by Harrison & Abramovitz.
These two steel-and-glass slabs, aligned along their wide axis, overlook the United Nations from across 48th Street. In many respects indistinguishable from the speculative office buildings of the same era, they illustrate the notion that even banal structures can sometimes be made more compelling by the act of multiplication.

The Synergy of Twos
There is no need to wonder what a single World Trade Center tower would have looked like. Something quite like it exists in Chicago: a square, straight, slender shaft, more than 1,000 feet tall, with strongly articulated vertical bays. Known as the Aon Center, it is nowhere near as iconic as the Sears Tower or the John Hancock Building, both of comparable height and vintage.
"One rather cynical view is that if a tower is really ugly, it's useful to have another just like it nearby," said Neil Harris, a history professor at the University of Chicago and the author of "Building Lives: Constructing Rites and Passages" (Yale University Press, 1999).
"It conventionalizes what might be seen as the extreme," Mr. Harris said. "There's something comforting about having a twin. They share values. And abnormality is lessened by the fact that there are two of them."
Twins possess a kind of energy, like the rods of a tuning fork, that seems to dissipate when the multiplication continues to three or four buildings.
They also incorporate thin air into architecture, since the void in the middle becomes integral to the design. "Two parallels that meet in the infinite" is how Ms. Agrest, an architect and a professor at Cooper Union, described the World Trade Center.
"The whole symbolic meaning of the skyscraper is displaced onto the space between them," she said.

The Latest Addition
At the AOL Time Warner Center, which straddles a 3.4-acre, two-block site between 58th and 60th Streets, the void carries an additional meaning: it is the "view corridor" over the discontinued portion of 59th Street.
This was required by guidelines under which the New York Coliseum site was awarded for development to Stephen M. Ross, Kenneth A. Himmel and William L. Mack. (Arguments are to be heard today in State Supreme Court in a lawsuit brought against the project by the Committee for Environmentally Sound Development, which contends that the building is much larger than the one contemplated by the environmental impact review four years ago.)
The design guidelines called for open space of at least 65 feet centered on 59th Street, or Central Park South. "You need two towers to create the space between them," said David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the architects of the AOL Time Warner Center.
The Columbus Circle towers will emerge from a very large base that includes stores, restaurants, Jazz at Lincoln Center, AOL Time Warner headquarters and CNN studios. The spires will be given over to condominium apartments known as 1 Central Park and a Mandarin Oriental Hotel.
No thought was given to altering the design of the towers after the Sept. 11 attack, said Mr. Ross, who dismissed out of hand the idea that his project bore any kinship to the World Trade Center towers. "It has no relevance at all," he said. "They didn't have a common base."
There are other differences, Mr. Childs noted. The Columbus Circle towers will be handed -- that is, as distinct as the left hand is from the right, more like mirror images than doppelgangers. Rather than having square floor plans, they will be parallelograms that align along their diagonal axes, which in turn will echo the angle of Broadway down below.
"They're not two candelabra standing on a plaza," Mr. Childs said.
Promotional literature for the AOL Time Warner Center refers to the "twin towers" and acknowledges the project's spiritual debt to the Century, Majestic, San Remo and El Dorado.
But Mr. Ross said the deciding factor was economic, not aesthetic. "You have twin towers because you have sites that are too big to feasibly accommodate one building," he said. "You build them because the site dictates that they be built."

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* "BRAZIL: BODY AND SOUL," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 27). The rotunda is black and half filled by an immense altar. The French architect Jean Nouvel's installation is aptly over the top, considering that the show is about a culture gloriously, self-consciously excessive. A sampler of Brazilian culture, the show divides attention between the Baroque and the modern. Physicality, spectacle, eroticism and pleasure: the cliches of Brazilian culture are all leitmotifs, in stunning objects mixing indigenous, African and European roots. These include the works of genius eccentrics like Aleijadinho, Brazil's Bernini, and Arthur Bispo do Rosario, a seaman, boxer, doorman, bodyguard, jailbird and mental patient who died in 1989 at the age of 78. He sewed banners out of bed sheets and embroidered them with long incantatory lists of places and people, including a presentation mantle he made for himself to wear before God on Judgment Day. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8, students and 65+ (Michael Kimmelman)

* "PIETER BRUEGEL THE ELDER: DRAWINGS AND PRINTS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Dec. 2). We could all do worse right now than to lose ourselves for a while in this show of drawings and prints by Bruegel, who knew a thing or two about vice and virtue. The world is anarchic and cruel and can drive all of us to despair sometimes, but good art is a realm unto itself, he tells us, and thankfully we can escape into it from time to time when we need to regain our senses. Against the narcissism of our fin-de-siecle milieu, the mysterious figure of the elder Bruegel comes as a small and fortuitous counterpoint. To judge from his pictures of the deadly vices, or his Everyman as a greedy, nearsighted merchant, or some of the nimbler drawings like "The Beekeepers," an image of lumbering, faceless figures in woven masks and bulky clothes, Bruegel doesn't come across as a compassionate artist, never mind his beloved pictures of peasants and ice skaters. Instead, his dark-humored viewpoint seems strangely moving and modern. Solace, he implies, comes only from the integrity of the artist's effort, not a bad lesson today. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

* "TOM FRIEDMAN," New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Feb. 3). A suitably diverse survey of one of the less predictable artists of the 1990's, who has made his name by transforming common objects and materials into one-of-a-kind feats of sculpture, drawing or photography. Toothpicks, toothpaste, sugar, a pencil, a dictionary and soap are among the materials subjected to Mr. Friedman's carefully plotted, meticulously executed methods. The results can be engagingly manic or meditative -- and sometimes nearly invisible, in which case the work becomes a minimally accessorized punchline. But when Mr. Friedman changes an artwork in a way that keeps the before, the after and the intervening transformation equally clear, he stops time for a few luxurious instants. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, artists, students and 65+ (Roberta Smith).

* "CASPAR DAVID FRIEDRICH: MOONWATCHERS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Nov. 11). Think of this exquisite, 19-work exhibition as a bit of fanfare played pianissimo. It heralds the arrival of "Two Men Contemplating the Moon," the museum's first painting by the supreme German painter of the Romantic era, who made nature his cathedral and placed figures before it as before an altar. Concentrating on paintings of figures transfixed by the moon, it brings out the more intimate and serene side of Friedrich's temperament. The show also includes a few paintings and drawings by his contemporaries and disciples. One result is a surprisingly vivid sketch of the artist and his circle, which offers the opportunity to get a sharper sense of his extraordinary achievement. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).

* "ALBERTO GIACOMETTI," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Jan. 8). Giacometti as the Sartre of sculpture might lead you to imagine him the right subject for troubled times. But that would be the wrong reason to see this exhibition. The right reason is that like all perceptive and eloquent art, it tells you why it is good to be alive. It investigates the pleasure of thinking and looking long and hard, which is never as simple as it sounds. The work is more varied than you may think -- sometimes black-humored, playful, sensual, even devoutly tender -- and includes plasters, painted bronzes and even a clunky stone garden sculpture, a splendid oddity, that demonstrate the material virtuosity and subtle coloration of an artist too often presumed to be pretty much just dark and heavy. Spread chronologically across two floors, compressed then open, like the art they contain, the show has as its unnecessary excuse the centenary of Giacometti's birth. We don't learn much that isn't already known, but it is a thorough, serious, very elegant exhibition, and there is nothing the matter with being reacquainted from time to time with what great art looks like. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and 65+ (Kimmelman).

RED GROOMS, "Selections From the Graphic Work," National Academy of Design Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Nov. 11). For all its ebullience, the art of Mr. Grooms as represented in this 100-piece print retrospective is curiously tedious. He produces teeming, riotously colored cartoons of metropolitan life and affectionately satiric portraits of artists from Courbet to Pollock to Chuck Berry. Many prints are made to be cut and folded into children's-book-style pop-up scenes or three-dimensional volumes, as in a boxy portrait of Gertrude Stein that looks like a parade balloon. But lacking the weird darkness of, say, James Ensor or the philosophical complexity of Saul Steinberg, Mr. Grooms's art remains psychologically if not formally one-dimensional. Hours: Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $8; $4.50, students and 65+ (Ken Johnson).

* "HIRSCHFELD'S NEW YORK," Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue, near 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672 (through Jan. 27). Few members of New York's culturati have escaped entrapment by Al Hirschfeld's line, a spare but incredibly flexible instrument that captures face and body language with far more accuracy than a camera. Following the performing arts for nearly 80 years, he did his first newspaper drawing, a head of the French actor Sacha Guitry, for The New York Herald Tribune in 1926; among his recent subjects have been Tina Brown, Jerry Seinfeld and the leading lights of the musical revival, "42nd Street." Manhattan itself and its institutions have sat for many a Hirschfeld portrait, from Harlem to Central Park to Greenwich Village. He has looked with an affectionate but beady eye at the Algonquin Round Table, the Savoy Ballroom, Trinity Churchyard, the Empire State Building, the subway at rush hour and the feeding frenzy of Upper West Side cognoscenti at Zabar's. At a time of shaken confidence, this show is more than a reminder of Mr. Hirschfeld's place in New York's cultural history: it is a welcome affirmation of its vitality as an arts and entertainment capital, and a tribute to the elan of those who continue to make it happen. Hours: Wednesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $4, students and 62+ (Grace Glueck).

* "INTO THE LIGHT: THE PROJECTED IMAGE IN AMERICAN ART 1964-1977," Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Jan. 27). Contrary to what you may think, this show isn't about the roots of today's ubiquitous video installations, although it deserves credit anyway as an act of historical rectitude, recovering pioneering examples of experimental film, video, slide projections and even holography from an era before anybody heard of Bill Viola or Sam Taylor-Wood. But the show's true goal is to demonstrate how sculpture expanded its purview partly thanks to film and video. In American art 30 or 40 years ago, projected images altered, enlarged and otherwise disturbed our sense of space and of objects in space, which after all is what we mean in one respect when we say sculpture. There are 19 works in the show. Some are prankish. Some are comical. Provocation, to the point of frustration, and a taste for the absurd are also motifs, the flip side to the spirit of optimistic experimentation. The exhibition is especially admirable for reminding us of artists overlooked by a public focused more on stars. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8, students and 62+ (Kimmelman)

* "TREASURY OF THE WORLD: JEWELED ARTS OF INDIA IN THE AGE OF THE MUGHALS," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 13). The opulent lifestyles of the emperors and kings of the Mughal age (1526-1858) are dazzlingly evoked in this pioneering exhibition. The first of its kind, it surveys the jewelry and jeweled objects with which imperial Muslims and Hindus adorned themselves, decorated their palaces and paid tribute to one another. The medium's technical and creative growth from the early 1600's to the early 1900's is traced by more than 300 works, including necklaces, bracelets, anklets, weapons, small boxes, flywhisks and even an elephant goad. Rubies, emeralds and diamonds are the main staples here, while the distinctive kundan technique of setting stones in extremely pure malleable gold gives each gem its due and each object a crisply patterned clarity that is almost architectural. The exhibition also includes inlaid hardstone, exquisite enamels and gemstones inscribed with Persian poetry. Altogether it reveals the mixing of Islamic and indigenous styles that gave Mughal art much of its special power and delivers that power at full strength. Hours and admission: See above (Smith)

* "VITAL FORMS: AMERICAN ART AND DESIGN IN THE ATOMIC AGE, 1940-1960," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 6). The use of organic forms in the visual arts exploded after World War II, drawn from the human figure and its components along with plant, teardrop, amoeboid, cellular and molecular shapes. This ambitious display of more than 250 fine art and design objects tracks the use of these "vital" forms in mediums from highbrow painting to popular consumer products. The organizers argue that the artists were expressing humanism and humane values at a time of worldwide cataclysm, but not enough is made of the role that Surrealism and its dream imagery played. Still, the exhibition does a good job in demonstrating that by the mid-1950's the hard-edged machine esthetic of the prewar years had given way to a visual language centered more on natural forms, helped along by more flexible materials. There's some enlightening and enjoyable looking here, but in the show's broad coverage some of the work -- particularly the paintings -- gets a little lost. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $6; $3 for students and 62+ (Glueck).

Galleries: Uptown

ERNEST BRIGGS, Anita Shapolsky Gallery, 152 East 65th Street, (212) 452-1094 (through Nov. 10). A second-generation member of the New York School, Briggs (1923-1984) was most impressed with the painterly rhetoric of his teacher, Clyfford Still, at the California School of Fine Arts in the early 1950's. His style (if not his titles) varied, from Still-influenced works like "Untitled" (1955), a dramatic upward rush of dense, dark treelike forms against a background of pale dawny light, to "Untitled" (1959), a wonderful farrago of black and brightly colored rivulets that leave lively pools of light as they flow in all directions. If not all that innovative, Briggs's juicy work still merits attention (Glueck).

"EXQUISITE MOMENTS: WEST LAKE AND SOUTHERN SONG ART," China Institute, 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181 (through Dec. 9). New York's big fall show of Chinese painting is installed in a very small space: two galleries at the China Institute that together could fit in a coat-check room at the Met. But square footage doesn't matter. Scale and quality do. Most of the 40 or so paintings in the show, on loan from premier American museums, are also small. Created in the form of album pages and fans, they are a one-on-one sort of art, meant to be brought out every now and then and savored, like love letters, in private. And as with love letters, the emotions conveyed are sweet, intense and sometimes deep (Holland Cotter).

* "NUMISMATICS IN THE AGE OF GROLIER," Grolier Club, 47 East 60th Street, (212) 838-6690 (through Nov. 17). A handsome show about an obscure subject: Renaissance illustrated books about ancient coins, with many of the coins and Renaissance medals they helped inspire. The illustrations, like the coins, are elegant and refined; the history offered in lengthy wall texts is a trove of obscure information. The larger fascination, for those not drawn to its elaborate scholarship, is the dialogue between media: how sculpture, in the form of these coins, influenced book illustration, which influenced sculpture, and so on. A curio: 16th-century prints of all the Roman emperors lined up in profile, with spaces left at the end, just in case, for future monarchs (Kimmelman).

GEORGIA O'KEEFFE, Gerald Peters, 24 East 78th Street, (212) 628-9760 (through Nov. 10). This modest selection of works by the legendary American painter includes a small watercolor of grapes and oranges, painted in 1904 when the artist was just 17; atmospheric abstractions in watercolor, made with deft economy in 1916; and, best, two small oils, one a picture of a single dark purple fig on pearlescent gray cloth and the other of an almost supernaturally glowing red flower in a white glass (Johnson).

FAIRFIELD PORTER, "Drawings From the Estate," Hirschl & Adler, 21 East 70th Street, (212) 535-8810 (through Nov. 10). None of the 83 drawings assembled for this well-produced show are nearly as memorable as Porter's best paintings. Sketchy and loose, they look hastily generalized rather than uniquely observant. Nevertheless, many have diaristic charm -- portraits of the artist's daughter playing guitar, for example, or views of small town streets populated by cars and trucks. Some pictures of ocean waves could be mistaken for Cy Twomblys (Johnson).

Galleries: 57th Street

* DAVID HOCKNEY AND HENRI MATISSE, "Line Drawings," Artemis Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0442 (through Nov. 10). Not a few artists of the last half-century or so owe much to the wizardly draftsmanship of Matisse, and Mr. Hockney is a pretty good example. This show tries to suggest through their works on paper -- Matisse's from 1918 to 1948; Mr. Hockney's from the 1960's and 70's -- the effect of Matisse's spare but supremely articulate line on the younger artist. At its best, Matisse's sprightly drawing is a lesson in the eloquence of brevity. Mr. Hockney's work is tighter and fussier, his line more broken, his subjects more particularized by detail. Still, as his later portraits make clear (particularly of Vera Russell in 1983), he has learned much from Matisse's willful looseness, his ability to imply by the sketchiest of suggestion elements of hair, clothes and body language. The playing off of one's work against the other's makes an intriguing exhibition (Glueck).

SOPHIA VARI, Nohra Haime, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 888-3550 (through Nov. 17). This Paris-based sculptor makes pedestal-scale bronzes in classic Cubist style but with a playful, contemporary feel. Selected planes of Ms. Vari's compacted, jumbled towers of spheres, ovoids, box shapes, pie sections and other sorts of volumes are painted in bright primary colors, which stand out against the near black sheen of the patinated bronze. The sculptures have a cheerfully decorative, slightly cartoonish appeal (Johnson).

Galleries: SoHo

TERENCE LA NOUE, David Beitzel, 102 Prince Street, (212) 219-2863 (through Nov. 10). This veteran abstract painter creates dense, colorful crazy-quilt collages of Cubist and biomorphic shapes, Expressionist gesture and quirky symbols on irregularly shaped unstretched canvases. Driven by playful hedonism and cosmic intuitions, Mr. La Noue's paintings have a richly sensuous presence, but feel, ultimately, more tastefully decorative than adventurously imaginative (Johnson).

Galleries: Chelsea

"A PRIVATE READING: THE BOOK AS IMAGE AND OBJECT," Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767 (through Nov. 10). Along with a few fancy real books, this entertaining exhibition offers all kinds of witty or poetic representations of books. Highlights include an open tome in faux-wood Formica, by Richard Artschwager; a copy of a Donald Judd catalogue raisonne in a Juddesque aluminum case, by Rodney Graham; skillful trompe l'oeil pictures of old book covers, by both Ian Everard and Steve Wolfe; and Marcel Duchamp's famous Surrealist catalog with a foam-rubber breast on a field of black velvet (Johnson).

MARK COHEN, "Trespass," Bruce Silverstein Gallery, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-3930 (through Nov. 10). Mr. Cohen zeros in on an arm, a leg, a foot, a shoulder tattoo, even a gum bubble so huge that it replaces the face of the young girl blowing it. Taken out of bodily context, these fragmentary (but uncropped) pictures often make fine street poetry. His use of strobe can lend a surreality to his shots, making light as much a part of the impact as the image itself. The head of a young boy, brightly silhouetted by light against the background of a dark street takes on a visionary aspect. Through the eloquence of Mr. Cohen's laconic lens, a town gradually reveals itself (Glueck).

ANNA GASKELL, "Resemblance," Casey Kaplan, 416 West 14th Street, (212) 645-7335 (through Nov. 10). Ms. Gaskell continues to produce the staged, dreamlike photographs of young girls engaged in mysterious, vaguely sinister activities for which she is well known. More surprising, and in some ways more imaginative, are her spidery cartoon fantasy drawings; she'd be a good illustrator for a new edition of Grimm's Fairy Tales (Johnson).

JAMES GOBEL, Kravets/Wehby, 529 West 21st Street, (212) 352-2238 (through Nov. 10). This young California-based artist makes pictures using the folk art-style technique of neatly puzzling together pieces of colored felt and yarn. He favors homoerotic pictures of big, bearded men, but an impressively complex image of an antique public fountain spurting white water with multicolored bushes and trees in the background steals this show (Johnson).

MORRIS LOUIS, Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474 (through Nov. 24). This excellent selection of canvases by the pioneering Color Field painter includes darkly glowing works from the "Veils" series; light-as-air examples of the "Unfurled" series; candy-colored stripes; and, most arresting, "Para III," which with its flowing pools of liquid red, green, orange and yellow is like a hallucinogenic light show (Johnson).

STEPHEN MUELLER AND DION JOHNSON, Bill Maynes, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 741-3318 (through Nov. 17). Glowing watery plaids, candy-colored stripes and checks and emblematic shapes that look Middle Eastern are playfully layered by Mr. Mueller in canvases both optically riveting and mystically suggestive. Mr. Johnson combines thick paint -- troweled, combed, smeared and dribbled -- schematic diagrams of machinery, furniture and architecture and neatly painted images in a child's picture book style to dreamy and sensuous effect (Johnson).

JORGE PARDO, "Pinhole Cameras," Friedrich Petzel, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 680-9467 (through Nov. 10). In a curious departure from his usual elegant and witty cliches of modern design, Mr. Pardo here presents a set of unbecoming gray crystalline sculptures that turn out to be pinhole cameras. Given a few hours of exposure, film placed inside each records a blurry black-and-white image of the gallery and its contents. It's a silly idea, but on the other hand, maybe it's a metaphor about perception and consciousness (Johnson).

* JAMES SIENA, Gorney Bravin & Lee, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 352-8372 (through Nov. 10). Mr. Siena's captivating abstract paintings look as though they were created by someone in an altered, mildly ecstatic state of consciousness. Spiraling lines, nesting boxes, complicated lattices and other patterns are executed by a patient but eccentric hand in glossy, richly colored enamels on smallish aluminum panels. The results are a combination of systematic complexity, comic style and seductive sensuality that is mesmerizing and irresistibly delightful (Johnson).

JESS VON DER AHE, Jay Grimm, 505 West 28th Street, (212) 564-7662 (through Nov. 10). This painter uses her own blood along with gold leaf to create abstracted images of waves, clouds and bubbles that call to mind Japanese screens and turn-of-the-last-century Viennese design. Under thick coats of clear, glossy resin, Ms. von der Ahe's works have a sumptuous decorative appeal that overrides any sensationalistic associations with her sanguinary medium (Johnson).

Other Galleries

* "EXPANDING ON A LEGACY: AMERICAN ART FROM THE MONTCLAIR ART MUSEUM," UBS Paine Webber Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, near 51st Street, (212) 713-2885 (through Nov. 30). In the 19th century Montclair, N.J., was a thriving art colony whose best known member was the landscapist George Inness (1825-1894), and it had high-minded citizens with cultural aspirations. A splendid result was the Montclair Art Museum, which opened in 1914 and today is one of the country's leading small museums of American art. This sampler of some 80 paintings, sculptures and American Indian art is meant to bring its treasures to a larger audience while it completes a renovation. A 1782 portrait by Gilbert Stuart; a major Inness landscape; realist canvases by John Sloan and Edward Hopper; a good slice of early Modernist work by Arthur Dove, Stuart Davis and Morgan Russell; an early Abstract Expressionist theme by Adolph Gottlieb; a group of sculptures by names like Daniel Chester Frency, Louise Nevelson, Man Ray and George Rickey, and an elegant Tlingit totem pole from the Northwest Coast make this an appetizing prelude to the feast across the river (Glueck).

"LARGER THAN LIFE," Center for Figurative Painting, 115 West 30th Street, (212) 868-3452 (through Nov. 30). The standouts in this five-artist show are two painters of opposite but equally ambitious sensibility: Leland Bell, whose large, perfectly composed figure compositions project an Apollonian love of order and clarity, and Paul Georges, a passionate hedonist whose big, recklessly vigorous painting of wild pink roses under a bright blue sky evokes a summer day to almost unbearably delightful effect (Johnson).

Last Chance

KEVIN APPEL, Marianne Boesky, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 680-9889 (through tomorrow). With a subtly ironic twist, Mr. Appel paints sleek, white-on-white pictures of a Modernist architectural heaven. On large horizontal canvases, the young Los Angeles-based artist organizes parallelograms and vertical white bands, suggesting the walls, floors and columns of some floating, ultimately purified modern interior, a Mies ghost world (Johnson).

WILLIAM BAZIOTES, Joseph Helman, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 245-2888 (through tomorrow). A charter member of the first-generation New York School, Baziotes (1912-1963) painted mysterious, amorphous beings that reflected his search for the primordial and the primitive in his own psyche. Like many of his colleagues, he was intrigued by the Surrealist use of automatic writing to plumb the unconscious. His blobby, jagged and serpentine shapes and his fine, thready lines, floating or swimming on misty, runny grounds, evoke the gods and monsters depicted in the classical sculpture that he admired. But finned and clawed creatures also swam up from his inner depths. He seems to have reached the height of his powers in work from the mid-1940's to the late 1970's, producing imagery of fluid, poetic eloquence. In this display of works on paper, Baziotes's lyrical talent makes a strong showing (Glueck).

DAISY CRADDOCK, "Two Places," Cheryl Pelavin, 13 Jay Street, TriBeCa, (212) 925-9424, (through tomorrow). In a gallery just a short walk from the ruins of the World Trade Center, it's hard not to experience Ms. Craddock's luminous land and seascapes as images of grief and consolation. There is a funereal sadness in her Impressionistic pictures of old trees draped with Spanish moss, bowing low over glassy pools of water. In the imperturbable immensity and timeless rhythm evoked by her pictures of foamy waves washing up on flat sand, one may feel a comforting Emersonian divinity (Johnson).

"EPIC PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE CUBAN REVOLUTION," Cuban Art Space, 124 West 23rd Street, (212) 242-0559 (through tomorrow). For a brief time before the Cuban Revolution turned catastrophic, it had a kind of Hollywood glamour, with troops in scruffy-chic beards and berets and the baby-faced Fidel Castro and the Byronic Che Guevara as superstar leaders. A handful of Cuban photographers, including Raul Corrales and Osvaldo Salas, were responsible for promoting that image, and some of their signature work is on view. The leading image maker, though, was Alberto Diaz Gutierrez, or Korda, who came to the job through a career in fashion photography and advertising and created the image of Che as "Heroic Guerrilla" (Cotter).

ANYA GALLACCIO, Lehmann Maupin, 35 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 965-0753 (through tomorrow). A plain of scorched black plywood, a full-size tortured bronze tree and wasp-nest clusters of bright red ceramic apples form a haunting image of nature out of balance that dominates the first New York show of this well-known young British artist. Several smaller sculptures cast from organic forms reflect a routine high-end realism; a large color photograph of the melodramatic girl-in-landscape genre is best overlooked (Smith).

* ALMA W. THOMAS, "Phantasmagoria: Major Paintings From the 1970'S," Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 247-0082 (through tomorrow). With each new showing, Thomas's paintings look fresher and livelier, their totally abstract vocabulary of color markings conveying the spirit of a vibrant inner life. As a practicing artist who lived from 1891 to 1978, she had a late start: After decades of teaching art in the public schools of Washington while doing realist still lifes on her own, she found her voice as an abstract color painter. She pared down her style from tight realist brushwork to geometric, mosaiclike dabs and patches of high-energy hues. Laid down in irregular allover patterns on solid grounds that show through in webs and networks, her late works are sophisticated color structures that still reveal a debt to the natural world. Joy may be in short supply elsewhere, but it resonates in these paintings (Glueck).

HEADLINE: Drug Issue Casts a Shadow on Trade Talks 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Boniface Chidyausiku does not remember exactly when the dispute over setting aside patents that limit cheap drug supplies grew so contentious that it began threatening to derail a new round of global trade talks set to begin next week.
 "It's been a gradual process, a gradual hardening, partly because the views remained so opposed," said Mr. Chidyausiku, Zimbabwe's delegate to the World Trade Organization and the leader of a council that has tried for months to work out a compromise. 
From his other vantage point -- his country leads a group of 38 African nations seeking more leeway under the trade group's intellectual property agreement -- Mr. Chidyausiku said: "This is quite an emotional issue for African countries. In Zimbabwe, we are losing 3,000 people a week." 
In the numerous meetings he has presided over this year, poorer countries have wrangled mainly with the United States and Switzerland, the homes of many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. Both nations argue that the existing Trips agreement -- the name is shorthand for trade-related aspects of intellectual property -- already ensures adequate supplies of drugs when there is a health crisis.
Simmering tensions started to boil over about two weeks ago, when Canada overrode the patent held by Bayer for the antibiotic Cipro and ordered the generic version from a Canadian company. The Bush administration followed with threats of taking similar action, and Bayer responded by agreeing to sell it bulk supplies at a deep discount.
"No one mentioned it formally -- that's not diplomatic," one trade delegate said. "But there was anger that there is a double standard at work here." 
Francisco Cannabrava, a trade negotiator for Brazil, said the Canadian and American moves had provoked "a lot of talk in the corridors."
Brazil has been at the center of the drug patent issue since it threatened earlier this year to set aside patent protections and buy generic versions of AIDS drugs from local makers because it said the name-brand versions cost too much, a step that drew the ire of the United States. Mr. Cannabrava said Washington's moves on Cipro "added a lot of weight to our argument."
Tempers are high in Geneva because of pressure to strike a last-minute compromise among some 30 countries in time for the trade group's biennial conference in Doha, Qatar, next week.
Last weekend, Hong Kong's delegate, Stuart Harbinson, who has been organizing documents for next week's meeting, decided to issue two papers on the issue, one spelling out each viewpoint. Unless a compromise is found, drug patents will be the only issue on the Doha agenda with "brackets" -- a choice of competing views. The last attempt to start a new trade round, in Seattle, collapsed amid a welter of brackets indicating numerous disagreements, and the trade group has tried to avoid them at Doha.
The American-backed version acknowledges a right "to take measures necessary to address these public health crises, in particular to secure affordable access to medicines," but it insists that the Trips agreement takes precedence. The version backed by developing countries reverses the priority, saying that "nothing in the Trips agreement shall prevent members from taking measures to protect public health."
Developing nations have repeatedly assailed the pharmaceutical industry for charging too much, while industrialized nations have accused generic drug makers in Brazil and India of cashing in unfairly on other companies' research.
American delegates here have said that the developing countries' proposed language would eviscerate patent protection. For sub-Saharan African countries hit hard by AIDS and other diseases, the United States has offered instead to extend by 10 years the deadline for them to comply with the Trips agreement.
"This isn't about Africa," said Mark E. Grayson, a spokesman for a trade group for big American drug companies. "The issue has been hijacked by India, Brazil and Egypt to further their own economic agendas." 
As Federico Cuello Camilo of the Dominican Republic emerged from one of the trade body's final meetings before Doha, he said, speaking of drug patents, that among the outstanding issues, "probably the deal breaker is going to be that one."

HEADLINE: For the First Time Since Ike, a Whiff of U.S. Deflation 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
DEFLATION. To a generation raised to fear inflation, the opposite -- prices falling across the economy -- has a certain attraction. Paying less must be good.
 There is a catch, of course. Your costs are someone else's income. And when income is falling it creates all kinds of problems for the economy and makes it harder for monetary policy to stimulate growth. Prices fell during the Depression, and they are falling now in Japan. Neither provides a model that anyone wants to emulate. 
 And now one measure shows deflation is here.
The government's quarterly growth report, which showed that the economy shrank in the third quarter, reported a decline of 0.4 percent, at an annual rate, in prices for personal consumption expenditures. It was the first quarterly fall in nearly half a century, since the second quarter of 1954, at the end of a recession. 
The number is calculated in a more sophisticated way than the more widely followed consumer price index, and it is a figure that the Federal Reserve watches. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan prefers the core figure for personal consumption expenditures, which excludes food and energy. It is still barely positive, at 0.3 percent.
To be sure, part of the collapse in inflation reflects recession-induced price cutting, which is normal. But there have been seven recessions since 1954, none of which brought deflation.
What is new here is that deflation is spreading from the industrial world to consumers. The Commodity Research Bureau index of raw industrial prices peaked in 1995 and now is at a 15-year low, off 16 percent this year and 40 percent from its high. Yesterday's report from the National Association of Purchasing Management showed the pricing power of manufacturing companies is at its lowest level since 1949.
There are winners from deflation. The fall in gasoline prices amounts to a tax cut, which the economy can certainly use. But as the Japanese experience shows, enduring deflation can lead to a big drop in consumption, as consumers conclude that prices will only get cheaper. Cutting wages is very hard to do, so corporate profits get squeezed, leading to more layoffs and more drops in consumer purchases, which lead to more layoffs and on and on.
The classic way to fight such a weakening economy is by easing monetary policy. But to be stimulative, the Fed needs to get short-term interest rates below the inflation rate. "The liquidity trap in economic theory arrives if the inflation rate falls below zero," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company. "You run out of bullets before the inflation rate hits zero."
Lower interest rates this year have kept the housing and auto sectors from collapsing, as they usually do early in economic downturns. But housing has started to weaken. "It now appears that a downward path of housing prices will accentuate the negative wealth effect from the stock market's decline," said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.
A decade ago, Japan's central bank was slow to loosen credit after its bubble burst. There is no way to prove its reticence was the cause of Japan's malaise, but it did not help. It is a precedent that Mr. Greenspan surely recalls.
The whiff of deflation is just one more reason that rates need to fall further. When the Fed meets next week, anything smaller than a half-point cut in the Federal funds rate, now 2.5 percent, would send the wrong signal. Another cut in December will probably be wise as well.

HEADLINE: Cantor Survivors on a Mission; 
Rebuilding the Firm, and Remembering Those Lost

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Almost every day, Chris Crosby turns in his chair at Cantor Fitzgerald's technical center in Rochelle Park, N.J., to ask his buddy for help -- for one sweet instant forgetting his friend is dead.
 Philip Marber, a Cantor division president in Manhattan, still wakes up at 3 most mornings, worrying about how to turn his new stock trading desk into the "well-oiled machine" he once ran. 
 John Law, one of a handful of surviving Cantor stock traders, now works with 50 newly hired employees on a trading desk unlike any he's known before. The raucous, knowing banter he once shared with his lost friends is gone, replaced by the slightly formal ceremony of well-meaning people who do not yet use each others' nicknames or know each others' pet peeves.
These men are among the roughly 340 surviving employees in Cantor's New York headquarters, working together on an almost unimaginable task -- saving a business in which three colleagues out of every four, around 660 people, died in the attacks on the World Trade Center. In a world that thrived on a smooth, familiar routine, every aspect of the workday environment is strange, and much harder. 
Office space, new equipment, telephone and computer links, market data and even basic office supplies had to be conjured out of the chaos so the firm could reopen with the national markets. Veterans took on new jobs -- from the Dallas trader who now reads market tidbits over the squawk-box to his New York colleagues because they do not yet have a full news service, to the public relations executives who helped build the firm's memorial Web site.
In this struggle, Cantor's survivors -- the firm now employs roughly 1,450 people, about 350 of them in the New York area -- have become what Mr. Crosby called a band of brothers. People who had once been, at most, a face in the cafeteria quickly became foxhole friends. Help has come from unexpected quarters, like the administrator who left the firm six months ago and has now returned to help organize its equity operations.
In the process, the survivors have found unsuspected strengths and a shared sense of altruism that has produced an added mission: to deliver on the firm's promise to contribute 25 percent of its profits over the next five years to the Cantor families who lost loved ones.
The impulse to rebuild came naturally to Cantor's surviving executives, Mr. Marber said. Surviving partners in New York had a substantial investment in the firm, and partners and employees working in branch offices around the country and in London "needed a place to make a living," he said.
It may well be an uphill battle. However loyal and sympathetic, longtime customers will stay with Cantor only if the badly bruised firm can deliver the service they demand. Rivals are trying to capitalize on any sign of disarray or confusion at the firm, as a weak economy shrinks the pie for everyone.
Indeed, even before Sept. 11, Cantor was in flux. Its traditional business -- handling government bond trades for giant institutional investors wary of revealing their trades to one another -- was giving way to modern electronic trading systems, including its own eSpeed operation. Its stock-trading business was booming, but its bond traders faced an uncertain future. Layoffs had left the usual scars, a residual uneasiness in some departments; resumes were circulating and resentments were brewing.
Then came the terrorist attacks, which doomed all Cantor employees working on four floors near the top of the World Trade Center's north tower. Overnight, the magnitude of Cantor's losses transformed the firm from an obscure specialty trader to a national symbol of the awesome human and business devastation caused by the attacks.
For Mr. Law, now working in a makeshift trading room in a Park Avenue building, each day is a new reminder of "how good I had it before." In the world of "before," where everything he needed was at his fingertips, he had time to read the papers and check the news wires, to tease his colleagues, to nurture about two dozen clients. Now, he has many more client accounts, the jokes have vanished, and none of his tools are where he expects them to be. And almost every person around him is an unknown quantity.
"It's a scramble every morning," he said. "I just keep repeating two little words: 'It's temporary.' Each day, the pain doesn't hurt so much. Every day we get a little better organized."
Mr. Crosby, one of a handful of technology staff members to survive, has found work to be the best treatment for a pain that prompts him to refer to his lost colleagues, once known as the guys, as gentlemen. Since about 3 a.m. on the day after the attacks, Mr. Crosby has poured himself into his job, a job that now requires him to shuttle between computer centers in Weehawken and Rochelle Park.
"I used to be managing the development of our large-scale databases," he said. "Now? Oh, I've got a whole bag of tricks." He has taken on projects that lost colleagues left behind.
Work has been "helpful and therapeutic," said James Talvy, a young technical architect at the firm, and it has also forged new bonds.
"We group together more," he added. "We're all trying as a group to rebuild this business -- not only for the sake of keeping busy, but to rebuild it for those who were left."
As at many financial firms displaced from Lower Manhattan, Cantor executives are struggling to coordinate a business that is scattered across Manhattan, New Jersey and Connecticut. Although executives say a new office home will eventually pull the firm together again, for now the surviving employees work alongside newly hired traders in Manhattan and unfamiliar sales and technology colleagues in Darien, Conn., and Rochelle Park and Weehawken.
"The first day here we didn't even have pens," sighed Heidi Olson, the chief administrative officer in the equities division, as she sat outside one of the firm's temporary Park Avenue trading rooms.
Ms. Olson left Cantor last April, after more than five years in corporate development. But after the disaster -- "I could not believe my friends were on fire," she said with a shudder -- she called and volunteered to help. Chores were handed to her, and then more chores.
Bank accounts had to be opened for Cantor's new relief fund. Supplies had to be ordered for the temporary trading room. Computers and phones had to be installed. Someone had to buy the machines that stamp the time and date on each order. There were no job descriptions -- just jobs, many of them utterly unfamiliar to Ms. Olson.
"Everything we ever took for granted was gone," Ms. Olson said. "So I just did whatever had to be done. It is like being a mom -- in that spiritual sense of doing whatever is needed for the good of the family."
Throughout the firm she senses a greater patience, a quiet pride in enduring the daily inconveniences of having "absolutely no routine at all."
At the beginning, there were moments when things fell apart. "People had breakdowns, people fainted," Ms. Olson said. "You sobbed, and then you got on with it."
But she still doesn't sleep very well, she said. "The ghosts come to get you at night. There's so much to think about: what you miss and all that needs to be done here."
She finds considerable comfort at work, she says. "This was a tribal event -- something happened to our tribe. And it helps to be here with people who feel the same pain."
But for Scott Wall, one of the few surviving Cantor bond traders, about the only thing in his work life that is unchanged is Cantor's name on his business card. He once traded corporate bonds in Manhattan, surrounded by people he'd known for almost a decade. He now sells convertible bonds from an office in Darien, among people he had barely met before Sept. 11.
"I remember hearing the president say that we should all go back to work, and thinking that I didn't have any work to go back to," Mr. Wall said. "I'm 38. I just hope it's not too late to make a change."
Cantor's chairman, Howard Lutnick, has also found his workday much changed. Once known for his combative arm-wrestling in a competitive business, Mr. Lutnick was suddenly surrounded by hundreds of grieving families who needed gentle handling. He took a self-taught crash course in the politics of philanthropy, meeting with the head of the American Red Cross to argue successfully for immediate cash assistance for families who lost breadwinners in the attacks.
Mr. Lutnick lost his only brother, Gary, in the attacks. His grief and shock were apparent right after the disaster in a spate of tearful media interviews. But in recent weeks, after public criticism from some victims' relatives, Mr. Lutnick has pulled out of the spotlight, refusing interviews and spending time talking quietly with families at a series of informational gatherings Cantor has held around New York City.
Mr. Marber was stranded at a golf resort in Ohio when the attack occurred. Otherwise, he almost certainly would have perished along with 130 others on the stock trading desk he ran. Isolated in his hotel room, he coped with his hopeless, impotent grief by making lists of what the firm would need to reopen.
When he got back to New York on Sept. 13, after a 12-hour van trip, he slept for a few hours and went to work. By Sept. 17, when the stock markets reopened, his jury-rigged trading team was ready.
The trading line held, and the work was done. But it is not like any trading desk he's ever run, Mr. Marber said. The easy laughter, the teasing banter that lubricated the tension, is gone.
"We had such a well-oiled machine," he said, with a tone of almost palpable longing. "Everything was in its place and everything worked, and if it didn't, we got it fixed in five minutes and got back to work. I want that back."
The only way to get it back is to build it again, he said. He is hopeful -- he expects the firm to hold its own for the rest of this year and be ready to grow again next year.
Peter DaPuzzo, a Wall Street veteran who is a senior Cantor partner, has attended 32 funerals, and his wife has been to 18 more. Seeing the young widows and solemn toddlers breaks his heart, he said.
The whole firm is wrestling with survivor guilt, by Mr. DaPuzzo's account. He wonders aloud whether, if he'd been a less persuasive recruiter, many of his lost employees would still be alive.
An optimist by nature, Mr. DaPuzzo says he can usually now make it through an entire day at Cantor's Darien office without tears. "You have to have strength for the others," he said.
But sometimes, he said, "I stumble. A friend came in to see me from Seattle -- someone who hadn't heard it all yet. He came in, we hugged, and we cried."

HEADLINE: More Gloomy Economic News as Consumer Spending Slumps 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Manufacturing last month turned in its worst performance since the 1990-1991 recession after consumer spending showed the biggest drop in almost 15 years, an industry report showed today.
 The National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index fell to 39.8 in October from 47 in September. The October reading was the lowest since February 1991, and the index shows the slump in manufacturing is 15 months old. New orders and production sank, making a recovery unlikely this year. 
 In a separate report, consumer spending fell 1.8 percent in September, the Commerce Department said. The drop occurred as the terrorist attacks kept Americans away from malls, restaurants and airports. The attacks also hurt orders for factory goods.
Manufacturing "is indeed in a deep, prolonged slump," said Steven Wood, chief economist at FinancialOxygen Inc. in Walnut Creek, Calif. "There is little prospect for an imminent turnaround."
The number of workers continuing to collect unemployment benefits rose to 3.69 million in the third week of October, the most in more than 18 years, the Labor Department reported. The number of people filing initial claims for benefits fell by 10,000 last week, to 499,000, still the third-highest weekly total this year.
The Commerce Department also reported that construction spending declined 0.4 percent in September, the fifth consecutive monthly drop. The decline brought spending to $843.1 billion at an annual rate, the slowest this year. Spending fell 1.2 percent in August. The string of declines is also the longest since the period of August 1990 to January 1991, during the last recession.
Analysts had expected a reading of 44.5 in the purchasing managers' index. The drop in consumer spending, after a rise of 0.3 percent in August, was larger than expected and the sharpest since January 1987, when blizzards kept shoppers at home. Growth in personal incomes, which rose less than 0.1 percent in September after a gain of 0.1 percent in August, was the weakest since incomes fell 3.9 percent in January 1994.
The purchasing managers' new-orders component, which accounts for 30 percent of the index, fell to 38.3 in October from 50.3 in September. The drop was the largest since the orders index fell 14.1 points in December 1980.
The production index, a gauge of current work being performed, fell to 40.9 last month from 51.3. The drop is the largest since the index fell 20.7 points in January 1984.
Manufacturers say they are also being hampered by the strength of the dollar and tougher lending standards at banks.
The National Association of Manufacturers called on Federal Reserve policy makers to lower the benchmark overnight bank lending rate half a percentage point, to 2 percent, when they meet on Tuesday. Central bankers have reduced the target rate four percentage points since the start of the year to prevent manufacturing and the rest of the economy from slumping into recession.
The rate is now the lowest in four decades. Investors are expecting a quarter-point cut next week and another quarter-point decrease by the end of the year, based on trading in federal funds futures contracts.
The factory report today showed little threat from inflation, making it easier for the Fed to lower rates. The index of prices paid for raw materials fell to 32.5 in October, the lowest in more than 50 years, from 36.3 the previous month.

HEADLINE: Fed by Low Rates, Refinancing Surge Is Helping Economy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Home mortgage rates have fallen sharply in recent weeks to the lowest levels in several years and are expected to drop further this month to rates not seen since the 1960's.
 Americans are taking advantage of the opportunity by refinancing their mortgages in record numbers. Since Sept. 11, about one million people have applied to refinance their home loans, roughly six times as many as did during the comparable period last year. 
 Average 30-year mortgage rates fell to about 6.5 percent at the beginning of this week, from a high of 8.7 percent last year. The Treasury Department's announcement on Wednesday that it would stop selling 30-year bonds should create additional demand for long-term bonds and send the interest rates on these issues lower, pushing down the long-term rates on home loans, if only slightly, economists said. Rates will probably remain low for at least the next few months, they add, because of the continued weakness of the global economy. 
The surge in refinancings -- effectively giving extra cash to families by lowering their monthly house payments -- is providing important support to an economy that is struggling in nearly every other way. The typical family that has refinanced in the last month has lowered its monthly payments by $150 to $200, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
Though that additional money makes it easier for consumers to pay their bills and perhaps even save some, it may stimulate the economy less than it has in the past. Because many people are worried about layoffs and recent declines in stock prices, fewer are freeing up money to remodel their homes or buy other goods, economists said. Instead, more are shoring up their own finances by paying credit card bills and other loans with high interest rates.
"There's clearly a shift toward a little more conservatism," said Douglas Duncan, the chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
That conservative shift is complicating the Federal Reserve's attempt to encourage consumer spending by lowering short-term interest rates, which affect mortgage rates. Similarly, Americans saved about 80 percent of the tax rebates sent out this summer.
The slowdown in consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the country's output, has helped halt a 10-year economic boom, the longest in recorded United States history. In the third quarter of this year, the economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.4 percent, after adjusting for inflation, the government said this week.
Even as people are postponing many other financial decisions because of widespread uncertainty, they are overwhelming banks with requests to refinance their mortgages. Of the million or so people who have applied to refinance their mortgages since Sept. 11, about two-thirds have already done so or will soon.
"We are in the biggest month of the biggest quarter of the biggest year in the history of the mortgage industry," Thomas M. Garvey, an executive vice president in the mortgage division of J. P. Morgan Chase, said at the end of October. "Every mortgage production shop in the industry is bursting at the seams."
Many people calling banks have had to wait an unusually long time before speaking to an employee. Countrywide Home Loans, one of the nation's largest home lenders, plans to double the size of its sales force, to 2,400 people, over the next 15 months, in part because of the heavy demand, said Brian Hale, an executive vice president at Countrywide.
Interest rates have fallen this year as the Federal Reserve has cut its target for short-term interest rates nine times and as lending demand has slowed with the economy. But longer-term rates, including those on many mortgages, have not dropped as much as short-term rates, partly because bond investors feared earlier this year that the Fed's aggressive rate cuts would lead to a rise in inflation, eroding investment returns. Some investors are also concerned that federal budget deficits could return.
The Treasury Department's decision to stop selling 30-year bonds could help push longer-term rates lower for reasons that have less to do with the economy than with the mechanics of the bond market. With no new 30-year bonds, more investors who want to own long-term bonds backed by the government will buy the Treasury's 10-year note, which influences the interest rates on home mortgages. The added demand will push the price of the 10-year bond higher, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, lower. With the 10-year rate and related rates falling, mortgage rates will fall, too.
Although most economists expect the Treasury's decision to have a relatively small effect, they say mortgage rates will remain near their current levels, or decline slightly, during the rest of the year. "There is no sign of mortgage rates shooting up because there is no sign of economic recovery," said Greg McBride, a Bankrate.com analyst.
The fees that banks charge and the payment schedules they require vary widely, but analysts say that refinancing a mortgage often makes sense when rates are are at least one-and-a-half or two percentage points -- or sometimes lower -- below a person's existing loan. That means many people who took out a new mortgage only 18 months ago may benefit by refinancing now.
People who expect to move soon generally should not refinance their loans, since it may take many months to recoup the associated costs. 
During the 1990's, when home prices were rising steadily and consumers were confident, many families who refinanced their home loans took cash out at the closing, either by increasing the size of their mortgage or by taking out some of the equity that had risen with home prices. Much of the cash was spent on second homes, cars, kitchen appliances and other expensive items, providing an economic boost. In recent months, though, the percentage of people doing so has declined, said Mr. Duncan, of the bankers' association.
These cash-out refinancings, as they are known in the industry, have declined since Sept. 11, said three of the five biggest mortgage banks. The other two said they had noticed no change.
Because home prices are no longer rising steadily in some parts of the country, people find it harder remove equity from their homes, said Joe Rogers, a national sales manager at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.
Mr. Duncan estimates people will take out enough money in their refinancings to increase consumer spending by $50 billion this year, boosting the nation's economic growth by half a percentage point. But more than two-thirds of that infusion can be attributed to refinancings before Sept. 11, when far fewer people were applying for new loans but a greater share were taking cash out, he added.
Bob Munson, who lives in a suburb of Cleveland, is taking out a new loan in an effort to be more conservative with his money. Mr. Munson, 48, works at a small computer company that he and his partners recently sold, and he plans to leave the company soon and begin a second career as a teacher.
With the economic future uncertain, and interest rates low, he decided to refinance his loan. Rather than lower his monthly payments, though, he shortened the term of his loan, putting him and his wife in better financial condition once they reach their 60's.
"The economy started pushing me down this thought process," Mr. Munson said. "Sept. 11 just confirmed it."

Mortgage Rates Decline, Igniting a Refinancing Wave
Home mortgage rates have fallen sharply in recent weeks to the lowest levels in several years and are expected to drop further this month to rates not seen since the 1960's.
 Americans are taking advantage of the opportunity by refinancing their mortgages in record numbers. Since Sept. 11, about one million people have applied to refinance their home loans, six times as many as did during the comparable period last year. Page A1. 

Rivera to Leave CNBC for Fox News
Geraldo Rivera will leave his top-rated talk show on the business news cable channel CNBC to join the Fox News Channel as a war correspondent, he said. The move will touch off a shift at CNBC away from talk shows in the prime-time hours and toward more of the business-related programming that it carries during the day. It will also give Fox News a foreign correspondent with higher name recognition than anyone else at that network. C3.

Auto Sales Set a Monthly Record
Sales of cars and trucks in the United States soared to the highest monthly level ever in October, automakers reported, but they were spurred by deep discounts that foreshadow trouble in the months ahead. C2.

PERSON: Dr. Jeffrey M. Isner 

HEADLINE: Dr. Jeffrey Isner, 53, Creator Of Cardiovascular Procedure 

BYLINE:  By ERIC NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Dr. Jeffrey M. Isner, who wedded gene therapy and cardiovascular medicine to create promising treatments for heart and circulatory disease, died on Wednesday at his home in Weston, Mass., near Boston. He was 53.
 The cause was a heart attack, said St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston, where he had worked for two decades. 
 Dr. Isner, who also taught at Tufts University, was an interventional cardiologist, a member of a relatively new medical field whose practitioners try to remove arterial obstructions to restore the flow of blood to the heart. He also treated patients who had blocked blood vessels in the legs, a painful, disabling and potentially fatal condition that can require amputation.
Interventional cardiologists are accustomed to thinking small. They typically do their work through angioplasty, a procedure in which a miniature balloon is threaded into a coronary or other artery and then inflated to clear away a blockage. Often the procedure entails inserting a tiny metal tube, called a stent, into the artery after inflation in an effort to prevent the blockage's recurrence.
But a decade or so ago, Dr. Isner began thinking much smaller still. That was when other researchers discovered a protein they called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF (pronounced VEJ-eff), which signals the body that it is time to grow new blood vessels. Could the substance, he wondered, be used to induce patients to grow new vessels that would bypass a blockage?
In 1994, Dr. Isner put the idea to the test, becoming the first to use genes to treat people with vascular disease. In the very first case, to treat a leg blockage, his team of surgeons coated an angioplasty balloon with trillions of genes that produce VEGF and then threaded it several times to a site near the patient's blockage.
The procedure came to be called angiogenesis, and while it remains experimental, preliminary studies have been promising, indicating that it may indeed help people who have vascular disease of the leg or who are suffering from angina, chest pain that results from coronary blockage.
Still, experts say, many questions remain before gene therapy can become standard treatment for vascular disease.
"The results were promising," said Dr. Valentin Fuster, director of cardiovascular medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, who was a friend of Dr. Isner. "The thing that he was trying to answer was for how long this increased flow would last. He didn't have the answer for that."
Jeffrey Michael Isner was born on Dec. 11, 1947, in Uhrichsville, Ohio, the son of Justin and Lilli Isner. He earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Maryland and his medical degree at Tufts.
In a 1997 interview, he attributed some of his early successes to simple good fortune.
"When we began our study," he said, "we had no idea what dose of gene therapy was going to work, or if the way we were injecting the genes was appropriate, of if the sites we were injecting were really appropriate."
Those successes also placed him in the middle of the debate over whether the increased blurring of industry and medical research raised ethical questions for doctors. Like a growing number of physicians, Dr. Isner was involved not only in medicine but also in business, as founder of Vascular Genetics and a major stockholder in the company, which is based in North Carolina.
Some critics have raised questions about whether such relationships can affect a doctor's medical judgment, but Dr. Isner rejected those suggestions.
"I'm not trying to dismiss this out of hand," he once said, "but I'm not going to be a wimp and roll over because someone is projecting a concern. I understand what the arguments are, but frankly I don't agree with most of them."
Last year the Food and Drug Administration temporarily suspended research by Dr. Isner, Vascular Genetics and St. Elizabeth's, criticizing the researchers on grounds that they had failed to report properly the death of two patients participating in a study and might have endangered the health of another. That suspension followed the much-publicized death of an 18-year-old man in an unrelated University of Pennsylvania gene therapy experiment.
Dr. Isner said the two patients had died of their underlying cardiovascular condition, not the treatment. But his company acknowledged administrative problems with the research and promised to correct them. Last spring he was permitted to resume his studies, and he recently received a $10 million grant from federal health officials.
He is survived by his wife, Linda Hajjar Isner, and three children: Joshua, Jessica and Matthew, all of Weston.

HEADLINE: State Budgets Facing a Fall In Revenues 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Even before accounting for the fiscal devastation caused by the Sept. 11 attacks, state governments were facing the deepest budget shortfalls in at least a decade, according to a survey released today by the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
 As governors and lawmakers prepare to cut billions of dollars in spending, they are girding for more bad news in coming weeks as the first reports on tax collections after Sept. 11 arrive. Complicating the uncertainty in some states is the need to spend substantial sums on public safety and counterterrorism efforts without knowing how much will be reimbursed by Congress. 
 "I think every state thinks it's going to be severe," said Gov. Jane Dee Hull of Arizona, a Republican who has called a special legislative session this month to address a projected $1.6 billion shortfall in her state's $15 billion budget for 2002 and 2003. "People just aren't moving around and they're not buying, and those are sales-tax issues," Ms. Hull said. "And the layoffs that are occurring in every state will hurt income taxes." 
The National Conference of State Legislatures found that state revenue growth had slowed substantially, with 44 states reporting that collections had dropped below forecasts made only four months ago. Nineteen states were spending more than they had budgeted, with Medicaid the primary expense, and seven other states predicted that overspending was likely. At least 28 states are imposing or considering budget cuts, and many are turning to reserve funds that were fattened during the economic expansion.
"The last time states were in this kind of situation was in the early 1990's," said Corina L. Eckl, the group's fiscal programs director. "The concern now is that there is this added uncertainty from the economic impact of the terrorism attacks. And that unknown is causing considerable anxiety among lawmakers."
Steve Peace, a San Diego Democrat who is chairman of the California Senate's budget committee, predicted that the shortfall in his state's $80 billion general-fund budget, which was forecast at $8 billion before Sept. 11, would now grow to at least $12 billion.
Because more than half of California's general fund is spent on education, lawmakers will face the prospect of making deep cuts in aid to schools in an election year, Mr. Peace said. "There's no way to do it without touching schools," he said. "It's a total, absolute impossibility."
On Wednesday, the federal government announced that the gross domestic product contracted in the third quarter at an annual rate of 0.4 percent, the first such decline in eight years. A recession is traditionally defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction, and few economists question that the country is headed in that direction.
The report by the National Conference of State Legislatures said state fiscal problems began to emerge late last year when collections of sales and income taxes slowed and failed to meet projections. Governors and legislatures took account of the decline and passed budgets that called for average revenue growth of 2.3 percent in the 2002 fiscal year, which began in most states on July 1. That was half of the actual revenue growth of 4.5 percent in 2001.
But as revenue data for July, August and September came in, states realized that their forecasts for even modest revenue growth were far too optimistic, the group found.
"Across the nation, forecasters are reporting declines in most major tax sources, especially the sales and use tax and personal and corporate income taxes," the report says. "In some states, the drops are significant."
Because there is typically a lag of about six weeks in the reporting of sales tax collections, the economic effect of Sept. 11 on state budgets is only now being measured. In Mississippi, for instance, state officials disclosed on Wednesday that tax collections for October fell below estimates by $22.1 million, or 7 percent. 
Here in Georgia, Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, has asked his agency heads to outline possible cuts of 2.5 percent in their budgets this year and of 5 percent for next year. Those amounts, Mr. Barnes said, should buffer the state from the impact of the economic downturn and the aftermath of Sept. 11.
The terrorist attacks, he said, "did not cause the recession, but it quickened it and it may have deepened it." he added, "The problem is we don't know what the future holds."

HEADLINE: City Offering Work for Some On Welfare 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration is quietly offering thousands of city jobs paying more than $9 an hour to welfare recipients who are reaching their five-year limit on federal cash assistance just as the city's economy sinks into recession.
 The workers' hourly wages -- well above minimum wage -- are to be paid out of New York State's $1.5 billion annual welfare windfall, money allocated by the federal government at the same level since 1995, but unspent because the welfare rolls have shrunk by almost half, state officials said. Many of the jobs are as seasonal laborers in the city's Parks Department, where city and union officials said they were prepared to absorb as many workers as the city's Human Resources Administration sends. 
 As 32,800 New York City families confront their five-year federal welfare limit on Dec. 2, more than 3,000 additional recipients who faced the same deadline are already working in the parks, officials from the parks workers' union said. 
Job offers apparently have been made to many of the thousands of recipients called in by the Human Resources Administration in the past month. 
"I can confirm that they are offering those jobs for the families that are coming up against those time limits," said John B. Madden, a spokesman for the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance. "The state is very supportive of the city's efforts. But who and how many are getting the job offers -- that's really up to H.R.A." He added, "I can't give you the numbers because I don't have the numbers."
Neither the Human Resources Administration nor the mayor's office returned calls seeking information about the program. Lawyers who have won federal court injunctions against some of the city's recent welfare practices said they had been frustrated in efforts to learn details of the job offers and conditions presented to recipients.
But Mark Rosenthal, president of the union local that represents seasonal parks workers, said 3,100 former welfare recipients are already in jobs that last 11 months and 2 weeks and can be renewed. They are doing work like cleaning parks and supervising playgrounds, he said, and most began in March in a test of the project. At least 1,000 more new hires are expected over the next four weeks.
"As many as they send, we'll take," he said. "We could have 10,000 very easy." He added, "You can have 20,000 in the park -- we had that in the W.P.A.," referring to a public works program of the New Deal.
Under state law, recipients who run out their federal welfare clock are still eligible to apply for a state aid program known as Safety Net Assistance, financed without federal money. But any able-bodied person who refuses a specific job without good cause is to be denied that aid.
The financial advantages to the city are evident. After Dec. 2, aid to the 32,800 city recipients who run out the federal welfare clock would have to come from the state and city treasuries, rather than from the federal welfare block grant created when welfare legislation was overhauled in 1996. And at a time when city agencies are facing steep budget cuts and a hiring freeze, a corps of temporary, federally-subsidized workers could take up the slack.
But the federal grant is up for reauthorization next September, and the surplus could melt away if Congress reduces the grant, or if the welfare rolls climb in a recession, cautioned Douglas Turetsky, spokesman for the city's Independent Budget Office.
Most of the 32,800 who face the December deadline are single mothers. Some may not be suitable for available jobs because of health problems, or because of family responsibilities like caring for a disabled relative, Mr. Madden said. About 11,000 are working already, but earn so little that they still qualify for public assistance. Many others have worked at so-called workfare assignments -- often in city parks -- in exchange for their welfare checks. 
"We're delighted that they're coming back with paychecks," said Mr. Rosenthal, whose union local successfully sued the city to get full pay for workfare recipients doing the same jobs as city parks workers. He noted that the new jobs were even better paid than those in a transitional jobs bill vetoed by the mayor. 
In a city office on Schermerhorn Street in Brooklyn, where many of the recipients have been summoned since Oct. 1, three women emerging from interviews this week had absorbed different, even contradictory, information about their options, and showed widely divergent reactions.
Nancy Flores was near tears over the pressure to take a full-time job. "Sick child, autistic child," she said in broken English, gesturing at her 7-year-old daughter, and then turning to her 10-year-old, Erica, to translate. "They want her to leave the welfare and go to work," Erica said, tugging at one of her tightly braided pigtails. No one mentioned safety net assistance, they said.
In the same waiting room, Tanya Jolly was overjoyed to be offered a job in a park near her home in the Bronx paying $9.38 an hour. Ms. Jolly, a mother of three, said she had spent two years working at clerical tasks in exchange for a meager welfare check and had come in expecting to be cut off without a dime. 
"This is forever." she exulted, waving the sheet of instructions like a flag. "This depends solely on you."
A friend, Tawana McMillan, who also has three children, looked on with envy. She, too, is still on welfare, though she has been working for the last year and a half for a Nordstrom department store in White Plains. On Oct. 1 she was laid off, and so far has been unable to restore full public assistance or get unemployment benefits.
"I want them to call me in for one of those city jobs," she said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE POSTAL SERVICE; 
Mail Delays Are Minimal, Despite Anthrax Problems

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: DENVER, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Postal authorities across the country said today that the mail was moving reasonably well, despite the discoveries of anthrax at mail centers in Washington, New York City, Maryland, New Jersey, Indianapolis and Kansas City, Mo. 
 "The lag time for us is minimal now," said Judy Winiarz, a postal spokeswoman in Chicago. "You're going to have that lag time in between cities that have a scare and us. But as a whole, across the country, we are processing the mail at the same pace. I don't think you are going to see an overall slowdown, just pockets of mail that are slower." 
 One pocket is Boulder, Colo., where the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association receive as much as half of their daily mail from Washington.
But since last Friday, no one at either federal agency is receiving anything. Because some of the in-coming mail passes through postal centers outside Washington where the authorities have found evidence of anthrax, the mailroom serving the two agencies was shut down to be cleaned, and the four mailroom workers have begun taking antibiotics as a precaution.
The Postal Service said today that 230 post offices nationwide would be tested for anthrax in the weeks ahead, about 200 for precautionary reasons and the others because they have been associated with contaminated mail or illnesses. Azeezaly S. Jaffer, a spokesman for the service, said that 64 had been tested so far, that 39 were free of problems and that 8 had areas of contamination and had been closed for "remediation." Test results from 17 have not come back.
Mr. Jaffer also said that all post offices were changing the way they cleaned sorting machines to use vacuum devices instead of forced air and that all of the Postal Service's 800,000 employees were being offered flu shots at no cost.
These efforts and others appear to be having a laudable effect, even in states like New Jersey, where two postal installations, in Hamilton and Princeton, have been contaminated.
Jim Stanley, a spokesman for the Postal Service in New Jersey, said the on-time delivery in the central part of the state had reached about 80 percent, compared with about 90 percent in normal times. But Mr. Stanley added that areas in the southern part of the state were suffering a major disruption because of the decision to close the mail-sorting plant in Bellmawr, near Camden. That plant serves 159 post offices, moves four million pieces of mail daily and serves 1.1 million sites in southern New Jersey.
In New York City, Tom Gaynor, a postal spokesman, said mail was moving at almost the usual pace, even though some neighborhoods were having delays of a day or two in delivery when post offices were closed because of hoaxes.
"We're moving the mail," Mr. Gaynor said. "Some of it may be slower than usual, where some offices have been evacuated for a few hours or for a day."
The Postal Service announced that tests showed anthrax on two more mail-sorting machines at the Morgan Station sorting center in Manhattan, raising the total to six contaminated machines. Postal authorities also said the machines had been shut down and would be cleaned.
And in Sunnyside, Queens, the post office was evacuated on Wednesday after a person received a phone bill with brown smears on the envelope. Tests showed that the substance was not anthrax.
In Washington, mail service was approaching normal today after three post offices that had been closed were reopened on Wednesday. "We're pretty close to 100 percent normal service," said Deborah Yackley, a spokeswoman for the capital area postal service.
Elsewhere, too, mail delivery was returning to the mundane exercise it was before the first of the anthrax spores were found in Florida last month. Officials in Los Angeles said on-time mail delivery was about 95 percent; Ernie Swanson, a postal spokesman in Seattle, said, "There hasn't been any slowdown of significance here that I'm aware of."
Postal officials attributed part of the rebound to a decrease in the overall mail load, with about 5 percent fewer packages and letters from early September to now, compared with the same period last year. The decline, they said, was attributable to the slowing economy as much as anything.
"A lot of people aren't sending as much as they used to," said Ms. Winiarz, the Chicago spokeswoman. "I didn't even send out Halloween cards this year. It's a mix of the entire economic situation. People don't have that extra two dollars to spend on a card, so less mail is getting into the system."
Some organizations worry that the mail-delivery system remains vulnerable and could be disrupted by new anthrax scares. Julie Browning, the dean for undergraduate enrollment at Rice University in Houston, said today was the postmark deadline for student applications.
"Obviously, we'll have to be flexible about the Nov. 1 postmark date," Ms. Browning said. "We can't know for sure. If it was dropped on the first, that doesn't mean the post office was functioning on that date. We're going to have to figure it out as we go."
And so are postal officials in North Pole, Alaska, a town of 1,570 that annually receives as many as 60,000 letters sent to Santa Claus, whose volunteer helpers in the area usually answer them. A manager in the Fairbanks post office said officials there were worried that future anthrax scares could lead to Santa's mail sitting in piles, unopened.
"We're already getting handfuls of letters," the manager said. "We're handling them same as normal; nobody's put the kibosh on anything. But it's still possible. It could happen tomorrow."

HEADLINE: Police Overtime Since Attack Creates Retirement Incentive 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN FLYNN 

 BODY:
The New York Police Department expects to pay up to $1.7 billion in overtime this fiscal year, a sum more than five times the record overtime it paid last year to officers who worked extra hours or extra shifts.
 The enormous expansion in overtime, as the city responds to security concerns caused by the World Trade Center attack, will have serious implications for the city's budget, even though large federal reimbursements are expected. But analysts say it could have an even larger impact on the department itself: the accelerated retirements of veteran officers who stand to qualify for larger pensions because of exceptionally large salaries this year. 
 New York City, which already has an acknowledged problem with police retirements, is about to pay many of its veteran officers an average of $50,000 in overtime for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, 2002. That sum will nearly double their salaries and create a huge incentive to retire while pensions reflect the unusually large earnings. 
"Anyone contemplating retirement before, this overtime will definitely make them decide on retiring," said Joseph Maccone, who managed the department's pension unit last year and now works for the police officers' union.
Through September, 1,677 of the city's 40,000 police officers retired, up 75 percent from the same period last year. Mr. Maccone said there were early indications that 500 more officers filed for retirement in October, up from 161 in October 2000.
"Everybody that was on the fence, now can't afford to stay," said one Manhattan detective who plans to retire in several months. He said he would make $90,000 this year, far more than the $75,000 he anticipated. "I have to get out. I'll never see this kind of money ever again."
Officers who serve 20 years in the job are entitled to pensions worth half of what they earned in their last 12 months with the department. Officials predict that between now and next September, the average patrol officer with 20 years of experience, who typically earns $64,000 a year with holiday pay and limited overtime, may make $110,000 or more.
For pension purposes, an officer's salary in his final year can rise only by 20 percent from the prior year, so only some of the additional earnings would be factored into the pension.
At the same time, some officers have told colleagues that, as tempting as the larger pension looks, they are worried about shrinking job opportunities in the private sector as the economy slows. And even if they want to go, only about 3,500 officers are eligible to retire with a full pension for 20 or more years in the job, officials said.
Still, the department is not taking the problem lightly. "It is a known fact that retirements were going up because of big classes that were hired 20 years ago," said Deputy Commissioner Thomas Antenen, a police spokesman. "How much of this will be affected by the overtime earned after the World Trade Center disaster remains to be seen."
So far this fiscal year, which is just four months old, the Police Department has spent $227 million for overtime, or $16 million more than budgeted for the entire fiscal year. More than half, $140 million, was spent on overtime associated with recovery operations and security patrols needed after the terrorist attack.
At this rate, city budget analysts predict police overtime may well reach $1.7 billion, a sum equal to the budget for the Philadelphia school system and five times what the Police Department spent last year, when overtime peaked at $317 million. Officials said the projection was based on the assumption that the level of security now in place would continue throughout the year.
Fire Department overtime has also increased this fiscal year. The department, which has an overtime budget of $88 million this year, has already spent about $58 million, with more than half of that attributed to the attack and its aftermath.
Officials said they were anticipating some rise in retirements but were still evaluating the potential impact of the additional earnings.
"Even though some people might be contemplating retirement," said Frank Gribbon, a spokesman for the Fire Department, "there are others who are making a commitment to stay to help the department get through this period when seniority and experience is so important."
The Police Department has already taken steps to curtail overtime spending where it can. For example, Operation Condor, a program that gave commanders overtime money to assign officers to work a sixth day in a week as they saw fit, has been suspended since Sept. 11. And much of the department, which had been working 12-hour tours in the weeks after the attack, has returned to normal eight-hour shifts.
But given the new level of security in place throughout the city, with police officers routinely patrolling bridges and tunnels and deployed in larger numbers to sporting events, even the most questioning analysts of police spending agree it will be difficult to exert much control on overtime this year. "What is happening now just can't be compared to anything that has happened in the past," said City Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, the chairman of the Public Safety Committee. "A lot of it is involuntary because it is a response to a disaster of a magnitude that is beyond anything the department has ever faced."
Because the overtime bill and others will likely grow so large, the federal government has already begun discussions on how much of the cost it will reimburse, according to city officials. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to reimburse the city for police overtime accumulated in the weeks immediately after the attack. Congress is expected to appropriate additional funds to help with the later costs.
But Preston Niblack, deputy director of the Independent Budget Office, a city agency that provides nonpartisan analysis, said it was not clear that the federal government would pick up anywhere near the full cost.
"It seems the costs that are related to new security needs are going to be on the city's own tab," he said. "The next mayor is going to face some choices about how to pay for these new needs, and cutting back on police overtime may not be as feasible a saving now as it was before Sept. 11."

HEADLINE: Privatization Snag in South Africa 

BYLINE:  By HENRI E. CAUVIN 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
When South Africa announced this week that the initial public offering of Telkom South Africa, by far the largest telecommunications company south of the Sahara, would be delayed yet again, the news threw cold water on the whole privatization effort here -- not to mention the national budget.
 The decision, while disappointing, was not really a surprise. Even critics who complain that privatization is moving too slowly said delaying the Telkom deal into late 2002 or early 2003 was the only prudent course. 
 "When is the right time is difficult to say, but I think it's quite obvious that now is not the right time," said Dawie Roodt, chief economist at PLJ Securities in Johannesburg. 
The trouble is that the right time may have already come and gone. 
A minority stake in Telkom was South Africa's first major privatization, back in 1997, when 30 percent of its stock was sold to SBC Communications and Telekom Malaysia. The government pledged to list the company publicly in Johannesburg and New York by the end of 2001. 
But before the government could organize the offering, the telecommunications sector began to falter around the world. The government pushed the timetable back, saying the listing would take place by the end of the current fiscal year, which ends in March 2002. 
Now, the finance minister, Trevor Manuel, says that the listing, which the government had been counting on to bring in at least $1 billion, will slip into the next fiscal year. 
"Preparatory work for Telkom's initial public share offer is well advanced," Mr. Manuel said in his budget update to Parliament this week. "But we recognize that the regulatory and institutional work that needs to be completed is formidable and market conditions at present are unattractive."
Few analysts hold out much hope for a big improvement in the market for phone stocks any time soon, but the delay may give the government time to sort out the continuing regulatory confusion that has clouded the offering and threatened to erode its value.
Legislation establishing important telecommunications regulations is still wending its way through Parliament, with some questions still unanswered and others settled only at the price of a damaging public spectacle. 
For months, politicians wavered over extending Telkom's monopoly on local phone service for a sixth year. When they ultimately decided not to, the question became whether to license one or two additional operators. The government reversed course several times and wound up where it started, with immediate plans for only one additional operator. 
Other issues are still unresolved, and while a delay because of market conditions is understandable, a failure to straighten out the legal issues will not be, said Judith D. O'Neill, head of the telecommunications practice at Thelen Reid & Priest in New York, who has worked extensively on African telecommunications privatizations. "The company should encourage the government, and the government should recognize that this is a good time to do this, so that when they are ready to list, they don't have a depression in price," Ms. O'Neill said in a telephone interview from Philadelphia.
Adding to the uncertainty has been rising antagonism between the governing African National Congress party and its traditional allies in labor and on the political left over privatization.
Neva Makgetla, coordinator of fiscal and monetary policy for the Congress of South African Trade Unions, said that the state had been too willing to sell off state companies like Telkom without adopting regulations that ensure universal access to essential services. 
"Competition is good for upper income and business, and will lead to better service," she said. "We've accepted that and we can live with that. But it should be in the context of the state providing basic service for the poor, because the private sector won't."
The confusion and acrimony have marked a year that began with leaders brimming with optimism about attracting private capital. Telkom, which has spent four years trying to transform itself from a relic of apartheid-era isolation into a nimble player in global telecommunications, was supposed to lead the way. The next step, taking Telkom public, was meant to whet interest in other enterprises the government wanted to sell, like Airports Company South Africa and South African Airways. 
But the state now has nothing to show for its efforts in 2001. No important state company has introduced or increased private ownership this year, and the immediate prospects are grim. The airline and the airport company have been made much less attractive by the global slump in travel after Sept. 11, and particularly by the collapse of Swissair, which owns 20 percent of the airline.

HEADLINE: Better Cars, Cleaner Air 

BYLINE:  By Daniel F. Becker; Daniel F. Becker is director of the Sierra Club's global warming and energy program.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As chairman of the Ford Motor Company, William Clay Ford Jr. said all the right things about the environment. As its new chief executive officer, he'll have the power to put his words into action. His challenge is to prove that an enlightened executive can turn Ford into a responsible corporate citizen. 
 Unlike many other corporate executives, Mr. Ford not only recognizes how his business harms the environment; he admits it and says he wants to fix the problems. His tenure offers real hope for progress on issues like global warming. 
 Because he is chief executive of the country's second-largest automaker, his statements and decisions have measurable impact on the industry. As chairman, Mr. Ford pulled the company's head from the sand in December 1999 by quitting the Global Climate Coalition, a cabal of polluting companies that denied the scientific research proving global warming. Within four months, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler also left. 
He also pushed the company to publish "corporate citizenship" reports. This year's acknowledged that Ford's vehicles and factories annually emit 400 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, adding to global warming. This is a devastating admission, but such corporate honesty is a crucial first step in educating shareholders about the corporation's environmental impact. 
Perhaps most promising is Mr. Ford's aggressive leadership in making the company's commitment, announced last year, to improve fuel economy in its S.U.V.'s by 25 percent by 2005. Improving gas mileage is the single biggest step American automakers can take to curb global warming. Moreover, it will save American consumers money at the gas pump and reduce the nation's dependence on oil. 
The key test for Mr. Ford, however, is how much he boosts fuel economy across the entire Ford fleet, not just in S.U.V.'s. Because Ford has failed to improve the fuel economy of its cars and trucks sufficiently, and because it now sells a higher proportion of gas-guzzling trucks than it did 17 years ago, its new vehicles get fewer miles per gallon, on average, than the ones it built in 1984.
It can do much better. Modern technology for engines, transmissions and aerodynamics can help Ford achieve an average fuel economy of 40 miles per gallon for its cars, pickups and S.U.V.'s, saving the United States almost one million barrels of oil per day -- more than half as much as the country imports from Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, old-school Ford executives have left this technology sitting on the shelf. Ford's cars currently lack many of the improvements, like variable valve timing and continuously variable transmissions, already available on more efficient cars. And Ford's trucks lack some of the technology already on Ford's cars. 
But Mr. Ford, like most executives, resists government intrusion into corporate decision-making. He has long argued that improvements in fuel economy should be left to manufacturers and has personally lobbied members of Congress against efforts to make cars and S.U.V.'s go farther on a gallon of gas. 
Mr. Ford has a compelling economic incentive to implement his vision of corporate citizenship: If he fails to do so, his company will lose market share to imports. Both Toyota and Honda are putting clean, gasoline-electric hybrid cars on the road, and Americans are snapping them up. Today, the waiting list to buy a 50-mile-per-gallon Toyota Prius is three months. Japanese automakers aren't just selling cars, they're selling a vision of the future through modern technology. If Ford doesn't sell that vision, its shareholders could lose their money and its employees could lose their jobs. 
Of course, like any large corporation, Ford has enormous inertia. It can't be expected to start churning out super-efficient vehicles next Tuesday. But the clock is ticking. Now more than ever, Americans recognize the need to break free of our oil dependence. Mr. Ford faces a difficult challenge, and his instincts are admirable. His leadership could show that it is everyone's patriotic duty to drive a fuel-efficient car.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales for October Were Highest Ever in U.S. 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Sales of cars and trucks in the United States soared to the highest monthly level ever in October, automakers reported today, but they were spurred by deep discounts that foreshadow trouble in the months ahead.
 Despite an economy in recession, rising unemployment and shaken consumer confidence, vehicles sold at a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 21.26 million last month, according to Ward's AutoInfoBank, a data service in Southfield, Mich. That tops the previous high of 21.24 million, reached in September 1986. Sales for the entire year are expected to finish above 17 million vehicles. 
 The record sales were spurred by a price war that began after Sept. 11, led by General Motors. That price war has eroded the profits of all of the Big Three carmakers.
The result is that the auto industry, while reaping higher sales in the short term, expects sales to drop sharply at the end of the year and early next year as the economy worsens and frenzied competition continues. Those fears have recently led to the reduction of credit ratings for Ford Motor, G.M. and DaimlerChrysler, production cuts and idled plants, and contributed to the resignation this week of Jacques A. Nasser, the chief executive of Ford. G.M., Ford and Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, all reported net losses in the third quarter. 
Still, the Big Three saw their cups as half full today. After all, G.M. and Ford actually gained market share last month, while Honda, Nissan and Volkswagen all lost share because their sales gains were not as drastic as Ford's and G.M.'s, according to Autodata of Woodcliff Lake, N.J. Toyota's market share rose only slightly. 
Sales rose 36 percent at Ford, 31 percent at G.M. and 28 percent at Toyota. Chrysler rose just 5 percent, in part because it did not offer the no-interest loans on some of its popular models.
"Wow is the appropriate word," said Paul Ballew, G.M.'s general director for global market and industry analysis, referring to the industry's record results in a conference call. "You can use other words, like exceptional, phenomenal and so on and so forth to describe the month's performance."
Wall Street was not seeing things so optimistically. Gary Lapidus, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said, "I'll come up with my own adjectives." 
Saul Rubin, an analyst at UBS Warburg, said, "You can't go on like this."
"It's an unbearable cost for the industry, and it's unsustainable," he added. 
For the Big Three, the huge sales increases came even though sales to rental car companies, which have been struggling since the attacks, have stalled and even though corporations have delayed orders for their fleets. Those losses were more than made up for by Americans lured to showrooms by plans like G.M.'s Keep America Rolling, which combined interest-free financing on the company's entire vehicle lineup with a patriotic advertising campaign.
Mr. Ballew did acknowledge that there would be "payback" for the inflated October sales. George Pipas, Ford's manager of sales analysis, had a similar assessment, calling the results "extraordinary" but also allowing that they were a "double-edged sword."
A Ford executive recently said that incentives accounted for 16 percent of the company's revenue this year, compared with 11 percent last year, and that every percentage-point increase reduced annual pretax earnings by $1 billion. 
Today, it appeared that the price war would continue. A G.M. spokesman indicated that it was possible his company's interest-free financing deals might be extended. And Chrysler said it would offer a new, seven-year, 100,000-mile warranty on its vehicles' engines, transmissions and the rest of their powertrains through the end of the year.
Ford and Chrysler executives have chafed at the interest-free financing incentives, introduced by G.M. after the attacks, but felt compelled to respond to G.M. to stay competitive. Environmental groups have criticized the Big Three for bolstering sales and making more gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles at a time when there is some renewed debate about the nation's dependency on Middle East oil. 
From G.M.'s perspective, the incentives are a chance to regain lost market share at a time when it has a fresh vehicle lineup. The company needs to maintain its size, after decades of declining market share, because it has about two and a half retirees for each worker on its payroll and must keep up with covering their pensions and health benefits. 
"Our goal with this was not to break the bank," Mr. Ballew said. "Given what occurred on Sept. 11, we needed something to help drive traffic back into the showroom and help to bolster consumer confidence and consumer sentiment. That was our goal."

HEADLINE: Enron's Shares Fall and Debt Rating Is Cut 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
With investors absorbing news of a formal Securities and Exchange Commission investigation and a downgrading by another large credit-rating agency, shares of the Enron Corporation fell 13.7 percent today, giving back most of the gains from Wednesday's rally.
 Late on Wednesday, Enron, the energy-trading giant based in Houston, said the S.E.C. had intensified its inquiry into the company's finances, making it a formal investigation, carrying subpoena power. 
 And today, Standard & Poor's lowered its rating on Enron's senior debt by one notch, leaving it a few notches above junk bond status. The downgrading came after a similar cut by Moody's Investors Service on Monday. S.& P. left Enron under review for a possible further downgrading. 
If Enron's credit rating were dropped below investment grade, it could force the company to issue millions of shares of stock to satisfy debts and prompt other big energy-trading concerns to curtail their business with Enron. 
S.& P. said that the company's "financial flexibility has continued to diminish" and that it had been unable "to calm investors that are unsure about the strength of Enron's core energy marketing business." But the rating agency also said it thought that "Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty" and that, so far, "most counterparties have maintained their trading activity with Enron."
This morning, Enron said it had obtained $1 billion in additional financing. The line of credit may help the company convince investors and trading partners that it can weather this crisis. But some industry officials said investors might have reacted negatively because Enron had to pledge assets from two subsidiaries, Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern Pipeline, to secure the credit line.
An Enron spokeswoman said that she did not know what interest rates the credit lines carried and that the company had no plans to seek even more financing deals.
Enron's shares have fallen by more than half in the last two weeks because of the S.E.C. investigation and worries about off-balance-sheet debts and transactions with investment partnerships involving the company's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last week. Enron shares fell $1.91 today, to $11.99.
Some analysts are beginning to attribute a swift recent rally in natural gas prices in part to the possibility that a collapse of Enron would roil the commodity markets. Enron dominates natural gas and electricity trading in the United States.
In New York today, natural gas for December delivery fell 0.1 cent, to $3.29 for a million British thermal units. The contract has soared from about $2.70 over the last two weeks as Enron's troubles became public.
"Enron has a massive exposure to both the buy side and the sell side in gas and other commodities," said Jay Saunders, oil and gas analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, "and if they're at risk financially, then you're exposed to that so you want to cover that risk. Anybody who has Enron as a counterparty in a trade might be concerned about getting paid."
Mr. Saunders added that other factors had also lifted prices lately, including falling rates of gas being put in storage for use this winter.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ANKARA; 
Turkey Says Troops to Join U.S. Campaign and Train Anti-Taliban Forces

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Turkey said today that it would send 90 Special Forces troops to Afghanistan, making it the first Muslim nation to join the American-led attacks on the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.
 Turkish officials said the soldiers would be sent to northern Afghanistan primarily to help train anti-Taliban fighters and support aid operations. But the officials acknowledged that Turkish soldiers might also engage in combat. 
 "We foresee a framework to keep this risk at a minimum," Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said in an interview. "But our soldiers are well prepared." 
Western diplomats described the commitment as a major step in efforts to portray the war in Afghanistan as a fight against terrorism, not a war on Islam. It has proved a challenge to convince people in general, and Muslims in particular, that the war is not against the Afghan people or Islam itself, particularly in the face of rising civilian casualties and the prospect of a long and messy conflict.
"It is not an easy decision for any country to send combat troops into a situation like this, so this was a very important and welcome step," a Western diplomat said. 
The results of a public opinion poll released today by the Ankara Social Research Center, a research group, illustrated Turks' skepticism toward the United States and their own government. Thirteen percent of the 1,240 people surveyed said they believed that Mr. bin Laden was behind the attacks on the United States. Two-thirds said they did not support the American attacks on Afghanistan. Sixty-three percent disagreed with Turkey's support for the American attacks, and 86 percent opposed sending Turkish troops to Afghanistan.
The Afghanistan conflict and the prospect that it may spread have underscored Turkey's position as a country on the cusp. It is caught between its religion and geography, and its long alliance with the United States and orientation toward Europe. Turkey is the lone member of NATO with a majority Muslim population and the lone NATO nation among the 50 members of the Organization of Islamic Countries.
Ankara's decision to dispatch troops to Afghanistan will be seen in many quarters as tilting too far toward the West. To date, Turkey has not experienced the violent anti-American protests that have jolted some Muslim countries since the bombing started on Oct. 7.
"Turkey had more than its military power to offer," Omer Vehbi Hatiboglu, a leader of Saadet, the pro-Islamic opposition party, said in an interview. "A more effective weapon was our Muslim identity to explain U.S. policies to the Muslim world. But now we have become a pact member and lost our mediating status."
The Special Forces are experienced in guerrilla warfare in mountainous terrain after fighting Kurdish rebels for more than 15 years in southeastern Turkey. They will join soldiers from the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia who are preparing for what is expected to be a sustained campaign of raids by small elite units.
Unlike many Muslim nations, Turkey is strictly secular. It has been a close ally of Israel, and condemning the attacks of Sept. 11 was easy for its leaders. Ankara signaled a willingness to take bolder steps on Oct. 10, when Parliament, over objections from the pro-Islamic opposition, authorized the eventual deployment of troops to Afghanistan and the opening of airspace and bases to other soldiers from the American-led coalition.
Transport aircraft in the Afghan attacks are using Incirlik Air Base in the south. The field is also a staging point for patrols above northern Iraq by American and British planes. A second, unnamed Turkish base is also being used.
Last Friday, the United States asked Turkey to provide the troops. The cabinet approved the deployment today, with what officials said was the backing of the powerful military. Officials said the troops were expected to leave within a week from Incirlik.
Clearly sensitive to how the decision would be seen in the Muslim world, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said the action was not intended to harm Islam.
"Those who portray this campaign as an action against Islam are contradicting the high values of Islam, which is a religion of peace," he said.
Mr. Ecevit rejected a pause in the bombing for Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, which begins shortly. "Terrorism has no Ramadan, no flags, no feasts," Mr. Ecevit said at a news conference.
The prime minister and other senior officials left open the possibility of adding troops in future. They also said Turkey would be willing to participate in a peacekeeping force later. 
Turkey took part in similar NATO missions in Kosovo and Bosnia, which have large Muslim populations.
Turks had good relations with Afghanistan for most of the last century and are related ethnically to Afghans. Turkey sent military trainers to help Afghan troops in the 1930's and later provided educational and cultural assistance. But Ankara never recognized the Taliban and it has maintained close ties with the opposition Northern Alliance.
Experts here played down the prospect of a violent reaction in Turkey or criticism from other Muslim nations to the decision to send troops. 
What does concern many Turkish political and military leaders is the prospect that the next front in the war will be in neighboring Iraq. Attacks on Baghdad could disrupt important economic ties between northern Iraq and southeastern Turkey, where the economy is already fragile.
On the other hand, some bankers and financial experts speculated that Turkey's participation could help its staggering economy by winning additional concessions from the International Monetary Fund and the United States.
The fund said today that it would soon send a team to Turkey to discuss how to bridge the $13 billion financing gap that Turkey faces next year as a result of its yearlong economic troubles. Those problems have been made worse by a drop in tourism since the attacks on Sept. 11.

PERSON: Juan Bosch 

HEADLINE: Juan Bosch, 92, Freely Elected Dominican President, Dies 

BYLINE:  By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Juan Bosch, a prolific writer who in December 1962 became the first freely elected president of the Dominican Republic in 38 years -- only to be toppled by a military coup after seven months in office -- died yesterday in the capital, Santo Domingo. He was 92.
 At its start, Mr. Bosch's presidency appeared to promise a more hopeful future for his impoverished and deeply troubled country. His election had been made possible by the assassination in May 1961 of Gen. Rafael L. Trujillo, the dictator who had ruled since 1930. That also let the Organization of American States lift sanctions imposed on the country in 1960 because of General Trujillo's complicity in a plot to assassinate President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela. 
 The Kennedy administration welcomed Mr. Bosch's election and sent Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson to represent the United States at his inauguration in February 1963. Washington also promised increased aid under the Alliance for Progress.
But Mr. Bosch quickly provoked his rightist opponents, introducing constitutional changes that included limiting the size of landholdings and strengthening industrial and agricultural workers' rights.
His performance as president had other problems, too. Caught between the remnants of General Trujillo's forces and Communists inspired by Fidel Castro, he often appeared indecisive and unable to delegate responsibility. In his book "Overtaken by Events," John Bartlow Martin, who was the American ambassador in Santo Domingo, described Mr. Bosch as "a poor president."
On Sept. 25, a group of military officers and other enemies of the government led by Generals Elias Wessin y Wessin and Antonio Imbert Barreras ousted Mr. Bosch and his cabinet. The plotters called them "corrupt and pro-Communist." Mr. Bosch went into exile in Puerto Rico.
The United States reacted angrily, suspending aid and refusing to recognize the triumvirate that emerged from the coup and was replaced by a cabal headed by Donald Cabal Reid, a prominent businessman.
In 1965, military supporters of Mr. Bosch conducted an uprising in the capital, demanding the restoration of the exiled president and a return to the Constitution of 1963. In April, Mr. Johnson warned Mr. Bosch not to return to the Dominican Republic. That month, the United States sent 22,000 marines to occupy the capital for several months while a provisional government was formed and elections were arranged.
Mr. Bosch returned to contest the elections in June 1966 but lost to Joaquin Balaguer, a former ally of General Trujillo. Mr. Bosch contested elections in 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990 and 1994, always losing. 
Juan Bosch Gavino was born on June 30, 1909, in La Vega to a Spanish father and a Puerto Rican mother. After college in Santo Domingo, he began writing and published more than 30 works of fiction and history. In 1937, appalled by a massacre of Haitian squatters ordered by General Trujillo, he began a 24-year exile, initially moving to Cuba.
In 1939, he helped found the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano, with a leftist non-Communist orientation. In 1952, he fled Cuba after Gen. Fulgencio Batista took power and threatened to deport him to the Dominican Republic. Mr. Bosch returned to his homeland in 1961 after General Trujillo's death and built his party into a movement of farm and factory workers.
In the 1962 election campaign, he made his followers extravagant promises that were probably unrealizable, including jobs for the unemployed, the division and distribution of big estates to landless farm workers, better housing and higher living standards.
He was so eager to resist being called a Communist that when a Spanish Jesuit accused him of that, he withdrew from the election for a while after failing to have the contest postponed to give himself time to reply. Two days before Election Day, Mr. Bosch rejoined the contest and won.
In 1941, he married the former Carmen Quidiello, a Cuban. They have a son, Patricio, and a daughter, Barbara.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 10, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An obituary on Nov. 2 about Juan Bosch, the first freely elected president of the Dominican Republic, misstated the family names of the man who succeeded him after a coup in 1963. The successor was Donald Reid Cabral, not Cabal Reid. The article also referred incorrectly to the 22,000 United States troops who were sent to the Dominican Republic in 1965 to occupy the capital for several months while a provisional government was formed and elections were arranged. They were a mixed force of marines and Army soldiers, not just marines.

HEADLINE: To Sway Russia, Bush Will Propose Cuts to Nuclear Arsenal 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
President Bush will decide in the next few days how deeply to slash America's nuclear arsenal as part of a new understanding with Russia on missile defense and strategic nuclear arms, officials said today.
 Together with economic incentives for Moscow, the reductions in nuclear arms are intended to be an inducement to the Russians to accept the Bush administration's program to test and develop antimissile defenses -- which are prohibited by the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. 
 A leading option under consideration, according to senior administration officials, is to reduce the American nuclear force to a range of around 1,800 to 2,250 warheads, from current levels above 6,000.
The president's final decision on the cuts is expected to be included as part of a broad package of strategic and economic incentives that Mr. Bush hopes to present to President Vladimir V. Putin when he arrives here later this month. 
White House officials confirmed today that Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, has made a series of calls around Capitol Hill in hopes of arranging a quick vote on revoking the main economic sanction against Russia remaining from the cold war.
That measure, the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, was intended to pressure Communist-bloc nations to allow free emigration, particularly in the case of Russian Jews trying to leave. The law has not been applied to Russia in years.
But Mr. Bush wants to announce this month that Russia and a host of former Soviet republics will be "graduated" from the entire process of being reviewed annually to be granted normal trading status. That step would also help pave the way for American approval of Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization. Congress permanently exempted China from the law last year.
American officials are touting these actions as signs of a new relationship with Moscow. But to forge those ties, Mr. Bush also appears to be modifying his own positions.
He needs Russian cooperation in the war against terrorism and the attacks on Afghanistan. The result is that few in the administration are now talking about withdrawing from the ABM treaty any time soon, despite Mr. Bush's oft-repeated claim that the treaty is outdated and dangerous.
Other stances have changed: the Bush administration is markedly more reserved on the question of Russian use of force in Chechnya despite previous American concerns that civilians were being hurt by indiscriminate Russian attacks.
While Mr. Bush has repeatedly indicated as a candidate and president that he favors deep cuts in the country's nuclear arsenal he has never said how many weapons he plans to eliminate. At a briefing for reporters today, Ms. Rice said nothing about the nuclear cuts, other than repeating the administration's position that it would not engage in negotiations over a new arms control treaty.
"We really believe the old arms control agreements in which you had to match warhead for warhead, system for system, ignoring geography, ignoring history, ignoring the threats around you, was the old way of thinking about this," she said. 
Other administration officials said that Mr. Bush would make a unilateral declaration of how deeply he hoped to cut the American stockpile, and that the administration expected Mr. Putin would do the same. "This may not be on paper," one administration official said. "It doesn't have to be." 
That alone is a huge change. By avoiding negotiations on limits that apply equally to both sides, the Bush administration is breaking with the cold war tradition in arms control, which made parity between the superpowers the paramount consideration. Moreover, if there can be an agreement without a treaty, there is nothing for the United States Senate to debate or approve.
But first Mr. Bush must resolve differences within the Pentagon about how deep those cuts should go.
The second strategic arms reduction treaty, Start II, which has never legally taken effect, called for reducing armament levels to around 3,000 to 3,500 warheads. President Bill Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia agreed that their goal should be to cut the number of warheads on each side to 2,000 to 2,500 under a proposed Start III accord.
The Bush administration may go somewhat lower. The primary option under review is to set a range for the United States at around 1,800 to 2,250 warheads, officials said.
Some in the administration would like to lower the upper end of the range, to make the cuts more significant and thus to differentiate the Bush administration's policy from Mr. Clinton's arms control goals.
But the United States Strategic Command, which oversees the nuclear arsenal, is resisting deep cuts and says the country needs to maintain an arsenal at the high end of that band, officials said. 
Since the Russians face severe budgetary pressure, their arsenal is expected to be smaller than that of the United States. Russian officials, for example, have said the number of nuclear warheads they have is likely to shrink to 1,500. But if the Russian total is higher, the Bush administration may have to rethink its approach. 
The arms reductions would be made over a 10-year period under provisions for on-site inspection outlined by Start I. 
Some former Clinton administration officials said the reductions the Bush administration is considering are less significant than advertised. That is because the Bush administration is adopting a new procedure for counting weapons in which strategic submarines and bombers that are being overhauled will not be included, a break with past arms control treaties.
This change in the counting will reduce the official tabulation of nuclear weapons by about 250 warheads without actually eliminating a single weapon. 
"It sounds like the Bush team may not have overcome the institutional resistance to lower numbers that the Clinton administration encountered," said Steven Andreasen, the director of defense policy and arms control for the National Security Council during the Clinton administration.
Arms control advocates said the reductions being considered by the White House are not nearly as deep as they had hoped. "They are not sensible cuts for the end of the cold war," said Bruce G. Blair, president of the Center for Defense Information. "Those numbers imply a requirement to prepare for the possibility of a large-scale nuclear war with Russia, which is not a plausible scenario."
A Bush administration official asserted, however, that the reductions projected now were the product of a review that took a fresh look at the nuclear force. He defended the decision not to count submarines and bombers in the overhaul, saying officials have decided it is not sensible to count what he termed "phantom arms."
Ms. Rice's calls to Congress this week to take Russia off the list of countries that are affected by the Jackson-Vanik amendment was another step in the direction of integrating Russia more fully into the West.
"We'd have to do it anyway to get Russia into the W.T.O.," one administration official said. "Putin wants Russia off the list, and by doing it we can declare victory, say 'it worked,' and move on," the official added.
Getting Russia into the World Trade Organization, however, will be a far more complex problem, involving extensive negotiations about opening Russia's markets. It is unclear whether Mr. Putin is willing to pay the political price -- especially if entry into the W.T.O. forces Russian industry to face global competition.
The third element of the administration's package to encourage an agreement with Mr. Putin is a new position on defensive systems. Instead of abandoning the ABM treaty, as many conservatives have advocated, the Bush administration now appears to be proposing a phased approach
During the first phase, it appears, Russia would permit the United States to go ahead with testing -- but not deployment -- of its antimissile system. But it would do this by amending, but not abandoning the ABM treaty.
This approach would enable the Pentagon's antimissile defense program to go forward while partially satisfying the Russians, who insist that the ABM treaty is the bedrock of arms control.

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
In Debate, Candidates Go Against Type

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
YOU may have heard that the mayoral election is a contest between a smug veteran Democrat and a novice Republican with a penchant for putting his foot in his mouth. But that was not how it played on television last night.
 When Michael R. Bloomberg and Mark Green faced each other in prime time, it was Mr. Bloomberg who came off as the smug veteran pol. He was calm and articulate, almost Reaganesque, by comparison with his Democratic opponent. At times Mr. Green seemed less a politician than a hectoring high-school debater as he shouted accusations and recited facts and figures. 
Mr. Bloomberg, like Mr. Reagan, preferred to stick with generalities. It made for smooth television and gave him an air of authority, but he could be aloof and frustrating if you wanted specifics. He also occasionally lapsed into corporatese, using "dialogue" as a verb and mentioning his "skill set."
Mr. Green was less polished but at times seemed more sincere, as when he smiled and said "ditto" right after Mr. Bloomberg praised Rudolph W. Giuliani. If you were looking for someone with an intimate knowledge of government and its acronyms, Mr. Green was your candidate. He promised new credits and new bureaucracies. 
The clearest ideological contrast came on a question about bilingual education. Mr. Green, echoing the views of bilingual educators and Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, said more money was needed to hire bilingual educators. Mr. Bloomberg said there were more pressing needs for money, and that the first priority should be teaching children English.
Mr. Bloomberg presented himself as the entrepreneur more in tune with the private sector, and he did not share Mr. Green's enthusiasm for a new public agency to rebuild downtown Manhattan. But otherwise he did not offer many assurances to conservatives worried about him being as liberal as Mr. Green. 
Both men say that they want to continue Mr. Giuliani's successes, and they do echo a couple of his themes. They both promise to keep crime under control, and they both warn against David N. Dinkins's approach to budget deficits, a tax increase. Mr. Green has said that taxes should be considered only as a "last resort"; Mr. Bloomberg has ruled them out. 
BEYOND crime and taxes, though, the candidates don't sound much like Mr. Giuliani -- or any of the successful reformers in other cities over the past decade. Outside New York, mayors of both parties have been paying close attention to ideas for re-inventing government emanating from Democratic gurus like David Osborne and conservative groups like the Manhattan Institute for Public Policy. But these two candidates seem oblivious.
Before Sept. 11, when education was deemed the all-important issue, the school reforms envisioned by Mr. Green and Mr. Bloomberg were tepid compared with what's already going on in other cities. Mr. Green wouldn't even support the small experiment with Edison Schools that had been promoted by Mr. Giuliani and supported by both conservative and liberal editorial pages. Mr. Bloomberg did favor it, but not enough to make an issue of it.
After Sept. 11, both candidates warned of calamitous budget deficits, but the pending crisis didn't prompt any notions of reinventing government. They talked vaguely of making workers more productive, but their most specific idea for coping with the deficit was a hiring freeze.
When Mr. Giuliani faced gaping budget deficits in his first term, he was ready with innovations. He did more than just order budget cuts at the Parks Department, for instance. He encouraged private groups like the Central Park Conservancy to provide support. The city began spending its own money more efficiently by hiring private contractors to take care of some parks, and it also used workfare recipients to clean parks.
How would Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Green protect the parks in the bleak fiscal times ahead? The question was put to each of them during breakfast interviews at The New York Times this week. Mr. Bloomberg gave no specific ideas other than "good management." Mr. Green said he might be open to letting private companies prune trees or do other tasks, but he expressed doubts about privatization and the use of workfare recipients to clean parks.
After listening to them at breakfast, it was easy to suspect that the parks would soon be in worse shape no matter who is elected. But it was hard to guess which man would do less harm. Last night's debate did not offer much further illumination.

HEADLINE: Clinton Backs Green, and Koch and Carey Give Their Support to Bloomberg 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

 BODY:
In a day of dueling big-name endorsements, Mark Green won the backing of a former president yesterday over a meal of chicken and ribs in Harlem; Michael R. Bloomberg got the support of a retired governor and a retired mayor who reminisced about World War II and their political legacies on the steps outside City Hall.
 Mr. Green, the Democratic candidate for mayor, ate lunch with the former president, Bill Clinton, at Miss Mamie's Spoonbread Too restaurant on West 110th Street -- topped off by a slice of banana pudding pie -- before appearing together outside the restaurant at a sidewalk news conference. 
 "We have basically shortened our lives by over-eating," Mr. Clinton said as he approached the microphones in an aggressively Kermit-green necktie bought especially for the occasion. 
Mr. Bloomberg, the Republican nominee, held a news conference with the retired governor, Hugh L. Carey, and the retired mayor, Edward I. Koch, but got to speak only after Mr. Carey held a small ceremony in honor of Mr. Koch. It included the presentation of a pin that Mr. Carey said came from their combat infantry unit in World War II.
"Ed is very self-effacing, very bashful," Mr. Carey said, moving determinedly toward Mr. Koch with the pin aimed at his lapel. "He has never worn our famous infantry pin."
"It is very nice of you," Mr. Koch replied, as if the two were conversing in his living room, not in front of Mr. Bloomberg and a bank of television cameras and reporters.
Mr. Carey and Mr. Koch eventually broke from their reminiscing and turned their attention to Mr. Bloomberg. They praised him for his business experience and suggested that his skills were needed to help get the city through its troubled economic times. 
Mr. Koch, who had previously endorsed two losing Democrats in the race, said he was going to remain silent about the Green-Bloomberg contest and simply vote for Mr. Bloomberg. But he changed his mind, he said, because he felt so strongly about Mr. Bloomberg.
"I believe this one can work out," Mr. Koch said. "I honestly believe that he will win. Can win. Will win."
In accepting the endorsements, Mr. Bloomberg said he aspired to be the city's best mayor, but he was gently scolded by Mr. Carey, who invoked the names of Mr. Koch and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and also made an oblique reference to Mr. Green.
"Mike, I want to caution you about one thing, you are not the arrogant candidate," Mr. Carey said. "You are running to be the third-best mayor this city ever had."
In Harlem, Mr. Green had some distractions of his own competing with the notoriety of the man he was with. A small crowd afforded Mr. Clinton his customary rock star welcome of shouts, screams, whistles and applause. 
"You know, when you get a job like this," Mr. Clinton said, "no one is born knowing everything you need to know to be president. No one is born knowing everything you need to know to be mayor. So you have to pick people you think have a capacity to grow. I know Mark Green, he has the capacity to grow, and he can do this job well."
Behind the scenes yesterday, both campaigns were stepping up their direct mail campaigns, advertising and telephone messages, including calls with a taped message from Mr. Clinton. Mr. Bloomberg also continued to send out mailings that feature photographs of two of the losing Democratic candidates, Fernando Ferrer and Alan Hevesi, as well as a statement by Mr. Hevesi criticizing Mr. Green.
A spokesman for Mr. Ferrer, Allen P. Cappelli, issued a statement for him: "This mailing was not authorized by me, and should not be interpreted as my supporting its candidate. I support Mark Green for mayor."

HEADLINE: The Mayoral Candidates Debate Public Safety, Education and Each Other 

 BODY:
The following are excerpts from the New York City mayoral candidates debate yesterday between Mark Green and Michael R. Bloomberg, sponsored by the Campaign Finance Board, the League of Women Voters of the City of New York, WABC and WNYC-Radio, as recorded by The New York Times. Diana Williams of WABC was the moderator. More excerpts are available at The New York Times on the Web at www.nytimes.com.
Q. Our first question goes to the issue of qualifications and experience. What is it about your opponent that you find insufficient for the office of mayor, Mr. Bloomberg?
MR. BLOOMBERG -- My opponent has not had any experience in managing a large organization, in leading a large number of people, in setting large budgets, in actually doing things. My opponent's experience is as an analyst and as a public advocate, but when it comes to leading this city he does not have the experience for a quarter of a million employees and a $40 billion budget.
Q. Mr. Green?
MR. GREEN -- Of the two of us, I'm the only one who's spent time in the public sector. My rival hasn't spent one minute in public life. Managing a budget: I ran an agency of 350 people, $17 million. I put together coalitions to reduce domestic violence in the workplace, coalitions to get tobacco signs out of communities that were addicting our children. If creating jobs in the private sector, which is a great thing, were the criterion, Bill Gates for mayor, since his company is 25 times larger than that of my rival's. When my rival wrote in his book, "politics, whatever the cynics may say, is a noble profession," he was right then, but his contemptuous slogan now, I think, is wrong.
Q. Name three things that you can do as mayor to try and ensure that New Yorkers are as safe as possible.
MR. BLOOMBERG -- Get out as much information as you can, every single day. The first thing is to let the public know what's going on. The second thing is to make sure that our police force, who is working with the federal government, takes the appropriate steps to ensure our safety. And the third thing is try to convince people to exercise some common sense, but go about their normal lives. You can't let the terrorists win. Leave security to the experts. 
Q. Mr. Green?
MR. GREEN -- Beyond as Mayor Giuliani has done, urging people to get on with their lives as London and Jerusalem do after lesser terrorist attacks: first, you have to have a deputy commissioner for counter-terrorism at the N.Y.P.D. and appoint people or consult with people who know what they're doing. I'm proud that Bill Bratton and Jerry Hauer, Peggy Hamburg, Sandy Berger -- experts on these matters -- have been advising me. Second, public health is public safety. You have to protect the public health function of the Health Department. So there's disease surveillance, so if there, God forbid, something happens, hypothetically on a subway, you can immediately detect it by people going into emergency rooms. Third, you need more points of departure, P.O.D.'s. So if something bad happens, everybody knows where to go for vaccines. It's pretty hard to get the vaccine, even if it's stockpiled, to the people who might need it. . . .
Q. Mr. Bloomberg, you've outlined a plan that would reward teachers with raises, a plan that forgoes an immediate move to reduce class size in the public schools. At a time of crisis in public education over that very issue, how can you defend that? 
MR. BLOOMBERG -- I'm not opposed to reducing class size. I'm just realistic about how much money we have. If we don't have enough to go around, you have to set priorities. My No. 1 priority is to protect the existing teachers that work in the school system. Unfortunately, after two or three years, a lot of young teachers leave because they just don't get paid enough to live. So I want to pay those teachers more, reduce the turnover in the classroom, which is so disruptive. If we absolutely don't have enough teachers, then of course you hire teachers. Nobody's suggesting that we would have a class without somebody at the front of the room.
But in terms of reducing class size it is just not a viable option today. We don't have the classrooms and we don't have the money. First and foremost, let's make what we have work as well as we can. Get rid of the board of ed, empower the principals, move disruptive kids out of the classroom and you'll fix the problem.
Q. Mr. Green?
MR. GREEN -- I don't know an issue on where we differ more than on education. And again my rival has shown that he's out of touch and doesn't understand the neighborhoods and the families of New York. I've visited 50 schools; I speak to parents and teachers and principals. They want smaller class sizes and my class size coalition has a lot of ways to do it without big budget expenditures. We want more computers and technology in the classrooms. He's five times said we want fewer computers in the classrooms. I was at Kingsbridge yesterday in the Bronx. They want a school there. My rival has said communities don't want new schools there.
Finally, we have to pay teachers more, especially in return for more performance. And in addition I don't want to defund our public schools by giving vouchers to private schools. On these issues we couldn't be farther apart.
Q. Well, Mr. Bloomberg, you want to respond?
MR. BLOOMBERG -- Mark, you have a right to your own opinions, but not a right to your own facts. Nobody is suggesting vouchers. I've clearly said that it is not something that will work in this city. In terms of computers, nobody's opposed to computer literacy. Your idea of computer literacy for all kids by grade six and not worrying about whether they can read or do math is just wrong-headed.
I would rather have books than computers any time. The basic skills are more important today than ever before. The problem with the school system is not that the kids can't type, not that they can't use Word or Microsoft Windows; the problem is they can't read, they can't write, they can't speak and read in English, they can't do math. . . .
MS. WILLIAMS -- We're now going to give each of you an opportunity to ask a question of each other.
MR. BLOOMBERG -- Mark, the way the runoff turned out between you and Freddy Ferrer, isn't it time to say, we're going to conduct -- you should conduct a real investigation of what happened? Isn't it time that you apologize for the smearing of Freddy Ferrer, saying that he was borderline irresponsible? Isn't it time to say, enough, that you should not have had or somebody should not have, in your interest, put out these disgraceful fliers and made those disgraceful calls? And will you promise right now to stop this politics of personal destruction that you seem to do every time you get close in an election?
MR. GREEN -- This is a man who said two weeks ago he wouldn't raise these issues because it's racially divisive. So what's despicable is the hypocrisy you just heard. This is a man who runs six to seven negative ads, which I haven't whined about. Now he's whining. The end of the story is that I asked my campaign people twice: Did anybody know about the racially divisive and motivated literature? No one knew about it. No one's shown it. How can I apologize for something that we weren't responsible for? Finally, I couldn't be prouder that Borough President Freddy Ferrer, Bronx County Chairman Roberto Ramirez, Assembly member Ruben Diaz Jr., Congressman Jose Serrano and his son Council member Serrano, 20 of the leading officials that were for Freddy Ferrer, including Congressman Rangel in Manhattan, have all endorsed my campaign. If they put it behind them and they think I'm the Democrat who could best be the mayor, I find this is a divisive question and quite off point in terms of what this city really needs, which is to rebuild the economy and educate our children.
MS. WILLIAMS -- O.K. Excuse me. Audience if you could, hold your applause please. 
We now have a question from Mr. Green to Mr. Bloomberg.
MR. GREEN -- You were quoted as saying that sanitation workers have a more dangerous job than cops and firefighters, quoted as saying communities don't want schools there, quoted as saying that rape could be prosecuted only if there was a third-party witness, quoted as saying domestic violence is a quality-of-life crime, I guess like graffiti. Would you like to now apologize for or recant any or all of these four very interesting statements?
MR. BLOOMBERG -- Mark, you've taken them all out of context.
MR. GREEN -- Are they all accurate?
MR. BLOOMBERG -- They were certainly said, but out of context. We were talking about all city workers. Some police and fire have enormously dangerous jobs as we've seen at the beginning. They're out there on the firing line, they could get killed. Sanitation workers and other city workers face environmental risks. The issue is, how do we get everybody home safe to their families at night? And it was in the context of talking about compensation for all city workers. When it came time to -- the issue of saying you needed a third-party witness, it was for a five-year-old case that the judge dismissed. Two years after an event occurred, you do need some kind of corroborating evidence and the judge said that.
In terms of quality-of-life crimes, the issue is not the label, the issue is, how do you stop the despicable behavior domestic violence? Don't worry about labels; worry about the substance. That's what my company has done, that's what I've done. We're not talkers. We don't have an ideological position. We're not worried about labels. What we're trying to do is to just go and do something about domestic violence. 
Once again, you're taking these things out of context. And it's the typical smear when the time gets close.
Q. The next mayor will, of course, have to negotiate new contracts with police, perhaps with firefighters. But there's a limit on how much you can pay them. Mr. Green, what kind of approach are you going to take here?
MR. GREEN -- I will tell you I have -- I'm so proud that for the first time in 20 years, police people, firefighters, 18 uniform service unions have endorsed a Democrat for mayor. If the cops and the firefighters have put their trust in me, I will do everything I can to pay them what they deserve.
But it's beyond pay. They won't come here if they're undereducated, if precinct conditions are bad. So I want a tuition assistance program upfront so any officer who doesn't yet have four years of college could get it over the first five years. We have to clean up the precincts. It's both conditions and pay. And I know about it because I talk to them.
Q. O.K. Pay raises for uniform services workers, Mr. Bloomberg.
 MR. BLOOMBERG -- We have to realize that we don't have a lot of money. We didn't before and we have an awful lot less now. Clearly we are losing police officers to other jobs, to other jurisdictions as well. They are underpaid. And the firefighters, you've seen the tragedy, you've seen the sacrifice that they made. I think we have to find ways to try to get both of those groups as much as we can. But we have the same issue where we're losing teachers. There are lots of city departments where the people are underpaid and our resources to solve the problem is relatively small. You have to go and you have to negotiate some ways through pensions and through pay raises and through changing the job descriptions so that these people do not find alternatives outside of the work force to be more attractive. But I don't think that we can possibly pay them in the next year or so what we really do owe them.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: IMMIGRATION LAW; 
Bills Require C.I.A. to Share Its Information on Foreigners

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Lawmakers from both parties are pushing immigration legislation that would require the Central Intelligence Agency to make information on suspected terrorists available to the officials responsible for admitting foreigners into the United States.
 Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, said at a news conference that legislation he introduced today with Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, would guarantee that cooperation. Mr. Brownback said the State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service "must be provided with law enforcement and intelligence information that will enable these agencies to identify alien terrorists." 
 Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, said the "major thrust" of a competing bill that she is preparing with Senator John Kyl, Republican of Arizona, was the "establishment of a comprehensive lookout database." Under her bill, the C.I.A., the F.B.I., the State Department and other agencies would be required to share information that would then be available to consular officers overseas who issue visas.
But the Feinstein-Kyl bill differs in some major ways from the Kennedy- Brownback bill. 
One crucial difference is that the Feinstein-Kyl bill would deny student visas to applicants from nations on the State Department's list of countries sponsoring terrorism.
The Kennedy-Brownback bill would simply require special scrutiny for student-visa applicants from those countries. Seven countries are on the State Department list: Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.
Both measures endorse changes like improvements in technology for identifying suspected terrorists at immigration checkpoints, but the Kennedy-Brownback bill would require studies, while the competing measure imposes deadlines for some changes.
There are many common elements, like an end to the requirement that Immigration and Naturalization Service inspectors clear airline passengers within 45 minutes.
Senator Feinstein said the four principal sponsors planned to meet next week to see if they could reach common ground, an achievement that would ensure smooth sailing in the Judiciary Committee.
Mr. Kennedy, a leader on immigration legislation since 1965, told the news conference that while there was an "urgent need" to strengthen security and increase the monitoring of foreign nationals in the United States, it must be done "in ways that live up to our history and heritage as a nation of immigrants."
"Immigrants are not the problem," Mr. Kennedy said. "Terrorists are the problem."
Two representatives also appeared at the news conference to announce that they were introducing companion House legislation to the Kennedy-Brownback bill.
Representative Sam Graves, Republican of Missouri, said the measure would "hopefully make our nation much more safe."
Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, said the bill would improve security but recognized that immigration and cross-border visits were essential to the economy. "We can't lock our country down," Mr. Conyers said.
Intelligence-sharing was the major emphasis. Senator John Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat who serves on the judiciary and intelligence committees, put it bluntly, saying, "It's critically important that the people who issue visas have the information about who the bad guys are. 
"The problem," Mr. Edwards continued, "is the intelligence community, specifically the C.I.A., has not prior to Sept. 11 been making that information available."

BYLINE:  By Erik Eckholm (NYT) 

 BODY:
 In a three-day visit to China, the end of an Asian tour, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany is cultivating economic and political ties. Mr. Schroder praised China's leaders for supporting the war on terrorism, but the main focus was on business: he watched German and Chinese business leaders sign agreements for investments and trade worth several billion dollars. China has avidly sought investments and high technology from Europe, in part to reduce dependence on the United States.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg and Green Clash Over Capability in Debate 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Mark Green and Michael R. Bloomberg tore into each other's character and credentials in an often fierce debate last night that laid out differences between the two mayoral candidates over how the city should rebuild downtown, and the best way to repair New York's troubled public school system.
 For 60 minutes, in the second and last debate of the mayoral campaign, Mr. Green, the Democrat, and Mr. Bloomberg, the Republican, hammered and needled each other as each sought -- not subtly -- to portray the other as unprepared to take over at a time when New York may be heading into one of the most severe fiscal crises in its history. 
 At one point, Mr. Bloomberg accused Mr. Green of "smearing" him by quoting "out of context" remarks he had made on, among other things, the need for a third-party witness to corroborate a rape allegation involving an employee of his company. At another moment, Mr. Green asserted that Mr. Bloomberg was being "despicable" and racially divisive for criticizing Mr. Green's intense campaign against Fernando Ferrer to win the Democratic nomination. 
By midway into last night's debate, there was little doubt about what each man was trying to accomplish in what is certainly their final joint appearance. At every opportunity, Mr. Bloomberg set out to mock his opponent, the public advocate, as a careerist government official who, running an office of 40 people, was ill-prepared to take over for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Excerpts, Page D5. 
"My opponent has not had any experience in managing a large organization, in leading a large number of people, in setting large budgets, and in actually doing things," Mr. Bloomberg said. "My opponent's experience is as an analyst and as a public advocate."
Mr. Green sought to paint his rival, the billionaire founder of a communications company, as insensitive to women and minorities, disloyal to the Democratic Party, from which he resigned to run as a Republican for mayor, and as completely unfamiliar with the way government works. Again and again, Mr. Green mentioned the neighborhoods he had visited in New York, in an attempt to paint the wealthy Mr. Bloomberg as out of touch. 
"I don't have your experience in selling computers to businessmen, but you don't have my experience in running a government," Mr. Green declared. He added: "You don't understand the city just by spending a lot of private wealth in ads in an election year. You understand the city by going to where people live and asking what they need and then reflecting it."
The debate between the two men came as the candidates entered the final weekend of a contest that has repeatedly been overshadowed by world events. Last night, in a fitting turn of scheduling for this contest, the fifth game of the World Series began just half an hour after the two candidates finished debating at the studios of WABC-TV.
It also came at a time when some private polls by politicians have suggested that the race might be getting tight. That might account for the decision by Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Green to attack each other so intensely -- and often personally.
That became particularly clear when the two men were given an opportunity to pose questions to each other. It was a moment they had been anticipating, as evidenced by the glee each man displayed before firing off questions that he had prepared for this moment.
"Mark, the way the runoff turned out between you and Freddy Ferrer, isn't it time to say we're going to conduct, you should conduct a real investigation of what happened?" Mr. Bloomberg asked. "Isn't it time that you apologize for the smearing of Freddy Ferrer, saying that he was borderline irresponsible?"
Mr. Bloomberg, who has been making a particular attempt to win over Hispanic voters angered by Mr. Ferrer's loss, continued: "And will you promise right now to stop this politics of personal destruction that you seem to do every time you get close in an election?"
Mr. Green responded by noting that Mr. Ferrer had endorsed Mr. Green's campaign, and asserted that he knew nothing about the telephone calls and leaflets distributed on his behalf that Mr. Ferrer's supporters had denounced as racially divisive.
"What's despicable is the hypocrisy you just heard," Mr. Green said. "This is a man who runs six to seven negative ads, which I haven't whined about. Now he's whining."
He added: "How can I apologize for something that we weren't responsible for?"
When it was Mr. Green's turn to question Mr. Bloomberg, he went through four of what had proved to be problematic remarks attributed to Mr. Bloomberg in the campaign, among them that it was more dangerous to work as a sanitation officer than as a police officer or firefighter, and describing domestic violence as a quality of life crime.
"Would you like now to apologize for or recant any of these four very interesting statements?" Mr. Green said. Mr. Bloomberg responded, "Mark, you've taken them all out of context."
He than proceeded to discuss each of the statements that Mr. Green had raised, as his opponent grinned at the image of Mr. Bloomberg giving the remarks even more exposure. Mr. Bloomberg concluded: "It's the typical smear when the time gets close."
Mr. Green said that the reconstruction of downtown should be overseen by an agency that included city and state officials "to cut through the red tape and the bureaucracy and immediately start digging and rebuilding."
Mr. Bloomberg said the city should run it alone. He said that given the amount of time it would take to clean up the site, the city should not rush in rebuilding. "Adding a level of bureaucracy adds absolutely nothing," he said, adding, "The city should be responsible for its own destiny."
Mr. Green used the exchange to question whether Mr. Bloomberg's years as a business leader had prepared him for government. "If you're in a private company, you can say, 'I'm going to run it all,' " he said. "This is not a private company."
On schools, Mr. Green disagreed with Mr. Bloomberg's opposition to placing computers in every classroom, and to his openness to the use of vouchers in public education. "On these issues, we couldn't be farther apart," Mr. Green said.
Mr. Green called for a reduction in class size. But Mr. Bloomberg said that scarce city resources should go to pay teachers more. "In terms of reducing class size, it is just not a viable option today. We don't have the classrooms and we don't have the money."
A day after Gov. George E. Pataki signed legislation allowing for the opening of six more casinos upstate, Mr. Bloomberg said he opposed such a move for New York City. Mr. Green, who two weeks ago had said he would be open to casinos in the city as a way of bringing in revenues, backed off that position last night. "I'm against it, for now, anywhere in the city," he said.
Mr. Bloomberg was measured and reserved, almost seeming fatigued. By contrast, Mr. Green was peppy, perhaps even overenthused. In his repeated attempt to boast about the communities he had visited, he proclaimed: "There are 200 different groups, 200 neighborhoods from Flushing to Forest Hills from Bayside to Bay Shore, I have been to every community."
Mr. Bloomberg's spokesman, Edward Skyler, issued a statement after the debate questioning, sarcastically, why it was that Mr. Green had been campaigning for mayor of New York City on Long Island.
At another point, Mr. Green was disparaging Mr. Bloomberg for criticizing him as a career politician, noting that he had described politics as an honorable profession in his book. "My rival, on page 232 of his book, 'Bloomberg by Bloomberg'. . ." Mr. Green stopped and considered the title of the book. "And they call me arrogant!" he said, laughing at his own joke.
Mr. Bloomberg said: "I don't remember what's on page 220, it's not the sort of thing that I spend time. . ."
Mr. Green broke in with a correction. "Two thirty two."
"Or 232," Mr. Bloomberg said. "I'm also pleased that you're able to describe yourself, I think a lot of people would agree with your characterization of yourself."

BYLINE:  By Terry Pristin (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 A group of small-business owners whose companies were hurt by the Sept. 11 attack traveled by bus from Manhattan to Washington yesterday to lobby Congress for federal aid. The owners of 48 restaurants, shops and other businesses in Lower Manhattan urged lawmakers to approve legislation being drafted by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Jerrold Nadler, both Democrats from New York. Their bill would provide as much as $1 billion in grants rather than loans.

CHARTER COMMUNICATIONS CUTS 2001 SALES FORECAST

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 Charter Communications, the cable television operator controlled by the billionaire Paul Allen, cut its 2001 sales forecast yesterday and posted a wider third-quarter loss. Sales are expected to rise 12.5 percent to 13.5 percent, down from 15.5 percent, as consumers cut spending amid a slowing economy. The company's third-quarter loss widened to $317.4 million, or $1.08 a share, from $210 million, or 93 cents, a year earlier. Carl Vogel, Charter's chief executive, pledged to help stem the decline and said customer demand for new services was strong. The company has systems in St. Louis, Boston, Fort Worth and Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Mayor Pleads Not Guilty To Charges Of Corruption 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Moments before pleading not guilty to a host of corruption charges in Federal District Court here, Mayor Joseph P. Ganim of Bridgeport was relaxed enough this afternoon to work the courtroom, warmly greeting supporters and members of the press and pantomiming to the courtroom artist to sketch him with more hair.
 But he was solemn as he answered, "Not guilty, Your Honor," to the 24 counts -- including bribery, extortion, racketeering and tax fraud -- read to him by Judge Janet Bond Arterton. 
 Mr. Ganim, the mayor of the state's largest city and not long ago a leading Democratic contender for governor, was arraigned and released on $100,000 bond after surrendering his passport. His next court appearance is set for Dec. 10. 
After the arraignment, Mr. Ganim, 42, appeared on the courthouse steps with his wife, Jennifer, his parents and all seven of his brothers and sisters. His address to the crowd, a few of whom held signs aloft offering encouraging words, echoed the defiant tone of the two prior news conferences he has held since his indictment on Wednesday.
"This isn't the news conference I imagined having in November," he said. "I expected to announce my candidacy for governor. Let me say once again, I am innocent of the charges. I have been betrayed by the people I trusted."
Since June, a trucking company and nine people who were close associates or friends of the mayor have pleaded guilty to various corruption charges in an exhaustive investigation that federal prosecutors say leads to Mr. Ganim.
The indictment charges Mr. Ganim with receiving more than $425,000 in cash, meals, clothing, jewelry, "investment quality" wine and home landscaping services, in exchange for pressuring businesses that received thousands of dollars in city contracts to pay small fortunes in consulting fees to friends and associates, including his former chief of staff and former campaign manager.
After the indictment, Gov. John G. Rowland and United States Representative Christopher Shays, both Republicans, said Mr. Ganim should step down because he must focus on his defense. But the mayor vowed today to remain in office and govern without interruption -- even though his lawyer, Richard Meehan Jr., had just asked the judge for more time before their next court appearance so he and his client can review the voluminous papers and hours of recordings supporting the indictment.
In the meantime, the state and the city are tightening their policies to ensure fiscal accountability in a City Hall still led by Mr. Ganim.
In September, the State Department of Economic and Community Development informed Bridgeport of more stringent controls on state aid. Bridgeport will be reimbursed quarterly for its expenses, rather than receiving the money upfront. Since 1995, the state has given $120 million to Bridgeport for infrastructure-related projects, including the Seaview Avenue and Lacey Manufacturing industrial parks still under construction.
Governor Rowland's spokesman, Dean Pagani, said today that state and federal reviews have so far turned up no indication that state money was used in any of the Bridgeport bribery or kickback schemes.
"We've performed several reviews of state projects and state accounts as these developments have unfolded," Mr. Pagani said. "If it turns out state funds were misused, we'll address it." 
The state is conducting internal audits of the money given Bridgeport since 1995, and plans to keep auditing the city's books. Additional project managers and accountants were recently hired on a contract basis to perform a more intensive review to ensure that no state funds were misspent by Bridgeport, said Rita Zangari, deputy commissioner of the Department of Economic and Community Development.
In addition, the City Council has started a more rigorous review of its budget and purchasing policies, said John M. Fabrizi, council president and the man who would, according to City Charter, replace Mr. Ganim should he resign or be removed from office. Next week, the Council will vote to establish a new oversight committee, separate from its ethics committee, to investigate any formal complaints from city employees or vendors who seek work from the city.
"We've learned from this," said Mr. Fabrizi, referring to the municipal corruption scandal. "The City Council is absolutely determined to change city government and make sure things like this can't happen again."

HEADLINE: A Mainstay of U.S. Job Creation Is Hit Hard by Sept. 11 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
The services sector, which has been America's main engine of job creation since World War II, has been dealt a powerful blow by the events of Sept. 11.
Of the 619,000 jobs that disappeared from September to October, 111,000 were counted by the government as service positions. The decline was the sector's largest since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began keeping track. 
 Travel-related businesses in particular cut their staffs as the terrorist attacks made Americans reluctant to fly. The number of jobs in hotels fell by 46,000, compared with an average monthly decline of 5,000 from July to September. 
 The number of jobs defined as "auto services" -- a category that includes jobs at car-rental agencies and in parking lots -- fell by 13,000. Normally the category does not change significantly from month to month. 
"We know that car rentals in airports are in very bad shape with the big cutback in air-transportation use," said Lois Plunkert, a senior economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "And perhaps the auto parking at airports would have been affected, too."
About 81,000 jobs in the retail trade, which includes car dealerships and restaurants, disappeared from September to October. Government data also suggested that stores are not hiring holiday help this year as much as usual. 
But economists counseled against concluding that the whole services sector suddenly nose-dived. They said that for statistical reasons, a large number of jobs that the government counts as services actually involve manufacturing duties. Because of this, they said, a portion of the services sector's job losses were attributable to the decline of American manufacturing, which has been going on for years.
John Stinson, a labor economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the line separating service and manufacturing jobs has been blurred in recent years by the sharp increase in the number of contingency workers, known as temps. Such workers are officially defined as service employees because they are hired and paid by temporary agencies, Mr. Stinson said. But many temps are sent to perform manufacturing jobs by their agencies. 
Since temps are usually the first to be laid off in a downturn, their growing presence throughout the economy has made the services sector more prone to the cyclical ups and downs that used to afflict mainly the construction and manufacturing sectors.
"There has been a lot of weakness in the temporary-help agencies," Mr. Stinson said. "It's not just a one-month thing at all. A lot of it is related to manufacturing."
Jeffrey A. Joerres, the chief executive of Manpower, the large temporary-help concern, said the company had found recession-level demand for temps in August, when it conducted its most recent quarterly survey.
But demand had been tapering off even before that, he said, adding that Manpower gets about 40 percent of its revenues from placing people in light manufacturing jobs.
The new public concerns about security did swell the ranks of one kind of services-sector job, however: detective, guard and armored-car services employment increased by 8,000 jobs in September and 22,000 jobs in October. Before the terrorist attacks, the category had not been growing at all.
Employment in mortgage banking also appeared to be expanding, spurred by the recent declines in interest rates. Mortgage banks added employees from September to October, even as other financial-services firms were laying people off.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
Analysts Worry of Ripple Effect In Argentina's Latest Debt Plan

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Argentina's newest proposal to reduce its debt burden might lead to a default that could make it very difficult for emerging-market countries to borrow in the future.
 So far, there have not been too many ripples beyond the impact on Argentina's neighbor, Brazil. 
 But the longer-term outlook depends a lot on how the debt is restructured to lower Argentina's financial burden and on whether investors are forced to accept a package they are unhappy with.
Problems with the restructuring program are already appearing. 
"In the short run, this has been telegraphed so long that the knock-on effect is going to be muted," said Carl Ross, senior managing director for emerging markets at Bear, Stearns. "I am concerned about the long-term contagion. If Argentina defaults, there will not be an immediate cascading of countries defaulting. But over time there could be.
"In the future," he added, "countries looking at Argentina's experience might conclude that if this is where we are going to end up anyway, why put our populations through the pain?" Argentina has already suffered through four years of recession and large budget cuts to meet its debt payments.
The issue of whether Argentina defaults during its effort to restructure as much as $95 billion in bonds held by Argentinian banks and institutions and foreigners is complicated by the definition of what is a default. But definition aside, a restructuring that leaves many investors unhappy with the deal will not be positive, Mr. Ross said.
An investor in emerging market debt, who spoke on the condition of not being named, said that a drawn out and messy restructuring of Argentina's debt, especially if it were repeated in other countries, could dry up the lending pool for emerging-market countries.
Argentina faces other tough problems that could undermine its effort to reach a deal with its creditors. Problems include declining tax revenue as the global economic slowdown drags Argentina's economy lower; the need to meet a zero deficit target to comply with terms for additional aid from the International Monetary Fund; difficult negotiations with the country's provinces on cutting spending; the withdrawal of money from the banking system by frightened investors; and obtaining the additional cash needed to offer its creditors a debt swap that is attractive to them while also reducing the country's debt burden enough to ease the pressure on the government and the economy.
Beyond all of that, any recovery for Argentina depends on turning the economy around, a task that has become even more difficult since the terrorist attack on the United States.
"There is a lot of uncertainty right now," said Joyce Chang, global head of international fixed income research at J. P. Morgan. She said that the prices of Argentina's bonds in the market already showed that investors "are pricing in an effective default."
The fact that the fallout from the current stage of Argentina's crisis has been limited is seen in the performance of bond prices this week. While Argentina's floating rate bond maturing in 2005 fell 17.5 points, or 27.6 percent, to $46, the popular Brazilian C bond maturing in 2014 dropped just 1.75 points, or 2.5 percent.
Bond prices in the rest of Latin America fell even less, with a popular bond in Mexico down just three-tenths of a point. And the Brazilian real, which has fallen 27 percent this year as the Argentine crisis deepened, has been in a mild rally since Sept. 21, rising 6 percent.
One reason for the moderate reaction is that many investors have already pulled out of Argentina and the countries they think could be hurt by its crisis. In addition, there are fewer big bettors in emerging markets since Russia defaulted on its debt in 1998.
Four large American banks have significant exposure to Argentine and other Latin American debt, and a new Lehman Brothers analysis says they "have been under pressure on renewed concerns about Argentina's debt woes." The four are FleetBoston, Citigroup, Bank of America and J. P. Morgan Chase. Lehman Brothers said that FleetBoston's Latin American loans accounted for about 10 percent of net income and noted that Citigroup said in the second quarter that Argentine loans contributed less than 2 percent to earnings. J. P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America each have about $900 million in loans in Argentina.
Problems with Argentina's plan to reduce its debt burden arose as soon as the country issued the barest of details. In a statement of economic policy changes to deal with the crisis, the government said Thursday that it wanted to save about $4 billion a year in debt service costs by cutting the aggregate interest rate on its debt to 7 percent from about 11 percent now. That is a reduction of nearly 40 percent. In exchange, the government has said it will offer guarantees of payment of principle and interest.
"It is difficult to believe that they have enough credit enhancements to go from 11 percent to 7 percent," Mr. Ross of Bear Stearns said, referring to the sweeteners the government would need to offer investors. "This is why the market is a little confused right now."
Because there are no details, investors are assuming a debt restructuring would be something like the famous Brady bonds used in the late 1980's and early 1990's to restructure Latin American debt, including that of Argentina. All those deals included significant debt reduction in exchange for guarantees of principle and interest payments.
The trader in emerging market debt who asked not to be named said there was a 50 percent chance now that the restructuring of Argentina's debt would be "a long, drawn-out messy process."
On the issue of default, the major credit rating agencies have already indicated that they will give a default rating to the new bonds in a debt exchange like the one Argentina is contemplating. That is because the value of the new bonds will be less than the value of the old bonds. A legal default, according to analysts, is more complicated, requiring a triggering event, like missing an interest or principle payment, followed by a vote of a majority or more of the bondholders to force the default.
Argentina says that it wants its exchange to be voluntary and that if enough bondholders agree to it, a legal default could be avoided, analysts said. But there will be a lot of pressure on investors, including banks and pension funds in Argentina, to agree, so a voluntary agreement may be less voluntary than it appears. And one may not be able to be reached.

 BODY:
Jobless Rate Rises to 5.4% As 400,000 Are Dismissed
More than 400,000 Americans lost their jobs last month, the most for a single month in nearly two decades, and the unemployment rate jumped to 5.4 percent, its highest level since 1996, from 4.9 percent in September.
 Analysts believe the economy is clearly in a recession and even though they expect the Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates in another attempt to stimulate the economy, they say the question now is how deep will the recession be? Page A1. 

Microsoft Antitrust Case Advances
Microsoft and the federal government finalized their settlement of the antitrust case, agreeing to a number of covenants that give more flexibility to computer makers installing the company's Windows software while restricting pricing agreements that Microsoft can impose. The company, run by Bill Gates, also will have to form a three-member committee to monitor compliance with the agreement. But state prosecutors declined to endorse the deal and persuaded a judge to hold off approval until they can review it. A1.

Air Travel Security Gaps Persist
Major gaps remain in aviation security nearly two months after the terrorist attacks. With Congress stalemated over whether to federalize airport screening workers, some airlines and airports are taking steps to improve security on their own, but passengers still encounter lapses they find alarming. B7.

Analysts Warn of Argentine Default
Wall Street economists and analysts portrayed a new Argentine effort to restructure its $132 billion national debt as tantamount to a default and the largest financial collapse of any country in history. Argentine bond prices plummeted and interest rates soared in anticipation of a default on nearly $95 billion in bonds, more than twice the amount that Russia failed to honor three years ago. A4.

Cigna's Third-Quarter Profit Falls
Cigna, a provider of health insurance, said that its third-quarter profit fell 2.9 percent, to $270 million, as the cost of medical care rose and life and disability insurance claims increased after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. C2.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: RELIEF; 
U.S. Orders New Aid to Help Avert Famine in Afghanistan

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that it was spending $8.2 million in emergency aid for Afghanistan, most of which would be used to buy trucks to transport 30,000 tons of wheat immediately to northern Afghanistan. It was the second emergency purchase this week intended to avert what the administration is now calling famine conditions.
 With only days before the first snows fall in Afghanistan's central mountains, Andrew S. Natsios, the administrator for the Agency for International Development, said relief officials were buying the trucks in central Asia this week and would begin using them immediately to deliver the food. 
 The new trucks will be loaded with $6 million worth of wheat being purchased in Kazakhstan this week. Because of its increasing concern over a food crisis in Afghanistan, the administration approved the local wheat purchase on Wednesday, saying there was not enough time to buy American wheat and then ship it to the region. 
"With these trucks we're buying time; we'll be able to move the food in within days and not have to wait for shipments that are already on the move but won't arrive for weeks," Mr. Natsios said.
The announcement was part of a ceremony marking the 40th anniversary of A.I.D., which was founded by President Kennedy and inspired by Gen. George C. Marshall and his plan to rebuild Europe. 
In an address to more than 1,000 A.I.D. staffers, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell invoked the spirit of General Marshall and promised that the United States would rebuild Afghanistan when the war was over.
"We will help them rebuild, we will not abandon them," he said. "We've made that geopolitical decision, and you are the ones who will make sure that happens."
After months of hearing conflicting views from the administration on the advisability of rebuilding devastated nations and installing friendly governments in them, the agency with that task cheered the secretary of state. 
Secretary Powell also told them their largely unheralded work in Afghanistan would become more difficult but more essential to a victory over terrorism.
"Osama bin Laden launched that attack from Afghanistan, a place where you have been helping people for years," he said. "What you have done in Afghanistan and will continue to do is an important part of our foreign policy." 
It is the job of the A.I.D. to ensure that 250,000 tons of food are transported into the country by the end of the year, according to Mr. Natsios, who called the effort a crucial part of the campaign to convince the Afghan people that the United States is their friend, not their enemy.
While the Pentagon issues daily reports of food rations the military is dropping into Afghanistan by air -- to date it has dropped roughly 500 tons -- A.I.D. has been working with the United Nations and private relief organizations to ship in the bulk of the food and supplies.
In the last week, relief groups said they were afraid they were losing the race to bring enough food to prevent widespread starvation in Afghanistan this winter.
Even before the United States began its campaign in October, A.I.D. had warned that Afghanistan was "on the verge of widespread and precipitous famine" after 22 years of war and conflict and three years of drought.
After the bombing began, officials said relief agencies had increasing difficulty trucking in wheat. Taliban officials and bandits have stolen food stocks and are charging taxes for passage. Truck drivers were reluctant to drive from Pakistan into Taliban-controlled areas and the Pentagon and British Defense Ministry had to set up a coordination cell in Islamabad to prevent airstrikes from hitting relief convoys.
Now, most of the trucks with new food shipments will enter Afghanistan from the north -- through Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan -- and transport shipments to what is called the "famine belt."
With the prospect of subzero temperatures, relief officials worry that the weak and the young could die as easily from the cold as from hunger, making it imperative to ship in clothing, medicine and building materials as well as food.
"The good news is that three-quarters of the population at risk for starvation live in the northern half of Afghanistan, outside of the war zones," Mr. Natsios said.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ASSESSING THE THREAT; 
As Troops Guard Major Bridges, a Warning Is Debated

BYLINE:  By BERNARD WEINRAUB with NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Caravans of armed National Guard troops and Highway Patrol officers fanned out across bridges in California's largest cities today to guard against potential terrorist attacks that Gov. Gray Davis suggested on Thursday might be imminent.
 But the severity of the threat remained a subject of debate, and Mr. Davis's decision to disclose it served as a source of irritation, if not anger, among some state and federal law enforcement officials. 
 On a clear sunlit day across the state, the governor's warning made some drivers nervous, but not reluctant to cross the four bridges that were, he said, under threat. Traffic was only slightly less than normal for a Friday, and slowed down only as drivers gawked at the troops and officers guarding the bridges and the helicopters that hovered above. "Traffic during our morning rush hour was down about 7 percent for a Friday, but now it's about the same," said Kary Witt, manager of the Golden Gate Bridge, as he drove north this afternoon. Speaking on his car phone. Mr. Witt said, "I see the Coast Guard beneath the bridge and a lot of troops on the bridge. It's business as usual." 
Mr. Davis announced on Thursday that federal officials had "credible evidence" that terrorists might be targetting four California bridges. Mr. Davis listed the Golden Gate and Bay Bridge in the San Francisco Bay area, the Coronado Bridge connecting San Diego and Coronado and the Vincent Thomas Bridge at the Port of Los Angeles as possible targets in the next few days. The announcement and its aftermath dominated local television news and startled Californians, especially in the San Francisco area. 
After Mr. Davis issued the warning, federal authorities took the unusual step of releasing a copy of a threat advisory sent earlier in the week to officials and law enforcement agencies in the West. "Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast," the advisory said.
Today, F.B.I. officials said they still had not been able to corroborate the threat, describing the information as "somewhat credible."
At a news conference today, Mr. Davis said he went public with the information after receiving information about potential attacks from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Customs Service. He said he believed it was important to announce the warning because it specifically mentioned suspension bridges in the West and covered a specific span of time, Nov. 2 through Nov. 7. "I'm confident I made the right decision," he said. "I have no regrets."
In public comments, Bush administration officials seemed to choose their words carefully in responding to Mr. Davis. "I respect the decision that Governor Davis made: he exercised his judgment," said Tom Ridge, the homeland security director. "Had he chosen not to reveal, I would have respected that as well." 
Mr. Ridge said, "Obviously Governor Davis thought that one thing that he could do to enhance the security of people using those bridges was to make a public announcement. We did not encourage him to do so."
But Mr. Ridge said the information sent to Mr. Davis and others made plain that it was "uncorroborated."
Attorney General John Ashcroft also said that the F.B.I. warning about the possible attack on bridges on the West Coast was based on a threat that authorities believed had "relative credibility."
President Bush, too, seemed supportive of Mr. Davis. "Part of the homeland defense is active and strong communications so that governors and/or local authorities can harden targets, respond to uncorroborated evidence and to protect their people," Mr. Bush said in a Rose Garden appearance.
Privately, F.B.I. officials on both coasts remained critical of Mr. Davis, and they rebutted his contention that he had apprised the bureau of his intention to publicize the threat at a press conference on Thursday naming a new terrorism czar. In fact, bureau officials said, Ron Iden, the assistant director for the F.B.I.'s Los Angeles office, was just as surprised as the reporters around when Mr. Davis revealed the warning. 
Some authorities were bluntly critical of Mr. Davis. Charles Plummer, the sheriff of Alameda County, whose officers cover a swath of the California coast from the Oregon border to Monterey Bay, said that Mr. Davis's decision was harmful and that it violated the implicit trust between federal and state law-enforcement agencies. 
"Do you think the F.B.I. is going to tell the governor anything in the future? I don't think so," Mr. Plummer said.
Other prominent West Coast officials, like Mayor James K. Hahn of Los Angeles, Gov. John Kitzhaber of Oregon, and Gov. Gary Locke of Washington had also been notified of the F.B.I. alert. But these officials and others decided not to go public.
"If we received a corroborated and credible threat, we would notify the public of an impending danger," said Dana Middleton, a spokeswoman for Governor Locke. "This was neither."
Mr. Davis, who is up for re-election in 2002, has been under political pressure to reverse his plunging poll numbers brought on by the statewide energy crisis earlier in the year and made worse by a severe economic slowdown in recent months. 
Some analysts suggested that Mr. Davis's aggressive response to the F.B.I.'s warning was prompted in part by a desire to lift his image.
"Every politician, including Gray Davis, wants to be Rudy Giuliani," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst here, referring to the New York mayor. "Davis is an incumbent running for re-election. He wants to be perceived as being in control of a crisis. He wants to be able to resonate with his constituency."
But Mr. Davis's decision to issue the warning may have had a downside, too. "The bad part for Gray is that the last thing you want to be is controversial," said Bill Carrick, a Democratic political strategist here. "He looks like he could have said things there were exaggerated. And that puts him in a bad spot. He may be well-intentioned, but I don't think you want to have a debate in the media about whether or not this was the right way to handle it. And that's what's happening."
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Mr. Davis, denied that politics was in any way related to the decision. "The governor's top priority is to make sure Californians are safe," Mr. Maviglio said. "He feels it's his responsibility to inform the citizens of when there is a credible threat. As the president said, if he were in the governor's shoes he might have done the same thing." Mr Maviglio added that quick polls taken after Mr. Davis's announcement found that an overwhelming majority of Californians believed it should have been made.
Even so, most commuters seemed to take the warning in stride. "I haven't heard a blooming thing, nothing much is happening," said Fern Cooper, a spokeswoman with the San Diego police. An official at the Golden Gate Bridge Authority said that between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., a total of 13,750 vehicles crossed the bridge. Over the last four Fridays, an average of 14,700 vehicles crossed the bridge between those hours.
Robert Kim, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol in San Diego, said that the 11,179-foot Coronado Bridge handled about 75,000 cars a day, and that today seemed perfectly normal. Nancy David, 52, on vacation on Coronado Island with her husband, David, a retired store manager from San Bernardino, Calif., said she and her friends had initially decided to stay at their hotel and not cross the bridge. "Then we decided that was silly," Ms. David said. "But I'll probably hold my breath all the way across."
Nathan Hiedo, a clerk in a liquor store on Orange Avenue who lives 25 miles north of San Diego, said he considered taking a roundabout way this morning. But then he decided to cross the bridge to Coronado, a town of 26,000.
"You know, the U.S. Army, there are fighting over there, in Afghanistan, and we are fighting here, in America, by not being afraid and driving across that bridge," Mr. Hiedo said. "When I think of what they are doing over there, I know that I must do my part here, too. Let's face it. Our job is easier than theirs."

HEADLINE: Cincinnati's Revival Sags Under Weight of Falling Revenue 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: CINCINNATI 

 BODY:
The two new stadiums along the Ohio River in downtown Cincinnati are supposed to anchor a complex of condominiums, stores, offices, restaurants, parks and a world-class history museum. But between the stadiums, the six-block stretch of riverfront is barren and paved over, serving only as a makeshift parking lot.
 Downtown redevelopment, the great hope of urban planners for reviving older cities, has been delayed in Cincinnati, a casualty of the gathering recession. The sales tax revenue that supports construction has fallen this year, and city officials are seeking ways to keep the project going. 
 Other cities are facing similar tax revenue shortfalls, restricting the financing for downtown redevelopment for the first time since the early 1990's.
"The sales tax is a big, big chunk of state and local funding everywhere in America for these projects," said Martin Regalia, chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce.
The slowdown in the national economy, entering its 16th month in November, has already dried up investment, reduced consumer spending and led to hundreds of thousands of layoffs. In recent months, it has hit states and municipalities.
With recent federal administrations bent on shrinking government, public spending has shifted to states and localities. Together, in 1999, they spent an amount equal to 62 percent of federal spending -- up from 54 percent in 1990 and 42 percent in 1960, according to a University of Michigan study. 
Some of this spending went into downtown redevelopment. Erecting stadiums to retain or lure professional sports teams became the focus in cities like Cincinnati, Cleveland, Los Angeles and Baltimore. 
Beyond stadiums, public money is going into the roads, parking garages, parks and other infrastructure so private developers can put up commercial buildings, apartments and theaters near the ballparks. 
As long as the economy boomed, there was tax revenue to finance downtown redevelopment, whose cost in Cincinnati is approaching $1 billion. Even now, officials here talk of a delay, but never cancellation.
"If we bail out now, the momentum may be lost forever," said Thomas L. Neyer Jr., one of the three elected commissioners who govern Hamilton County, which includes Cincinnati. "If the economy requires us to wait a year or two, so be it."
No company is a bigger supporter of downtown redevelopment than Procter & Gamble, whose headquarters, factories and research centers here are a huge presence. Charlotte Otto, a senior executive there, resists even a short delay. She speaks of "creative financing" -- a bridge loan, for example, that would be repaid when the recession ends and tax revenue rises again -- to keep the riverfront project going.
"Given the challenges, it would be easier to say, 'Let's put off redevelopment for a year,' " Ms. Otto said. "But we can't; the riverfront project is really the catalyst for a vital downtown." 
But some experts take a different view of the value of such redevelopment projects. Where such projects have seemed to work -- Faneuil Hall in Boston and South Street Seaport in New York, for example -- the real generators of jobs and growth were Boston's appeal as a high-tech center and New York's role as a financial powerhouse, said Edward Glaeser, a Harvard economist and urban specialist.
"These cities would have prospered without redevelopment projects," Mr. Glaeser said. "They were only an added attraction."
That is an argument largely ignored in many cities. Driven by a yearning for urban revival -- and the political and commercial success it seemed to promise -- local governments have channeled hundreds of millions of dollars into the new projects.
In Cincinnati's case, revenue from the sales tax, which is levied by the state, pays the monthly installments on the bonds floated to build the stadiums, at a cost of more than $700 million. Hamilton County has traditionally received half a percentage point of the 5.5 percent state sales tax collected in the county. While the economy was booming, the county's voters agreed in 1996 to add half a percentage point to the state levy, bringing it to 6 percent here, to help finance the riverfront construction. To quiet opposition, however, part is paid out for education and for rebates on property taxes.
Opponents of redevelopment argue that the money should have been spent on schools or on rebuilding commercial districts in ghetto areas. 
"The riverfront complex becomes the playground of people in the suburbs," said the Rev. Damon Lynch 3rd, pastor of the New Prospect Baptist Church, in a downtown ghetto neighborhood. "They want to drive in, enjoy the arts, the fine dining, the riverfront, the ballet, the symphony, and drive home."
Now the slowing economy, aggravated by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, is doing what the opposition could not: forcing postponement of another major bond offering, this one to build six blocks of underground parking garages between the stadiums, at a cost of at least $60 million. They are needed to lift the river's flood level. The complex of commercial establishments and cultural centers could then be built atop the garages.
The financing for this construction was based on the assumption that the sales tax revenue would continue to increase at an annual rate of 5 percent to 7 percent, as it did in the 1990's. Instead, sales tax revenue began to fall this year and through September was 3.5 percent below last year's collections.
Only one small part of the vast underground garage -- the only part financed under the existing bonds -- is being built. A single orange construction crane, swinging gracefully back and forth, marks the site along the otherwise inactive riverbank, cleared now of the industrial structures that once marked Cincinnati as a thriving city. That section of the garage is to be the foundation for a privately financed museum celebrating the underground railroad, which brought slaves to freedom in Cincinnati, across the river from Kentucky.
The hope is that the elaborate exhibitions will rival Washington's Holocaust museum in attracting visitors from all over the world. Construction is to start early next year.

Peres and Arafat Shake But Do Not Talk, Yet
The Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres, shook hands with the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, at a luncheon in Majorca, where they are attending an economic conference. While Mr. Arafat's advisers talked up the idea of a meeting, Mr. Peres's advisers played it down, saying he had no mandate yet for negotiations. A4

A Default, of Sorts, in Argentina
Wall Street economists and analysts in Argentina portrayed a new Argentine effort to restructure $132 billion in national debt as tantamount to a default and the largest financial collapse of any country in history. Argentine bond prices plummeted and interest rates soared to record levels. In the last several days, Argentines have withdrawn more than $500 million from bank accounts. A4

Moscow Damps Arms Hopes
Russia's foreign minister said "difficult consultations" still blocked a restructuring of the arms-control framework that governs the nuclear policies of the United States and Russia, appearing to rule out an agreement between President Vladimir V. Putin and President Bush when they meet this month in Texas. A6

Virginia's High Court Upholds Cross Burning
The State Supreme Court, ruling 4 to 3, struck down a state law that since the early 1950's had banned cross burning, saying the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects expression no matter how offensive. The majority relied on a similar ruling by the United States Supreme Court in a Minnesota case in 1992. Virginia's attorney general said the state would ask the United States Supreme Court to review the case. A8

'3 Strikes' Sentence Is Voided
A three-judge panel of the federal appeals court in San Francisco, voting 2 to 1, threw out as unconstitutionally harsh a shoplifter's 50-year prison sentence under California's "three-strikes" law, raising the possibility of hundreds of other challenges. A8

Bloomberg Gains Ground As Mayor's Race Tightens
The race between Mark Green, the Democrat, and Michael R. Bloomberg, the Republican, has narrowed considerably, with 42 percent of those likely to vote favoring Mr. Green and 37 percent favoring Mr. Bloomberg, a difference that is not statistically significant, a New York Times poll found. New Yorkers believe both are qualified to be mayor, despite Mr. Bloomberg's lack of political experience, which Mr. Green has frequently cited. Further, they widely regard Mr. Bloomberg, a wealthy entrepreneur, as having "strong qualities of leadership." A1

Bad Economic News, Troops on the Golden Gate, Angry Firefighters

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
 There was more economic fallout from Sept. 11, none of it good. The government had already reported that the economy shrank over the summer, for the first time in eight years. Now, the word from the Labor Department was that 415,000 Americans had lost their jobs in October, the most for a single month since 1980. The unemployment rate jumped half a percentage point, to 5.4 percent, well above the 3.9 percent rate just 13 months before.

AN ECONOMIC STIMULUS -- Not that the economy was going like gangbusters before the terrorist strikes. But the attacks seem to have dashed hopes among business leaders for a speedy recovery after a mild recession. Estimates were that one-fourth of the jobs that were lost was a result of September's terrorism. "It is not good news for America," President Bush acknowledged.
 His proposed solution is a stimulus package approved by the House, one that relies mainly on tax cuts, especially for businesses. But the Democrats who control the Senate want a greater emphasis on public spending. Tax cuts, they say, are unlikely to persuade businesses to hire and to spend, not when profits are shrinking in a weak economy. Mr. Bush says he wants a final bill on his desk by Nov. 30, but it was far from clear if Congress would meet his deadline.

PATROLLING THE GOLDEN GATE -- As the economy turned down, security worries bumped up, most visibly in California. There, armed troops patrolled the Golden Gate and several other bridges after Gov. Gray Davis warned of "credible evidence" pointing to an imminent terrorist attack. Traffic seemed close to normal, though. And some law enforcement officials, local and federal, were annoyed with Mr. Davis. They were not as sure as he seemed to be about the credibility of his evidence.

ANTHRAX MYSTERY -- Nor did any hard proof emerge in the anthrax threat. The director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Robert S. Mueller III, acknowledged that the government had no clue who was responsible -- a foreign terrorist cell, a domestic hate group or perhaps a deranged loner with scientific know-how. In effect, Mr. Mueller deputized all Americans, urging them to do amateur sleuthing of their own. They could, for example, study the handwriting on anthrax letters that have been made public to see if it looks familiar.
One hopeful glimmer was the absence of evidence of any more bioterrorism beyond the mail-borne anthrax seen in recent weeks. There were fears of possibly new attacks after the death of Kathy T. Nguyen, a New York hospital worker, who did not fit the dominant victim profile: postal workers and employees of news organizations. Now, health investigators suspect that Ms. Nguyen's infection was linked somehow to anthrax-contaminated mail, same as the other cases. But exactly how she caught the disease was still a puzzle.

A WIDER NET -- Anger over terrorism impelled the Bush administration to expand the list of suspected terrorists beyond a few groups like Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's network. Tough financial sanctions were imposed on 22 organizations, including Hamas, Hezbollah and others with broad support in the Arab world. Irish and Spanish groups were also named. The action pleased Israel's allies and disappointed supporters of Arab countries, which wanted to keep the spotlight only on Al Qaeda.
For all the brave attempts at stiff upper lips, the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks rubbed emotions raw, nowhere more so than in New York, and among no group more brutally than the city's firefighters. They lost 343 of their colleagues in the World Trade Center. Many still have trouble coming to grips with that staggering number.

A PROTEST IN GRIEF -- Frustrations boiled over at ground zero, where firefighters marched in anger over a City Hall order reducing their numbers at the site for safety reasons. The ruins had become too unstable to have a lot of people gathered around, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said. But firefighters, focused on the search for buried colleagues, insisted on being allowed to remain in force on what they consider hallowed ground. So they protested. A dozen of them were arrested after they broke through barricades and scuffled with police officers (who lost 23 of their own on Sept. 11).
It was a painful coda to a tragedy already hard enough to bear. He understood the firefighters' anguish, Mr. Giuliani said. But no one is above the law, he said, and the safety experts must be heeded "even if our hearts may tell us something different." CLYDE HABERMAN

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE GOVERNOR; 
Talk About Terrorism Puts Heat on Gov. Davis

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif., Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Gov. Gray Davis presided today over a feel-good session on how to right the badly listing California economy, but no matter how hard the business and labor leaders here tried to focus on tax credits and accelerated spending, the talk inevitably veered toward terrorism -- and Mr. Davis's sudden, ticklish problem with that issue.
 By announcing on Thursday that terrorists might try to attack California's major bridges, Mr. Davis created a stir. But the attention was focused more intensely on him than on the bridges, underscoring the complex problems he faces as he prepares to run for re-election next year. 
 While Mr. Davis managed to get through the summer without the rolling power blackouts that many experts had predicted, he has since had to deal with a sour state economy, potentially tough Republican challengers and now the threat of terrorist attacks.
Politicians might say it is better to be called an alarmist than to be the one who failed to alert the public to a genuine threat. But the Federal Bureau of Investigation has expressed surprise and annoyance that Mr. Davis had passed on an "uncorroborated" threat, one that the agency had never intended to become public.
Mr. Davis's political opponents then added to his mounting troubles by suggesting he had been trying to gain political advantage, or by questioning his judgment. 
Dave Cox, for example, the head of the Republican caucus in the State Assembly, said the decision to publicize the threat had been a tough call for the governor, a Democrat, and then added, "I think the American public needs to know, but we need to be cautious about not frightening it."
A Republican investment banker, William E. Simon Jr., who announced his candidacy for governor today, put it bluntly: "When you come out and make blanket statements that bridges might be attacked, that sends a certain level of panic and fear in people."
And while Mr. Davis's longtime allies expressed support, it was conspicuously tepid.
The issue touched directly on a proposal made repeatedly at this conference: that the state should sharply increase spending for a tourism campaign. Restaurants, hotels and theme parks have suffered steep declines since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.
But if the campaign were to rely on famous attractions, one would clearly be the Golden Gate Bridge. Kathleen Connell, the state controller, said that such images could not be used now, and that any campaign would now be tougher to mount.
"His comments had a short-term negative impact," said Ms. Connell, a Democrat, "but it could be even worse in the long term . That image of the bridges being so vulnerable is going to remain in people's minds." 
The overall issue -- security versus full disclosure -- was summed up by Ed Leamers, an economic forecaster at the University of California at Los Angeles, who criticized the heavy police presence at the Los Angeles International Airport, calling it "more alarming than secure."
The same F.B.I. warning Mr. Davis received went to other Western governors and local law enforcement officials, and none disclosed it -- a fact that some politicians tacked on to what otherwise sounded like votes of confidence.
"I support whatever decision the governor made, and do not want to second-guess him," said Bill Jones, California's secretary of state and a Republican candidate for governor. "But, having said that, it seems strange that the governor of Washington State got the same threat and chose not to release it."
The criticism is something Mr. Davis, who sailed through two years in office with strong public support, has been hearing a lot of lately. The volume of the attacks seemed a reflection of the sudden vulnerability of a politician who had appeared likely to glide into a second term.
Mr. Davis has rejected that view. In an interview today at the conference he insisted, "I made the call that I know is right." He denied there was any political influence over his decision. 
But Democrats expressed little support. Robert M. Hertzberg, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly and usually a strong ally, said he could not judge because he did not know all the facts that Mr. Davis had relied on.
John Burton, the Democratic president of the State Senate, said he wondered why, if the threat was that great, traffic on the big bridges was not halted.
"We have word that terrorists are going to blow up the bridge, but that people should keep crossing it?" Mr. Burton asked.
The governor said he would consider many of the suggestions made at the economic conference, and repeated that, since this was only the second specific threat the F.B.I. had received since Sept. 11, it seemed better to tell people than keep them in the dark.
"There is no playbook for these times," Mr. Davis said.

HEADLINE: A Shameful Vote on Air Safety 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Bush's Approach on Plane Security Chosen by House" (front page, Nov. 2):
 I wonder when the American people will wake up to what the Republican right is doing to them. 
Once again, these politicians have demonstrated their allegiance to special interests at the expense of the average American. 
 Many "moderate" Republicans also failed to support the Democratic proposal to federalize airport security, thereby joining with their right-wing colleagues to perpetuate a system whose failures seem apparent. Regrettably, the Republican stance is consistent with an economic "stimulus" package that shamelessly caters to corporate political contributors.
In the wake of the most cataclysmic event on American soil since the Civil War, House Republicans are busy binding up their contributors' wounds rather than their nation's.

 KPMG Consulting Inc., a top consulting firm, said yesterday that it would cut up to 400 jobs, or 3 percent of its work force, and take a second-quarter charge of $15 million to $20 million as it copes with the economic slowdown. KPMG, based in McLean, Va., also said 300 employees had chosen to take voluntary leaves of absence as part of a work force alternative program. The job cuts will be spread across the company's global work force with "very small impacts in any one area," the company said. KPMG is part of a large number of financial services companies cutting costs as the threat of recession looms.

CAR MAKER'S ATLANTA PLANT TO IDLE 2,100 WORKERS

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The Ford Motor Company will close an Atlanta car plant for a week starting on Monday, idling about 2,100 workers, to reduce production because of lower orders from rental-car companies and businesses. The plant makes the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable sedans. United States auto sales surged 24 percent last month, and Ford's sales nationwide rose 36 percent in October, helped by no-interest loans. Orders from rental-car companies and businesses looking to add to fleets slid 30 percent last month and have been declining since July as a slowing economy reduces travel demand and prompts companies to scale back on purchasing, a Ford sales analyst, George Pipas, said.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Americans Trust Uncle Sam 

BYLINE:  By ALEXANDER STILLE 

 BODY:
The titles of the new releases say it all: "The Trouble with Government," "Disaffected Democracies" and "Why People Don't Trust Government." This fall a host of new books with a variety of new theories tried to explain a well-established, generation-long trend: Americans' steadily declining trust in government. Then September's terrorist attacks turned prevailing ideas about people's faith in their political institutions upside down, along with so much else.
 The public's reactions to the events of the last two months have been so extreme and apparently contradictory that they have sent social scientists back to the drawing boards, providing them with a real-life, real-time laboratory in which to measure the complex and often ambivalent relationship Americans have with their government. 
 After the attacks, arguably a result of an enormous government failure in intelligence and airport security, many Americans turned to government and found a renewed faith in some institutions that have not been held in high regard in recent decades, like Congress and the media. Within weeks, the number of people who said they trusted the government to do what is right most of the time hit its highest levels in 30 years, rising to 55 percent in a recent New York Times/CBS News poll. And suddenly a majority of Americans felt that the country was moving in the right direction, even though the stock market was falling precipitately and hundreds of thousands of workers were losing their jobs. At the same time, growing numbers of people have expressed concern about the government's muddled reaction to the recent anthrax attacks and the uneven progress of the war. And a majority of Americans, 52 percent, still favor a smaller government providing fewer services, although the percentage of Americans who say they want a bigger government providing more services has jumped to 43 from 32.
"Trauma and war bring out communal solidarity and remind people of why we have government," said Francis Fukuyama, professor of international affairs at Johns Hopkins University. "But the fact that the numbers keep moving around shows that it can be quite ephemeral. Foreign policy crises and national security threats are generally times of state-building, but only if government is seen as being effective. If we screw up the military side of things and the anthrax problem, things could change a lot."
Pollsters are used to presidential approval ratings going up and down, but trust in government has been a much less volatile index and one that social scientists consider a more useful barometer of the public's attitude toward government. Trust in government went up during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, but by only about 7 percentage points in a Washington Post/ABC News poll, a fraction of the recent 22-point rise.
"Part of it is rallying around the flag in a time of crisis," said Robert Putnam, a professor of political science at Harvard University who has written extensively about the decline of trust in his book "Bowling Alone" and as editor of a recent volume titled "Disaffected Democracies," "but part of it reflects something deeper: the only people going up the stairs of the World Trade Center while everyone else was going down were government officials. The events made us all realize the government does important work." He was quick to add: "This is a big jump, and if it should persist, it would change the whole political climate. But no one knows how the country would react to repeated terrorist attacks."
Mr. Putnam and other researchers say the subtler long-term effect could be a realignment of people's attitude toward government, the beginnings of which can be seen in recent government actions: the bailout of the airline and insurance industries, disaster aid for New York City, the extension of unemployment benefits and an increased federal role in airport security.
"All of a sudden you have Republicans sounding like liberals," said C. W. Brands, a historian at Texas A&M University and the author of a recent book, "The Strange Death of American Liberalism," which ascribed the decline of liberalism and of trust in government to the waning of the cold war. "A crisis makes liberals out of everyone, in the sense of people seeing a positive role for government. My theory is that if this crisis persists, people will get used to the idea of looking to government to solve problems and it will spill over into other areas."
Whatever the long-term political consequences, the events since Sept. 11 have upset the conventional thinking about Americans' faith in their government.
When public opinion surveys began testing trust in government in the 1950's, three-quarters of Americans responded that they expected the federal government to do the right thing most or pretty much all of the time. It was one of the highest levels in the world. Trust remained high until the early 1970's and then dropped steadily until only one in four Americans expressed faith in their government by 1980. There have been brief rises since then -- during the first Reagan administration, the second Clinton administration and in the gulf war in 1991 -- but faith in government has generally remained low, dropping to 26 percent as recently as 1998, well below the most recent level of 55 percent.
The phenomenon persisted for more than a generation, and a whole industry of scholarship cropped up to try to solve the mystery of what caused Americans to distrust government. Early suggestions were the Vietnam War, the civil rights protests of the 1960's, the Watergate scandal and economic stagnation of the 1970's, feminism and the sexual revolution. As Garry R. Orren, a professor of public policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, wrote in a 1997 book, "Why People Don't Trust Government," "All told, the level of mistrust nearly tripled in the decade after 1964."
But since Watergate, surveys have detected growing distrust in government in very different parts of the world, from Western Europe and Canada to South Korea and Japan. So scholars began to look for a more general explanation, a single master theory.
"This trend is pervasive in all the industrialized nations and goes hand in hand with democratization," Ronald Inglehart, a professor of sociology at the University of Michigan, said in a telephone interview.
So in just the past year, social scientists have begun to advance a host of new theories to account for the post-Watergate declines in the United States and elsewhere: the end of the cold war, television, the expanded role of government, globalization, growing income inequality and a shift in values.
Mr. Inglehart, for example, has been conducting something called the World Values Survey for nearly 30 years, trying to measure shifting public attitudes in dozens of countries around the world. 
"Insecure people who are struggling with basic necessities like strong leaders and tend to idealize authority," he said. "In the richer and more secure societies, there is a declining deference to authority. Having achieved a level of prosperity, people push for autonomy, self-expression and democracy -- postindustrial values."
Indeed, some scholars have turned the problem around and argue that the real surprise is not the low level of trust but the high degree of faith in government in the recent past. Mr. Fukuyama at Johns Hopkins said, "Most of these studies use as their base line the 1940's and 1950's, when the United States was just coming out of the Depression and World War II, a time when there was a lot of national unity and in which the federal government had performed very well."
In his new book Mr. Brands of Texas A&M argues that except in periods of war -- like now -- Americans have always had high degrees of distrust of government. "As I studied the question," he said in an interview, "I came to feel that distrust of government was the basic default position for the United States and that the cold war kept faith in government high and made it possible to maintain a consensus for big government."
To conservatives like Mr. Fukuyama, government wore out people's trust by extending its sphere of actions beyond essential functions like national defense to thorny social problems like poverty and racial injustice, which were much harder to solve through government action.
Derek Bok, former president of Harvard University, argues in his new book, "The Trouble with Government," that the American government simply did not perform as well as other large welfare states. "I think there is a real problem in terms of the government not delivering what people want," in terms of providing good health care and education and alleviating poverty and crime, Mr. Bok said in a telephone interview.
For now, however, the expanded role of the government is likely to be most conspicuous in the area of national defense. "The creation of an Office of Homeland Security would have, a month ago, seemed to the Republican right like an Orwellian invention," Mr. Brands said. "But in the cold war, national defense became national security and the scope broadened. Cold war liberals' argument for the war on poverty was that it was needed to make America's message to the world credible."
Mr. Putnam said: "World War I and World War II made people more sympathetic to the idea of government in public policy. It created the climate for the civil rights bill and the Great Society."
The recent volatility of the polling numbers, Mr. Fukuyama said, shows that a national crisis alone does not create trust in government: "It's a combination of external threats and government effectiveness. The government was seen as being effective during the Depression and World War II, less so during the 1960's."
Moreover, Mr. Putnam said, other factors that accounted for the general decline of trust in government among industrialized nations may come back into play: "I think globalization has made it harder for any single government to achieve what its citizens want. The problems are global, but the problem-solving mechanisms at our disposals are local or national." So if global terrorism proves beyond the scope of national government and international cooperation, it could cause trust in government to crash.

HEADLINE: Tourism Industry Seeks Aid in Italy 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Italy's tourism industry is suffering its worst crisis in half a century and needs emergency aid, the business group Confindustria said today.
 The number of tourists has plummeted since the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, with some tour operators reporting a 70 percent slump. 
 "This is the most serious collapse the industry has seen in 50 years," Confindustria said in a statement. "We are calling on the government to provide the necessary funds for urgent intervention to prop up the sector."
The tourism group Confturismo said in a separate statement that 2.5 million expected visitors would be staying away from Italy in the weeks leading up to Christmas, depriving the trade of an estimated 610 billion lire ($285 million).
Italy's tourism industry generates some $66 billion a year, 8 percent of the country's gross domestic product.

HEADLINE: In a Breakthrough, of Sorts, Arafat and Peres Shake Hands 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: FORMENTOR, Majorca, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
It is a measure of the stagnation of the Middle East peace process that a handshake today between the Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, should be regarded as progress.
 But it was the first real contact between the two men in more than a month, and in that time the Middle East has burned. With pressure from Washington for the Israelis and the Palestinians to cool it for the sake of the international coalition against terrorism, officials from both sides chose to see a ray of light at this sunny Spanish resort town. 
 Mr. Arafat and Mr. Peres may yet have a substantive meeting here, with Mr. Peres talking of preparing a peace plan and the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, talking of leading talks based on a pledge to stop new Israeli settlements. 
But the single handshake, at a lunch together with the Spanish prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, and the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, completely overshadowed an economic conference devoted to the Mediterranean and the European Union.
Mr. Arafat's advisers talked up the idea of a meeting; Mr. Peres's advisers played one down, saying he had no mandate yet for negotiations. "We haven't prepared for a serious discussion, and if we have a major public meeting we'll just raise expectations too high," said Yoram Dori, a senior Peres aide.
Of more importance, he said, was Mr. Peres's meeting today with Mr. Mubarak. "It was the first Israeli-Egyptian meeting in two or three months," Mr. Dori said.
In a speech to the conference, Mr. Mubarak, himself vulnerable to an attack by Islamic fundamentalists, said the Middle East was deteriorating "one day after another without the slightest hope that there will be a peaceful end to the conflict."
He blamed the violence on "a lack of clear vision needed to reach peace" on the part of the Israeli government, charging that "its use of violence, blockades and closing of borders in an attempt to oppress the Palestinian people leads to a vicious circle of indefinite violence and counterviolence."
Indirectly, Mr. Mubarak called on the United States to become actively involved with the Israelis and the Palestinians to halt the slide to further bloodshed.
While the attacks of Sept. 11 are not the outcome of the troubles in the peace process or a result of American support for Israel, Mr. Mubarak stressed, "the deterioration of the peace process to the current regrettable stage and the lack of an active international leadership of the peace process have created a general public opinion in the Arab street that is antagonistic to the peace process."
Mr. Mubarak called on Israelis and Palestinians to "exit as quickly as possible from this cycle of violence and to move toward political negotiations as the only means to reach security and guarantee peace and stability."
Egypt is one of America's most steadfast Arab allies, but the war in Afghanistan, coupled with television pictures of Palestinian suffering, is placing significant pressure on Mr. Mubarak and other moderate Arab rulers of semi-autocratic states, American officials believe.
Still, there was no evident American diplomatic presence here, and no senior American official has been to the Middle East since Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was there in June.
Osama el-Baz, a senior Mubarak adviser, said that Mr. Peres and Mr. Arafat could not make any breakthrough here. "But we expect a step that can move the stagnant waters of the peace process," Mr. Baz said in an interview. "If things are left as they are, it will be bad for both the Israelis and the Palestinians, and for all who seek peace in the Mideast, and this will be reflected, however unfortunately, in the attitudes of the Arab people vis-a-vis the war against terrorism."
Martin Indyk, former United States ambassador to Israel, also called for a high-level American mission to the Middle East, to try to bang Israeli and Palestinian heads together.
"After Sept. 11, we at least need quiet in the region," Mr. Indyk said in a telephone interview. "We don't need pictures in the Arab world of Israeli tanks moving on Palestinians. We're going to have pictures of B-52's bombing Afghanistan, but we don't need both."
Mr. Sharon has made it clear that he first wants to see tougher action by Mr. Arafat to restrain militant Palestinian groups like Hamas. Since Sept. 11, Mr. Arafat has worked to hamper Hamas, American officials have said, but Mr. Sharon wants more.
Mr. Peres and Mr. Sharon appear to be engaged in a good cop-bad cop routine, with the aim of getting Mr. Arafat to crack down on his militants and make it easier for Israel to stop new settlement activity, as called for under the Mitchell Report, which Mr. Sharon has accepted as a basis for new talks.
While Mr. Peres says he would open peace negotiations and even evacuate some easily selected settlements now, Mr. Sharon wants to hold Mr. Arafat to earlier promises to arrest Hamas militants and work to stop suicide bombings.
While Mr. Sharon made a show of toughness for his conservative supporters at home, he also supported Mr. Peres's decision to come here to see Mr. Arafat. Whether directly or through Mr. Mubarak, officials of both sides say, Mr. Peres and Mr. Arafat have questions to ask each other, if only to prepare the ground for a more serious effort later.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Microsoft in Deal, but States Hold Back 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON with STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Microsoft and the federal government, long bitter legal enemies, walked into a federal court together today and announced that they had settled their epic antitrust dispute. State prosecutors who had filed a parallel antitrust lawsuit declined for now to endorse the deal and persuaded a federal judge to give them until early next week to formulate a response.
 Outlining the details of the proposed settlement publicly for the first time, the Justice Department and Microsoft described a set of business restrictions that appeared to fall considerably short of what the judge who tried the case, Thomas Penfield Jackson, tried to impose on Microsoft last year. The company had already adopted some of those restrictions last summer after it was found to have engaged in illegal monopolistic practices. 
 The proposed settlement gives computer makers more flexibility to install icons and menu entries of their choosing into Microsoft's Windows operating system. It prevents Microsoft from entering into certain restrictive and discriminatory pricing agreements. It requires the company to make some disclosures about its software code to encourage competition. And it restricts the company from retaliating against competitors. 
It also creates a three-person technical committee to monitor compliance with the agreement. The committee is to have offices on the Microsoft campus, access to Microsoft's computer code and the ability to interrogate its employees.
But the proposed settlement does not restrict Microsoft from putting anything into its primary monopoly product, the Windows operating system, that could drive out rivals and help it extend its monopoly into new products and software areas. Moreover, the agreement expressly does not require the company to acknowledge that it committed any antitrust violations, despite the findings of Judge Jackson and a seven-judge appeals court that Microsoft had repeatedly violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by bullying rivals and engaging in a wide range of anticompetitive practices over a period of years.
Critics said the settlement offer was also less than what Microsoft was reportedly willing to accept during a previous round of mediation efforts that failed. They also said the offer was riddled with loopholes that could be exploited by Microsoft.
Those complaints were rejected today by senior government officials and Microsoft executives, who hailed the proposed agreement as a landmark in antitrust law.
"This settlement is the right result for consumers and for businesses, the right result for the economy and the right result for government," Attorney General John Ashcroft told reporters shortly after the government filed the proposed settlement in Federal District Court here. "It provides prompt, effective, certain relief for consumers and removes the uncertainty in the computer market, a critical factor in today's economy."
Mr. Ashcroft said the criticism by some of Microsoft's competitors that the deal was a sell-out to a company with strong ties to the Republican administration was "totally false."
"We believe that this settlement is a very strong settlement, that it not only encompasses the relief that was signaled by the court of appeals, but that this has additional safeguards," Mr. Ashcroft added. He said that "in no respect did the White House seek to shape or influence the outcome."
Senior Microsoft executives applauded the deal at a news conference at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
"The settlement will help strengthen our economy during this difficult time and ensure that our industry can continue delivering innovations to the marketplace," said Bill Gates, the company's co-founder and chairman.
Industry competitors, both large and small, disagreed, with some recalling the earlier consent decree that resulted after they first brought their complaints to the Justice Department nearly a decade ago.
"In its current form, today's proposed consent decree, like the one entered in 1994, does too little to promote competition and protect consumers, and can too easily be evaded by a determined monopolist like Microsoft," said Paul T. Cappuccio, executive vice president and general counsel of AOL Time Warner. 
Another executive, who did not want to be named because his company does business with Microsoft, asserted that some of the company's concessions were not as generous as they seemed. For example, he said, although personal computer companies can load non-Microsoft products and icons to competing software on a new computer's Windows desktop, Microsoft would be permitted under the settlement to install software that asks users after 14 days if they want to change the PC maker's selections, presumably to Microsoft's preferred offerings. "Microsoft can present that choice to the user any way it wants and offer any kind of incentives it wants," the executive said.
But some industry analysts said the government had done a solid job of trying to restrain Microsoft without hobbling it.
"It looks to me as if this settlement evens the playing field as much as you can when you're dealing with an 800-pound gorilla," said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management. He said the three-person compliance committee "should prevent Microsoft from manipulating the technology in the Windows operating system to disadvantage competitors."
The settlement cannot take effect unless it is found by a federal district judge to be in the public interest. A major potential obstacle to such a finding is the view of the states that filed their own parallel lawsuit and have been reluctant to join the agreement.
Today those 18 states, plus the District of Columbia, persuaded the judge now overseeing the case, Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, to give them until Tuesday to study the proposed settlement and decide whether they will join it or challenge it.
The states' new lawyer, Brendan Sullivan, told Judge Kollar-Kotelly that the extra time was necessary "to assure that this is a good agreement, and that we are not trading a settlement of litigation today for a decade of litigation tomorrow."
After the brief hearing today, some of the state prosecutors praised aspects of the deal. They said they were uncertain how they would proceed and whether they would be able to get any tougher restrictions imposed on Microsoft.
Briefing reporters on the courthouse steps this morning, one of the lead attorneys general in the case, Tom Miller of Iowa, stopped short of endorsing the deal but said it "represents some progress."
Another leader of the group, Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut, said it was essential that the states carefully consider the proposed settlement.
"The decree contains some significant remedies, but we need to do our due diligence and parse all the provisions carefully because we have a lot invested in this case and the public has a lot at stake," he said, adding that it was impossible to predict now whether the states would sign onto the deal or try to seek a tougher remedy.
Microsoft has established a group of state-level lobbying and political organizations aimed at pressing the states to settle, and some lawyers involved in the case said they would expect that, at the least, by Tuesday some of the states would yield to the Justice Department deal.
Justice Department officials, sounding many of the same notes about the antitrust lawsuit that had been expressed by Microsoft's legal team, said they felt obliged to accept the deal because their case was never really as strong in important respects as it had been presented by the Clinton administration. They also said they felt it was time to put an end to the uncertainties of litigation in a rapidly changing technology industry.
Microsoft embraced the settlement as a pragmatic compromise. "While the settlement goes further than we might have wanted," Mr. Gates said, "we believe that settling this case now is the right thing to do to help the industry, and the economy, to move forward."
In the news conference at Microsoft headquarters, Mr. Gates, in a subdued mood, conceded that the case had had "a profound impact on me personally and on our company."
One legacy of the case, Mr. Gates said, is that "we will focus more on how our activities affect other companies."
In his view, Microsoft went "the extra mile" in settlement talks and agreed to conditions, especially on the disclosure of technical information, that went beyond the scope of the rulings against it.
Mr. Gates added that he hoped the states, after studying the settlement proposal, would "agree that it's the right way forward."
Yet Mr. Gates and Steven M. Ballmer, the chief executive, stopped short of admitting that Microsoft had broken the law or done things wrong. When asked that question specifically, Mr. Gates said that Microsoft was "accepting a broad set of new requirements on the company" and that it was doing so because of "concerns" about competition in the industry.
Echoing that sentiment, Mr. Ballmer said that "with the success of our products there came a number of competition concerns."

Spitzer of New York. (David Scull for The New York Times)(pg. C3) Chart: "The Proposed Settlement"Highlights of the proposed antitrust settlement between Microsoft and the Justice Department: Microsoft can add anything it wants to its monopoly product, the Windows operating system. Microsoft cannot restrict the freedom of PC makers to install non-Microsoft software, and is prohibited from retaliating against PC makers for shipping machines with competing software. Microsoft must sell Windows under the same terms to all PC makers, though it can offer discounts for volume purchase agreements. Its pricing terms must be published on a Web site accessible by PC makers and the government. Microsoft must disclose technical information to software rivals so that their products run smoothly on Windows. But sharing the information gives the companies no rights to Microsoft's intellectual property. Microsoft cannot retaliate against any software or hardware company for developing software that competes with Microsoft. A three-person technical committee will monitor compliance, with the Justice Department and Microsoft each choosing one member and the third selected by those two. The team members will serve renewable terms of 30 months and will have offices on the Microsoft campus. They will be given broad powers with access to Microsoft technical information and the authority to interrogate company employees. Microsoft rivals and customers may submit complaints anonymously to the independent committee. After review, the committee will inform the company and the government of serious complaints, which can result in an enforcement hearing in federal court. Microsoft will appoint an internal compliance officer. This person will make sure that all Microsoft officers and board members have read the settlement and are given yearly briefings on its requirements. The conditions of the settlement will be in place for five years. If Microsoft is found to willfully and systematically violate the agreement, the settlement terms will remain in force for an additional two years. (pg. C3)

Air Canada Puts Best Face On a Big Loss

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
It's bad, Air Canada said today, but not quite as bad as we thought.
 Costs are falling and its finances are stabilizing, the airline said, putting a positive gloss on the loss of 160 million Canadian dollars ($100 million) that it reported today for the third quarter. 
 The airline, which dominates Canadian air travel and has far more extensive operations in the United States than does any other foreign carrier, earned 184 million Canadian dollars ($115 million) in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Figures for both years are before taxes, and the 2001 figure does not include 71 million Canadian dollars ($45 million) in government assistance received earlier this week to compensate for the sharp loss of business in the days after the Sept. 11 terror attacks. 
Air Canada did not release net after-tax earnings figures because it is reviewing the value of intangible assets on its books, like good will, and will probably make "significant downward adjustments," the company said. Operating revenue for the quarter was down 15.6 percent.
Air Canada officials said today that the airline no longer expected to reduce capacity nearly as sharply as the 20 percent cuts it forecast in mid-September. Robert Milton, the chief executive, said, "I feel better than I did," though the outlook remained "murky," with unusually high volatility in traffic from week to week, especially on short-haul routes.
Glenn Engel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs in New York, said Air Canada "did a better job than the rest of the world in the third quarter, and they seem to be doing a better job in the fourth quarter."
In particular, Mr. Engel cited Air Canada's success in bringing down costs. American carriers' average costs per passenger have risen about 6 percent because of the falloff in traffic, he said, but Air Canada's costs have fallen by 5 percent over the last year, and the airline expects further improvement.
Air Canada has focused increasingly on accommodating a rapid migration of cost-conscious passengers from business and full-economy fares to discount services. "The market is saying they want Wal-Mart," Mr. Milton said, as he announced that the airline would shrink business-class cabins and add 5 to 6 percent more seats on its jets.
The move also reflects competition on some domestic routes from fast-growing no-frills carriers, notably Canada 3000 and WestJet. Air Canada's share of available seats fell to 65 percent in July from 77 percent two years earlier, while WestJet doubled its share to 14 percent and Canada 3000's share rose to 9 percent from 4 percent, according to a government report.
On Thursday, WestJet reported a 32 percent rise in third-quarter net income and a 41 percent rise in revenue from a year earlier.
Air Canada's own new discount airline, Tango, began service on Thursday, with a plan to take over as many as 20 of Air Canada's aircraft. But Tango made a slow start, with some flights canceled almost immediately for want of passengers. Mr. Milton said today that people booked on canceled Tango flights could be accommodated on Air Canada flights instead, but Mr. Engel of Goldman, Sachs said, "Generally, an airline within an airline is confusing with customers."
Mr. Milton also criticized Canadian authorities for providing less generous financial assistance to Air Canada than airlines south of the border have received from Washington.
"Every time you see a U.S. airline landing here, those seats are subsidized by the U.S. government," he said. Air Canada estimates that it would have received $290 million if the same criteria had been applied to it.
Air Canada's stock rose slightly in Toronto, to 2.89 Canadian dollars ($1.81) a share.

HEADLINE: Twin Towers At the Center Of Legal Brawl 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON and JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
The battle over who will bear the costs of the destruction of the World Trade Center and who will control the reconstruction of lower Manhattan -- already a full-blown brawl involving legions of lawyers and lobbyists -- is continuing to escalate.
 On Thursday, lobbyists for Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who holds the lease on the World Trade Center, and for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the property, helped ensure that a bill passed by the House on airplane security included broad language protecting them from claims by victims of the Sept. 11 attacks and their families. 
 That came as a group of investors led by Mr. Silverstein prepared to answer a lawsuit that the Swiss Reinsurance Company filed against them last week in Federal District Court in Manhattan. In the suit, the insurer, known as Swiss Re, seeks to limit how much it will have to pay to cover the destruction of the twin towers. Lawyers representing the various parties involved agree that more lawsuits are likely to follow. 
The issues are clear. No one wants to be left facing a mountain of claims from victims and their families; no insurer wants to be part of what could be a $7.2 billion payment to cover the loss of the buildings; and no lender, investor or developer wants to miss out on a piece of what may be one of the biggest insurance payouts ever.
Resolving those issues is anything but clear. The effort to sort out who will pay and who will profit involves fragile alliances, conflicting interests, and charges and countercharges of hypocrisy as Mr. Silverstein tries to limit his liability while maximizing the obligations of insurers, at least one of which -- Swiss Re -- is already fighting back.
Time is short. Mr. Silverstein paid about $6 million on his mortgage last month; the next payment is due next week, according to G.M.A.C. Commercial Mortgage, the General Motors subsidiary that lent him $564 million. For now, he can cover that and other expenses -- including $10 million a month in ground rent to the Port Authority -- out of a pool of lease payments and security deposits paid in advance by Trade Center tenants. But even with the fund he can probably afford to hold out for no more than four months without receiving insurance payments, others close to the matter said.
To plead his case in Washington, Mr. Silverstein -- who has the least to lose financially and the most to gain -- retained Jack Quinn, the former White House counsel who last January engineered an Inauguration Day pardon issued by President Bill Clinton for Marc Rich. Mr. Quinn lobbied Congress and the Bush administration to limit how much money victims can obtain from Mr. Silverstein's real estate companies, which drew criticism from another powerful lobbying group, trial lawyers.
"This guy is trying to get $7.2 billion in insurance, and he wants to limit his liability to $1 billion," said Carlton Carl, director of media relations for the Association of Trial Lawyers of America. "Why? If you start limiting everybody's liability, then nobody is accountable to anyone. It subverts our entire legal system, which calls for personal and corporate responsibility for harms that one causes."
In New York, Mr. Silverstein is relying on Herbert Wachtell and his partners at the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz to force his insurers to pay $7.2 billion, twice the amount they argue they are obligated to pay for the destruction of the trade center. Mr. Silverstein says he is entitled to the larger sum, and needs all of it to finance reconstruction.
The dispute turns on an arcane legal question of whether the crash of two hijacked airliners into the twin towers of the World Trade Center was a single insurable event, entitling Mr. Silverstein's group to $3.6 billion in coverage, or two distinct events for which the group can file separate claims of $3.6 billion apiece. Mr. Wachtell's team is up against Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, the law firm that represents Swiss Re.
For his public relations, Mr. Silverstein has turned to Howard Rubinstein, who in the past has represented Rupert Murdoch, George Steinbrenner and the Empire State Building. Mr. Rubinstein will try to make the case that Mr. Silverstein should be a central player in rebuilding a version of the World Trade Center, phoenixlike, at ground zero. A battery of architects, engineers and cultural experts is being consulted to draw up plans and blunt efforts by rivals to control reconstruction.
At the same time, Mr. Silverstein is trying to hold together a coalition that includes the Port Authority, which owns the site, and his lenders and co-investors in the buildings that have been destroyed. It is a tenuous alliance, one which is certain to fracture should some members begin to sense that they will not be repaid by Mr. Silverstein or come to believe that he cannot get all the money he claims that the insurers owe him and cannot cap his liability.
For its part, the Port Authority, a political body, has moved cautiously to sort out its plans and interests. So far, said Lewis M. Eisenberg, its chairman, the agency is focused on two short-term goals: rebuilding the transportation hub that was under the trade center and trying to limit the authority's liability.
The suit by Swiss Re, the insurer with the most at stake in the Trade Center disaster, is a clear effort to put pressure on the alliance and possibly prompt some of the investors or lenders to pressure Mr. Silverstein to walk away from a rebuilding effort, experts say.
Like many developers, Mr. Silverstein was highly leveraged. By some estimates, he put up only about $12 million of his group's $3.2 billion bid for a 99-year lease of the World Trade Center earlier this year. Other less visible lenders and investors have considerably more at stake.
Nevertheless, Mr. Silverstein, who lost four employees in the attack, speaks of rebuilding lower Manhattan with almost religious zeal. "There's no way I could not go forward and build this thing," he said in an interview on Wednesday. "What these terrorists have tried to do is destroy the symbol of New York, destroy the symbol of our economic progress, our strength, our way of life, and I can't handle that."
He dismissed criticism of his effort to limit his group's liability to the $1 billion covered by insurance, saying he just wants to put a quick end to what could become decades of litigation that would enrich lawyers at the expense of their clients.
"Look at what's happened from the 1993 incident," he said, referring to the earlier bombing of one of the World Trade Center towers. "Hundreds of millions of dollars in claims are still outstanding. This is designed to avoid what's happened there."
Mr. Silverstein has pledged to continue to pay his mortgage and ground rent, a promise that is crucial to maintaining the coalition of lenders and investors who financed his bid for the complex.
But Mr. Silverstein's position is beset by uncertainties. Chief among them is the fact that there was no final insurance policy in place when the trade center was attacked. The policies were still under negotiation, and the coverage included the disputed terms of the so-called "binders," or promises by insurance carriers to provide coverage. A policy was formally issued by Travelers, a Citigroup subsidiary, on Sept. 14, after a flurry of e-mails and phone calls among the lawyers negotiating the terms of the policy, but other carriers are keeping quiet about whether they will agree to be bound by those terms or by others.
Swiss Re executives say that the case turns on a tightly scrawled note on one of the binders that strikes some language and replaces it with the phrase "subject to wording to be agreed." In its complaint, the insurance company asserts that the crashes are a single event under the language in effect on Sept. 11.
Mr. Silverstein's lawyers maintain that New York state law, which governs the case, makes clear that each crash and collapse was a separate insurable event. In 1959, they note, the New York Court of Appeals found that the collapse of two walls in adjoining buildings owned by one person, 50 minutes apart, were distinct events.
Swiss Re contends that the developers underinsured the buildings, but several lawyers said that $3.6 billion was seen as more than enough to cover what before Sept. 11 was judged to be any likely disaster. "It was considered by many people who looked at it as far in excess of what should be bought," said one person with knowledge of the insurance negotiations. "No one ever, ever considered you could have an event as horrific as what happened."
Besides, the lawyers added, the $3.6 billion worth of insurance was about as much as insurers were willing to underwrite; any more than than would have been prohibitively expensive. As it was, to get so much coverage required policies written by 22 carriers.
When the Port Authority ran the trade center, it had $1.5 billion of insurance coverage. The Silverstein group of investors initially sought $2.3 billion in coverage, but lenders wanted more. So Mr. Silverstein's partnership raised the coverage to $3.25 billion and then, about a week after the closing, to $3.6 billion.
If Mr. Silverstein's insurers pay him only $3.6 billion, his desire to rebuild could be frustrated. The value of the Silverstein group's remaining lease payments to the Port Authority is about $2.6 billion. The developer also owes about $30 million annually to the city in lieu of real estate taxes, and several hundred million dollars more to lenders.
At least one lender, though, transferred much of its risk elsewhere. G.M.A.C. sold most of its $564 million mortgage to other investors, and currently stands to lose just $80 million if it is not repaid. Wells Fargo, the trustee for holders of bonds backed by the mortgage, would not provide a list of investors.
Westfield America, a real estate investment trust controlled by a major Australian developer that owns several shopping malls in the United States, invested $120 million along with Mr. Silverstein; $100 million of that was borrowed from UBS Warburg. It is unlikely that a large company like Westfield would default on the loan, say people familiar with the financing of the lease.
Even if Mr. Silverstein ultimately wins the money he wants, any effort to rebuild inevitably comes back to the Port Authority and the governments of the states of New York and New Jersey and of New York City.
They may not be interested in supporting Mr. Silverstein's ambitious desire to replace all of the trade center's 10 million square feet of office space and 500,000 square feet of retail space just now because of the slowing economy and potential tenants' concern about further terrorist attacks. If he duplicated the twin towers' size -- whether in two 110-story towers or a combination of shorter buildings -- many people involved in ongoing negotiations worry privately that no one would rent the space.
Such decisions are still a way off, in any case. Swiss Re's lawsuit would have to be resolved long before any rebuilding could begin. For now, the fate of the case rests with Federal District Court Judge Denny Chin, who was randomly assigned to the case when it was filed last month. Judge Chin, a 1994 Clinton appointee, is both soft-spoken and demanding, and lawyers who have been before him say he is willing to defy powerful interests in reaching his decisions
But the case could be settled before it is decided by Judge Chin, and it would not be surprising if the parties reached a deal requiring the insurers to pay a figure of $3.6 billion to $7.2 billion. The prospect of such a settlement does not seem to deter Mr. Silverstein from fulfilling his latest ambition.
"I have my health, my life, my family, my people less the four who died, and the ability to say, 'Let's regroup and show these terrorists what we'll do, what we need to do,' " Mr. Silverstein said. "Life is for the living."

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN; 
Trying to Show Who's Better Suited to Inherit a Legacy

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

 BODY:
 The mayoral campaign of Michael R. Bloomberg, the Republican candidate, began broadcasting a television advertisement on Thursday called "Every Step," which suggests the election of his Democratic opponent, Mark Green, would jeopardize the legacy of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.

PRODUCER -- Squier Knapp Dunn Communications, in consultation with David Garth.

ON THE SCREEN -- The ad begins with various scenes of a safe and vibrant city, including officers frisking suspects, bustling shops and smiling people on the street. It then splits to include a picture of Mr. Green next to the scenes, which change from color to black and white as they become increasingly bleak: an image of City Hall; a long line of garbage trucks; closed businesses; and buildings covered in graffiti. The announcer's criticisms of Mr. Green are splashed across the screen in white letters, including a reference to an unspecified article in The New York Times on Sept. 5, 2001. The ad closes with shots of Mr. Bloomberg hard at work.

THE SCRIPT -- Announcer: "Our quality of life is better. Police successfully fighting crime. Waste cut. Corruption no longer tolerated. Taxes down. Every step of the way, Mark Green attacked and criticized the changes that made life better. He will tear apart Giuliani's City Hall and turn our city back. Back to when our neighborhoods were ignored. Mike Bloomberg will build on what Mayor Giuliani accomplished. Fight crime. Cut waste. Use his experience to strengthen our economy. Mike Bloomberg. A leader, not a politician."

ACCURACY -- As public advocate, Mr. Green was actively involved in questioning and challenging some policies of the Giuliani administration. Tensions between the two men were well known. Mr. Green was particularly aggressive in pursuing allegations of police misconduct and he was outspoken on issues of racial profiling, suggesting Mr. Giuliani's law enforcement approach had undermined the Police Department's relationship with blacks and Hispanics. But Mr. Green, who has been endorsed by Mr. Giuliani's first police commissioner, William J. Bratton, has not suggested that he would turn back the clock on the mayor's achievements. Mr. Green has said he will keep Compstat, the intensive data collection system used by the Police Department; precinct accountability; and quality-of-life policing.

SCORECARD -- This is an ad that uses scare tactics rather than specifics to raise doubts about Mr. Green's credentials. It does not substantiate its most damaging claims -- that Mr. Green would "tear apart" Mr. Giuliani's City Hall and "turn our city back." It is in keeping with Mr. Bloomberg's central theme late in this race, that he, and not Mr. Green, is the best steward of Mr. Giuliani's legacy. But unlike other ads that use the Giuliani references effectively, it risks turning off viewers. DEAN E. MURPHY

HEADLINE: Unemployment Jumps to 5.4%, A 5-Year High 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Over 400,000 Americans lost jobs last month, the most for a single month in more than two decades, as businesses responded to a deteriorating economy with a surge in layoffs.
 The unemployment rate jumped to 5.4 percent in October from 4.9 percent, its highest level since 1996, the Labor Department said yesterday. 
 The question among analysts is no longer whether the United States is in a recession, but how deep it will be and how many months will pass before jobs become plentiful again. 
"There is almost like a national hiring freeze," said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers, in St. Louis. 
Roughly a quarter of the lost jobs were a direct result of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, according to Thomas L. Nardone, chief of the division in the Bureau of Labor Statistics that compiles the monthly job numbers. The attacks apparently dashed the hopes of many executives for a quick recovery after a mild recession, and they stepped up layoffs to prepare for hard times.
The Federal Reserve is expected to respond to the October numbers by cutting short-term interest rates half a percentage point, to 2 percent, when its policy makers meet in Washington on Tuesday. It would be the 10th rate cut since Jan. 1, reducing rates by 4.5 percentage points.
The 415,000 lost jobs, almost double the number most forecasters had expected, intensified a debate over how Congress and the administration should deal with the sinking economy, given that Fed rate cuts are having so little effect and that the upturn often forecast for early next year seems less and less likely.
"It is not good news for America," President Bush said yesterday of the October job numbers. He urged the Senate to approve by Nov. 30 a House-passed bill that relies mainly on tax cuts, particularly for business, to stimulate the economy. The terrorist attacks, the president said, have "threatened the livelihoods of thousands of American workers."
The Democrats are putting much more emphasis on public spending to jump-start the economy, particularly in the form of subsidies paid out to the rising number of unemployed workers. They argue that the subsidies will encourage spending, while the tax cuts will not persuade business to hire and spend in a weak economy with profits shrinking.
The debate brings into public view the two parties' divergent views over the role of government in the economy. "The government is not a creator of economic growth; the private sector does that," Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao said yesterday in an interview. "Government has to help business create more jobs, and they do that through tax cuts."
The Commerce Department, in a separate report, provided further evidence that the economy was under stress. Orders for merchandise placed with American manufacturers plunged by 5.8 percent in September, to $313.1 billion, the lowest level since March 1997.
The booming economy created millions of jobs in the late 1990's. The peak came last March, and then as the economy weakened, the work force steadily contracted. Nearly 900,000 jobs have disappeared since March, nearly half of them in October alone, when total employment stood at 131.77 million.
The decline of nearly 900,000 is the largest in so few months since the 1990-1991 recession -- suggesting to economists that last March will eventually be officially designated as the start of the current recession. It began gradually and picked up considerable speed last month, particularly in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks. Mr. Nardone said the terrorism triggered job cuts at airlines, travel agencies, hotels, restaurants and car rental agencies that exceeded by 100,000 the average declines in those industries in recent months.
"People are asking, 'What would the economy look like if the terrorist attacks had not occurred,' " Mr. Nardone said. "But they did occur and that has had an impact on people's decisions that continues to multiply the damage to the economy."
Retailers provided evidence. Christmas hiring normally begins in October, but the upturn did not materialize and retailing lost 81,000 jobs in the Labor Department's seasonally adjusted numbers.
The 415,000 lost jobs in the nation as a whole and the half-a-percentage point jump in the unemployment rate were the largest in each category since May 1980, in the midst of a recession. Just 13 months ago, the unemployment rate was only 3.9 percent. Unemployment rose among every group, but African-Americans suffered the most: a 1 percentage point increase in their jobless rate in October alone, to 9.7 percent. Just last fall, black unemployment had fallen to a record low of 7.2 percent.
The cutback in labor costs took more than one form. Aside from eliminating jobs, employers reduced overtime and trimmed scheduled work, so that average weekly pay for production workers, who represent 75 percent of the work force, fell by 77 cents, to $491.98 -- the first decline in nominal weekly pay in years.
Part-time work also surged among people who either wanted full-time jobs and could not get them, or had their hours cut back by their employers against their wishes. That number jumped 1.1 million in September and October, to a total of 4.5 million. "That is a very big number," Mr. Nardone said. "The demand for labor is clearly contracting." 
Most of the employment decline since last March has come in manufacturing, but the service sector made a huge contribution last month, shedding 111,000 jobs, the largest cut on record. These are the nation's office workers. They work in health services, private schools, hotels and temporary help agencies. Nearly all of the loss was among the temporary workers, who are the easiest to shed and the first to go, economists say, when companies are bent on cutting labor costs.
"The falloff in the employment of temporary workers is a good indicator of the labor market's weakness," said Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, "because firms can cut back with basically no cost."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE PRESIDENT; 
G.O.P. Moderates See Dangers in Bush's Stance on Aviation Security

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Shouts of victory rose up in the West Wing on Thursday night as the House passed a Republican aviation security bill that President Bush had battled for, even as he fought his broader war against terrorism.
 But in the morning's clearer light, some moderates in the president's party warned that Mr. Bush might have lost by winning. At the least, they said, he had handed the Democrats a potent campaign issue by siding so powerfully on a bill pushed by his party's conservative wing that rejected the complete federalization of airport security that many polls suggest Americans want. 
"I simply do not understand it," said Representative Marge Roukema, a moderate New Jersey Republican who did not vote the president's way. "I just have to shake my head. The Democrats will beat us up and down on it, no question about that. But besides the politics, we'll be inviting more airline disasters and putting more lives at risk."
Mr. Bush, others said, was still haunted by the specter of his father, who defied his party's conservative wing on taxes and then lost the White House. For that reason, Democrats said, Mr. Bush is fearful about standing up to the two House conservative leaders, Representatives Tom DeLay and Dick Armey of Texas, who worked hand in hand with the White House to push through the Republican version of the bill. 
"The ideologues have taken over, and they're out of touch with America," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who voted with 99 other senators in approving an opposing bill that would make all 28,000 airport baggage and passenger screeners federal employees. "Just as Bill Clinton's job was to face down some of the ideologues on the left, President Bush's job is to face down the ideologues on the right." 
The White House said the president was acting on principle, not politics.
"Basically what passed the House was the president's original proposal," said Nicholas E. Calio, the president's Congressional liaison. "So what was not to like about it?"
At issue is the security, both physical and psychological, of millions of airline passengers who will crowd American airports in the holiday season and beyond. Air travel has been down sharply since the Sept. 11 suicide hijackings as the White House and Congress have struggled to make flying safer and to lure nervous passengers back into the air. 
On Oct. 11, the Senate passed its version of an airline security bill by 100 to 0. The bill's authors argued that aviation safety was now a matter of national security and could not be left in the hands of often inexperienced and underpaid employees hired by the lowest-bidding private contractor.
Mr. Bush and House Republican leaders balked at adding tens of thousands of people to the federal payroll, and instead promoted a plan to leave the work in the hands of the private contractors, but under government supervision, with higher pay and stricter standards.
Nonetheless, White House advisers have signaled that Mr. Bush would sign either bill in the interest of moving quickly to offer air travelers reassurance.
That seeming agnosticism apparently drove Mr. DeLay to distraction. Earlier this week, he said, he told the White House that if the president wanted the House bill, he would have to start a personal lobbying campaign.
The president soon began calling and meeting with dozens of Republican and Democratic fence-sitters -- although not, one White House official pointedly said, only because Mr. DeLay had told him to do so. Still, Mr. Calio parked himself in Mr. DeLay's office during the vote in the House.
Whatever the reasons for the lobbying campaign, many Republicans said the president had a far different style of persuasion than what were described as the hardball tactics of Mr. DeLay.
Representative Jim Ramstad, a Republican from Minnesota who ultimately voted against the president, said he got a call from Mr. Bush at 8:30 a.m. Thursday while he was out jogging, but when he called back he spent most of his conversation with Mr. Bush discussing how fast each man could run a mile.
"I got no pressure at all from the president," Mr. Ramstad said. "He said he understood that I was supporting the Senate bill and he asked if I were locked into that position, and I said yes, and he said, 'Well, I certainly respect your position.' "
In contrast, Mr. Ramstad said, "we are still hearing the bones crunching" from Mr. DeLay's "pressure job."
Democrats and moderate Republicans said the president would now have the difficult political task of promoting a compromise bill out of the competing House and Senate versions in time for the heavy travel season that starts at the end of this month. Many said that even in a supposed era of bipartisanship, Democrats would quickly blame Mr. Bush if a bill was languishing in Congress when Americans were fearful of flying or if there was another terrorist attack on an airline.
"I think that he made a decision that the difference between federalizing and not federalizing airline security was not worth the political capital to buck DeLay," said Representative Robert Menendez, a prominent House Democrat from New Jersey, who voted for the Senate version of the bill. "I think that's going to come back to haunt him."
The White House, perhaps mindful of that, was moving quickly today to try to reconcile the two bills.
"We're prepared to take an active role to make sure that an airline security bill comes out of conference as quickly as possible," Mr. Bush said.
He added that if he could sign such a bill, "it will say to the American people that we are doing everything we possibly can to recover from the aftermath of Sept. 11."

Up With Moguls! Exploit the Rich!

BYLINE:  By BILL KELLER 

 BODY:
This is not an endorsement of the candidacy of Michael Bloomberg in next Tuesday's New York City mayoral election. For endorsements you have to go next door to the editorial page, where, if you are a candidate encumbered by great wealth, you may be subjected to the biblical eye-of-the-needle test. This is an endorsement of the idea of Michael Bloomberg, meaning the idea that it would not kill us to have a few self-made billionaires in our political life.
 For a country that idealizes opportunity, dotes on celebrity and frequently confuses the ability to make vast sums of money with wisdom, it is remarkable how indignant the discourse gets when a rich person runs for public office. We'll propel Jack Welch's astoundingly tedious memoir of corporate life to the top of the best-seller list, but if Mr. Welch decided to invest some of his bounty running for governor of Connecticut, the knives would surely come out. 
 Mark Green's campaign chant against Mr. Bloomberg -- "Message beats money!" -- is descended from a long line of populist derision wielded by candidates who feel it's nobler to spend someone else's money pursuing public office. Supporters of Arch Moore famously caught the spirit in the 1980 campaign against Gov. John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia. The bumper stickers read, "Make Him Spend It All, Arch!" (Rockefeller supporters' bumpers retorted, "At Least It's His," which seemed particularly apt a few years later when Mr. Moore was sent to prison for mail fraud.)
Candidacies of the rich are a curiously neglected subject in political science. Alan Ehrenhalt, editor of Governing magazine and a student of American politics for more than 30 years, says that as near as he can tell, voters don't care if a candidate is rich. In some cases, he says, particularly where the political climate has been tainted by special-interest money, the customary rich candidate's plea that he can't be bought may work to his advantage.
Jon S. Corzine, who spent $63 million acquiring a Senate seat from New Jersey, a state acquainted with political scandal, thinks the beholden-to-no-one argument worked powerfully for him. On the other hand, a candidate whose wealth appears to have kept him out of touch with real life -- think of George Bush puzzling over the novelty of a grocery-store scanner -- may be punished. But in general, voters seem not to regard enormous wealth as a stigma. The latest Times polling, completed on Thursday, found that 75 percent of New Yorkers care "not at all" if a wealthy candidate pays for his campaign, and they find that less worrisome, by 2 to 1, than being bankrolled by special interests.
Mr. Bloomberg says the only people who hold his money against him are journalists, and loyal though I am to my fraternity of skeptics, I suspect he is onto something. Journalists find it difficult to think of a legitimate reason that anyone who had not already lapsed into the dubious career of politics would give up respectable work (or a life of leisure) for a job that requires being polite to strangers, compromising with idiots and reading your every unguarded remark in tabloid headlines. We are wary of people who believe in things, and dubious of reformers. Partly this is cynicism born of exposure to politicians who don't believe in anything and reforms that didn't reform, partly it is a reluctance to seem overly credulous, partly it is the sense of detachment that draws people to a career on the sidelines. I can think of just a handful of working journalists who have actually run for public office themselves, and to get that many I have to stretch the category of "working journalist" to include Al Gore and the category of serious candidate to include Jimmy Breslin.
Our suspicion of politics is nearly matched by our suspicion of the rich. If getting rich were a matter of intelligence or judgment, we believe in our envious hearts, surely reporters would be in life's E-ZPass lane. This creates an oddly contradictory stance toward candidates like Mr. Bloomberg: We don't hold the office in great esteem, but hold on a second, Mr. Moneybags, what makes you think you're qualified? If only Mr. Bloomberg had debased himself doing the kind of spotlight-chasing Mr. Green has done, he might be worthy to be mayor.
Here are a few reasons not to disparage the political aspirations of people like Mr. Bloomberg.
Why shouldn't the rich work for us? Noblesse oblige, the notion that those enriched by the system should repay it with public service, has fallen into serious disrepair, if not disrepute. The idea of an elite that is not motivated by personal gain has a venerable history in our land, dating to gentlemen politicians like Washington and Jefferson and continuing through the progressive reformers and industrialist philanthropists of a century ago, the Harrimans and Roosevelts and Rockefellers. 
Somewhere, perhaps in the Vietnam-era repudiation of the best and brightest, perhaps in the Reagan-era backlash of the right, perhaps in the greed-is-good prosperity of the 80's, the notion of common interest seems to have been smothered by special interests. We keep a token Kennedy and a token Rockefeller in the Senate, as if to remind us that there was a time when public service was actually taught in the homes of the rich, but more often we see noblesse oblige turned inside out. Nowadays those who have spent a few terms as public servants in Congress or the cabinet expect to be repaid for their sacrifice by peddling their credibility in the high-priced bordellos of K Street. When someone comes along who talks about "giving back," and seems to believe it, why is that not cause for celebration? True, with Mr. Bloomberg, master of the eponymous empire, there is always the slight suspicion that his campaign is an exercise in brand extension. But this is a guy who says if he can't be mayor his fantasy would be to run the World Bank or the United Nations. Phew. The man has the do-good disease bad.
Maybe they know something we don't. Being rich is not, in and of itself, evidence of great executive ability, or even emotional stability. (Ross Perot. Case closed.) But I'm prepared to believe that a competent mogul might actually know some things that could be usefully applied to overseeing a piece of government. Someone who has successfully run a company might, for example, know the value of economic diversification, fiscal discipline, quality control and customer service. A successful C.E.O. ought to know something about negotiating compromises and holding people accountable, which are essentials of politics. (And, yes, it is inescapably about politics. Mr. Bloomberg's slogan that he is "a leader, not a politician," would disqualify him for the job of mayor if he meant it literally.) Good bosses know how to master bureaucracy. If Jack Welch had spent the last year applying his tough-love management to the C.I.A. rather than compiling all his thank-you notes into a book, maybe we'd have seen Osama bin Laden coming.
One of the things rich people know something about, by the way, is other rich people. They are positioned to see the nonsense in nostrums proposed in the name of universal prosperity. When Republicans proposed earlier this year to repeal the inheritance tax, the most credible opposition came from a group of 800 rich Americans, including the likes of George Soros, Paul Newman and Warren E. Buffett, who argued that the estate tax actually nourishes the economy by rewarding merit rather than birthright.
Have a little faith in voters. It is tempting to believe that the American electorate is not very bright, or not very attentive. Maybe so, but there's little evidence that candidates with more money than talent do better than candidates with neither. The field is littered with failed plutocrats -- Michael Huffington, Steve Forbes, Ross Perot, our own Ronald S. Lauder and Abe Hirschfeld, and many others. Voters just aren't that stupid.
This is not, by the way, an argument against campaign reforms, including New York's much-admired public financing system (which allows candidates like Mr. Bloomberg to opt out), restrictions on soft-money propaganda and free TV time for candidates. Such laws, though, are designed to protect us not from rich candidates but from more pernicious dangers -- the poisonous influence of chit-calling donors and the chilling advantage of incumbency.
There may be plenty of good reasons not to vote for Michael Bloomberg as the next mayor of New York, but his money is not one of them. Let a hundred Bloombergs flower!

HEADLINE: Poll Finds Gap Narrowing For Bloomberg and Green 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MARJORIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
New Yorkers now believe that both Michael R. Bloomberg and Mark Green are qualified to be the next mayor of New York, amid signs that Mr. Green's contention that Mr. Bloomberg does not have the skills or experience to run the city has not taken hold, according to the latest New York Times poll.
 By a slight margin, more New Yorkers saw Mr. Green as having "the right kind of experience" to be mayor of New York than felt that way about Mr. Bloomberg, who is making his first run for public office. Mr. Green is also more heavily favored among older voters, who tend to vote in disproportionately higher numbers. 
 But the poll found that by a significant margin, voters believe that it is Mr. Bloomberg who presents "strong qualities of leadership," a trait analysts believe could prove influential as voters choose who will lead New York through what are potentially perilous years. 
And Mr. Bloomberg -- who one year and at least $41 million ago was barely known by most New York voters -- is now viewed more favorably among New Yorkers than Mr. Green as he goes into the last days of the campaign.
The poll, taken Saturday through Thursday, found that among those most likely to vote, Mr. Green, a Democrat, is supported by 42 percent and Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, by 37 percent. The difference is not statistically significant. About 20 percent are undecided -- an unusually high figure for this late in the contest, and a hint that New Yorkers might be in for a fairly ferocious final weekend of campaigning.
The poll was done in a week in which Mr. Bloomberg won the endorsement of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, apparently very much to his benefit. Of the self-identified Democrats who said they would have voted for Mr. Giuliani were he on the ballot, a majority said they intended to vote for Mr. Bloomberg. The poll also came out as Mr. Bloomberg is financing a final tidal wave of television advertisements, mailings and automated telephone calls, many of them harshly critical of Mr. Green, and directed at specific blocs, including Jewish and Hispanic voters. "He wants to tear apart Rudy Giuliani's City Hall," Mr. Bloomberg said of Mr. Green in one automated call that went out this week. 
At the same time, the combination of the war abroad, terrorist fears at home and a World Series has overshadowed the day-to-day news coverage of the race, coverage that in a typical year, would serve as at least a partial counterweight to the paid advertisements of both candidates.
Given Mr. Bloomberg's financial advantage, that would appear to be to the disadvantage of Mr. Green, particularly after a stretch in which even Mr. Bloomberg's supporters expressed concern about his first-time candidacy.
The poll found that Mr. Green's attempt to use Mr. Bloomberg's wealth against him -- "You don't understand the city just by spending a lot of private wealth," Mr. Green declared at a debate on Thursday -- may not carry much weight with this electorate. In an era when wealthy candidates have become something less than a novelty, most New Yorkers said they did not mind that Mr. Bloomberg was spending so much on his own contest; some said they even preferred it.
The poll of 791 registered voters, of whom 390 are considered likely to vote, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for all registered voters and plus or minus five percentage points for likely voters.
In every sense, this has been a thoroughly unusual political year, even before two planes flew into the World Trade Center on what was supposed to have been the day of the Democratic primary. Nonetheless, news that Mr. Bloomberg was appearing to close in on Mr. Green in a city with such an edge in registered Democrats, and after Mr. Green had been acting as if victory were at hand, caught supporters of both candidates by surprise.
And it distressed a number of Democrats, some of whom suggested that Mr. Green was making the same mistake in the general election as he had in his primary battle with Fernando Ferrer. Both then and now, they said, Mr. Green ran a safe campaign, avoiding attacks on his opponents or offering a compelling case for his own candidacy.
That began to change earlier this week, when Mr. Green ran his first negative advertisement directed at Mr. Bloomberg, though even some of Mr. Green's supporters said he should have moved earlier. 
"Didn't he learn his lesson in the runoff?" said one senior New York Democratic official. "This thing is slipping away from him, and he is still measuring the drapes in Gracie Mansion."
Mr. Green's campaign announced late yesterday afternoon that it would begin broadcasting what is by far its toughest advertisement directed at Mr. Bloomberg, raising -- among a host of other tough-worded charges against him -- allegations of sexual harassment that were directed at Mr. Bloomberg by employees of his company. "Do we really want to make Mike our mayor?" the announcer asks.
In a Marist College poll released yesterday, Mr. Green was ahead by 46 percent to 42 percent, also not statistically significant, based on interviews of 435 likely voters between Monday and Wednesday. 
Mr. Bloomberg expressed satisfaction with the changing poll numbers. "This is just an indication that we are getting the message out of why this time, given the problems this city faces, my background is what is needed," he said.
Mr. Green told reporters yesterday that he was not concerned about the shifting tides. "He's not gaining momentum, his ads are gaining momentum," Mr. Green said. "There's a clear contrast in this race." 
Mr. Green's supporters said they had expected the contest to tighten up, given Mr. Bloomberg's record-setting expenditures, and the ferocity and sheer ubiquity of his attacks. They noted that New York is a heavily Democratic city, that Mr. Green is a familiar figure with extensive experience in government, and that he has won the support of most of New York's major unions.
Still, there were some potentially worrisome trends for Mr. Green suggested in the Times poll.
For one thing, he is still having difficulty nailing down groups who tend to vote Democratic. Mr. Green is so far drawing the support of only about half of the city's likely black voters, and is trailing Mr. Bloomberg among Hispanic voters.
That is apparently a legacy from the fractious campaign Mr. Green ran against Mr. Ferrer to win the Democratic nomination, a fight that Mr. Bloomberg has sought to reprise, to his benefit, during this contest. And Democratic respondents in the poll who said they voted for Mr. Ferrer in the primary are evenly split between Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Green. 
Mr. Green's support is also notably tepid among Democratic voters, presumably a reflection of the fact that Mr. Bloomberg is a former Democrat whose views are largely indistinguishable from Mr. Green. About one in two Democrats said they would vote for Mr. Green. (By comparison, four in five Republicans, or about 80 percent, said they were planning to vote for Mr. Bloomberg.) And turnout will play an important role in Tuesday's balloting. If the pool of likely voters is enlarged to include those only somewhat likely to vote, then Mr. Green's advantage shrinks to one point. 
Most of all, though, Mr. Bloomberg seems to be benefiting by his identification with Mr. Giuliani. The mayor has a huge favorable rating, around 80 percent, that crosses all demographic lines.
Three-quarters of black respondents, who have consistently given Mr. Giuliani low job-approval ratings, said they now approve of Mr. Giuliani's performance. And sixty percent of all voters said that, if it were possible, they would vote for Mr. Giuliani again -- with most saying they will vote for Mr. Bloomberg in the general election. "From what I see in his television ads, Bloomberg says he'll be very involved with getting people back to work and following through with the economic things Giuliani has started," Margaret Mariano, 81, a Democrat and retired seamstress from the Bronx, said in a follow-up interview. "Mark Green doesn't seem to be doing too much. I really favor Giuliani, but he's not running, and since he's endorsed Bloomberg, he knows a little more about him."
On what is arguably the key question of this election, the poll found voters evenly divided when asked whether they would prefer someone with governmental experience (Mr. Green) or business experience (Mr. Bloomberg). But when the choice was between government experience or a "fresh approach," they chose the latter, 53 percent to 47 percent.

How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Oct. 27 to Nov. 1 in all parts of New York City with 1,172 adults, of whom 791 said they were registered to vote. Interviews were conducted in either English or Spanish. 
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of telephone exchanges in the city. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each area in the city was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure as the respondent. 
The results have been weighted to take into account household size and the number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to borough, race, sex, age, education, and Hispanic descent.
In addition, the questions about voting preferences in the 2001 election for mayor are based on the responses of "most likely voters," defined in terms of intention to vote, attention to the campaign, and past voting behavior.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult New Yorkers.
For smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is plus or minus 5 percentage points for "most likely voters."
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

YOUNGKEN, HEBER W., JR.

 BODY:
 YOUNGKEN-Heber W., Jr., 88. An internationally known educator, researcher, and university administrator, died October 22 at his home in Peace Dale, RI. He was the son of noted pharmacognocist Heber Wilkinson Youngken and Clara Eastman Youngken. Youngken devoted his life's work to the field of pharmacognosy and natural products chemisty. He was the author and co-author of over 180 publications dealing with the sources, chemistry, and pharmacological characteristics of plants. He was the author of "Pharmacognosy," J.B. Lippincott, PA, 1951, second ed. 1965, a textbook, (with R. Pratt), and "Organic Chemistry in Pharmacy," J.B. Lippincott, PA, 1949 (with Wilson, et al), among other texts. His writings appeared in numerous national journals including the "Journal of Natural Products" and the "Herbalist." He also contributed to research findings in the field of drugs derived from marine organisms. Youngken was the recipient of numerous awards, including the American Pharmaceutical Association Newcomb Award in Pharmacognosy, and achievement awards from the American Society of Pharmacognosy. Youngken served on review councils of the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, and was a principal researcher of numerous grants for studies in the field of natural products. He was a member of the revision committees of the "United States Pharmacopeia" and the "National Formulary", and frequent consultant to members of the drug industry on botanical drugs. Youngken came to Rhode Island in 1956 as the dean to establish, organize and develop the University of Rhode Island College of Pharmacy after 15 years in the pharmacy faculty at the University of Washington in Seattle. 
Under Youngken's leadership the URI pharmacy college grew in teaching, research, and service from 9 faculty and 135 students to 33 full term and 18 part time faculty with more than 600 undergraduate and graduate students at his retirement in 1981. Its faculty and graduates have gained worldwide recognition for excellence in pharmacy research and the related health sciences. He was a visiting professor at the University of London, 1970 and the University of Cairo, Egypt, 1977, '79, '81, and '85. Nationally prominent in pharmaceutical education and research, Youngken chaired or served on various committees representing the American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA), the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), the Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences, the American Society of Pharmacognosy (former president), the Society of Economic Botany, and many others. In 1953 he published one of the first papers in the United States to promote the concept of clinical pharmacy and the student externship programs. In 1958, he founded the Pharmacy Clinic at URI for continuing pharmacy education, now dedicated in his name. In 1994, the medicinal plant garden at the University of Rhode Island was dedicated to Youngken. A new faculty chair at URI, known as the OmarYoungken Distinguished Chair in Natural Product Chemistry, was created in his honor in 2001. Youngken served in the US Navy during World War II in North Atlantic convoy escort duty, later achieving the rank of Captain in the US Navy Reserve. He held degrees from Bucknell University (AB), the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy (BS), and the University of Minnesota (MS, PhD). In 1982 he received an Honorary DSc from the University of Rhode Island. Youngken is survived by his wife Daphne Goodwin Youngken, two sons, John Ronald Youngken of New York City and Richard Charles Youngken of Wakefield, RI, and two granddaughters, Kelly Goodwin Youngken of Arlington, VA, and Abigail Bouldin Youngken of Greensboro, NC. A memorial service will be held at St. Augustine's Church in Kingston, RI at 3:00 P.M., Monday, November 19th.

WHETHER they call it "observing purdah" or "hijab," the meaning is the same: a traditional Muslim woman's obligation to hide her physical beauty from men to whom she is not related. But there are many interpretations of what is required among the Afghan refugees now living in Pakistan. 
 When the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, they tried to impose a uniform standard: the head-to-toe covering called the burqa, a swirl of colored fabric that covers everything except a woman's eyes, erasing not just her allure but her individuality. 
 Aftab Ahmed Butt, who owns three women's clothing shops in Peshawar, Pakistan, summed up the argument for strictness: "Women should wear proper purdah with only their eyes showing. They should wear gloves and socks. Women not wearing purdah are wrong because males will be attracted to them. In your Western clothes your beauty, your dignity, would vanish. Women can wear makeup and Western clothes, but just for her husband."
But in the streets near his shops, Afghan women observe purdah or hijab (Urdu and Farsi words, respectively, that mean "covering")in many ways. 
Some keep the burqa while others use a large shawl that they call a chador, wearing it worn over loose clothing. (This is not the chador worn in Iran, which covers a woman completely.) The chadors vary in size, color and the way in which women wrap themselves, depending on the wearer's thoughts about hijab itself.
A few rebel still further. "Purdah was the oppression of the Taliban who forced us to wear these things and I left them behind in Kabul," said a recent arrival. Her blue eyes flashed defiantly from below a small, light, white scarf. But she dared not give her name.

GRAPHIC: Photos: "We are Pashtuns. We don't like the chador. The burqa is half of our faith. It is my religious duty to wear it. The wives of the prophet used to observe purdah. First, I was wearing a chador but when I got married my husband told me to wear the burqa. While you are in Rome do as Romans do." ZARGHONA, 19, in a full burqa in a shop that sells only burqas.; "I like the chador. When I was in Kabul I used to wear it. I was 6 or 7 when I started to wear it. It is quite comfortable and I don't cover my face. Next year, when I am in the seventh class, I will observe hijab. I will feel like a grown-up woman. I have seen Western movies and their clothes are their fashion, but this is an Islamic country, and Islam doesn't allow us to wear such clothes. I think they look very bad." HALEEMA, 13, a student.; "Every Pakistani woman wears a chador so I am supposed to wear it. I'm working, so I can't afford to wear a burqa. If I did, the mohajirs refugees would tease me because the burqa is for "good" women who stay inside the home. I face a lot of hurdles and problems. Men offer me money to go with them for the night." NOOREEN, vendor of bracelets in a Peshawar street market.; "This is the proper Islamic hijab. I've been wearing it for twenty 20 years. I made it myself. I like this color. It takes two or three hours to make and it costs 300 or 400 rupees about 5 or 6 dollars . It is economical to make it myself. It is a sin if you are not covering your face. We have to take care of our modesty. Hiya modesty is half of our faith." ULIYA, 45, in a homemade burqa.; "Because we are Muslims we should have a hijab. Some say only their hair should not be seen, some will wear a veil over their face and some will wear the burqa. It depends on each family how they do it. The disadvantage is the hot weather. I want to be in the house in the summer, where I don't have to wear it, but I think there are more advantages than disadvantages. Islam does not say you MUST wear it. Islam shows you the way and if you agree, you wear it." LIDA, 16, student of medicine at Afghan University in Peshawar.; "I won't hide my face. I don't agree with this rigid version of Islam that some people practice. I believe we should adopt the moderate, middle way. I'm not trying to be fashionable, I'm not wearing makeup. So why should people look at me? But if they do, I don't care. I will take my stand. My father-in-law gave me permission to work on the condition that I would hide my face. I told them I respect them but I don't like their way." RAHEELA, 45, girls' school principal. (Photographs by RUTH FREMSON/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Militancy; 
Living in a World Without Women

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
IN the war of militant Islam against the infidel West, there is a chilling paradox. Nowhere not on protesters' banners, pre-suicide videos or posters of the most wanted is there a woman's face. These martyrs and radicals call themselves the purifiers of society and the saviors of the poor, yet everything the world has learned in the last decade about why some countries develop and others stay mired in poverty shows that women can make all the difference.
 National standards of living improve family income, education, nutrition and life expectancy all rise, and birthrates fall -- as women move toward equality, said Jennifer Seymour Whitaker, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations studying how investing in women can help increase economic development and stability. She cites as an example a statistical model of Egypt that demonstrated if mothers with no education had completed at least primary school, the population below the poverty line would have been reduced by one-third. United Nations agencies produced similar findings in other countries. Amartya Sen, the Nobel prize-winning economist, has emphasized this repeatedly. 
 When women's influence increases, these experts explain, it strengthens the moderate center, bolstering economic stability and democratic order. Women might serve as powerful assets in the West's attempt to counter Islamic radicalism. 
The results of Iran's last two presidential elections reveal the moderating power of women -- their covered heads and bodies notwithstanding. President Mohammed Khatami, a moderate by current Iranian standards, was elected twice over the wishes of Islamic conservatives because of the pivotal support of women.
But for the last 30 years, Islamic extremism has flourished throughout the Middle East. As women have been pushed out of the political and economic spheres, their traditional moderating role has declined. "This is the warriors' time," said Fouad Ajami, director of Middle East Studies at the John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. "The warriors, the martyrs they're all men. In this moment of history, with the world of the Arabs and the larger world of Islam on the boil, the whole question of women and women's progress is shelved."
Indeed, in societies where women did gain footholds, that power may have prompted a backlash among lower middle class men in particular that helped militants. Women often look like competitors for jobs and a better life in countries where half or more of the population is under age 25. Angry young men, many of them unemployed, have seized the public arena from Algeria to South Asia and filled it with hate, intolerance and the abuse of women, Mr. Ajami said. He and other scholars of Muslim societies say these men are from the lower middle class, where expectations were rising fastest. "This is the class that is most hostile to women," Mr. Ajami said. "If this class dominates the Islamists, feminism and modernity are doomed."
Since 1979, radical Islamic movements have toppled or challenged governments from Iran to Egypt to Pakistan. Their growing popularity has many causes: poverty, the dissatisfaction with regimes viewed as corrupt and irreligious, the dislocation of modernity and unease with women's independence. Azar Nafisi, an Iranian scholar now at Johns Hopkins, said recruitment of militants is strong among low-paid workers or lower middle classes.
In recent decades, the media and the Internet have made images of Western life omnipresent. And what it looks like frightens this segment of the population. "If Western culture, if democratic culture, is spread to their countries, there will be no room for them," Ms. Nafisi said. "Women become the most obvious symbols of this change that seems threatening."
That backlash takes place even in less radical societies. In Kuwait, Mr. Ajami noted, the emir's efforts to bring women into politics has met a wall of resistance, and an Islamist backlash forced a vote in Parliament against coeducational universities.
Not all women oppose extremism. Some women aligned with extremists because they believed in the cause and were also disturbed by what seemed a Western-inspired cultural assault on traditional ways. Some thought they would improve their status by joining a revolutionary movement. Others choose to cover their heads or faces out of piety. Many initially rallied around militants for some of the same reasons as men -- distaste for corrupt secular rulers, frustration over poverty. In Iran in the 1970's, Mr. Ajami said, educated women donned the chador to protest the rule of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlavi -- and walked into a trap. For a generation, he said, they have paid for the mistake with a loss of many freedoms and rights.
It could be that women are less inclined to support radicalism now. Ms. Nafisi, who was a professor of English literature in Teheran, explained, "They saw what happened in the Iranian revolution, the Algerian revolution, the Palestinian struggle and many other places."
WHILE these militants are fighting secularism or the West, "they need women, they use women," she said. But even women who have risked their lives, she said, found they were little more than advertisements. When the battle was won, she said, "they put the women aside."
What is happening now, said Mr. Ajami, is "the break of the compact with modernity" throughout the Arab and wider Islamic world. "The issue of gender is so crucial to progress and modernity," he said, "But if the cult of the martyr and the children of the stones on the West Bank, if that's the dominant cult, then what little place there was for women is shrinking."
The sense that the place of women is regressing under Islamic militancy is widely acknowledged. But in the history of Muslim movements, even violent uprisings, it was not always so. A woman, Cut Nyak Dhien, led the nationalists of Indonesia's deeply Islamic region of Aceh in rebellion against the Dutch in the 19th century. Egyptian and Turkish women were in the forefront of modernizing, secularist movements in the 1920's. In the 1970's, Leila Khaled of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine hijacked planes. Benazir Bhutto marched through the streets of Pakistan in the 1980's to demand a return to democracy.
By the 1990's, some Muslim women seemed to be on the verge of success in the professions, scholarship and public life. Educational levels and opportunities were rising in many Islamic countries. "Some of these networks we thought we were building don't seem to have survived," said Mahnaz Afkhami, who has worked with Islamic women around the world for decades. Ms. Afkhami founded the Women's Learning Partnership in Washington, which aids grass-roots women's groups in many Muslim countries. She calls them an invisible majority not noticed by the West.
In Malaysia, for example, an anthropologist, Norani Othman, formed a movement to reinterpret Islamic law and strip it of centuries of accretions that discriminate against women. In Bangladesh, Yasmeen Murshed founded one of several organizations that teach women how to run for political office. From North Africa to Pakistan and Indonesia, women have demanded the right to study theology along with men, breaking their monopoly of the Koran.
Rounaq Jahan, a political scientist from Bangladesh at Columbia University's School of Public and International Affairs, said it is often forgotten that "more than half of the billion Muslims in the world live in Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India more than 500 million in just these four countries." Many are moderates if not secularists, she said, and how they have dealt with militancy could be instructive elsewhere.
Afghanistan has shown a world of Muslim women just how bad things can get. Ms. Nafisi said the West's promises that Afghan women would have choices in a post-Taliban era should be part of the anti-terrorism campaign. "When reconstruction in Afghanistan begins," she said, "the U.N. will find their most ardent supporters will be women."

An article last Sunday about the influence of women in Islamic cultures misstated the affiliation of Rounaq Jahan, an expert on women in developing countries. It is Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs, not Public and International Affairs.

A Stumble, Then a Rally Amid Bad News

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
By conventional logic, the stock market should have sagged throughout last week as investors were hit with a steady barrage of dismal economic reports. There was almost no encouraging news from corporate America. 
 Consumer confidence, construction spending, manufacturing activity and consumer spending all declined. The unemployment rate surged in October to 5.4 percent from 4.9 percent, with Americans losing more jobs in a one-month period than they had lost in any other month in more than 21 years. 
 But on Wall Street, some investors viewed the bad news as evidence that the worst might be over and that the economy would improve next year. After falling on Monday and Tuesday, the stock market stabilized on Wednesday and rallied on Thursday and Friday.
 Microsoft contributed to the rally on Thursday, reflecting anticipation of a settlement between it and the Justice Department on its long-running antitrust case.
 Stocks still finished lower for the week. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 221.63 points, or 2.3 percent, to 9,323.54. The Nasdaq composite index was off 23.23 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,745.73. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 20.51 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,084.10. SHERRI DAY

HEADLINE: Seeing the Causes Of Resentment 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your review of Diane Coyle's "Paradoxes of Prosperity" said the book, though written before Sept. 11, showed "that something was amiss in the capitalist Garden of Eden" -- that globalization had made many people resentful of the advanced economy of Western nations ("In a Global Tide, Beware the Undertow," Book Value, Oct. 28). 
 But the review did not mention what seems to me an unanticipated yet major root cause of the current wave of terrorism: world overpopulation. 
The looming population bomb of a few decades ago appeared to have been defused by improvements in agriculture that have fed additional billions of people and have largely spared us the predicted scenes of famine on the evening news. However, it is turning out to be a timed-release horror rather than a bomb. 
The enormous population increase of the last several decades, mainly among the world's impoverished, is a contributing factor in the "race for the bottom" in wages. The increased disparity between rich and poor is causing the anger that is driving the terrorists.
We are now paying a high price for the joys of being awash in cheap, high-quality consumer goods.
Whatever the solution to the current, virulent anti-Americanism, it certainly cannot be to raise the world to the American middle-class level. It is doubtful that the planet could support several more billions of people at subsistence, much less middle-class levels. I think overpopulation must, again, be a subject for concern.

HEADLINE: Raises for Public Servants 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In "Honoring, and Paying, All Those Who Serve" (Economic View, Oct. 28), Tom Redburn discussed how the public's recent recognition of the value of everyday workers had not resulted in a change of public policy, including higher wages. 
 But higher wages for public employees, of course, mean higher taxes enacted by officials elected by the public at large. 
From the administration of Ronald Reagan and through Sept. 11, candidates who supported a broad safety net were typically defeated by candidates who promised lower taxes and smaller government and offered reminders that "it's your money, not the government's."
If and when the next crop of candidates who espouse a broader safety net and higher wages for public employees find success at the ballot box, public policy will follow.

Bay of Mules

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The only place where tribal feuds are more rampant than Afghanistan is Washington.
 As the federal warlords here continue to stumble over and undermine each other, some have wondered if the president should reach beyond the Beltway and summon the best minds in the country, as Roosevelt did with the Manhattan Project and his Wall Street conscripts. Draft a Yankees team of business egomaniacs, political tough guys and science brainiacs to help us slam terrorists on health, intelligence, the economy, security, cyberspace and communications. 
 We need to get out of our psychological crouch -- not easy given the rolling high alerts -- and begin anticipating the terrorists' next moves. We need big ideas to quell big fears. As F.D.R. secretly wrote to Robert Oppenheimer in 1943, "Whatever the enemy may be planning, American science will be equal to the challenge." 
Our institutions are lumbering as they try to keep up with the simple, supple, clever paladins of Islam.
We're sophisticated; they're crude. We're millennial; they're medieval. We ride B-52's; they ride horses. And yet they're outmaneuvering us.
We spend $300 billion a year on planes and bombs and military marvels but still can't faze Taliban warriors who pop up out of the charred earth and mock us as ineffectual. (Our limp allies in the Northern Alliance also criticize our aim even as they refuse to fight in the rain. Next they'll balk if they split a nail.) 
We spend $30 billion a year on the C.I.A., F.B.I., N.S.A. and D.I.A. but still can't find O.B.L., his sleepers or the anthrax killers. (Robert Mueller begs us to help the F.B.I. find clues. Was it Colonel Mustard in the library with the spores on the candlestick?)
We spend $50 billion a year on public health, but are woefully unprepared for an onslaught of germs or viruses. Even though four people have died while health officials stumble around trying to fathom the way anthrax spreads, several renowned anthrax experts were quoted in the press last week as saying that the government has not bothered to call.
Then there is the Bay of Mules, the slaughter of Abdul Haq, which vividly showed once more how risibly incompetent our C.I.A. is. Mr. Haq's friend, Reagan N.S.C. director Robert McFarlane, bitterly complained afterward that the agency was more Clouseau than Clancy: "They spend $30 billion and do not have anybody out there who speaks Dari or who understands who these players are."
The agency slept while the Soviet Union fell and Osama rose.
David Boren, president of the University of Oklahoma and former chairman of Senate Intelligence (where George Tenet was his staff director), agreed that the C.I.A. must retool so it can be energized by "small teams with very carefully targeted objectives, moving very rapidly and not be part of such a big, moribund, slow-moving, dinosaur structure." 
He thinks President Bush should ask stars from various fields to convene here regularly as "a quasi-independent think tank," devising bold solutions to brazen threats.
I called a business star to see what he thought, but he bluntly predicted that such a brain trust would get lost in the fat folds of the bureaucracy. "Everything is so fuzzy and slow down there," he said. "You need somebody with hiring and firing authority, budget authority, to come in and break all the rules and crack heads, make sure the F.B.I. and C.I.A. are sharing every ounce of information, get rid of all the layers, establish clear, simple lines of communications."
He noted that the homeland czar is already drowning in his own flow chart: "Tom Ridge has got nothing except his friendship with Bush. You think some guy two levels down in the C.I.A. gives a damn about that?"
Like his dad, George W. Bush likes to be surrounded by a comfort zone of unquestionably loyal old reliables.
He kept on Mr. Tenet, despite his Clinton connection and all the C.I.A. debacles, because he felt comfortable around him. But Mr. Bush needs a wartime C.I.A. consigliere to crack heads, not a go-along-get-along guy.
America's crisis has spurred the president to rise above the familiar, trying things that he was not good at before -- news conferences, Congressional addresses, staying on top of his briefing books. He has reached inside himself and succeeded. 
Now may be the time for him to reach outside.

HEADLINE: Contenders Differ on 'the Seattle Way' 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
A city councilman and a city attorney are facing off in Tuesday's mayoral election, but their contest also amounts to something of a referendum on what is referred to here as "the Seattle Way." 
 The councilman, Greg Nickels, is a passionate defender of the local leadership style, in which officials seek solutions by listening to all points of view and working to achieve an accord. 
 The city attorney, Mark Sidran, said this year that "the Seattle style historically is the notion that it's not nice and it's not polite to disagree in public or to have a vigorous debate."
"I'm prepared to try to accomplish things even though I know some people disagree with me," he said. 
Mr. Nickels says he is the best person to bring the city together, although he balked at a suggestion that he would be a "consensus-driven" mayor. "Not consensus," he said, "but it is inclusion." 
Seattle has plenty of big city problems, including horrendous traffic jams. There is still fallout over the violence at Mardi Gras celebrations this year that led to one death, and an economic downturn poses budget problems. 
Polls suggest that the race is tight. Mayor Paul Schell, who placed third in the nonpartisan primary with 22 percent of the vote, threw his support to Mr. Sidran this week. 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 5, 2001

HEADLINE: In Miami, Candidates Promise What They Won't Do 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
A striking aspect of the race for mayor of Miami is how much time the candidates spend promising what they will not do.
 Nine contenders are seeking to unseat Mayor Joe Carollo, relying on the usual talking points about city services, high taxes and the need to do more for the elderly. But they are also pledging not to further embarrass a city that has grown weary of colorful episodes and scandals. 
 Yet many of the candidates, who include two former mayors, are themselves high-profile characters whose very presence on the ballot offers insight into the complex, often comical Miami political structure. 
One contender, Xavier Suarez, has wanted a shot at the mayor since 1998, when his Election Day victory over Mr. Carollo was overturned by a court that concluded widespread voting fraud had occurred. Another candidate, Jose Garcia-Pedrosa, is a former city attorney and city manager whom Mr. Carollo fired. A third mayoral hopeful, Manny Diaz, is a prominent local lawyer who represented the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez in the custody battle last year.
"The issue," said George Gonzalez, a political science professor at the University of Miami, "is which candidate seems most professional, least likely to embarrass the city."
Mayor Carollo says that Miami is in far better shape than when he took office in 1996. He cites a drop in crime, an increase in international trade and, until the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a relatively strong economy.
But Mr. Carollo's challengers point to a list of problems and embarrassing moments. They note Miami's loss in August of the Latin Grammy Awards to Los Angeles because organizers feared protests by Cuban-Americans here. The ceremony was expected to pour $35 million into the economy and highlight Miami as the capital of Latin music. The program was later canceled. 
The mayor's opponents also point to accusations of police corruption. More than a dozen officers were indicted on federal charges that they planted evidence and lied to cover up their actions in several shootings.
Mr. Carollo's own legal troubles have been campaign fodder. In February, he spent a night in jail after a domestic dispute in which he was accused of throwing a cardboard tea container at his wife. A misdemeanor abuse charge was dropped.
"The whole personal scandal, of course, has been unsightly," Mr. Suarez told a reporter who had not asked him about it. "All of us running for mayor have tried not to comment on it."
Mr. Carollo, reached by phone several times in the last week, said he could not talk but agreed to be interviewed later and then was unavailable at those times.
Mr. Carollo has been speaking directly to voters in radio broadcasts and at neighborhood forums as he wages one of the toughest fights of his career. Polls show him trailing former Mayor Maurice Ferre, with Mr. Diaz gaining on him.
Mr. Carollo also failed to win a key endorsement. The Miami Herald has backed Mr. Diaz, saying he "offers fresh ideas and a more thoughtful approach to the city's problems."
Some candidates said that, above all, Miami needed more leadership and less controversy.
"I think the people of Miami are just tired of scandals," said Mr. Ferre, whose own tenure as mayor from 1973 to 1985 was marked by the Mariel boatlift and racial unrest in Liberty City.
Still, Mr. Carollo's supporters and some analysts say it is unfair to blame him for everything. Many of the police shootings that led to the officers' indictments, for example, date to 1990, before he took office.
"I don't think he's done any worse or any better than any other mayor," said Mr. Gonzalez, of the University of Miami. "His own personal problems further hurt the city's image. But it says nothing of him as an administrator."
And Sergio Bendixen, a political analyst, cautioned against counting Mr. Carollo out prematurely. 
"He's not the type to quit, nor the type to lose interest in power," Mr. Bendixen said. "He lives for that."

HEADLINE: Once Braced for a Power Shortage, California Now Finds Itself With a Surplus 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
By now, as the last of the Indian summer heat finally leaves the Central Valley, California was supposed to have suffered through a long hot season of electricity blackouts and price gouging, putting the world's fifth-largest economy in further peril.
 But rather than days of blackouts, from early May on there has not been a single hour with the lights out since then, and Californians have led the nation in energy conservation. Instead of a scarcity of power, California now has too much, and the state has been selling electricity at a loss or even giving it away. 
 But if California proved that it could defy the dire predictions and make of mockery of the energy-guzzling cliche often applied here, the state is still stuck with a huge burden from its disastrous experiment in power deregulation. 
At the core of California's problem is this mystery: How could the state use less electricity this year and last and still pay $35 billion more for it than it did in 1999? 
And now, as it locks into long-term contracts to provide energy stability, the state could be saddling a generation with rates that are $20 billion above market costs, in the estimate of consumer groups and state watchdogs. Because these contracts were made when energy prices were high, the cost of the solution could end up being just as great as the cost of the problem.
So while the immediate "crisis" of keeping power flowing through the Golden State has disappeared, the epic transfer of wealth that has characterized this chapter in the state's history continues.
"People realize now that this was a monumental scam," said Gov. Gray Davis of California in an interview, referring to the freewheeling energy market that ended earlier this year.
Records show that on some days during the worst of the power troubles, up to a third of the electricity that should have been available was taken off line, creating an artificial shortage that drove up prices, said Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission.
"We had plenty of electric power available," Ms. Lynch said. "But we didn't have a cop on the beat."
The cop, in the view of state leaders, was a federal regulator that took a hands-off role even as prices rose 1,000 percent or more above previous years. Regulators finally acted in early summer, instituting price caps on the wild California market.
The companies that provided electricity to California say they did nothing illegal, and the problem was that California never had enough electricity to get through tight times, causing dramatic price spikes.
In claims before federal regulators, California says it is owed a refund of at least $9 billion from the power providers. The most egregious example of price gouging, state officials say, was when Duke Energy charged the state $3,880 for a single megawatt hour that had cost about $30 one year earlier.
With falling oil and natural gas prices, a megawatt hour can be purchased on the spot energy market for about $19, providing enough power to run a thousand homes. 
The energy companies say they owe the state nothing. The companies, which would not comment on the specifics of the California claims, say they simply played by the rules. Federal regulators say the state is owed a refund, but the exact amount will probably not be determined until next year.
As the billion-dollar claims are sorted out, the state's experience over the last two years is being held up as cautionary tale -- by both sides of the debate over power regulation. 
At least half the states have some form of energy deregulation, and four of them are starting down this path within the next year. But unlike California, the other states say they have held on to their regulatory power, while ensuring adequate outside power sources should the market tighten. 
Last May, as he unveiled his energy policy, President Bush said the nation was facing the worst energy shortage since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970's. His plan called for building one new power plant every week for the next 20 years, and drilling for oil in new places like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
At the time, Vice President Dick Cheney said blackouts were a certainty in California and was dismissive of the conservation effort. 
Several things threw the predictions off. First, after begging President Bill Clinton and later President Bush to put price caps on the California market, Governor Davis finally got his wish in late June. It had an immediate effect, records show, of driving down electricity costs on the freewheeling open market that California had created.
At the same time, the regulators said the generators had to sell their power to California, making it much more difficult to withhold power in order to drive up prices, or sell out of state.
"After the cop finally showed up, we went from paying a hundred million dollars a day for power to twenty million," said David Freeman, who negotiated power contracts when the state stepped in for the bankrupt utilities. The utilities gave up their generating plants during deregulation.
Second, California embarked on the nation's biggest conservation program. The state authorized $800 million for energy efficiency, and mounted a $30 million advertising campaign, using sly humor to get people to "kill-a-watt," as one ad put it. At the same time, Governor Davis signed an executive order allowing people who saved 20 percent energy use to earn a 20 percent discount on their bills.
The most optimistic projections had it that 10 percent of ratepayers would take advantage of the pay-to-conserve program. This week, the state released figures showing that more than a third of eligible ratepayers cut their electric use by 20 percent.
What helped the conservation program, others say, was a rate increase of up to 40 percent on residential users -- giving people a powerful incentive to save energy.
The state also added power, bringing on line the first new power plants in 12 years. Together with conservation savings, California found itself in the summer with a daily surplus of available power -- on some days by a huge margin.
The weather played a big role as well. The summer of 2001 was the 25th-hottest in the last 100 years, federal weather officials say. But there were no prolonged heat waves throughout the entire state and the West, straining the system.
Bush administration officials this week praised Governor Davis for the conservation program that surprised everyone.
At the height of the crisis, California began buying long-term contracts to provide a stable energy supply. The state has signed 55 contracts for $43 billion in power.
When the purchases were made -- averaging about $69 per megawatt hour -- they looked like a bargain, when spot prices were four times as high. But now, with spot energy selling for $19, the contracts have riled consumer groups and prompted a rift between Governor Davis and his appointed head of the utility commission, Ms. Lynch.
Ms. Lynch says the state is making a monumental blunder. She said the state should renegotiate, claiming the contracts were signed under duress.
Governor Davis, after saying for months that the state got a good deal that saved the day, has hedged his statements of late. "If we can improve on the contracts, we will," he said.
For now, many California leaders feel as if they came through a near-death experience.
"Sure we were robbed," Mr. Freeman said. "We got ripped off real bad. But we're survivors. We showed we could whup them even after nobody said we could."

HEADLINE: Tourism Industry Pins Hopes on Heritage and Culture 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: VICKSBURG, Miss., Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Joan and Allan Stanford considered lying on the beach or relaxing in the mountains, but with a war going on, a self-indulgent pleasure just seemed inappropriate. They wanted to travel, did not want to fly. 
 So the Stanfords, a nursing home administrator and a truck driver from Lucedale, in southern Mississippi, found themselves this week at the Vicksburg National Military Park, wandering amid the cannons and the bronze busts and the marble testimonies to soldiers long dead. Generations of Americans have hallowed this soil, making it one of the most visited Civil War battlefields, and Mississippi tourism officials hope its popularity grows at time of flag decals and patriotic song. 
 "We knew we didn't want to travel too far from home this year, and then we realized there was a lot we had never seen in our own state," said Ms. Stanford, 43. "So we decided, why not learn a little bit about our own heritage? With everything going on, we just figured it was time to learn where we came from."
It is upon that foundation that many tourism officials around the nation expect to rebuild their industry, shattered by the attacks of Sept. 11 and the daunting impediments to mobility that followed. Now many states are encouraging residents to take tentative steps back into the world of leisure by exploring their backyards, hugging their relatives and returning to American roots.
"Heritage and culture sites are now bigger than they have ever been," said Darienne Wilson, director of tourism for the Mississippi Development Authority. "People want to walk on the square of a small country town or an old battlefield. They want something calm in their life, and they want to go somewhere where they feel safe."
Many tourism officials said the industry expected an enormous number of family reunions to take place from Thanksgiving through Christmas this year. Around the South, which hopes to remain a winter destination, cities are encouraging residents to play host to those reunions.
"I think we're going to see more families together this winter than in the last 15 or 20 years," said Tony Schopp, president of the Savannah Convention and Visitors Bureau in Georgia. "People may have delayed or canceled their major trip, but they still want a trip, and they'll drive farther than they used to get together with their families. We want them to do that in Savannah."
The movement toward leaner vacations had already been building as the economy began to contract, but the more recent fear of flying, airport inconveniences and a renewed sense of patriotism have all but transformed the industry. Dozens of states, facing layoffs at hotels, restaurants and attractions, have begun pleading with residents to spend their tourism dollars at home, and thousands of people have already begun to comply.
Officials in Missouri have begun an advertising campaign urging residents to "Rediscover Your Missouri." Georgia's campaign, known as "Georgia for Georgians," allows anyone with a state driver's license to receive a variety of discounts at hotels, resorts and state parks. In Minnesota, Gov. Jesse Ventura unveiled a campaign this week to get residents to "Explore Minnesota Now." Maryland last month dropped all bridge tolls and transit fees for a weekend to get people traveling again.
Even Hawaii, which has been devastated by the drop in travel, is trying to get residents to spend money at home, offering deep discounts to Hawaiians. Of course, the bank accounts of many state residents have diminished because of the downturn, so if that plan does not work, the state is also distributing 40,000 telephone calling cards so that Hawaiians can call their friends on the mainland and urge them to visit.
Cities without a small-town square to sell are trying to reposition themselves in old-fashioned ways. Orlando, Fla., which saw a 23 percent drop in tourism in September, unveiled a hastily prepared advertising campaign last month called "Family Time, Family Place," which shows families hugging at attractions like Disney World.
"Our research shows that Sept. 11 caused people to prioritize the things in their life, identifying what is truly important and meaningful to them, and family is at the top of the list," said Jose Estorino, senior vice president for marketing with the Orlando-Orange County Convention and Visitors Bureau. "If people are going to take a trip now, they are going to do it to become closer to their family, and that's the focus of our campaign."
Many destinations have essentially given up hope that air travel will return to normal this winter and are concentrating instead on what the industry calls rubber-tire traffic, those visitors close enough to drive. Areas that have suffered the worst reductions in tourism since Sept. 11 are those heavily dependent on air travel, including Hawaii, Las Vegas, Orlando and Atlanta. The loss of conventions and meetings has cost Atlanta $50 million a week, according to its visitors' bureau.
"Fortunately for us, 84 percent of our travel is already rubber-tire, so I hope we're going to prove more resilient than other places," said Janis Cannon, the deputy commissioner in charge of the Georgia tourism division. "Instead of people flying off to Europe or somewhere, we hope we can get them to spend money in Augusta."
Here in Vicksburg, Lamar Roberts, director of the Gray and Blue Naval Museum, said his small attraction was now regularly visited by charter buses full of school groups that had canceled air trips to Washington or New York.
"We get a lot of people who've just decided to slow down and stop in a lot of places they've never been, like right here," said Mr. Roberts, whose storefront museum claims to have the world's largest collection of Civil War gunboat models. "It's a good time to be a history buff."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ARAB AMERICANS; 
Struggling to Be Both Arab and American

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Nov. 3 

 BODY:
The national anthem was a given. So was the flag. But the planners of the Arab American Political Action Committee's fourth annual banquet were stuck on one detail: What to put on the banner behind the podium?
 Someone suggested "America First," to quash questions of divided loyalty yet hint at exasperation over Israeli influence on American foreign policy. Another offered the bland but ubiquitous "United We Stand." The dozen immigrants and sons of immigrants struggled for a catch phrase to capture their complexity: "Proud to be Arabs, but 100% American." "Truly Arab, Fully American." "Proud Arabs, True Americans." 
 "I think we should stress the Arab, because our community is shying away," said Mazen Hammoud, 33, an engineer who arrived here in 1988. 
"Frankly, I'm just really sick and tired of defending my ethnicity," said Tina Farhat, 22, a student at the University of Michigan campus here. "Is there any reason I shouldn't be a proud Arab?"
The struggle over a slogan here in the headquarters of The Arab American News, where murals from Beirut and Jerusalem hang over stacks of the bilingual weekly, echoes the broader battle fought daily in this city's classrooms and cafes, on the assembly line at the Ford auto plant and over real estate transactions on newly vibrant Warren Avenue.
Since Sept. 11, as reporters have scoured the sidewalks for terrorist sympathizers amid law enforcement suggestions that Dearborn is crawling with "sleeper cells," the community has increasingly tried to assert its nascent political power, seething over ethnic profiling and declaring it a democratic right to criticize American foreign policy. Outrage over the terrorist attacks is matched by outrage over Israeli occupation, Iraqi sanctions, stereotyping and wiretapping.
Yet even as Arab Americans claim their place, the alienation is obvious. In dozens of conversations, with new "boaters" who have been here a few months and those whose families have stayed for generations, people here inadvertently but consistently refer to non-Arabs as "Americans."
"When do I become an American?" asked Donnie Unis, 62, a retired fire captain whose grandfather came here in 1896, and who has lived all his days in this city, except for a 19-month Army tour in Germany. "I don't want my kids to live the life I've had to lead, always apologizing for who I am. I can either be an American or I can be an Arab, but I can't be both. You know what? I am both."
Dearborn, a town of 27 square miles southwest of Detroit, was famous first as the home of the Ford Motor Company. Now it is better known as the heart of Arab America, the place with the largest concentration of Middle Eastern people outside the Middle East. 
Some 300,000 Arabs live in metropolitan Detroit: Palestinian Christians in Livonia, Iraqi Chaldeans in Southfield and Warren, Yemenis in Hamtramck and Syrians in Macomb County. Dearborn, dominated by Lebanese Muslims, is the community's soul, with an Arab population that has grown to 30,000 from 7,000 in 1970. 
Arabic signs hawking insurance, dental work, auto repair, bargain blue jeans and fresh fruit stretch for miles down Warren Avenue, as 188 Arab-owned businesses have opened in the last decade.
There are a dozen mosques, from tiny storefronts to the $15 million dome rising on Ford Avenue that will be the nation's largest. "Yala," Arabic for "Let's go," is a staple of sidewalk chatter. Pharoah's Cafe I has elaborate water pipes with six flavors of tobacco, including Bahraini apple, rose and "cocktail," but no liquor. 
"When I speak to my parents, they say, 'How do you like living in America?' " said Farhan Latif, 20, the Pakistani-born president of the Muslim Students Association at Henry Ford Community College, whose parents live in Dubai. "I tell them I'm not living in America. I'm living in the gulf." 
As their culture permeates street and social life, Arabs are also organizing to influence local politics, starting with the schools, where they make up nearly two-thirds of the ballooning enrollment. At Stout Middle School, like other schools here, Muslim girls in head scarves jump rope in sex-segregated gym classes. The school district banned pork from its lunches eight years ago, and this fall began a program serving halal meat, permitted under Islamic rules. At Fordson High School, which is 90 percent Arab American, just 300 of the 2,100 students attended the homecoming dance, many of them escorted by male relatives.
At the same time, Arab entrepreneurs are lobbying to be included in minority small-business loan programs. Others are complaining that none of City Hall's department heads, just 7 percent of its appointed commissioners and only a handful of police officers and firefighters are of Arab descent.
"We want to pick up the garbage in our community," said Osama Siblani, editor of The Arab American News and an adviser to the Lebanese immigrant who is challenging the four-term mayor in Tuesday's election. "We want to be police officers. We want to be firefighters. It looks like an occupation army."
Considering the community's longevity and upward mobility, many question why it has not moved further into the mainstream. New waves of immigrants reinforce old-world ways. Religious differences and disagreements over America's place in the world exacerbate feelings of isolation.
Hassan Jaber, deputy director of the 30-year-old Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services, said Dearborn's Arabs lack strong institutions to speak through. "People are starting to question where we are as a community," he said. "One of the mistakes we've done as a community is lack of interaction." 
Economic success has preceded political influence. When Hassane Baydoun, sometimes called Sam, arrived here in 1978, there were no lights on Warren Avenue and the storefronts were boarded and broken. Today, Mr. Baydoun, an American flag on his lapel above a Century 21 pin with 70 tiny diamonds -- one for every $1 million sold -- cruises through in his Cadillac, one hand on his ever-chirping cellphone. 
To the left is the New Yasmeen Bakery, the Stars and Stripes in the window blocking Al Jazeera, beamed from Qatar, on televisions inside. Someone offered $132,000 in 1987; now the building is worth $2 million, Mr. Baydoun said. On the right is the Hamido restaurant -- the owner just bought a 1,400-square-foot doughnut shop on the next block for $510,000. That Mobil station on the corner? It sold for $15,000 in 1987, then $90,000 a few years ago. Today it would cost $1 million.
Arab Americans long ago spilled over from the South End, near Ford's Rouge Plant, to dominate Dearborn's East End, and are increasingly buying houses -- whose values keep rising despite warnings of immigrants ruining the neighborhood -- in the West End and even in nearby Dearborn Heights.
A few years ago, Mr. Baydoun, 38, built a $250,000 home in the East End. The Arabic inscription over the front door reads, "In the name of God, the beneficent, the merciful." Below it hangs an American flag.
"I didn't know how American I am, really, until this thing happened," Mr. Baydoun said of the terrorist attacks. 
He recalled his Oct. 1, 1984, naturalization ceremony. "They asked me if I wanted to change my name. I said, no, I'm Hassane, that's the name my father gave me. In retrospect, maybe I should have changed it, with what's going on nowadays." 
One of Dearborn's first Arab-owned businesses was Joe & Ed's, a market with seven kinds of olives and umpteen flavors of Frito-Lay chips. Mr. Saad, Joe's son and Ed's brother, is Al to the distributors gossiping over golf and Adel to the workers trading tidbits from Al Bayat, the Beirut daily newspaper sold at the counter.
"The American people that come here, everyone that comes to this community, likes us," said Mr. Saad, 42, a Dearborn native. "The thing that used to strike me is when the kids would say, 'You're not like the other Arabs.' I am like them." 
Mr. Saad's sons play football, his daughter is a cheerleader. He gives money to the mosque but rarely steps inside. He has never been to Lebanon.
"If they wanted to tell everyone to go home, where would I go? To the moon?" he said. "I don't have a country. This is my only country."
Mr. Saad's sister Lorraine, 49, left Dearborn 12 years ago to open a restaurant in Las Vegas, where her fuchsia lipstick and sleeveless shirts would not stand out. "I don't want to be like them, I don't want to act like them," she said of the Dearborn Arabs.
Ms. Saad came home to Dearborn in May to help her 27-year-old son open a pizza and bagel shop next to the market. "I don't want him in Vegas until he gets married," she said, "because he has a better chance here of marrying his own kind." 
The familiar comforts of the community are not always present in the workplace. Said Berry laughed when asked if any of the union stewards at Ford's Rouge plant are Arab American. Mr. Berry said that in 13 years of loading and unloading trucks he has never been late, yet the cleaner jobs always go to someone else.
When co-workers pass him by while handing out literature, Mr. Berry said he cannot help but wonder whether they think him illiterate. More than once, he said, men on the line have asked whether he pays taxes on his $24 an hour.
After Sept. 11, Mr. Berry warned his wife to be careful going outside. But when she said she would appease any harassers by saying she understood, he exploded, "You won't."
"I always thank God for everything, and an extra thanks for being here -- we believe this is the land of opportunity," Mr. Berry said. "When I go to Lebanon, I miss it back here. What do you call this, loyalty, love? It's not like I'm forced to come. I feel I should come back."
At the political banquet, "This Land is Your Land," and "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," wafted through the Bint Jebail Cultural Center, named for the Lebanese town that has, in a way, recreated itself here in what is known throughout the Arab world as Dearborn, U.S.A. 
Three members of Congress attended in a nod to Dearborn's 10,000 Arab registered voters.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: ALLY'S FUTURE; 
U.S. Pondering Saudis' Vulnerability

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
The question is asked quietly by policy makers inside Washington's official corridors, and loudly by television and newspaper experts: Is Saudi Arabia heading for an Iranian-style Islamic revolution?
 The issue of Saudi stability has been factored into Washington's strategic thinking for several years. 
 After the terrorist bombing of the Khobar military barracks in Saudi Arabia in 1996, which killed 19 Americans, the Central Intelligence Agency organized a special team of analysts to study Saudi Arabia under the same rigorous process used to assess the most serious threats to American national security, senior intelligence officials said at the time.
One reason for subjecting Saudi Arabia to the C.I.A.'s "hard-target strategy," which it also uses for Russia, China, Iran, Iraq and North Korea, was concern that the United States could lose its closest ally in the Persian Gulf, just as it lost Iran in 1979 when a religious-based revolution overthrew the monarchy there, the officials said.
The task force concluded that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, was politically stable and unlikely to become another Iran. But it warned that Washington's information void about the threats facing a closed society was so vast that such a conclusion was far from certain. 
After claims by federal investigators that 15 of the 19 hijackers in the Sept. 11 attacks were from Saudi Arabia and that some recruiting, financing and planning for the attacks occurred on Saudi soil, there is anxiety once again that the kingdom may be vulnerable to enemies in its midst.
That anxiety is compounded by charges from critics in the kingdom that the Saudi royal family is too close to Washington, and by critics in the United States that the family is not close enough.
"The Saudis are in a tight fix," said Mamoun Fandy, a professor at the National Defense University in Washington and author of "Saudi Arabia and the Politics of Dissent." 
"The Islamists think the Saudis have sold out to the Americans, and the Americans think they have sold out to the terrorists," he said. "Eventually this translates into an erosion of legitimacy -- that if you are not satisfying the Arabs and Washington, then you're on your own."
But does that translate into popular revolution in the name of Islam?
Certainly there are parallels between the House of Saud and the Pahlavi dynasty in Iran. 
Like prerevolutionary Iran, Saudi Arabia is an authoritarian, oil-rich monarchy with a Muslim population. It is notorious for corruption and profligate spending, resistant to democratization, viewed increasingly as subservient to the will of Washington, dependent on American weaponry and criticized by radicals in exile and some conservative clerics for not being Islamic enough.
But the shah was a singular, isolated ruler, while the Saudis have dispersed power throughout the royal family. Many of its 7,000 members hold key political positions (the governors and military commanders in nearly every province are members) and run important businesses. 
The shah was determined to transform Iran into a modern, secular society at breakneck speed, regardless of how much it offended the clergy; the House of Saud adheres to a conservative, repressive version of Islam, and despite an uneasy alliance with the clergy, it draws much of its legitimacy from its role as guardian of Mecca and Medina, the two holiest sites in Islam.
Iran has a long tradition of active rebellion and opposition politics in the name of the nation-state. Saudi Arabia does not. 
Perhaps most important, Crown Prince Abdullah is regarded as a pious, incorruptible leader more responsive to the people and more willing than his predecessor, King Fahd, to take on Washington, particularly when it comes to policy toward the Palestinians. (King Fahd's illness has left him unable to govern.) 
Prince Abdullah's release of three religious sheiks imprisoned after the 1991 Persian Gulf war and his criticism of Washington's unwavering support for Israel has also strengthened his reputation at home. 
"Since late 1998, the crown prince began responding to both internal and external demands by reining in the most ostentatious behavior of the princes, limiting their participation in business ventures," said Gwenn Okruhlik, a political scientist at the University of Arkansas who has written extensively about Saudi Arabia. "The strongest nationalist voice in Saudi Arabia today is Abdullah, so he may be able to respond in a way that the shah could not."
Experts like Dr. Okruhlik and Dr. Fandy say that for the moment, the situation in Saudi Arabia is not as unstable as it was in 1990, when the kingdom agreed to permit American bases on its soil after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, or between 1995 and 1998, when a succession struggle and a lack of clear leadership made the kingdom seem vulnerable. 
The problem today is that the House of Saud is suffering from a steady degradation of support rather than widespread opposition to its rule. 
Saudi Arabia has 30 percent unemployment and one of the highest birthrates in the world. Average income has dropped by at least half since the heyday of the oil boom of the early 1980's. Most of the people are under 15, a population bulge that will put even more pressure on an already crumbling infrastructure. 
The Saudis are struggling with how far to go in acknowledging the presence of enemies in their midst. Last Sunday, the deputy interior minister, Prince Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz, said -- without proof -- that Osama bin Laden "is not involved in any explosions in the kingdom." 
Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador in Washington, in an interview last month drew a stark comparison between Saudi Arabia today and Iran under the shah. 
He offered this anecdote: In the late 1960's, the shah sent King Faisal a series of letters that said: "Please, my brother, modernize. Open up your country. Make the schools mixed women and men. Let women wear miniskirts. Have discos. Be modern. Otherwise I cannot guarantee you will stay in your throne."
King Faisal wrote back: "Your majesty, I appreciate your advice. May I remind you, you are not the shah of France. You are not in the Elysee. You are in Iran. Your population is 90 percent Muslim. Please don't forget that."
Prince Bandar concluded, "History proved our point."
By contrast, he said, the compact between the ruler and the ruled remained strong in Saudi Arabia.
"Nobody, no force in the world, including the United States of America, can help the king of Saudi Arabia or the royal family or the government to stay in power against the will of the people," he said. If there are internal frictions, he added, it is because Saudi Arabia is "the only country in the world where the government is avant garde and the people are more conservative."
Many experts are not so hopeful. 
"The Al Saud have always based their so-called right to rule on conquest, co-optation through the distribution of oil revenues and Wahhabism," the strict version of Islam practiced in the kingdom, Dr. Okruhlik said. "But coercion has fostered popular resentment, oil revenues have shrunk dramatically and Wahhabism never reflected the diverse reality of Saudi Arabia. There has been a convergence of dissent as men and women, merchants and industrialists, Sunnis and Shiites across the board are calling for a redistribution of wealth, the rule of law and social justice."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE REFUGEES; 
Many Flee From War To Cities, Not Camps

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: QUETTA, Pakistan, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
His three small children wailed at night, terrified by the sound of the American bombs. He was afraid of being conscripted by the Taliban, the rulers he couldn't stand. All around his home, neighbors were leaving their village to seeking safety and shelter elsewhere.
 Shah Wili, a 27-year-old brick maker with fine hands and a gentle manner, arrived in this desert city three days ago, along with his wife, mother, sister and 18 children of his extended family -- refugees from what seemed like an endless war at home. 
 Like most Afghans fleeing to Pakistan, Shah Wili chose to come to this garish bustling city, scorning a transit camp established by the United Nations high commissioner for refugees at the border. He also was not willing to go to one of the sprawling refugee camps in the region that have served Afghans for more than 20 years of conflicts.
Of the 70,000 Afghan refugees who have arrived in Pakistan, refugee specialists estimate that 70 percent of them have chosen the path of Shah Wili -- choosing to go to the major cities of Peshawar or Quetta. Once in these cities, they squeeze into overcrowded corners with friends and family, renting rooms and trying to make do in an economy with few jobs for locals or foreigners.
By choosing to go to a city instead of one of the major camps, the refugees become ineligible for refugee status and the entitlements of food, shelter and medical services that come with it. Like Shah Wili, most are arriving with what they can pile onto the top of a bus, with a few precious objects clasped in their arms.
Shah Wili said he paid out his last rupees for the journey to safety, arriving three days ago. But he said that the price was worth it. "This home is like a palace to me because there is no bombing," he said, looking up at a straw-thatched roof and leaning against the mud-and-brick wall of one of the three small rooms he has rented for his extended family.
They paid the equivalent of $20 to travel from their home in the village of Haji Arab, a few miles south of Kandahar to go to the border. Along the way, they passed a refugee camp run by the Taliban at Spin Boldak, the last town in Afghanistan before the Pakistani border. Shah Wili said he shunned it because he was worried he would be conscripted from the camp, which is reportedly surrounded by a trench and some heavy weaponry.
At the border, the family was held for two days while they haggled with the police and then with a bus driver who would take them to Quetta for an affordable sum.
Shah Wili said he paid the driver about twice the usual bus fare because his family did not have Pakistani identity cards and the driver said he would have to pay off the police. But he did not have enough cash to pay for the transport of all their belongings -- carpets, clothes, kitchen utensils. The rest remain stranded at the customs post.
One reason that many Afghans choose the cities is that they believe the women can lead a more private life behind the high mud brick walls that enclose the homes here and offer more protection than the brazenly public life of a tented camp. In the small compound where Shah Wili and his family have settled, the adult women of the group -- his mother, his wife and his sister -- occupied one room.
In the tradition of their conservative society, the women welcomed two female visitors but not male visitors. Unmasked because they shed their burkas -- the head-to-toe tent-like garment that covers the face, arms and legs -- the women were friendly, slightly vivacious and very curious about the first Western women they had seen. Their traditional clothes were brightly hued.
On a shelf, a pale blue burka belonging to one of the women was folded for use when she stepped outside. On a wall hung a prize possession of Shah Wili's mother, a battery-operated clock that hung from the wall still wrapped in protective plastic with the hands set on Afghan time.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: SMALL BUSINESS; 
Desperate Trip To Lobby For Grants, Not Loans

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
As pupils returned from their summer break, enrollment at Park Preschool in Lower Manhattan was at its highest in its 12-year history. The neighborhood was growing so fast that Kevin Artale, who owns the private school, was considering opening another one.
 But on Sept. 11, the preschool, which is near ground zero, suffered $80,000 in damage, about $30,000 more than its insurance policy would cover. Children had to be divided into groups and moved to temporary quarters. Thirteen of the 80 children dropped out, and more may follow if their parents flee the area. 
 "Before, there were moving trucks coming into the neighborhood all the time," Mr. Artale said. "Now all the trucks are going in the opposite direction."
Desperate to keep his business afloat and to avoid laying off any of his eight employees, Mr. Artale boarded a bus before dawn one morning last week to travel to Washington with 47 other small-business owners from Lower Manhattan. Their mission was to lobby members of Congress for immediate relief and tell them they need grants, not loans, to survive. They also urged support for an economic stimulus package that would provide tax credits for employers and residents remaining in or relocating to downtown.
Restaurateurs, travel agents, shopkeepers and others on the trip, organized by the Alliance for Downtown New York, argued that theirs was a special case. Many businesses were damaged and had to close for several weeks. Some remain shut. Concerns about air quality and transportation are keeping many residents and visitors away. And as many as 100,000 workers in the area who made up a crucial part of the customer base for neighborhood businesses have disappeared, many of them permanently.
Kent Gordis, a television producer, summed up the group's message: "This was an act of war on a civilian target," he said, "and we were part of the target."
Seven weeks after the attack, businesses that are still closed include Steamer's Landing, a Battery Park City restaurant, which employed 45 people. At others that are open, like Capsouto Freres, a restaurant in TriBeCa, business is down 30 percent, in part because taxis no longer circulate through the area.
There is no access to TriBeCa Auto Repair, which is on a street that has been closed. Ernest D. Seruya, an owner, has had to lay off all 12 employees. He is still paying off a $350,000 loan he got four years ago to renovate his service department.
At Sabena's, a gourmet take-out business on Nassau Street, deliveries have declined to 35 a day, from 120. Matthew K. Sabena, the chief executive, said he is owed $15,000 from charge-account customers and incurred $200,000 in losses when he had to close a new take-out store whose start-up costs were supposed to come out of the downtown store.
The business owners were pushing for legislation being drafted by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Jerrold L. Nadler that would provide $1 billion in grants. Paul J. Q. Lee, the owner of 32 Mott Street General Store, a gift shop in Chinatown that has been in his family since 1891, explained to Representative William Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, that very few business owners qualify for Small Business Administration loans or have the collateral to secure them. "The guys I know have debt up the kazoo," Mr. Lee told the congressman.
Mr. Pascrell said he was sympathetic. "Low-interest loans aren't what you need," he said. "I know that." 
Representative Barney Frank, a Democrat from Massachusetts, told another group that there was "a reasonable chance" that legislation to provide grant aid would be approved, but only if the recent tax cuts were reversed. "We need to replenish the federal revenue out of which this is going to come," he said.
Baback Panahbarhagh, owner of Milano, a low-priced women's clothing store less than two blocks from ground zero, does not have time to wait, however. Like many entrepreneurs, Mr. Panahbarhagh said, he put everything he had into his shop and could not afford to carry business-interruption insurance. Now, sales are off by 75 percent and he is fighting an eviction notice from his landlord. His loan application to the Small Business Administration was rejected.
It makes good sense for the government to help businesses like his, he contended. "If downtown is ever going to be viable again," he said, "it will need an infrastructure. If they let this one die, they will have to rebuild it from scratch."

HEADLINE: Peruvian Leader's Image Problems Add to Political Woes 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Peruvians, who are not known for their punctuality, have a new explanation for their tardiness. When late for an appointment, they now typically say they are on "Toledo Time" or "Cabana Time" a reference to the town where President Alejandro Toledo grew up.
 The jokes are just one sign that three months after his inauguration, Mr. Toledo has mounting image problems that are distracting from his efforts to resuscitate an economy hobbled by three years of political unrest. 
 Peruvian news organizations appear fixated on how many hours Mr. Toledo keeps his cabinet or foreign dignitaries waiting for appointments, on which five-star restaurant he ventured to the night before, and whether he arrives on any particular day at the presidential palace for work before noon.
Mr. Toledo's personal life, which involves a continuing paternity suit and a jaunty social life, hurt him during his 2000 campaign against former President Alberto K. Fujimori and again in his campaign that won him the presidency in a race against another former president, Alan Garcia, by a narrow margin earlier this year. 
Now they are translating into plummeting popularity in the polls, growing friction within his cabinet and his party's congressional delegation, and stinging public criticisms from the business community.
"We need to define ourselves better," Justice Minister Fernando Olivera conceded in an interview. "There's an impatience among the people and I understand that but it is being pushed by certain elements and parts of the press that want to destabilize the government."
Mr. Toledo's advisers say that his accomplishments since his inauguration on July 28 are not getting the recognition they deserve.
They note that his call during his inaugural address for a regional cutback in military spending has generated meaningful negotiations with Ecuador and Chile that appear to be advancing. Pleas for donations from Spain, the United States and other allies recently bore fruit with pledges of more than $1 billion in fresh foreign assistance that will go to a variety of rural development programs over the next two years.
And despite criticisms that Mr. Toledo has not advanced a coherent economic policy, supporters say he has resisted pressures to increase government spending that would cause inflationary budget deficits and raise interest rates.
"I ask the press to let us function," Doris Sanchez, the minister for women's affairs and an increasingly important spokeswoman for Mr. Toledo, pleaded this week. She promised that Mr. Toledo "will re-launch his government" in the coming days, an implicit admission that the normal honeymoon period following the inauguration has been rocky.
Governing Peru has never been an easy task given a history of terrorism, corruption, tensions between military and civilian authorities, and a population divided by geography and racial division. Mr. Toledo faces a particularly difficult task in taking over the country at just the time that prices of its main mineral and fishing exports are low, and the economies of its main trading partners are slowing.
Mr. Toledo has set out to purge the security forces of elements allied with Vladimiro Montesinos, Mr. Fujimori's former intelligence chief, who still exerts influence from a high-security naval prison while awaiting trial for gun-running, money-laundering and leading death-squad activities.
Cleansing the military is all the more difficult because Mr. Toledo must also confront the recent re-emergence of some Maoist Shining Path terrorist units in remote jungle regions. Western diplomats say they fear that an apparent increase in coca plantings in recent months could fuel the rebels' cause with protection money, much as it has in Colombia.
Such long-term threats are hard to manage when day-to-day problems flare up with regularity.
There have been almost daily street protests around the country and they have become increasingly violent in recent weeks. Doctors and nurses recently went on a 24-hour strike charging that Mr. Toledo had abandoned his campaign promises to increase spending on public health. Other groups have faulted him for not keeping his manifold campaign promises. Protesters in several southern cities have blocked roads to advance their claim that Mr. Toledo is not fulfilling campaign pledges to improve their local transportation systems. 
Mr. Toledo has blamed the protests on mayors who in his view are still allied with Mr. Fujimori, who resigned and fled to Japan last year to escape prosecution on corruption and human rights charges.
"A lot of money is being spent with the aim of destabilizing democracy," Mr. Toledo said in a recent national television address.
In recent days, Mr. Toledo has returned to some of the poorest provinces to improve his image, riding horseback through villages, wearing Indian clothing, dedicating new public works, and appearing with young students using computers for the first time.
Mr. Toledo has pledged to make education and jobs his first priorities, but his message has been muffled by a number of missteps.
One of his first decisions, taking a raise the lifted his salary substantially, to $18,000 a month, the highest of any head of state in Latin America, has been roundly criticized as insensitive at a time when Peruvians are suffering through a recession. 
His recent trip to a summit meeting of heads of state in Shanghai was overshadowed by the Japanese government's denial of a statement from Mr. Toledo, that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi told him that Mr. Fujimori would be tried in Japan on corruption charges.
After Mr. Toledo returned home, the news that his nephew, Jorge, had joined in the official travel delegation raised questions and a variety of contradictory responses about what the nephew was doing in China, and what agency was paying him and his expenses.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE PLOT; 
Hijackers' Meticulous Strategy Of Brains, Muscle and Practice

BYLINE:  By KATE ZERNIKE and DON VAN NATTA Jr. 

 BODY:
American Airlines Flight 11 was in line for takeoff from Logan International Airport, the passengers already reminded to turn off personal electronic devices, when Mohamed Atta, in seat 8D in business class, dialed his cellphone for the last time. 
 The call rang aboard another sparsely occupied jetliner a bit farther back on the same tarmac, on a cellphone belonging to Marwan al-Shehhi, in seat 6C on United Airlines Flight 175. 
 The conversation between the two men, so close that they called each other cousin, lasted less than one minute -- just long enough, investigators say, to signal that the plot was on. That simple communication was the culmination of months of meticulous planning and coordination that by 10 o'clock on the morning of Sept. 11 would become the worst terrorist attack in history.
With all the suspects dead and no conclusive evidence, as yet, of any accomplices, investigators have been left to recreate the architecture and orchestration of the plot largely from the recorded minutiae of the hijackers' brief American lives: their cellphone calls, credit card charges, Internet communications and automated teller machine withdrawals. 
What has emerged, nearly two months into the investigation, is a picture in which the roles of the 19 hijackers are so well defined as to be almost corporate in their organization and coordination. 
Investigators now divide the 19 into three distinct groups:
Mr. Atta, considered the mastermind, and three other leaders who chose the dates for the attack and flew the planes; a support staff of three who helped with the logistics of renting apartments, securing driver's licenses and distributing cash to the teams that would take the four planes; and beneath them, 12 soldiers, or "muscle," whose main responsibility seems to have been restraining the flight attendants and passengers while the leaders took over the jets' controls. 
The leaders had researched their plans so well that they knew just when each of the four cross-country flights would reach its cruising altitude -- the moment, investigators say, when the hijackers stormed the cockpits to confront the pilots with box cutters. The coordination was so thorough that each of the four hijacking teams had its own bank account, and each team's A.T.M. cards used a single PIN. The slightest misstep could trigger intense frustration: more than once last summer in Florida, when money transfers from abroad had not arrived on the expected dates, security cameras captured several hijackers glaring impatiently into A.T.M. screens. 
The hijackers made a true technophile's use of the Internet, online chat rooms and e-mail. But when it came to their most crucial communications, they did what Al Qaeda's manual on terrorist operations instructs: they met in person. They chose as their meeting place the same locale where generations of American conventioneers have met to exchange information about their crafts: Las Vegas, where investigators say the most crucial planning in the United States occurred.
But unlike traditional conventioneers who cluster in casino hotels that replicate the Pyramids or the New York City skyline, the leaders and their logistics men stayed at the seediest end of the famous Las Vegas Strip, next to the "Home of the $5 Lap Dance," at a cheap motel guaranteed not to have surveillance cameras. They stayed briefly, only as long as it took to exchange important information, and apparently did not visit the casinos or any of the other purveyors of easy vice in America's City of Sin.
Most of the 19 hijackers, perhaps all of them, spent time in Osama bin Laden's Afghan training camps, investigators now say. Some of the Sept. 11 soldiers appear to have met there. And like Mr. Atta and the other pilots, the muscle did not seem to fit the profile of suicide bombers as desperate and impoverished young men. With the exception of one, they were all Saudis, relatively well off and well educated. While the leaders seemed to be Islamic zealots, the muscle did not, indulging often in pornography and liquor. 
There is still much that investigators do not know. While they contend, for instance, that the plot cost nearly $500,000, they have been able to trace only half of it back to a suspected Al Qaeda source. They know where the leaders met, but not what information they exchanged -- among hundreds of e-mail messages seized from computers in Florida and Las Vegas, there is no "smoking gun" or reference to the Sept. 11 attacks, a senior investigator said.
The investigators say they are unsure how the soldiers were recruited. And they do not know how those men thought the story was going to end -- if they were aware that they had signed on to die. "This went totally by the book," one senior government official said. "It has all the earmarks of Al Qaeda. It was well organized, far from a half-baked operation. They had good coordination, excellent communication that is hard to track, and a good, simple plan. Somebody did their homework."

Following the Manual
Investigators say their best theory is that Sept. 11 was a franchise operation, and that the leaders hewed closely to the dictates of Al Qaeda's terror manual. 
The plot was first pieced together, they say, at least two years ago, in Hamburg, Germany, where three of the men who would later be leaders and pilots -- Mr. Atta, Mr. Shehhi and Ziad Jarrahi -- were part of a terrorist cell. Three other suspected members of that cell fled in early September and are being sought as accomplices.
Senior law enforcement officials say the Hamburg plotters received the blessing -- and, crucially, cash -- from Al Qaeda, although investigators say they do not know who in Osama bin Laden's organization approved the operation. Several officials say they suspect it was Mr. bin Laden himself, and investigators have also said his top three associates were involved in the planning. "They met with somebody else who was calling the shots" in Germany, one official said. "But we don't know who that person is." 
Mr. Shehhi and Mr. Atta received visas to enter the United States in January 2000, and Mr. Jarrahi arrived in June of that year. Another pilot, Hani Hanjour, had been living in Southern California since 1996, and two of the logistics men, Nawaq Alhazmi and Khalid al-Midhar, had moved to San Diego in 1999. 
Investigators are not certain how the Hamburg and California groups came together, but evidence suggests it was through Al Qaeda channels. Investigators say they have linked Mr. Midhar to the attack on the American destroyer Cole and perhaps to the 1998 bombings of American Embassies in East Africa.
The money for the operation began arriving at branches of the SunTrust Bank and Century Bank in Florida, in the summer of 2000. Mr. Atta received slightly more than $100,000, Mr. Shehhi just less than that amount. About half of the $500,000 used to pay for the operation, senior Federal Bureau of Investigation officials say, was wired by an important bin Laden operative, Mustafa Ahmad, from the United Arab Emirates, and much of the rest from Germany. However, one official said the authorities suspected the money trail began in Pakistan. Travel records show each of the men making several trips in and out of the United States in 2000 and early 2001 -- to Spain, Prague, Bangkok and Saudi Arabia. Mr. Atta took seven international trips; Mr. Shehhi took five. In this country, they all had begun taking flying lessons, in Phoenix, San Diego and South Florida. 
By spring 2001, the 12 men whom investigators call the muscle had begun to arrive from Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government, stung by reports that most of the hijackers had visas from their country, initially said that the hijackers used fake identities stolen from innocent citizens. But the F.B.I. says that it has confirmed the identities of all 19 of the hijackers, and that 15 were Saudis.
While the Saudi government has restricted the F.B.I. and reporters from interviewing the families of the men, the families of some of the foot soldiers have told Arab newspapers that their sons left within the last 18 months, variously saying they were going to seek religious counseling, on pilgrimage or on jihad in Chechnya. An investigator said there was evidence that these men spent at least a year in Al Qaeda training camps.
The family of one, Mohand Alshehri, said he had studied at Imam Muhammed Ibn Saud Islamic University in Abha, Saudi Arabia, for one semester. The father of two others, Wail and Waleed Alshehri, said they had studied to become teachers. Another, Ahmed Alnami, had studied law in Abha. The man the F.B.I. identifies as the third logistics man, Majed Moqed, studied at King Saud University in Riyadh, in the faculty of administration and economics, according to Arab newspapers. 
Most hailed from poor villages where fundamentalism thrives. But their families appeared to be on the upper rungs; their fathers were religious leaders, school principals, shopkeepers and businessmen. 
None had visited the United States before, and several appeared to speak little or no English. Once they arrived, the logistics men helped them fade into American life. 
Hani Hanjour helped some rent an apartment in Paterson, N.J. Others cycled through one apartment in Delray Beach, Fla. Mr. Midhar helped some obtain illegal driver's licenses and photo ID's in Virginia. 
The leaders and logistics men seemed to "buddy up" with their junior partners. When Ahmed Alhaznawi had an ulcerated leg, Mr. Jarrahi took him to Holy Cross Hospital in Palm Beach County, Fla. At first, Mr. Atta and Mr. Shehhi lived together in Florida; Mr. Shehhi then moved in with Fayez Ahmed , and Mr. Atta with Abdulaziz Alomari, the last hijacker to arrive.
Most of the 19 obtained Social Security numbers, which allowed them to open bank accounts and obtain credit cards. They seemed, the F.B.I. says, to remain self-contained, with little or no help from a support network in the United States. Investigators suspect the help came from money men in the United Arab Emirates and several important lieutenants in Germany and Afghanistan.

Research and Planning
Al Qaeda's manual, which prosecutors say was used in the embassy bombings, outlines three stages of any operation: research, planning and execution.
"In order to discover any unexpected element detrimental to the operation," it says, "it is necessary, prior to execution of the operation, to rehearse it in a place similar to that of the real operation." 
So beginning in May, the leaders and logistics men began taking trial flights on cross-country routes, though they never took the exact flights that they would later hijack. 
After each flight to the West Coast, they flew to Las Vegas. And each time, they flew first class -- as most of the 19 would on Sept. 11. Although they traveled first class, their accommodations were distinctly low-rent, at an Econo Lodge on the faded end of the Strip.
Although several of the hijackers are believed to have had numerous meetings in South Florida and Paterson, senior investigators say they are convinced that the most important American planning occurred in that dingy hotel room.
Investigators say they can confirm only one overlapping visit to Las Vegas, on Aug. 13 and 14, although they say the picture may not be complete. An Algerian who is believed to have helped train the pilots, Lotfi Raissi, drove from Phoenix to Las Vegas at least once last summer, and hijackers may have done the same. 
Mr. Alhazmi and Mr. Hanjour arrived together and appear to have spent most of their time together; Mr. Atta spent most of his time alone, disappearing into the dark cavern of Cyberzone, an Internet cafe where young men slouch in front of a half-dozen brightly lighted computer terminals, surfing the Web. 
Investigators are not sure why the plotters chose Las Vegas. "Perhaps they figured it would be easy to blend in," one senior official said. The men were most likely following the manual's protocol: meet at a place that offers good cover. 
It is not unusual for criminals to launder money in Las Vegas casinos, but surveillance tapes show no trace of the hijackers. Based on that and on interviews, the F.B.I. says it believes the hijackers did not gamble. Nor have investigators found any local terrorist cells there. 
There was one curious disruption in their pattern, on the last trip east from Las Vegas. For the flights in May, June and July, the hijackers booked nonstop, round-trip tickets. But on that final flight, they bought one-way tickets to different destinations, with layovers, and they flew coach, not first class. 
Investigators speculate that with their test flights completed, the hijackers now wanted to save money. They may also have wanted to see if they could buy one-way tickets without attracting attention -- which is what they did over the next two weeks as they purchased tickets for Sept. 11.

Carrying Out the Mission
Those return flights put the men in position to execute the plot. Mr. Hanjour and Mr. Alhazmi flew to Baltimore, where they would soon join their soldiers in nearby Laurel, Md. From there, on the morning of Sept. 11, they would leave for Dulles International Airport and American Airlines Flight 77. 
Mr. Atta flew from Las Vegas to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., near where much of the muscle was living. 
Investigators see a spike in the number of cellphone calls between the 19 in those final weeks. The hijackers bought plane tickets, each team choosing almost exactly the same seats on the planes. The Florida group moved north to Boston; the New Jersey group moved out of the Paterson apartment. Three hijackers wired money back to Mr. Ahmad in the United Arab Emirates. 
On Sept. 10, Mr. Atta and his charge, Mr. Alomari, drove from Boston to Portland, Me. 
Why Portland? Again, it may have been protocol: the manual warns against traveling in large groups and suggests boarding "at a secondary station" to deflect notice. 
The next morning, they almost missed their connecting flight at Logan Airport in Boston, making it with minutes to spare. 
As the hijackers may have anticipated from test runs, the planes hit cruising altitude after about 40 minutes. The hijackers, who had cared so little about learning to take off and land a plane, began their work. 
Four of the five men on American Flight 77, the jet that plowed into the Pentagon, had helped with the logistics or are considered by investigators to have been leaders. It is assumed that several of the logistics people, including Mr. Midhar, also carried box cutters and served as muscle. 
That plane, apparently flown by Mr. Hanjour, began to jerk wildly in the air. There may have been a struggle with the pilots, but investigators say it was more likely a result of Mr. Hanjour's poor skills -- his flying school teachers would later say he had been a sorry student. 
Based on one cellphone call from one of the planes, the F.B.I. now contends that the muscle began to herd passengers into the back of the planes, and forced the pilots from the cockpit by telling them it was a traditional hijacking, one where, if demands were met, the passengers and crew would be released without harm. 
As the planes accelerated toward their targets, the muscle men, too, may have believed the same thing. This question remains the subject of debate within the F.B.I. Some investigators note that in surveillance photographs taken at a Portland A.T.M. the previous night, Mr. Alomari appears to be grinning, an expression more befitting a petty thief about to go on a stealing spree. 
One F.B.I. official said the prayers found at the crash sites seemed to exhort the foot soldiers to be strong in prison -- unlike the four-page set of instructions and prayers found in Mr. Atta's luggage, which made it clear he believed he was going to his eternal paradise. 
Investigators in this country and abroad note that this would be in keeping with terrorist patterns. 
As Al Qaeda's manual instructs, "The operation members should not all be told about the operation until shortly before executing it, in order to avoid leaking of its news."

HEADLINE: In a Suffering City, Charity Endures; 
The Times Neediest Cases Fund Helps a Man Who Has No Home

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
Robert Tucker hunched forward, his cheek resting on the side of a nearly deserted subway car. His body bumped up and down with the movements of a Manhattan-bound E train as it thundered through the tunnel under Queens Boulevard at 3 a.m.
 It was the night before Halloween, Devil's Night, and Mr. Tucker, 60, was spending it as he spends many nights, trying to catch as much sleep as he could before the train he was riding reached the end of the line. 
 During the day he spends time at a cafeteria for the elderly poor or earns pocket money by offering to carry bags for bus or train travelers. 
At night he sleeps in a Pennsylvania Station waiting area, in subway stations or on trains, at a crowded drop-in center that has comfortable chairs but no beds, with friends in Harlem or Brooklyn or on the street. At every hour, he knows where he is welcome and where he is not.
"Being homeless is hell," Mr. Tucker said. "A lot of people look down on you, they don't trust you, they look at you like you might do anything."
Mr. Tucker is one of the thousands of homeless in New York, and has been for two and a half years. It began, he said, when he told the police about the drug dealing going on at a flophouse on the Bowery where he was living, and was threatened by the other residents. 
He is also one of the tens of thousands of poor New Yorkers helped by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Today The Times begins its 90th annual appeal for donations to the fund, 24 days after ending a special monthlong campaign to help the victims of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Officials who run the fund emphasized that the Neediest Cases Fund serves a different group of people from the 9/11 Neediest Fund. "We're maintaining a bright-line distinction between the two funds," said Jack Rosenthal, president of The Times Company Foundation, which administers the funds. "To meet need in one area does not diminish it in another."
The 9/11 fund has raised more than $43 million, more than five times as much as the record $8 million raised last year by the Neediest Cases Fund. "The public responded to the disaster with astonishing generosity," Mr. Rosenthal said. "But nonprofit organizations are already distressed to see a sharp drop-off in regular contributions. How painful it would be if such compassion fatigue depressed gifts for the neediest. That would turn the poor people of New York into the latest victims of the terrorists." 
"We set up the 9/11 fund within 24 hours as a way of trying to get assistance in sudden desperate need," Mr. Rosenthal said. "The regular Neediest Cases Fund seeks to help people whose poverty arises in the ordinary course of life."
The Starr Foundation, a private charitable group associated with the American International Group, the insurance company, gave $1 million to the Neediest Cases Fund last month. "We were anticipating a difficult winter for the needy in New York City even before Sept. 11," said Florence A. Davis, president of the Starr Foundation. "Now, after Sept. 11, that's even clearer."
In the nine decades that The Times has published stories as part of its Neediest Cases campaigns, much has changed. A government-run social welfare system now assists those at the bottom of the economic ladder, including Mr. Tucker, who receives $100.50 every two weeks in welfare and $130 in food stamps once a month, credited to an electronic benefits card. 
But men still live on the streets of New York, as the homeless did 90 years ago, when a shabby beggar approached Adolph S. Ochs, then the publisher of The Times, on Christmas Day 1911. The chance encounter with the beggar, whose name has not been recorded in any known source, inspired Mr. Ochs to use his newspaper to help the poor.
One of the many projects supported by the Neediest Cases Fund is a meal-in-a-bag program run by Project FIND (Friendless, Isolated, Needy and Disabled). Last December, Project FIND received a grant of $10,000 from the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies to give out lunches -- which cost Project FIND $1 each -- free to the elderly for a year. The federation is one of the seven local charities supported by the Neediest Cases Fund. 
From Sunday to Friday, workers give out about 20 bags of food a day to the elderly men and women who frequent the cafeteria on Ninth Avenue that sits snugly beneath an overpass to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. One of the aims of the project is to attract the homeless to the cafeteria, where Maury Sherman, a social worker, can help them get off the streets, said Cynthia Dial, executive director of Project FIND.
One of the men who began taking his meals there was Mr. Tucker. Last Tuesday, he gave a tour of the parts of the city he often calls home and told the story of his life, from his days as a child, when he dreamed of being a professional baseball player to his life on the windswept sidewalks of New York.
At 3:20 p.m., Mr. Tucker put down his foam cup of tea and emptied his pockets of their contents: a phone message from a social worker, some napkins, the chipped benefits card with his picture on it, $7 and a receipt from a Harlem optometrist for new eyeglasses.
His glasses had been stolen two weeks earlier, when he fell asleep on a subway station bench. But that is not the only reason his vision is impaired. When he was 6, he accidentally poked a wire into his eye. He bled profusely, he said, but doctors at the emergency room told him that he would be able to see again in a few weeks.
He never did. Now, there is a circle of light blue matter where the pupil and the iris once were, the damaged left eye jutting out from its socket a fraction more than the good one.
Mr. Tucker, born in Mobile, Ala., said his mother, Lorain Tucker, died when he was 12 and his father, Hickes Jessie, when he was 13. After his mother died, Mr. Tucker's uncle from Detroit raised him. He moved to New York in 1977. 
In addition to his vision problems, Mr. Tucker also has diabetes and a fungus on his feet that developed last summer, when he would go for days without taking off his sneakers. Despite his ailments, Mr. Tucker earns pocket money by carrying suitcases for bus travelers at the Port Authority terminal. He uses the money for food, clothes, cigarettes and periodic trips to off-track betting parlors. He said he never drinks, though, because drinking killed his mother and his sister Barbara.
At 4 p.m., Mr. Tucker picked up his meal-in-a-bag. Inside was a bottle of water, cans of orange juice, peaches, tuna fish, two slices of rye bread and some butter. It was food he could manage despite the fact that his seven remaining upper teeth had been pulled days before by a dentist. 
He drank the orange juice, holding the can high to get every last drop, put the rest of the food back into the bag and got ready to go. At 4:20 p.m., he walked across Ninth Avenue, and into the bus terminal's back door.
"Pardon me, darling, do you need help?" he asked a young woman who had just gotten off a bus and was looking around. "Oh, Richmond? That's Gate 74. Up the escalator, turn left, go down the hall, down the next escalator. Can I help you with that?"
She said she could manage her bag herself. No sale.
After a few minutes, he spotted a Port Authority police officer. Mr. Tucker turned and briskly walked out of the arrivals area, but the officer followed him. 
"I'm dead at this place," Mr. Tucker said shortly afterward. "My best bet is to go over to Penn Station. Maybe I can get $3 or $4 over there."
Mr. Tucker said he has been arrested about 50 times in the past few years for soliciting or trespassing. He often winds up spending a night in jail, and he is typically sentenced to time already served or to a few hours of community service, in which he picks up litter at subway stations. The arrests do not seem to deter him, though. "Sometimes I'll be so tired," he said, "I'll be glad to go to jail to get some rest."
Last winter, a friend told him about the Project FIND cafeteria, his first step toward ending his cycle of arrests. At the cafeteria, Mr. Tucker met Ms. Sherman. "Maury, she helped me out tremendously," Mr. Tucker said. 
When Ms. Sherman found out that he was a diabetic, she insisted he take his medication, which he told her he had not been taking. "He started talking to me about some of his past experiences and burst into tears," Ms. Sherman recalled.
She helped him find a part-time job as a foot messenger, and told him about Peter's Place, a drop-in center in a church basement on West 23rd Street that helps people find permanent housing. "He's taking care of himself, which he wasn't for so long," Ms. Sherman said.
After Mr. Tucker was reprimanded one morning for arriving at his job too early, he said, he became angry and quit. But Ms. Sherman hopes that if he finds a place in a single-room occupancy building, he can find a job more easily. "Once Robert is in an S.R.O., he would qualify for all kinds of vocational training programs," she said, adding that he would also have access to social workers there. 
At 4:45 p.m., Mr. Tucker left the bus terminal, bought a cigarette for 50 cents, and walked toward Penn Station, where he watched for potential customers. In an hour and 15 minutes he earned tips from a young woman with a suitcase who gave him $1, and from a middle-aged woman who gave him $3.
Now he had enough to do his laundry. Mr. Tucker wanted to look nice for an appointment he had with a psychologist, who was going to talk to him the next day about moving into Euclid Hall, an S.R.O. on the Upper West Side.
Mr. Tucker walked down to Peter's Place, where he stores his clothing, toothbrush and diabetes medications. At 6:50 p.m. he arrived at a nearby laundry with enough money for two single-serve boxes of Tide and his small load of wrinkled shirts, pants and socks.
After doing his laundry, he spotted a MetroCard on the sidewalk. "Oh, look at this," he said. "I always stop and pick up cards. Sometimes they be good."
At 8 p.m. he returned to Peter's Place, and put his bag in its spot. Then, it was time to go back to the bus terminal to see if he could earn money for the next day's meals.
But there was one matter of business to attend to first. He had to check that MetroCard. He descended into the subway station at 23rd Street and Seventh Avenue and swiped the card through a reader, which indicated that the card had $3 on it. "See that?" he said with a confident grin. "That's all I needed to know." 
At midnight, after eating a fast-food dinner and trying his luck at the Port Authority again, Mr. Tucker decided to go back to Penn Station and sleep in the waiting area for ticketed passengers. But he had to leave about an hour later when security guards started asking people to show their tickets.
"Well," he said, "our best bet now is to ride the trains." 
At 1:42 a.m., Mr. Tucker got on an E train -- which he favors because its doors never open above ground to face bitter cold air -- and found a seat near the window. When the train arrived at the end of the line in Queens, Mr. Tucker, eyes bloodshot, walked across the platform to a train waiting to go the other direction. He rode that train all the way to the chilly Canal Street station in Manhattan, where he arrived at 3:31 a.m. He dozed off on a wooden bench, waiting for the next train. Much later that morning, Mr. Tucker had meetings with workers from two S.R.O.'s. It was a step toward ending his pattern of nights spent on subway trains.
"Maury said if I went to Peter's Place, within a year I could be living somewhere," he said, "and she's almost right."

HEADLINE: Our Towns; 
A Nassau Republican Follows Marx (the One With the Cigar)

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINERIP 

DATELINE: MINEOLA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
LIKE Groucho Marx, Thomas Gulotta, the Nassau County executive, must be going. Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, is the top elected official in this Long Island suburb, home to the nation's oldest, most powerful Republican machine, but if he doesn't go soon, there may be few Republicans left here. Like Groucho, who could take dear old Huxley College and blissfully destroy it, Mr. Gulotta ran a wealthy county in a time of unprecedented prosperity and oversaw its near fiscal ruin, and now, his fellow Republicans say, he must be going.
 "He keeps showing up," says Fred Parola, the county comptroller and a fellow Republican, facing his toughest re-election bid in 25 years. "He'll be at a campaign opportunity and Republicans say, 'Oh my God, what's he doing here?' He's the poster boy for the fiscal crisis, but he doesn't get it. Last weekend I saw him at two Eagle Scout ceremonies and a Halloween parade." 
 Though Republicans outnumber Democrats 4 to 3 in Nassau, by last spring Mr. Gulotta's approval rating was 10 percent, and under pressure from Republican leaders, he agreed that after three terms, he would be going. By then, Democrats controlled the County Legislature. Even top Republicans expect Thomas Suozzi to be elected county executive on Tuesday, the first Democrat in 40 years. "For Republicans," says Mr. Parola, "Gulotta's a supernightmare."
While most Republicans push fiscal conservatism, Mr. Gulotta remained an avowed (Groucho) Marxist, refusing to raise taxes for eight years while the county spent freely. This was classic Groucho, one for me (voters love low taxes) and one for me (police unions and other Republican favorites donated big time to Mr. Gulotta). A Nassau cop with five years on the job makes $74,267, $20,000 more than a New York City cop doing far more dangerous work. Nassau Community College professors -- including Mr. Gulotta's wife -- had the nation's top community college salaries in the 1990's (salaries that now rank third in an American Association of University Professors survey).
Nassau faced a $178 million deficit in 2000 when the governor, a Republican, created an oversight board to monitor county finances. But Margaret Dumont could never get the Groucho out of Rufus T. Firefly, and Frank Zarb, the Republican businessman running the oversight board, could never quite eliminate Mr. Gulotta's brand of tutti-frutti fiscalism. One week after the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Gulotta produced his final budget, calling it balanced. No one believed it; not the Republican Mr. Zarb, not the Republican comptroller, not Republican legislators, certainly not Democrats. To balance it, Mr. Gulotta projected that sales tax revenue would be higher in 2001 than it was during the 2000 economic boom and even higher in 2002, making him the last American to predict a post-Sept. 11 boom economy.
FOR his part, Mr. Gulotta said he had no data to alter sales tax projections, so he left it for legislators to revise. He declined to say if he believed that police salaries were too high, but added that if they were, it was the legislators' fault for rejecting his union contract proposals, resulting in larger arbitration awards. And he said he didn't care how Republicans felt about his showing up. "I go at the request of groups seeking my support."
The men who ran Groucho's Freedonia loved rows of medals on their chests, and Mr. Gulotta is known for handing out record numbers of county certificates of appreciation. "He could do 100 ceremonies a week," Mr. Parola said. "He had staff people clipping the papers for every little event. I've been with him when he showed up at some private 100-year-old's birthday party. It was embarrassing."
And yet Nassau, a county of 1.3 million, has no central grants manager -- a position that Mr. Parola first pressed for in 1998. Nassau remains technologically primitive; many county workers have no e-mail or voice mail and Nassau is just now doing its first property tax reassessment in 70 years.
Republicans are worried. Mr. Parola was endorsed by Newsday in his first two comptroller races, but not this time. This year's editorial praised Mr. Parola for warning of the fiscal crisis back in 1996 and for often making his own party "spitting mad," but faulted him for being unable to change Mr. Gulotta. Truth is, nobody much influenced Mr. Gulotta; not his party leaders, not state overseers, not the press. And now that he must be going, Republicans worry about how many may join him come Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Political Briefing; 
Neighborly Repartee Takes On an Edge

BYLINE:  By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
Minnesota and South Dakota share a border, and their governors, like good neighbors, talk to each other a lot. The exchanges have been mostly good-natured, but lately they have taken on an edge -- which was probably inevitable, given that few governors are more outspoken than Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, an independent, and William J. Janklow of South Dakota, a Republican. 
 It all began two weeks ago when Mr. Ventura, at a trade show in Canada, speculated that Mr. Janklow was not at the show because he was home "cutting new ads" to induce Minnesotans and Minnesota businesses to move to South Dakota. 
 Then, warming to his topic, Mr. Ventura added: "I love his ads, and I love the points he makes. The bottom-line problem is you then have to live in Sioux Falls. If that element wasn't in there, you'd be home free."
Sioux Falls, just west of Minnesota's southwest corner, has received laudatory livability reviews in recent years in several polls and business publications. Mr. Janklow immediately countered the governor, a former pro wrestler, with this smackdown: "Whoever said that sounds like a jerk."
Then last week, after a few days of quiet, Mr. Janklow went back on the offensive.
A Minnesota company had decided to expand -- but in South Dakota, he announced. He said he wanted Mr. Ventura to know "how pleased we are that another company has seen that their future in Minnesota means an investment in the people of South Dakota."
Mr. Ventura responded that the company would not stay long in South Dakota after it discovered how much higher Janklow taxes were than Ventura taxes.
Stay tuned.

HEADLINE: Control of the State Senate Hinges on a Handful of Races 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
The campaign between James E. McGreevey and Bret D. Schundler is no longer the most interesting governor's race in New Jersey.
 With Mr. McGreevey pulling ahead in the polls heading into Tuesday's election, and Mr. Schundler sounding increasingly defeatist, the more intriguing contest suddenly is the one -- really, the 120 separate races -- that will determine who will serve as acting governor for a single week in January. 
 Control of both houses of the State Legislature hangs in the balance, and the 80-seat General Assembly is widely expected to shift to a Democratic majority, while the 40-member Senate is too close to call. Because senators take office a week before the new governor does, the new Senate president -- or, in the event of an evenly split Senate, the Assembly speaker -- would serve as acting governor until the inauguration.
More important, the new governor and the Legislature will have to face projected budget deficits of more than $2 billion, falling revenues, a troubled economy and an already burdensome debt load. And some advisers to Mr. McGreevey, thinking ahead, are now talking as if the worst thing possible would be for Democrats to sweep to victory in the governor's race and both the Assembly and the Senate.
"Mario Cuomo and George Pataki have thrived under a divided Legislature," said one Democratic lobbyist here. "It's a model that, when it works, encourages bipartisanship. But dominating both houses in a difficult economic environment is hard. You want to share credit, and blame, with both parties."
A Republican strategist made the same point more sharply: "McGreevey would like one Republican house, to take the blame for a tax increase." 
Not coincidentally, Republicans have held the Assembly and the Senate since 1991, the election that immediately followed Gov. Jim Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase.
Of course, should Mr. Schundler's campaign completely nose-dive by Tuesday, giving Mr. McGreevey a victory margin of better than 15 or 20 points, even Republican operatives think his coattails could be big enough to bring the Senate along with him. That is why many Republicans were dismayed when Mr. Schundler spoke openly this week of the possibility of losing.
"That may in fact dispirit Republican partisans a little bit, and depress their vote," said a campaign consultant working for Republican candidates in both houses of the Legislature. And every Republican vote will be vital on Tuesday.
Democrats hold 15 out of 40 seats in the Senate, meaning they need a net gain of 6 to win a majority. The redrawing of the map of legislative districts this year gave the Democrats a head start. Norman M. Robertson's seat in the 34th Legislative District, which was drawn to include heavily Democratic parts of Essex County, is likely to go to Nia H. Gill, a veteran Democratic assemblywoman there. And Barbara Buono, an assemblywoman from Middlesex County, is heavily favored in the 18th District, where the incumbent Republican, Jack G. Sinagra, is retiring.
To reach a majority, Democrats would have to win at least four of these competitive seats now held by Republicans:
District 1: In Cape May and Cumberland Counties, a veteran Republican, James S. Cafiero of North Wildwood, is being challenged by William J. Hughes Jr. of Ocean City, a former federal prosecutor and the son and namesake of a popular former congressman. The district is overwhelmingly Republican, but Mr. Hughes has spent more than $600,000 on his race, and Democrats have courted the growing Latino vote in Vineland, the largest city in Cumberland County.
District 3: Raymond J. Zane, a longtime senator who switched to the Republican party in February, is being challenged by Stephen M. Sweeney, an ironworkers' union leader who is also the freeholder director of Gloucester County. Each has been attacking the other with a barrage of TV advertisements in the Philadelphia market.
District 14: In the battle for Hamilton, a town neighboring Trenton where both Senate candidates live, the incumbent Republican, Peter A. Inverso, faces a stiff challenge from the Mercer County sheriff, Samuel J. Plumeri Jr.
District 22: This seat was held by Donald T. DiFrancesco, the acting governor, who is retiring. Joseph S. Suliga, a Democratic assemblyman from Linden, is considered the favorite against the Republican nominee, Milt Campbell, a former Olympic decathlon gold medalist from Plainfield who is black, like many others in parts of the district added to it this year. But Democrats say they expect Mr. McGreevey to win so big here that Mr. Campbell's ticket-splitters will do him little good. Senator Richard J. Codey, the Democrat who stands to lead the Senate and be acting governor if his party wins control, cited internal polling showing Mr. Suliga leading Mr. Campbell by 17 percentage points.
District 38: Louis F. Kosco, the incumbent Republican in this Bergen County district, faces Joseph Coniglio, a popular civic leader who is benefiting from the addition to the district of the heavily Democratic Fort Lee and Fair Lawn.
The one Democratic seat that is seen as vulnerable to a Republican pickup is that of Senator Garry J. Furnari of Nutley, in the 36th District. His Republican challenger, John V. Kelly, is a popular assemblyman, but the district was redrawn to protect Mr. Furnari by including more Democratic parts of Bergen County.

HEADLINE: The Candidates on Major Issues in the Mayoral Race: An Overview; 
Taxes and Budgeting

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
MR. BLOOMBERG -- He has ruled out any tax increases, even in the face of steeply declining city revenues. It is too easy for citizens and companies, faced with higher taxes, to leave New York, he says. 
 But he is also skeptical about the value of tax breaks as a means of keeping companies in the city. While the city must be able to offer tax incentives to compete in the "border wars," Mr. Bloomberg says that such breaks are less important to companies than the proximity to those they do business with and access to the kind of workers they need. 
 Acknowledging that the city is facing a tough time economically and fiscally, Mr. Bloomberg says that there is not very much that can be easily cut from the city's budget. He emphasizes the need to set priorities, and to work with the city's employees to find efficiencies if they are to make more money.

MR. GREEN -- Saying that New York City faces its worst fiscal crisis since it almost went bankrupt in the 1970's, Mr. Green has pledged to raise taxes only as a last resort. Instead, he hopes to find places to save large amounts through management efficiencies, through better contracting and through collective bargaining with the municipal unions (though he does foresee raises for city workers). He has put together an advisory commission on the budget, including the current city comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, and an advisory committee on business issues led by the former treasury secretary Robert E. Rubin.
In terms of economic development, Mr. Green has suggested focusing on industries and what they need to remain in the city, rather than handing out tax breaks and other incentives to individual companies. Leslie Eaton

HEADLINE: THE AMERICAN WAY; 
Mayo With A Slice Of Life

BYLINE:  By Liz Smith; Liz Smith is the author of "Natural Blonde," a memoir.

 BODY:
I was delivered out of Texas to Manhattan in the early 1950's, having escaped what I call American survival cooking -- barbecued or fried haunch of whatever, corn smoldering in its own husks, grain mashed into a flat fried cake, vitaminless vegetables cooked senseless and tables always decorated with red and yellow condiment bottles.
 Well, the next thing I knew, I was in Le Pavillon at 57th and Park, being cautioned by the owner and creator, Henri Soule, on how to eat caviar properly. With a different spoon for each tin he opened, Soule and I would nibble and taste. "Never, never, dear girl, never add anything to caviar," he'd say. In those days, Soule, the greatest restaurateur the country has ever known, would send me cases of a red wine he particularly favored. No one I knew had ever heard of Chateau Petrus. It was his enthusiasm. I unwittingly opened it like soda pop and served it with everything from chicken-fried steak to chili. (I might be rich today if only I'd put Soule's gifts away in a damp, cool place.) 
 I was a junior society reporter, and an apprenticeship with Soule was a gift from my boss, Igor Cassini, then Hearst's Cholly Knickerbocker. The first time we went to Pavillon, he cautioned: "Mr. Soule is very kindhearted, but he doesn't suffer fools gladly. He won't seat a lady at the table if she arrives alone. She must wait in the foyer no matter how much she needs a drink. He won't serve women in trousers -- not even Hepburn or Dietrich."
Back then, I occasionally yearned for what Tom Wolfe has called "the glories of boiling lard." In other words: Southern cooking, which I still love. But, no, I was in another universe of comfort food -- haute cuisine.
I ate the remarkable souffles at Voisin, where one day the actress Elaine Stritch and I celebrated our Feb. 2 birthdays. As she sat down, looking voguishly smart, Elaine said: "Oh, Lizzie, Noel Coward is coming. He's trying to entice me into 'Sail Away' in London, but I don't want to go." When the urbane master himself arrived, he was polite but cool. He gifted Elaine with a monogrammed passport case and to me said, "And you, young woman, will you please shut up!" (I did. And Elaine did go to London.)
I often went to Pearl's, a Chinese restaurant unlike any other. It had a Spartan decor by the great costumer Irene Sharaff, and it had Pearl herself, who treated Bill Paley, Woody Allen and Lauren Bacall the same way she treated us nobodies. Her yuk sung and lemon chicken were true Cantonese comfort foods, often imitated but never rivaled. And it was a far cry from eating out of cartons in "The Godfather."
I began to enjoy an ambience I'd never dreamed of -- perfect, stinging ice-cold martinis and wine that had to "breathe."
I learned to eat orecchiette, a pasta that looks like ears, at the now defunct Romeo Salta, and I discovered that while the "spaghetti red" my mother lashed together was tasty, spaghetti called pasta was better. I found that Le Veau d'Or served the best sole amandine in the world. At the Colony restaurant, I struck up a friendship with a waiter from Montecatini Terme, and thus I rode in on the wave that today is Le Cirque, as Sirio Maccioni later made his mark in 90's New York. 
I lived through the 60's, when theme eateries thrived. These experiences involved one place called the Forum of the 12 Caesars, where the waiters wore togas and served wild boar. I recall dining at the Tower Suite atop the Time-Life Building. The staff formally introduced themselves. The gent I was with, an Anglophile named Trumball Barton, sprang up after hearing "I'm John, your butler," and said, "And I'm Mr. Barton, your customer, so no more personal remarks, if you don't mind."
When we were given a mysterious first course, a small crab on toast, another guest, the comedian Kaye Ballard, looked at it and then hit it with her fist -- mashing it flat. "I'll never wash," Kaye said. I don't think we ever went back to the Tower Suite, where the between-course sherbet was the only thing as fascinating as the view. 
And when I went to Maxwell's Plum as a guest of Woody Allen's, I always ordered comfort food -- shepherd's pie in the Warner LeRoy manner.
These adventures kept me amused. I didn't learn how to prepare cuisine; I was too busy eating out. This was a new world, where baby veggies in strange combinations were described by Truman Capote as the vegetables of the rich. Taken to France on a tour by Mumm, I ate in a cafe near Paris, where the dessert included a hard-boiled egg covered in chocolate. I came to like delicate sauces and things blanched and buttered to perfection, eggs beaten and whipped to perfection. But frequently, haute cuisine was too haute for hicks.
Privately, I was still serving Southern comfort in my apartment. Batches of chili and fried chicken, I discovered, made me popular with the very people I was trying so hard to impress -- Helen Gurley Brown and her husband, David Brown, Gloria Steinem, Tom Wolfe, Gloria Vanderbilt, Donald Brooks, Geraldine Stutz, Mica and Ahmet Ertegun, Tommy Thompson, Nancy Friday, Gael Greene, Nan and Gay Talese.
Will Rogers once quoted a friend as saying, "I et for two hours and didn't recognize a thing I et, except an olive." My gang "et and et," as well. We ate high on the hog and low on the calf. We ate our way through the Eisenhower recession, the Cuban missile crisis, Vietnam, the assassinations of J.F.K., R.F.K. and Martin Luther King Jr., through Watergate, the Persian Gulf War and the Clinton crisis. Recently a journalist friend was on the street, covering the World Trade Center disaster. She ordered a sandwich, saying: "Don't bring me any fat-free mayonnaise. If the world is coming to an end, I want the real thing."
When I became a permanent guest of Lee Bailey in the early Hamptons, he was not yet the Clarkson Potter cookbook king writing about food. We made our social-climbing mark in Bridgehampton by feeding people. Lee constantly experimented. He would make something I adored, like chicken cooked with fresh peaches, and then never repeat it. His mantra was "homemade mayonnaise," which, frankly, I considered a waste of time. But "murder by mayonnaise" became our mantra. We talked more about food than drugs and sex.
I never attained the finesse of Lee's other devotees, who combined super careers and being perfect cooks and hostesses. I just stuck to my elemental favorites -- fried chicken in the classic mode. (All you need is a chicken, salt, pepper, flour and a paper bag to shake it in before depositing it in hot grease. "Do you cover chicken when you fry it, Mama?" I asked. "You can," she'd say, "but it won't make much difference.") This very chicken, plus my unusual standby -- chicken- or country-fried steak and cream gravy -- made me very unpopular with women who were dieting. But Lee opined, "Men love it!" Lee would sometimes hand over the main course to me while he enhanced the trimmings with taste and imagination. I recall once broiling 20 perfect T-bone steaks for 20 people, and Lee frothed up the rest. We were a big hit, proving the director Joel Schumacher's thesis that people just want to be fed. "Put some Cheese Whiz on a cracker on the windowsill, and you'll draw a crowd!" he'd laugh.
Lee Bailey was a father figure to my crowd, but he'd let someone else "do it" sometimes. The theater press agent Diane Judge constructed one of our favorite meals. Her New England Boiled Dinner became a perennial winner, as it could be held if the evening became too raucous.
I opened this dialectic on comfort food high and low with a memory of the late, great Henri Soule, who came here from France during the 1939 World's Fair and changed American food history. In his marvelous book "Dining at the Pavillon," Joseph Wechsberg tells the story of how he and Soule drove back from Long Island after Soule had established a restaurant, the Hedges, in East Hampton. Soule instructed the driver to stop at a roadside stand. "Let's get out and have a couple of hot dogs -- they're delicious here!"
I learned a lot about comfort from Henri Soule. One weekend the elegant DuPont-wed Francis -- yes, with an "i" -- Carpenter and her friend Shirley Maytag sailed into Sag Harbor. "We must go to the Hedges," Francis said, and so they set out for East Hampton. Arriving, Francis was stunned to see only a few cars. The dining room was all set up but empty. "Tell Mr. Soule that Mrs. Carpenter is here for lunch," Francis said to a passing busboy. Soon, Soule appeared in a bloody apron wiping his hands. Apologizing that he'd been butchering, he was charm itself, seating the ladies and asking what they'd like. "Whatever you'd like us to have," responded the gracious Francis. To Mrs. Maytag, she whispered: "Poor Henri. He has no customers."
Soule served them a fine lunch accompanied by an excellent white Bordeaux. When Francis asked for the check. "Oh, madam," Soule said, bowing. "There is no check. For you see, there is no lunch at the Hedges!"
So, who says there's no free lunch? If you're lucky, you eat high, and you eat low.

Barbarians Inside the Gates

BYLINE:  By Judith Shulevitz 

 BODY:
Now is not the moment to glorify violence. On the other hand, when Martin Scorsese puts off the release of a long-awaited new movie, you can't help dwelling for a moment on the forbidden spectacle implied by such self-censorship. A clue to "Gangs of New York," a film Scorsese has been working on intermittently since the mid-1970's, is the book it's based on -- Herbert Asbury's 1927 cult classic, "The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld," which has just been reissued in paperback with a foreword adapted from a story by Jorge Luis Borges. 
 The book itself is hard to describe, and is better understood for what it isn't than for what it is. To begin with, "The Gangs of New York," a chronology of gangs who terrorized the city from its post-Revolutionary days through the early 20th century, is not a work of liberal reform in the spirit, say, of Jacob A. Riis, the social reformer who wrote "How the Other Half Lives." Asbury expresses neither shock nor dismay at the conditions that spawned the gangs, although he describes the city's squalor clearly and treats political corruption as part of the general criminality of the era. Nor does Asbury formulate scientific hypotheses about the causes of juvenile delinquency, a task that absorbed the fledgling discipline of sociology in his day. As he says in his introduction, "This book is not a sociological treatise, and makes no pretense of offering solutions for the social, economic and criminological problems presented by the gangs." 
 "The Gangs of New York" isn't respectable history, either. For years academic historians have quarreled with Asbury's representation of a 19th-century New York kept in a constant state of anarchy by thuggery, but their own methods aren't exactly confidence-inspiring -- they mostly rely on police reports, whereas Asbury paints a picture of a police force whose leaders were gangsters themselves. The latest historian to take on Asbury is Tyler Anbinder, author of "Five Points: The 19th-Century New York City Neighborhood That Invented Tap Dance, Stole Elections, and Became the World's Most Notorious Slum." A passionate defender of the hard-working poor, Anbinder accuses Asbury of seeing Five Points, a downtown neighborhood that was arguably the worst slum in New York history, through eyes prejudiced against its Irish newcomers. But the older book captured the feel of desperate poverty better than Anbinder's bland social historian's prose, even if Asbury got a few details wrong. And Asbury comes off as positively multicultural when you compare him with his peers and immediate predecessors, like Riis, who was openly revolted by what he perceived as greedy Jews, opium-peddling Chinese and other unwashed hordes who had floated up to America's shores.
What "The Gangs of New York" is, really, is literature, a string of unsentimentally observed, mildly ironic, only quasi-nonfictional stories about men who mythologized themselves as heroes, though the world rightly considered them scum. Critics have accused Asbury of failing to see through the criminals' braggadocio, but that misses the point. The book is the modern equivalent of an ancient epic, filled with tales of battles fought by club-wielding giants, as well as with many endless genealogies. 
Early on there were the Bowery and Five Points gangs -- the Bowery Boys and the Dead Rabbits, locked in undying enmity. The Dead Rabbits begat the Plug Uglies, named after the stiff woolen helmets they wore smashed down on their heads; the Shirt Tails, who always left their shirts untucked; and the Chichesters. The Bowery Boys (or B'hoys) begat the Mighty Mose, the Paul Bunyan of New York. This legendary figure was reputed to have been eight feet tall and to have lifted horse-drawn carriages with his bare hands and to have rescued a foundering ship by blowing smoke rings into its sails. 
Along the wharves, river pirates preyed on sailors, and they roamed the Hudson in rowboats, looting and pillaging as far up as Westchester and beyond. These became the Daybreak Boys, so called because they operated at dawn, and also yielded Albert E. Hicks, a gangster who after being shanghaied onto a sloop killed the captain and crew with an ax, scurried ashore and was caught with the captain's effects on his person. He confessed, became a celebrity and was hanged on Bedloe's Island in an execution carried out with great fanfare and watched by an estimated 10,000 people, including many politicians. Later came the statesmen of Tammany Hall who, Asbury says, ran New York for the benefit of themselves and other gangsters, with sops thrown to the poor. And on it went, against a shifting, squabbling ethnic background that evolved from Irish to anti-Irish Americans of English descent to Chinese to Jewish to Italian, with the criminal organizations becoming ever more professional and the violence more lethal.
Like all good literature, "The Gangs of New York" generated more literature. Luc Sante's "Low Life," a history of the New York underworld, owes a great debt to Asbury, as much in its bemused style as in content. Borges based his story "Monk Eastman, Purveyor of Iniquities" on a character he found in Asbury's book. Eastman, a misshapen Jewish thug and ward boss with a deep tenderness for birds and cats, at one time commanded more than 1,200 followers. "The story of the New York gangs," Borges wrote, "possesses all the confusion and cruelty of barbarian cosmologies, and much of their gigantism and ineptitude." 
After a lifetime of crime and imprisonment, Eastman redeemed himself on the battlefields of World War I. But Borges made Eastman his protagonist probably not because he reformed, but because he relapsed. Honored by the governor of New York for his wartime heroism, Eastman died shortly thereafter on the streets of New York, murdered, as it turned out, by his partner in bootlegging and drug dealing. The monsters who prowled historic New York weren't easy to tame -- that's why we like to read about them so much. Like the bank robbers and cattle rustlers of the West, they're part of American mythology. Historians may dispute that the gangs were ever as brutal or Tammany Hall as venal as people like Asbury made them out to be, but if our artists had limited themselves to straight history, Francis Ford Coppola might never have made his "Godfather" trilogy, or Sergio Leone "Once Upon a Time in America." As Scorsese said of the character in his movie last year: "These were warriors, and their gods were war gods. I'm dealing with making a film about barbarians."

 THE CULT OF THE NATION OF FRANCE
Inventing Nationalism,
1680-1800.
By David A. Bell
304 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
Harvard University Press. $49.95.
 "THIS people has become a worshiper of its fatherland, without ever having known, before the Revolution, what a fatherland was." So Giacomo Casanova wrote in 1797, expressing the common view that the explosion of French patriotic fervor that followed the Revolution of 1789 was something quite new. In "The Cult of the Nation of France," David A. Bell takes issue, arguing that the concepts of nation and fatherland had been important in France before then. 
At the center of Bell's subtle and intricate argument is religion. Religion, he suggests, was changing in the 18th century. And with men less likely to see God as an interventionist presence in their daily lives and more likely to stress God's distant, inscrutable quality, space was opened up for an autonomous realm of human action, described by a series of interconnected words: society, public opinion, civilization, fatherland and nation. One reflection of this sense of the autonomy was the rules change, in 1758, in the Academie Francaise's eloquence competitions: orators previously required to give speeches on subjects of religious devotion were now asked to deliver eulogies of "great men of the nation." 
Bell isn't arguing that patriotism remained static throughout the 18th century. Before 1789, it was a matter for the elite. (As Voltaire remarked, "The spirit of the nation always resides in the small number who put a large number to work.") The revolutionaries, Bell notes, tried to inculcate a sense of the nation into all men. Their missionary zeal, he suggests, was provoked both by a reaction against the influence of the Roman Catholic Church and by a propensity to imitate the church's techniques. Patriotism also became sterner with the Revolution, hinging on men's (and the emphasis on masculinity was important) ability to conquer their nature. The most chilling illustration of such patriotic feeling is David's 1789 painting of Brutus receiving the bodies of his sons, whom he himself has ordered to be executed for treason. Brutus sits apparently unmoved by the deed his patriotic feelings have provoked as his wife and daughters weep inconsolably. 
Bell winds up with a glance at contemporary France and a sideswipe at the training ground of the French intellectual elite, the Ecole Normale Superieure in the Rue d'Ulm, which he sees as a school for missionaries of the republic and believes to have been marginalized by the hegemony of American academia. This is odd. Anyone who examines the influence that Derrida, Foucault and Bourdieu have had on American universities might conclude that it is the Ecole Normale Superieure that has conquered America rather than vice versa. Indeed, Bell's own approach is characteristic of the Rue d'Ulm. (Nothing is more ulmien than his failure to mention the Ecole Normale at St. Cloud, which, as a trainer of primary schoolteachers, was less prestigious but probably more influential than its sister institution in Paris.) 
Like all good normaliens, as well as fashion-conscious American intellectuals, Bell is interested in ideas, culture and language, and he is rather dismissive of the idea that nationalism might be explained with reference to social, economic and technological change. But having deployed such sophisticated arguments to explain the construction of French nationalism, Bell seems to take it for granted that the decline of French national identity is a natural process. Will France, he asks, simply "dissolve into Europe, cyberspace and the global marketplace?" But cyberspace and the global marketplace are not just products of nature. The founders of what has become the European Union were aware that Europe had to be created by an act of political will; anyone interested in the links between Catholicism and nation-building would do well to examine the influence of Christian Democrats in forging postwar European integration.
It is axiomatic that the next mayor's central task will be rebuilding. But rebuilding what? If it is merely office space, then he may not even equal Giuliani, during whose tenure millions of square feet of commercial space have gone up in Times Square alone. And mayors, in any case, don't build office buildings; developers do. But mayors do guide the process of development through decisions about zoning, land use, subsidies, capital spending and so on. Planning, to use the collective term for this process, is a terribly important and generally tedious subject that experts usually care about much more than politicians do -- except when it comes time to cut the ribbon. But the next mayor will have to think about planning in the largest sense. He will have an opportunity to reshape the physical city as few mayors before him have.
The first issue will be ensuring that businesses and people return to Lower Manhattan. At a recent forum on rebuilding downtown, virtually all the panelists agreed that the single most important thing the city could do right now is to get money out of the federal government as fast as possible and into the hands of residents and small businesses. There are all sorts of mechanisms to accomplish this. The Giuliani administration is proposing to give businesses a $5,000 cash bonus for every employee they hire. Green had suggested a federal "residential tax credit" to induce jittery residents to return. Michael Bloomberg proposes providing tax incentives to landlords to lower rents for small businesses. There is also a consensus that funds must be used right away to begin rebuilding collapsed subway stations and to provide express bus service and perhaps ferry service to the area.
The short-term issues are, if not easy, at least straightforward; it is the long-term issues that are really thorny. Thousands of workers in the finance industry have been relocated from downtown Manhattan to New Jersey or Connecticut. Tax incentives and boosterism may not be enough to get them to return. And if some firms stay away, others may conclude that New York isn't so indispensable after all. And this raises a question that New York's mayors have not had to ask before: why should the financial industry be so heavily concentrated in New York, particularly in Lower Manhattan? The reason no one had to ask this question before is that New York City has been the financial capital of the country at least since the 1830's, when, as Mike Wallace, a co-author of "Gotham," an encyclopedic history of New York, points out, the demise of the Second Bank of the United States in Philadelphia left New York as the center of the national banking system and the source of capital for the expanding system of canals and railroads. New York's dominance is, as another urban scholar, Robert Fitch, puts it, "path dependent": it is the center because it has always been the center. 
The problem is not precisely that the finance industry will leave Lower Manhattan. The industry has been moving to Midtown for the last quarter-century, and few of the major investment banks still have their headquarters downtown. The issue is, first, whether the many brokerage and other firms that were quartered downtown will return there, and second, whether the big financial and other concerns that are located outside of downtown will remain in New York. 
Bloomberg, who ought to know about such things, says that the corporate headquarters are here to stay, no matter what threats their C.E.O.'s make in the hope of extorting tax breaks from the city. "You want to be where your customers are, where your suppliers are, where your competitors are, and the media that covers you," he says. The danger is rather that a new fear of keeping all employees in one building will encourage firms to move back-office and other functions to cheaper, and at least safer-feeling, regions beyond New York.
The solution may lie in the development of less-expensive commercial districts within the city. A body convened by Schumer and known as the Group of 35 has suggested the construction of 50 million square feet of office space in new "central business districts" in downtown Brooklyn, Long Island City and the far West Side of Manhattan. Green says that he was touting the virtues of downtown Brooklyn well before Schumer came along. Oddly enough, during the runoff Green savaged Ferrer for proposing to "disperse" the finance industry, and since scarcely anyone understood the issue, he was never called on it. 
But the conscious creation of new downtowns is not an expensive solution, since developers would need massive subsidies to build in marginal areas. Moreover, it is a real-estate solution to a problem perhaps best understood not solely in real-estate terms. Hugh O'Neill, the president of Appleseed, a New York-based economic development consulting firm, says: "What makes New York City a center of world finance is a concentration of talented people and an enormous base of shared knowledge, the socialized knowledge of global finance and the innovative financial culture. None of that is embodied in any particular building." 
It is more important, O'Neill argues, to think about the special character and the amenities that attract those people to New York than to replace the lost office space or to hand out subsidies to real-estate developers or corporate tenants. This is especially true in the case of Lower Manhattan. Though Wall Street is still dominated by finance and anchored by such institutions as the Stock Exchange, the Depository Trust Company and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the whole area of Lower Manhattan has been revitalized by Internet firms, nonprofits, health care companies and other vibrant organizations whose employees typically live in the neighborhood, and this trend seems almost certain to continue despite the failure of so many of the dot-coms. In a recent study issued by the Center for an Urban Future, Joel Kotkin, an authority on technology and urban affairs, writes that small, high-tech firms are helping to reshape Lower Manhattan. And while the "old economy" demands "ready access to materials or convenience to the marketplace," the new one cares more about "quality of life and access to educated workers."
After initial patriotic vows to rebuild every square foot of damaged commercial real estate, it is now becoming clear that the key to revitalizing Lower Manhattan lies elsewhere. Development, as Green put it in a recent speech, "means not just rebuilding office buildings but building parks and open space, cultural institutions, restaurants, retail and housing." Carl Weisbrod, the president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business improvement district, says that the city and state must not only rebuild the subways and the PATH train from New Jersey but also connect the two to create a seamless commute and extend the PATH trains in Lower Manhattan to the Long Island Railroad to permit a relatively uninterrupted trip from New Jersey to Brooklyn and ultimately to J.F.K. Weisbrod argues that Lower Manhattan's two great advantages are the subway system and the waterfront. If the city focuses on those two resources, he says, "we have an opportunity to make downtown spectacular and absolutely breathtaking." All of these ambitious plans depend on federal money; if the Bush administration doesn't come through with more aid, Lower Manhattan will have to be rebuilt on the cheap.
Green and Bloomberg offer two very different models of downtown reconstruction. Green understands it as a grand civic project, on the order of the redevelopment of Times Square. "We will," he said recently, "marshal the talent and creativity of the New York City planning and design world -- through a competition -- to get the best and most creative ideas and to create a bold design for a better downtown, a downtown of the future that can be a model for the nation and the world." Green has proposed an Economic Reconstruction Authority, which would bring together representatives of state and local government, the public and private sectors and management and labor. 
Bloomberg is more focused on removing impediments from the private sector. "The money that's going to rebuild is all private money," he says. "So what's this agency going to do: tell private enterprise what they can do with their money?" Bloomberg also argues that the whole debate over keeping the finance industry in Lower Manhattan is beside the point. The big firms are already gone, he points out. "What you have to do is look for other industries -- biotech, media, fashion. And that's what a private developer will do." 
Crises either make mayors or destroy them. James J. Walker -- Beau James -- was a charming gadabout and dandy in the Roaring Twenties but then had the misfortune to be re-elected in 1929. Walker was forced to resign in disgrace in 1932: "a shallow, fun-loving politician in the most trying times in the city's modern history," in the epitaph of Thomas Kessner, the biographer of Fiorello LaGuardia. Abe Beame, an ancient veteran of the Democratic clubhouse, was elected in 1973 under the motto "he knows the buck" and was promptly overwhelmed by the city's fiscal crisis. David Dinkins took office in 1990 as a "healer" and was battered by racial psychodramas. 
LaGuardia was our first great crisis mayor. We think of LaGuardia today as the feisty character who read the Sunday funnies on the radio, but in fact, as Kessner makes plain in his biography, "Fiorello H. LaGuardia and the Making of Modern New York," LaGuardia was a remorseless, and frequently apoplectic, character who seized control of the city from a corrupt and worn-out Tammany Hall. LaGuardia was Giuliani's hero, and in fact there are striking parallels between the two men's administrations. What "the machine" was for LaGuardia, urban liberalism was for Giuliani: an entrenched foe to be uprooted through tireless combat. 
Both men used a fiscal crisis to assert control over city government. Gov. Herbert Lehman was so outraged over the emergency authority LaGuardia sought when he first took office that he accused the mayor, not unfairly, of demanding "dictatorial powers." In Giuliani's case, when the Health and Hospitals Corporation balked at his plan to reorganize the city's hospitals, the mayor said, "It was constituted by the city government; it could be reconstituted."
This is, traditionally, what it means to be a big mayor in New York. The reformers, as Vincent Cannato, the author of a recent biography of John Lindsay, says, "grab the city by the lapels and shake it." They confront their way to authority. But the next mayor will not be able to lash out at his foes as Giuliani and LaGuardia did, because he will have no Tammany, no entrenched liberalism to smite: the author of the city's woes is very far away, and only the United States military can smite him. He will not be able to seize the levers of power in the name of reform. And yet, as Cannato says, "the next mayor is either going to step up to the plate and be a big figure, or he'll be swallowed up by events" as Beame or Walker were. Cannato adds that he is "not terribly optimistic" about the next mayor's prospects. 
The most crucial aspect of the next mayor's job will be to preserve the tenuous solidarity the city now enjoys and turn it to practical use. This is in part a matter of policy. He will have to make public safety a paramount issue. He will have to remember that for many, if not most, voters, issues like housing or schools are far more pressing than cleaning up Lower Manhattan. He will have to found an ethic of shared sacrifice on real sacrifices by everyone.
At the same time, the mayoralty is a profoundly theatrical and intensely symbolic job -- and especially so at moments of crisis. When Fiorello fought fires and flattened recalcitrant city workers, it was just the kind of performance New Yorkers needed to restore their faith in government. The single greatest episode of John Lindsay's mayoralty was a coup de theatre -- his walk through Harlem in the midst of an incipient riot, his great shock of hair rising above the crowd like some WASPy banner. Giuliani has radiated hope and optimism in the midst of great suffering and thus has helped all those around him to control their fears, even if they can't dismiss them. The next mayor must, in effect, find a scaled-down, postwar version of the mayor's Churchillian style.
You can talk all you want about infrastructure and tax credits and so on, but the central fact of New York City right now is that people are living in fear. Their fears are rational and irrational; they involve airplanes and anthrax and smallpox and bombs in shopping bags -- whatever. And though in normal times New Yorkers might scoff at the idea of seeking reassurance from a mayor, no one is scoffing now. Perhaps nothing bad will happen from here on in, and the fears will subside. But if they don't, the mayor will still matter in a way he has rarely mattered before. And this is true not only in a broad, almost spiritual sense but also in regard to the decisions people make. As Eugene Keilin says: "The most effective retention policy is if people either feel secure or no less secure than they did before. And it will be done through force of personality rather than any specific issue." 
I was struck, as I spoke to academics and experts and voters around the city, that some people were making the existential choice of hope and others the equally personal and irreducible choice of fear, or at least profound gloom. And sometimes it was the people who had felt the most suffering who were most insistently optimistic. About a week or so after the disaster, I called Rosemary Scanlon, the former chief economist for the Port Authority. Scanlon had lost friends and colleagues in the collapse of the World Trade Center, and she was almost too upset to speak. But when I asked whether she thought Lower Manhattan would be permanently damaged, she pointed out that the Nazis had as a matter of conscious policy tried to obliterate the City, London's financial center, and that after the war the British had, with equal resolution, rebuilt it "block after block after block." And then she added that the fears of permanent dispersal that followed the 1993 bombing of the trade center proved to be groundless. And as if that weren't enough, she pointed out that air travel, after collapsing in the aftermath of the gulf war, returned to normal within a year, even in the midst of a recession.
A moment when people are hesitating between hope and fear, a moment when a moral account must be drawn down -- this is, quintessentially, the leadership moment. And New Yorkers can only hope that destiny has, in fact, chosen the right man for the moment or, better, that that man will become, through the same mysterious alchemy that produced the Mayor Giuliani we all see today, the one that the moment requires.

In a survey completed by The Times on Thursday, after the magazine had gone to press, Michael Bloomberg, who trailed Mark Green considerably in previous polls, closed the gap to five percentage points.

Washington Makes A Patriotic Pitch

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
FIRST there was the terrorist strike on the Pentagon. Then there was the anthrax attack on the Senate. Threats of new terrorism mean that tours of the White House and the F.B.I. have been shut down indefinitely. The city's close-in airport, Reagan National, has only limited operations.
 So what are the capital's beleaguered tourism officials to do? Confronting the worst tourism downturn in the city's modern history, their guess is that the best way to lure visitors back to Washington -- and perhaps the only way, for now -- is by appealing to their patriotism. 
 "In the spirit of national unity, we encourage our fellow Americans to join us in Washington, D.C., as we rally behind a timely message of patriotism," Mayor Anthony A. Williams says in a new statement that welcomes visitors to the city's tourism Web site, www.washington.org.
Tourism officials in neighboring Virginia, which draws many travelers who visit Washington first, have talked of temporarily dropping their "Virginia is for Lovers" advertising slogan in favor of "Virginia is for Patriots."
The events of Sept. 11 and everything that has followed are threatening to devastate the city's economy, with 24,000 jobs projected to disappear by next spring.
The hospitality industry is the city's second largest employer -- only the federal government is bigger -- and half of the job cuts are expected to take place in hotels and restaurants. Already, half of the members of the local hotel and restaurant employees union are out of work.
The hotel occupancy rate is normally 80 percent at this time of year; in mid-October, it was closer to 30 percent.
City leaders hope the situation will improve as federal aviation officials allow more flights to return to Reagan National, which was shut for three weeks after Sept. 11 because of fear that its proximity to the White House and every other major government building would make it a tempting target in a second wave of strikes.
In early October, the government allowed service to resume from Reagan to eight destinations, including New York, Chicago and Dallas. On Oct. 26, service was resumed to an additional 18 cities, including Philadelphia and Houston.
But the new security rules imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration on passengers flying into the airport remain strict, jarringly so. At O'Hare and Dallas-Fort Worth airports, security areas have been set aside for flights into Reagan airport, with passengers subjected to an extra search, including a frisking with an electronic wand.
Passengers on flights into Reagan are barred from standing up, even to use the lavatory, in the final 30 minutes of any flight, an effort to make it that much harder for someone to try to charge the cockpit. "If you violate this rule and stand up, I am required to turn this plane around," an American Airlines pilot warned passengers on a flight from Chicago two weeks ago. "Nobody is joking about this."
In the first weeks after Sept. 11, the city's leaders repeatedly tried to reassure tourists that the capital was safe, arguing that no city in the country was being more tightly guarded as a result of the terrorist attacks.
But their assurances became less reassuring after the anthrax attacks, and after Mayor Williams said in Congressional testimony on Oct. 12 that the city was "home to perhaps the greatest targets for terrorist activity in America" and therefore needed help to pay for new security measures.
For travelers willing to put aside their anxieties, there may never be a better time to visit Washington, especially for visitors who like to have tourist sites to themselves.
While tours of many public buildings have been suspended, the city's fabled museums are open, albeit with much tightened security and with many fewer visitors than normal. The Mall is uncrowded and quiet.
Many of the city's most luxurious hotels are offering deeply discounted rates. The Swissotel at the Watergate, which borders Georgetown, has splendid views of the Potomac, and normally sells rooms at more than $300 a night, has been offering weekend rates of $125. The new Hilton Garden Inn, only three blocks from the White House, has weekend rates of $79 a night, half its regular rate. As is true throughout the country, there are heavily discounted air fares to match.
"It's a great time to be a tourist in Washington," said Bill Hanbury, president of the Washington Convention and Tourism Corporation. "You can walk straight into the Smithsonian or the Holocaust Museum without any lines. You can get a seat to any play."
"We want people to come back to their nation's capital and to touch and feel the symbols that reflect on American democracy," he said, adding that a visit now is "absolutely patriotic."

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 11-4-01; 
United Nations

BYLINE:  By Andrew Sullivan; Andrew Sullivan is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
In crises, some things clarify. I grew up for 20 years in Britain, and I'm now closing in on 20 years of adulthood in the United States. It's funny how feelings of identity arc in such a life. I remember the first time I got a lump in my throat singing "The Star-Spangled Banner," on July 4 about 10 years ago. It took me completely by surprise. My attachment to my new country had taken shape and form without my even knowing it, until I found myself tearing up in a routine ritual of patriotism. It wasn't that I had left my love of homeland behind. But it was now refracted through the prism of my new love -- a love that is foolish to inspect because it belongs somewhere in the heart where reason doesn't follow. 
 And then, in the aftermath of Sept. 11, another surprise. As friends and family from the U.K. finally penetrated the tangled phone system, I found out that they, too, were almost as grief stricken as I was. "What can we do for you?" was one question I heard over and over again, as if ordinary Brits could do anything for me or anyone else in such a case. But the feeling was intensely serious. It was almost as if it had happened to them, as if a vicarious American patriotism had crossed the Atlantic. Days later, all of Britain stood still to mark a moment of silence for a tragedy thousands of miles away. 
 My own first moment of silence blurred nationalisms as well. It was at a memorial service for an acquaintance of mine from Provincetown, where I spend my summers. Graham Berkeley was a Brit, a violinist, a business professional, a big, tattooed bodybuilder, who'd been on the flight from Boston that crashed into the World Trade Center's south tower. Like me, he was a transplant for many years in America and loved the place with a passion. A bunch of us gathered around some candles and memorabilia on the farthest part of Herring Cove beach, the sun setting over Cape Cod Bay, told stories and wiped away tears. And by the side of us were two large flags impaled in the sand, Old Glory and the Union Jack. In the dusk, they intertwined until the reds, whites and blues seemed almost indistinguishable.
Sentimental? Surely. Irrelevant? Surely not. When the queen ordered the band to play "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace for the first time in history, I doubt I was the only one watching through tears. When Tony Blair stood in Congress as President Bush gave his memorable tribute to America's truest friend, the hair stood up on the back of my neck. And as the news came through that British special forces were among the first soldiers to foray into Afghanistan, alongside Americans, it seemed simply fitting.
Tony Blair's role in all this has, of course, been central. Blair has not only been the key rhetorician of the war against terrorism; he has also become almost a second secretary of state of the United States. He has shuttled from Pakistan to Oman and Egypt, defending American policy, patching the leaky coalition ship. He was the figure who announced to the world the proof of bin Laden's complicity in the attack in the House of Commons. He has rallied the European Union and committed British troops as by far the biggest non-American contingent in the war in Afghanistan. And all this from a prime minister who is, primarily, a Europhile. A cynic would respond that Blair has, like many previous British leaders, merely seized an opportunity as America's diplomatic and military fig leaf to enhance British influence in the world. 
But there is surely more to it than that. What Blair was responding to was what I had felt from afar: the instinctual association of ordinary Brits with Americans under fire. Some of this was understandable. There were, after all, dozens of British victims in the World Trade Center attack. Their presence alone is a sign of how deeply interwoven the lives of Britons and Americans had become in the new global economic order, and a sign too of how Britain, an open country, deeply reliant on trade and international finance, would suffer if terrorism shut the global system down. 
But beneath this, there is also something primal. What struck me here among my American friends at the time was how instinctive their response was to British support. It wasn't so much gratitude, I sensed, as relief. At moments like these, the Brits somehow make America seem less alone in the world. They act as a sanity check when America feels beleaguered, a reassurance that not all foreigners harbor reflexive hostility to the United States. And at profoundly vulnerable moments, maternity matters. Somewhere in the American psyche, the support of the mother country buoys even those Americans who have no ethnic or cultural connection to Britain whatsoever. When faced with a real threat, we remember the fundamentals. Orwell foresaw this linkage in his vision of a new bloc of trans-Atlantic powers called Oceania in his novel "1984." Churchill, partly American himself, articulated it more cheerfully in his notion of a union of the English-speaking peoples. But now, perhaps because of deeper and deeper cultural penetration, because of growing financial and economic interdependence, the merger once dreamed of is finally coming to pass. What Orwell and Churchill foresaw, and the 1990's deepened, bin Laden catalyzed still further. And it's appropriate, perhaps, that this came about not because of some political effort from the top but simply because of an emotional groundswell from below. Those feelings soldered something new and deep between these two countries: if not a reunification, then something close to it.

This committee, with its elaborate organization of staff officers of every grade, disposes of all our resources and, in practice, uses British and American troops, ships, aircraft and ammunition just as if they were the resources of a single state or nation. . . . This is a wonderful system. There was nothing like it in the last war. There never has been anything like it between two allies. . . . If we are together nothing is impossible. If we are divided all will fail." Winston S. Churchill, speaking at Harvard in 1943

HEADLINE: The Final Fronton Nears Its Final Days 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH BEST 

 BODY:
THE sanctuary of professional athletes, the locker room, is often a noisy place. Card games, practical jokes and loud banter characteristically can be heard from behind its closed doors. 
 But since the announcement on Oct. 15 that Milford Jai-Alai would close after 25 years, the players who call the fronton's locker room their home have been more subdued. 
 "It's very quiet in the locker room," said Josu Elesgarai, one of Milford's top jai alai players known on the court as Beitia, who first came to the United States from Spain in 1992 to play at Bridgeport Jai-Alai. 
Mr. Elesgarai is among 200 employees, including the 48 competitors, who will no longer have jobs after Dec. 12, when the last of the state's three frontons will close.
Leonard Meyer, the Milford Jai-Alai president, said the closing was forced by a combination of events including declining attendance, a continuing drop in revenue in the face of competition from Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun casinos, and the inability to gain legislative support for the simulcasting of horse races.
"Milford has been a wonderful city to be in business in," Mr. Meyer said. "The citizens and government have been more than supportive. We felt a part of the community. We have no argument with the casinos. They're doing what they have to do. We've had a working relationship with them."
In fact, one of the last major events that will take place at Milford Jai-Alai is the Mohegan Sun International Jai-Alai Championships, one of the sport's major tournaments, which ends today.
Milford had its best year of operation in 1988, when the fronton had revenues of about $100 million for six months of operation, said Bob Heussler, a spokesman for the fronton. Milford alternated seasons with the Bridgeport fronton at the time.
The fronton's best individual day was Memorial Day of 1983, when rainy weather helped inspire 7,000 people to bet $770,000.
The Foxwoods Casino opened in 1992 and within three years, Milford was the only jai alai fronton remaining. 
After Bridgeport Jai-Alai closed in 1995 and was converted to Shoreline Star Greyhound Park, Milford began operating year-round. At about the same time, the fronton in Hartford closed and is now the site of the Meadows Music Theater. However, revenues continued to drop steadily in Milford. Last year the total amount of money bet at Milford was just more than $70 million and this year it is at about $66 million.
Attendance was affected not only by the opening of the casinos, but by the acceptance of jai alai bets in the Connecticut Off-Track Betting system in 1994, a move the frontons made in an effort to keep revenue flowing. However, while it made betting more convenient, it kept fans out of the fronton, away from the restaurant and from experiencing the atmosphere of being inside the building watching first hand the sport that is billed as the world's fastest ballgame.
"It was a double-edged sword," Mr. Huessler said. "From a business perspective you had to be available in OTB, but at what price? I think it might have been, in the end, too steep a price to pay."
Milford Jai-Alai was not able to gain legislative support for the simulcasting of horse races, which is available at the dog track in Bridgeport.
The cavernous Milford fronton has a capacity of 4,500 seats, and average attendance when it opened was more than 3,800. Today, the average attendance is fewer than 500.
On the weekend just after the closing announcement was made, the smack of the pelota against the wall echoed periodically throughout the building as players moved about the jai alai court. The other constant sound was the loud buzz from one of the lighting ballasts. An occasional shout from a fan broke through from time to time. 
Those who have been regulars at the fronton for many years said that while they do enjoy the wagering, it is the game itself and its athletes that they will miss the most. 
"It's very exciting, I'm going to miss it because it's a fun night out and great entertainment," said Ken Samu, a social worker from Trumbull, lighting up a cigarette after checking his program. "I don't play the horses or the dogs. I like jai alai because I like watching the game."
The Dec. 12 closing was selected because it was a natural break in the Milford schedule, what was the annual two-week shut down for maintenance and repair work. 
Lester Trotto, 53, began working part-time at the fronton cashing in winning tickets for customers. Today as the mutuals manager he supervises nearly 50 people who take and cash bets. Mr. Trotto, who has spent 25 years in the jai alai industry and is a native of the Milford-New Haven area, is uncertain what he will do when his job ends, along with its salary of more than $40,000.
"I'd like to do something on the road, but not sales," he said. "I really don't have any other experience than this. I've met a lot of people working here, so I've got some people looking around for me."
After learning of the closing, some of Mr. Trotto's staff moved quickly to attend a job fair at Mohegan Sun, thinking that if enough of them were offered jobs, they could arrange car pools to work each day.
Mr. Meyers said he would work with his employees to assist them with unemployment and with state job programs. He also has already been contacted by those interested in acquiring the 25-acre property, located just off of Interstate 95 on Old Gate Lane.
The only other jai alai frontons in the United States are in Newport, R.I., and at locations in Florida. The players, who are primarily from the Basque region of Spain where the sport developed, hope to find jobs in those locations. However, not all players have the same ability to find new jobs.
Some players, like Mr. Elesgarai, have been living and working in Connecticut for many years and have a permanent work visa, known as a green card, that allows them to collect unemployment and work outside of jai alai. Others are in the United States with temporary work visas and will have to return to Europe if they cannot find a job. 
Jai alai players in Milford average about $50,000 per year, a figure that varies depending on their contracts and record of winning games. Even for those who can stay in Connecticut, it will be difficult to find a job with the same kind of income.
"It's happening too fast," said Mr. Elesgarai, 31, who owns a home in Milford where he lives with his family, including two young children. "We have two months. A lot of people are going to be unemployed. It's going to be tough working outside of jai alai."

HEADLINE: HOLIDAY FILMS: THE LINEUP; 
Hogwarts, Middle Earth And Other Getaway Spots

BYLINE:  By ANITA GATES; Compiled with the assistance of Suzanne O'Connor.

 BODY:
 HOLLYWOOD would love to know what America wants to see at the movies this holiday season. (If only we knew ourselves.) Some big films have been moved to 2002, in hopes that times will be better or, as we say wistfully every day, "back to normal." A few serious, possibly Oscar-worthy pictures will open over the next two months, but the sure thing this season is fantasy. Thank God for Harry Potter and hobbits and time travel and terrifying stories set in a distant future that has nothing to do with us.

'TEXAS RANGERS': A genuine actual western that has been threatening to open since spring 2000. The mostly young stars include some TV heroes (James Van Der Beek, Dylan McDermott, Ashton Kutcher). Directed by Steve Miner, it's about the founding of the Rangers after the Civil War. Nov. 30.

DECEMBER

'B-52': Hartmut Bitomsky's documentary about the bombers of the same name. They have wingspans as wide as a football field, carry a crew of six and have a range of 8,388 miles without refueling. And who would have thought we'd care? Dec. 5.

'PINERO': Benjamin Bratt plays Miguel Pinero, Nuyorican poet, playwright, Tony Award nominee, actor, TV writer, heroin addict and ex-con. Unlike Reinaldo Arenas, the subject of last year's "Before Night Falls," this artist enjoyed his success before dying young of AIDS. With Mandy Patinkin as Joseph Papp. Written and directed by Leon Ichaso. Dec. 5.
'THE BUSINESS OF STRANGERS': Think of it as "In the Company of Women." At an airport hotel, an executive (Stockard Channing) and her young assistant (Julia Stiles) bridge the generation and income gap, then decide to play strange games with a corporate headhunter (Frederick Weller). A drama with black comedy, written and directed by Patrick Stettner. Dec. 7.

Waking up in a small locked room, he believes it's 2399 and he's just been cryogenically unfrozen so he can be carved up into "donor organ packets." Hope Davis plays his doctor. A psychological thriller directed by Campbell Scott. Dec. 7.
'NO MAN'S LAND': Three soldiers in an abandoned trench: one Serb, two Bosnian -- and one is lying on top of a spring bomb. When a U.N. official and a journalist try to help, the situation becomes a media circus. A satiric drama written and directed by Tanis Danovic. Filmed in the former Yugoslav republic Slovenia. Dec. 7. A related article is on Page 31.
'OCEAN'S 11': George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and a few others star in a not-exactly-remake of Sinatra and the Rat Pack's not-exactly-good 1960 heist film. This time the gang is planning to hit Las Vegas casinos during a high-profile boxing match. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, which should count for something. Dec. 7.
'PRINCESA': A nice Brazilian boy working as a transvestite prostitute in Milan finds the man of his dreams, complete with more than enough money for a sex-change operation. But the dream disappoints. Directed by Henrique Goldman and based on the memoirs of Fernanda Farias de Albuquerque, who later committed suicide. Ingrid de Souza stars as Fernanda. Dec. 7.

With the voices of two other outspoken siblings, Vanessa and Corin Redgrave. Dec. 14.
'IRIS': A romantic, sure to be tear-jerking drama about the British novelist Iris Murdoch. She's played by Kate Winslet as a young woman at Oxford and by Dame Judi Dench as the older Murdoch, who loses all to Alzheimer's. Hugh Bonneville and Jim Broadbent play John Bayley, Murdoch's husband, whose memoirs the film is based on. Directed by Richard Eyre. Dec. 14.
'NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE': A high school football star (Chris Evans) bets he can turn a bespectacled nerd (Chyler Leigh) into a prom queen. But this comedy, directed by Joel Gallen (whose claim to fame is having produced the MTV Movie Awards show for a decade), sets out to play with the usual cliches. Mr. T is listed in the cast, which could be a sign. Dec. 14.
'VANILLA SKY': This year's Meg-and-Russell award -- for the co-star romance that overshadows the film where it all began -- goes to this romantic comedy from Cameron Crowe. Tom Cruise is a handsome, womanizing publishing tycoon looking for his soul (just like Jerry Maguire). Penelope Cruz, as his best friend's girlfriend, has played this role before: in "Abre los Ojos," the 1997 Spanish film that inspired this one. Dec.14. A related article is on Page 3.
'LITTLE OTIK': It's based on an old Czech fairy tale. When a couple can't have children, the husband just carves a baby out of a stump. Unfortunately, it turns into a monster. A combination of live action and Claymation, written and directed by Jan Svankmajer. Dec. 19.

'GOSFORD PARK': Robert Altman mixes "Upstairs, Downstairs" and murder. A comedy-of-manners mystery set in 1932 at an English country estate. Mr. Altman loves big ensemble casts, and here he has a mostly British one, including Alan Bates, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi, Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam, Maggie Smith and Emily Watson. Dec. 21.
'HOW HIGH': Two stupid young men get into Harvard by smoking a particular kind of marijuana (which, inexplicably, makes them temporarily brilliant). Then they run out of the stuff. With the rap stars Redman and Method Man. Directed by Jesse Dylan, son of Bob, who once had something to say about getting stoned. Dec. 21.
'JIMMY NEUTRON: BOY GENIUS': Starring space aliens who look like green egg yolks. Thank goodness they're animated, as is the brilliant 10-year-old boy who has to save the people of Retroville from the invaders. With the voices of Martin Short and Patrick Stewart. Directed by John Davis. Dec. 21.
'JOE SOMEBODY': A divorced corporate nobody (Tim Allen) turns his life around. He has to. He's just been publicly humiliated at the office in front of his daughter. A comic drama from John Pasquin, who also directed Mr. Allen in "The Santa Clause." Dec. 21.

Directed by Frank Darabont ("The Shawshank Redemption," "The Green Mile"). Dec. 21. Related articles are on Page 34.
'THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS': When bad things happen to early bloomers. Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson star as the amazingly brilliant, successful children of Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston. But they've all gone seriously downhill, and now they're having a reunion. A comedy directed by Wes Anderson, who gave us "Rushmore." Dec. 21.
'ALI': If anybody can play the boxing legend Muhammad Ali with the right blend of wit, anger and, of course, greatness, it's probably Will Smith, who hasn't had a real acting challenge since "Six Degrees of Separation." He gets his chance in this drama directed by Michael Mann, whose last film was "The Insider." With Jamie Foxx, Jon Voight, Mario Van Peebles and Jeffrey Wright. Dec. 25.
'A BEAUTIFUL MIND': Russell Crowe as a math genius with schizophrenia and an active sex life.

Charlotte does it all in search of the R.A.F. pilot she loves but finds a handsome resistance leader (Billy Crudup) and his father (Michael Gambon) pretty fascinating too. They've changed the book's ending, which was, let's face it, a little too realistic. Dec. 28. A related article is on Page 3.

A World War II drama about two Czech pilots, close friends who join the British R.A.F. and fall in love with the same woman. Ondrej Vetchy, Krystof Hadek and Tara Fitzgerald star.

HEADLINE: HOLIDAY FILMS; 
Hollywood in Wartime: Lessons of Pearl Harbor

BYLINE:  By A. O. SCOTT 

 BODY:
ON Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. On Dec. 8, a Warner Brothers employee filed a report on a property called "Everybody Comes to Rick's," which the studio released in late November of the following year, drastically altered to reflect the demands of the time, as "Casablanca." Everybody knows the story of how Rick, a cynical nightclub owner whose credo is "I stick my neck out for nobody," rediscovers his essential nobility and sacrifices self-interest to the greater good. The basic story line would become a staple of wartime American cinema -- the film historian Thomas Schatz said it "signaled the wartime conversion of Hollywood's classical narrative paradigm" -- and would help make Humphrey Bogart one of the top movie stars of the era. In retrospect, "Casablanca" can also be seen as a metaphor for Hollywood's own heroic contribution to the war effort.
 Not that the film industry's response seemed especially heroic at the time. A year after Pearl Harbor, performing the critic's traditional holiday duty of compiling a list of the 10 best movies of the year, Bosley Crowther, The New York Times's chief reviewer, while approving of a number of films that dealt with the war (including "Casablanca"), argued that "by and large, the general quality of motion pictures this past year has reflected the confusion and uncertainty in Hollywood." 
 "Producers have plunged willy-nilly on purely 'escapist' pictures or have made the war out to seem illusory by dodging it into old routines," Crowther went on. "Stories have been, in most cases, disappointingly unoriginal and methods have been generally jejune. American films have slipped -- or just marked time -- this year."
A year later, on Christmas Day 1943, James Agee, writing in The Nation, wearily complained that "last year, it seems to me, was the all-time low -- so far." 
But in the decades since the war ended, such demurrals have faded, and the era is recalled as one of the proudest in American movie history. "In many ways," Mr. Schatz writes in "Boom and Bust," his authoritative chronicle of American cinema in the 1940's, "World War II was the best of times for the movie industry not because of its unprecedented economic prosperity, but because of its social and cinematic achievements." He goes on to quote a foreign correspondent for Look magazine, who wrote in 1944 that "there was a time when it was considered smart to be cynical about Hollywood. That was before the war."
The holiday film season as we now know it is an artifact of recent history. In the 40's, the studios were not in the habit of crowding all their A-list pictures into the five final weeks of the year. The speeded-up, concentrated release schedule that has become the norm over the past decade has made the panic sown by Sept. 11 especially dramatic, as the studios have pulled some big movies from release and rescheduled others in a desperate attempt to divine the public mood. People will certainly go to the movies this December, as they did in December of 1941, and perhaps in greater numbers than last year. The movies we will see are, for the most part, the ones we would have seen anyway, but the circumstances have changed suddenly, and in ways we have yet to understand. 
Of course, historical analogies are always dangerous, and looking back on the war that began 60 years ago on Dec. 7 may not be much help in facing the one that began on Sept. 11 of this year. Putting aside the obvious military and geopolitical differences, it seems unlikely that industry will undergo wholesale conversion to wartime production, or that a formal collaboration between the military and the movie studios, like the one overseen by the Office of War Information in the 40's, is in the works. Nor, for that matter, do the movies enjoy the monopoly on visual information that they did then: images of the current war now reach us instantaneously wherever we are, around the clock, rather than in the communal darkness of the cinema.
But some things, it seems, have changed little in more than half a century. Critics are still wont to complain about the state of the movies. And cynicism about Hollywood, which may have been thought smart in 1941, is something of a no-brainer nowadays. But movies remain the flagship of the popular culture, and as such they are able both to formulate and to reflect public perceptions of crisis, and also to help the public cope with its own confusion and uncertainty.
In theory, anyway. The hard question that is being faced by nervous studio executives at the present time is, how. In a time of national worry, do audiences want to be distracted from grim and upsetting realities? Do we want to be reassured and comforted, or do we need to face down our fears? Do we want morale-boosting propaganda or honest criticism? The easy answer, confirmed by a look back at the 10-best lists and box-office records of the 40's, is yes, all of the above.
As the war dragged on (and the box office surged, setting a record in each year of the conflict, only to break it the next), it occupied an ever greater share of Hollywood's attention. In addition to the home-front melodramas and sagas of combat, though, the studios continued to turn out westerns, knockabout comedies with Abbott and Costello and Hope and Crosby, musicals, and crime dramas. For the latter genres, the mid-40's were the beginning of a golden age -- the age of Technicolor song-and-dance extravaganzas and film noir shadow plays.
In 1942, what would become the dominant modes of wartime storytelling were represented by "Casablanca," "Mrs. Miniver" and "Wake Island": thrillers with reluctant heroes, inspiring tales of ordinary indomitability and fictionalized bulletins from the front. The combat pictures especially satisfied a dual and sometimes contradictory craving: for the truth about what American soldiers, sailors and pilots were facing overseas and for stirring, morale-boosting tales of home-grown heroism. The best combat dramas -- like John Ford's "They Were Expendable" and William Wellman's "Story of G.I. Joe" -- managed to satisfy both demands, as did combat documentaries by leading Hollywood directors like Ford's "Battle of Midway," John Huston's "Battle of San Pietro" and William Wyler's "Memphis Belle."
Among the legacies of wartime film production was the reciprocal influence of the documentary and fictional approaches. According to Mr. Schatz, "as documentarians like Ford, Wyler and Huston dramatized and humanized their wartime subjects, fictionalized accounts of combat developed a more pronounced documentary realism."
IF one of Hollywood's responses to war was a new openness to realism -- understood both as a technical possibility and as an ethical imperative -- another was a renewed commitment to the difficult task of escaping reality. One film on Crowther's 1942 10-best list was Preston Sturges's "Sullivan's Travels." Released six weeks after Pearl Harbor (and therefore substantially completed well before the attack), this spirited satire of high-minded (or, in the Sturges idiom, "deep dish") Hollywood may have struck audiences in 1943 as suddenly out of date, a holdover from the prewar world. The real-world concerns that preoccupy its hero, a successful director of risque comedies like "So Long, Sarong," "Hey Hey in the Hayloft" and "Ants in Your Pants of 1939," are those of the Depression. The glitter and insouciance of Hollywood give way, in the course of his travels, to a grim landscape of hobo camps and chain gangs. What Sullivan learns in his journey through the lower depths is that the downtrodden want only to laugh -- an epiphany that comes when he watches a Mickey Mouse cartoon in the company of a rural black congregation and a group of brutalized convicts. 
At the same time, though, "Sullivan's Travels" can be taken as a pre-emptive parodic strike at the noble intentions that would overtake Hollywood over the next three years, and also as a harbinger of Sturges's own wartime comedies. In 1944, he released "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" and "Hail the Conquering Hero," two home-front comedies that upend every convention of wartime Hollywood. In "Miracle," his heroine is a young woman (Betty Hutton) who, after a drunken one-night stand with a serviceman on his way overseas -- a tryst sanctified for the benefit of the censors by hasty vows of matrimony -- finds herself pregnant. "Hail the Conquering Hero" records the travails of a young man, played by Eddie Bracken, who is kept out of the service by chronic hay fever but who half-unwittingly deceives his hometown into treating him like a war hero.
Sturges, of course, was a kind of anti-Capra, perhaps the greatest cynic the American movie industry has yet produced. But his films of the 1940's show that in wartime, cynicism can, paradoxically, become a virtue, just as sentimentality can be a vice. "Hail the Conquering Hero" does not puncture the he-man mythology of the combat films so much as complement it, by reminding us that they also serve who only stand and sneeze. And "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek," in turning the iconography of the chaste, valiant hometown girl upside down, paints a picture of small-town Americans who are no less heroic for being completely ridiculous. 
The present appeal of movies made during World War II is obvious enough, and has been apparent in the "greatest generation" worship of the past few years. It is tempting to view the 1940's as a less ambiguous, simpler time, in which the moral choices were clearer and the cultural responses to them emphatically and intuitively appropriate. The reality at the time, of course, was more complicated, but the glory of wartime Hollywood nonetheless exerts a powerful nostalgic pull.
Nostalgia, though comforting, is not the best way to learn from history. Hollywood should look back on its finest hour not in the hope of repeating itself and turning out a new crop of stirring combat epics, film noirs or uplifting domestic dramas. It has done enough of that already. But perhaps this is a time for the film industry to stick its neck out a bit, to risk discovering new forms of realism and new modes of escape.

To the Editor: 
 Anthony Tommasini writes that "recording costs, especially for symphonic and operatic fare, have skyrocketed." This is not true for the single largest component of recording costs in the United States and Canada: wage payments to orchestra musicians. Since 1977, the wages set by the relevant collective bargaining agreement between the American Federation of Musicians and the major record companies have remained virtually constant when adjusted for inflation.

HEADLINE: Affairs of the Horse: 2 Centuries of Images 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER WEST DAVIS 

DATELINE: KATONAH 

 BODY:
WHAT does it mean to be an American? 
 Ask a horse. 
 So the new show, "Horse Tales: American Images and Icons 1800-2000," at the Katonah Museum of Art here argues.
Every culture has come up with its own take on the horse. Show what you've done with this common denominator, and you'll reveal who you are. 
"Everybody has a horse story," said the exhibition's co-curator, Ezra Shales. "Their first ride, the first time they were thrown, the reason they don't ride. They are all vivid memories and very powerful to listen to."
Mr. Shales and his co-curator, Dr. Susan H. Edwards, assembled two centuries of horse imagery (memorabilia, memento, art, craft, video, photograph, illustration, packaging), sorted them by theme rather than time line and compressed them into the 2,500 square feet of display space (a limitation that Mr. Shales says forces you "to be concise and specific"). 
For starters, horses evolved in North America, went "extinct" here, vanishing West over the land bridge to Asia, and, after a 7,600-year hiatus, reappeared courtesy of the Conquistadors.
They have missed out on little history since. They powered farms, pioneering, ranching, soldiering. Without Shoshone horses, Lewis and Clark would have gone home early (or not at all), cowboys would have looked for other careers, and picture Paul Revere running through the streets at midnight trying to rouse his neighbors to war on foot. 
The 1885 Sioux watercolor "General Custer Fighting Sitting Bull," the Frederic Remington bronze "The Bronco Buster" (1918) and George Catlin's "Wild Horses at Play" (1842) are all clear reminders of how the West was really won astride.
Changing into an industrial society did not chase the horse off. Today about 6.9 million horses are in the United States and 7.1 million people are involved in an equine industry that, according to the American Horse Council, has a $112.1 billion impact on the gross domestic product.
Still, several haunting images lament the beasts that have been discarded.
The exhibition's poster child, "The Wreck of the Ole 97" by Thomas Hart Benton, seems to stylize all the myths and misgivings of progress through technology with a rearing white horse spooked by the sight of a train, an innocent young girl who is thrown from the carriage as a result. 
There are no more forlorn-looking creatures than the four steaming nags pulling the No. 15 Harlem trolley through the snow and slush of Manhattan in Alfred Stieglitz's 1892 photo "The Terminal." For them, it is the end of the line.
Saddest of all is "Untitled (Turned Him Out to Die)," a 1939 crayon on cardboard work by Bill Traylor, a former slave who who took up art at the age of 80. 
Even after horses themselves had been hobbled, humbled and made redundant by machines, their symbol nevertheless remained. The horse, as Dr. Edwards put it, has been "co-opted to suggest power, speed, reliability, status, ruggedness, sexuality and wildness." 
Horses have also not avoided shouldering the baggage of modern psychology. Some themes are inescapable whenever anyone tries to explain the spell horses cast on everyone: male versus female, and the phenomenon of young girls and horses. "The psychic and symbolic functions of the horse might be very different for the two sexes," said one artist, Deborah Bright.
Might be? Judging from the evidence presented here, male artists think horses should be pulling plows, roping cattle, playing polo or leading a charge. In contrast, female artists tend to prefer their horses idyllic, unfettered and anthropomorphized to the point they seem ready to discuss the weather.
Reclaiming the form from the male context is one of Deborah Butterfield's missions. Her "Untitled (2040.1)" depicts a grazing horse made from pliable, frail intertwined branches, vines and twigs -- it is astonishingly all bronze. 
As far as the young-girls-and-horses issue goes, a 4-by-7-foot photograph by Janet Biggs, called "Celeste in Her Bedroom," gives a good idea of the subject's complexity. In a separate screening room in a corner of the gallery two looping videos explore how the jolting, repetitive motion of riding a horse can make a girl have trouble controlling her body. But as the essay in the catalog says, ours is "a society still invested in the romantic myth of childhood innocence."
The real myth and magic here comes when you just let the horses tell their own stories. The spooked, rearing stallion in John Steuart Curry's "Belgian Stallions," painted in 1938 -- why is he looking eastward with such apprehension and alarm? 
Look closely at Kazuhiko Sano's acrylic of Secretariat, the painting that was made into a 33-cent stamp, and look deep into those enormous dark eyes and kick yourself for never putting some money on that horse.
Horses have the largest eyes in nature, a trait that no doubt makes a lot of people self-conscious and nervous around them (remember "Equus"?). It also makes them excellent witnesses. If only they could talk. Spend an hour or two at the Katonah Museum and you'll start to think they can.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Rutherford; 
A Patriotic Town With an Easy Commute

BYLINE:  By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
A GRANITE pillar capped by a flame-shaped light and carved with the words "To Rutherford's Glorious Dead" looms over the intersection of Park and Passaic Avenues, in front of the Rutherford borough hall. The monument to World War I fallen is one of a half dozen war memorials near the two-story 1901 brick structure.
 At the point of wedge-shaped Lincoln Park, 30 yards south of the pillar, a cannon points down Park Avenue, the early 20th century business district. Freshly painted red, white and blue shields bolted to its sides honor those who fought in the Civil and Spanish American Wars. Also in the park are monuments to those who died in World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam and the 1898 sinking of the battleship Maine in Havana harbor. And throughout the town, a majority of houses display American flags. 
 "We've always been a patriotic town," said Mayor Bernadette McPherson. "Even before the events of Sept. 11, it was not uncommon to see flags flying. It may have seemed corny in other places, but not here. We live by the principles behind the flag. 
"There has never been a report of a bias crime in the town. On Sept. 11, I had many calls from residents who wanted to donate blood. More policemen volunteered to go to ground zero than we could possibly send. Although our fire department is volunteer, many of these people left their jobs to stand by in case they were needed."
As its war memorials imply, Rutherford is an old town, first settled in 1687 by Waling Jacob Van Winkle, a Dutchman from New Amsterdam. It calls itself the City of Trees and lives up to its name, with more than 6,000 two-foot-thick oaks, sycamores and maples arching over Rutherford's residential streets. 
At the intersection of New Jersey Routes 3 and 17, three miles from Exit 16W of the New Jersey Turnpike, four miles from the heart of the Meadowlands sports complex and seven miles from the Lincoln Tunnel, Rutherford has less than half-hour connections to Manhattan by bus or rail.
It is one of five New Jersey municipalities designated as "transit villages" by former Gov. Christie Whitman, qualifying it for priority status for state and federal aid for infrastructure improvements. Recently, New Jersey Transit and the New Jersey Department of Transportation financed two studies on possible downtown redevelopment, which the borough administrator, Robert A. Gorman, estimates cost well over $100,000. 
Most of Rutherford's single-family housing stock is at least 50 years old and is concentrated on 40 percent of the 2.6-square-mile borough. The remainder includes a capped landfill, slated for redevelopment as a golf course, and a commercial zone with several office buildings and two hotels -- the 127-room Extended Stay America and the 163-room Marriott Renaissance.
Peter S. Van Winkle, a descendant of the town's first settler and the owner of the 135-year-old A. W. Van Winkle & Company real estate office on Orient Way, estimates that nearly 20 percent of the houses are post-World War II Cape Cods near the Passaic River, which forms the western border. The other homes are primarily 50- to 100-year-old colonials, spread throughout the town, and 19th-century Victorians concentrated on Ridge Road and its surrounding streets near the commercial center. 
In mid-October, 19 houses were listed for sale on the Multiple Listing Service. The asking prices ranged from $169,900 for a pre-World War II two-bedroom colonial on Meadow Road near Route 17 to $550,000 for a seven-bedroom, four-bath center hall colonial of a similar age on West Pierrepont Avenue on the western side of town. 
Several garden apartment complexes have been converted to co-op or condominium ownership. The largest co-op complex is the 370-unit Hastings Village on Hastings Avenue. According to Glenn D. Elliot, a broker at the ERA Justin Realty Company, studio apartments in Hastings Village go for $30,000 to $35,000, one-bedrooms for $50,000 to $55,000 and two-bedroom units for $65,000 to $70,000.
The largest condominium complex is the 136-unit Rutherford Manor, where a one-bedroom unit recently sold for $96,000 and a two-bedroom went for $125,000. There are also town-house-style condominiums in complexes like the 20-unit River Oaks Villas on Donaldson Avenue near the Passaic River, where a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath unit recently went for $225,000.
Rutherford has more than 1,000 rental apartments, 890 of which come under a local rent control ordinance that applies to buildings or complexes of four or more units. The largest rental complexes are the 115-unit Union Bridge Apartments and the 109-unit Willow Gardens, both on Union Avenue, which stretches for one mile from Station Square to the Passaic River. According to Violet Rycroft, the borough rent control officer, rents throughout the town range from about $600 for smaller studio apartments to $1,700 for some larger three-bedroom apartments.
AMONG the town's newer residents are Charles E. Cornelis; his wife, Sharon Breslau; and their two children, ages 2 and 4. They moved from West Hartford, Conn., to a three-bedroom 1930's colonial on Wood Street five months ago to be closer to Mr. Cornelis's job as a graphic designer in Manhattan. "We are a seven-minute walk to the train station," he explained. "We liked the tree-lined streets, the old-style architecture and the fact that we can get into Manhattan easily for recreation."
Another attraction for the Cornelis family was the Williams Center for the Arts, named for the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet William Carlos Williams, who lived in Rutherford. Located in Williams Park near the train station, the center has three movie theaters and two theatrical performance halls. Upcoming performances are "Noah's Ark" at 1 P.M. on Nov. 17 and four performances of "Annie" on Nov. 17 and 18. 
Both Mr. Elliot and Mr. Van Winkle term the local real estate market as "very hot," with many properties selling within days of being listed. According to Mr. Van Winkle, prices have climbed about 12 percent in the past year. They expect the market to grow even hotter next fall, when New Jersey Transit's Secaucus Transfer Station is opened; the project will shave nearly 10 minutes off the trip to or from Manhattan by allowing train passengers to travel directly from Rutherford into Pennsylvania Station, rather than switching to the PATH train in Hoboken. 
"I would not be surprised if we saw a further 15 percent appreciation in housing prices because of the improved commute," Mr. Van Winkle said.
The borough's street pattern -- with Park Avenue slicing diagonally through a grid -- was laid out in 1866 by Daniel Van Winkle, Peter's great-great-grandfather, when he donated a tract of land to the Erie Railroad Company for the construction of the first train station.
A later station, built on the same plot of land in 1898 and restored by New Jersey Transit, stretches for three blocks across Station Square at the foot of Park Avenue, anchoring the downtown. With "Erie Railroad" chiseled into its stone lintel, the station, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is the core of an ongoing downtown redevelopment effort. The borough is replacing cracked sidewalks with brick pavers, installing Victorian-style street lamps and giving financial incentives to business owners who upgrade their tired, sooty, turn-of-the-century storefronts. The mix of stores in the downtown includes numerous nail salons, a few clothing shops, a western wear store and Fun-Ghoul, a large supplier of theatrical costumes.
Rutherford's numerous restaurants, including Mignon (steakhouse), Paisano's (Italian), Cafe Mattise (French) and Trattoria Corrado (Italian) on Station Square, are "dry" because of a local ordinance that prohibits the serving of alcoholic beverages at commercial establishments. The closest major mall is the Garden State Plaza in Paramus, seven miles to the northwest.
The largest new development is the recently completed five-story Boiling Springs Savings Bank headquarters on Orient Way, a stone's throw from the station. The bank has also started foundation work for a 500-space parking garage, a 48-unit apartment building and a second office building.
Among Rutherford's attractions is its 2,350-pupil public school system, consisting of three K-5 schools, two K-8 schools and the 710-student Rutherford High School. Although all of the school buildings were built between 1913 and 1927, they are well maintained. Class sizes range from 18 and 22, compared with a statewide average of 21.4.
The superintendent of schools, Leslie A. Conlon, said all classrooms in the district have at least one computer, with computer instruction starting in kindergarten. Foreign language instruction is introduced in second grade and instrumental music in fourth grade.
On College Board tests, last year's graduating class scored a combined verbal and mathematics average of 1,032, compared with a state average of 1,012. Of the 153 graduates, 72 percent went on to four-year colleges and 16 percent to two-year institutions.
LAST year, Rutherford High School won the coveted United States Department of Education Blue Ribbon School of Excellence award. "We were recognized for our overall focus on technology," Ms. Conlon explained.
Every room in the high school is wired for Internet access, compared with a state average of 74 percent. There is one computer for every 2.9 students, compared with one for every 4.8 students statewide.
In addition, Rutherford High has its own television studio and offers special courses from Cisco Academy, a course of study intended to prepare students for jobs at the networking giant Cisco Systems. Rutherford High offers seven advanced placement courses in English, foreign languages, history, biology, computer science and art. It also offers college-level courses in cooperation with Fairleigh Dickinson University in nearby Teaneck.
Other schools in the borough include St. Mary's School, a K-12 coeducational Roman Catholic school, and one of the two campuses of Felician College, a coed four-year Roman Catholic institution with 1,600 students.
The largest park in Rutherford is the 30-acre Memorial Park off Union Avenue along the Passaic River. It has three baseball diamonds and four softball diamonds, a Little League field, a football stadium, five tennis courts, two basketball courts and three playgrounds, one of which, Katie's Corner, was recently refurbished through contributions in memory of a local girl who died in a fire. 
Another important recreational facility is the Nereid Boat Club off Riverside Avenue along the Passaic. Established in 1875 in Nutley, N.J., the club relocated to a town-owned building in Rutherford five years ago and restored the dilapidated structure. Rutherford residents can join the rowing club for $75 annually. Nonresidents pay $450 a year.

HEADLINE: Suffolk Is at Odds Over Tobacco Money 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
A PROPOSAL by Robert J. Gaffney, the Suffolk County executive, to sell the rights to the county's share of the national tobacco settlement -- using the money to pay off debt, hold down property taxes and stave off a $37.7 million budget shortfall next year -- is facing opposition from county legislators who say it all sounds too much like a Nassau County-style scheme.
 Mr. Gaffney, a Republican who has curried a reputation as a fiscal conservative, and Kenneth Weiss, his budget director, contend that the plan is financially sound and merely duplicates what municipalities across the state and country have already done. And, they add, it would shift the risks and uncertainties about future tobacco payments from the county to private investors. 
 Detractors point to an analysis by the County Legislature's Budget Review Office, which says that benefits would be quick but temporary and long-term costs would be high. 
That analysis shows that under Mr. Gaffney's proposal the county would reduce debt by $354 million from 2002 to 2030, the plan's time span. But that amount would be $234 million less than the $588 million in tobacco revenues the county would otherwise receive.
The Gaffney plan is structured so that greatest benefits would come in the period from 2002 to 2009. But after that time, according to the analysis, the plan would become progressively more expensive.
Since 1999, New York City, Nassau County and more than half of all other counties in the state have sold the rights to their tobacco revenues, a process called securitization. Nationally, more than $6.5 billion in securitization bonds have already been marketed, principally to institutional investors, and most experts say conditions are ripe for more.
Under the Suffolk plan, a variation of those used elsewhere, Mr. Gaffney would establish a corporation to sell bonds to private investors. The bonds would be backed by the tobacco settlement revenues, which would go directly to the corporation.
The county would use the money to reduce long-term debt, indirectly freeing money for other purposes.
The tobacco revenues come from a settlement reached in November 1998 between 46 states and the major tobacco companies. The companies agreed to make long-term payments to the governments, and in return, the states agreed not to sue the companies for smoking-related injuries. In New York, settlement payments to counties are pegged to Medicaid costs; next year, Suffolk's share is projected at $23.7 million.
In Suffolk the more immediate problem is making up for the shortfall that is expected in sales-tax receipts, the backbone of county budgets. Mr. Weiss put the shortfall at $37.7 million in the county's proposed $1.2 billion budget for 2002 after the figures were revised following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
He said the lower estimate on sales taxes and the fact that the proposed budget already called for an increase in property taxes of nearly 9 percent led county officials to turn to securitization. Securitization had been under consideration for future budgets, he said, but was moved to the forefront after Sept. 11.
But the proposal has not been well received by some legislators. Under the proposal, the County Legislature would be asked to approve a local law creating the corporation to sell the bonds. It will also get to approve the proposed budget.
The chairman of the Legislature's finance committee, Michael Caracciolo, a Republican from Wading River, said the short-term benefits of securitization were far outweighed by its high long-term costs.
"This is clearly the path we do not want to go down," said Mr. Caracciolo, who added that the Legislature should look for other ways to fill the budget gap. "We must avoid at all costs the type of financial gimmickry that was exercised in Nassau County and resulted in that county's having junk-bond status."
Mr. Weiss, the budget director, said that such a comparison was mistaken. He said the Gaffney administration had waited to see how securitization worked in other counties and states and was now convinced that it was a sound practice.
"Tobacco securitization is not some new invention," he said. "It's nothing that Suffolk County has decided to undertake on its own. It isn't experimental." 
Frederick Pollert, director of the County Legislature's Budget Review Office, said the approach still had major drawbacks for Suffolk.
"What really happens is that we borrow against the future revenue stream, and we accelerate the revenues for the time period from 2002 to 2009 so there is a net budget saving over that time," he said. "But then on the back end, it is costing us money in all those years that follow."
Mr. Pollert said the interest on the bonds, which would be about 5.5 percent, made tobacco securitization "an extraordinarily expensive source of capital." If the county simply issued short-term notes, the interest rate would be about 2 percent, he said.
Mr. Pollert has advised the legislators that another method for closing the projected $37.7 million shortfall would be to rescind the county's sales-tax exemption on clothing and footwear costing less than $110.
The exemption, which was approved by the Legislature and put into effect in March 2000, resulted in a revenue loss of $29 million that year and $24.7 million for the first half of this year. 
But the exemption has been popular with retailers and shoppers, and legislators may balk at rescinding it. "That I would totally reject," Mr. Caracciolo said. 
Mr. Weiss said securitization would help the county meet sharply rising social-service costs attributed to the weakening economy. Dennis J. Nowak, a spokesman for the county Department of Social Services, confirmed that costs and caseloads were up for Medicaid, foster care and the homeless. 
The number of families in emergency housing has risen from 249 in 1999 to 474 last week, Mr. Nowak said, topping a previous peak in 1994. Projected costs for 2002 are $29.2 million, nearly twice this year's total. He attributed rising homelessness to a shortage of affordable housing; rent for a two-bedroom apartment is currently about $1,200 a month.
Mr. Weiss said the county also faced increased police and emergency-service costs after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
Supporters of securitization say its greatest benefit may be that it protects governments against the risks of tobacco company bankruptcies or legal challenges to the settlement plan that could reduce revenues in the future.
In 1999, a number of New York cities and counties issued settlement-backed bonds: New York City, $709.3 million; Nassau, $294.5 million; and Westchester, $103.5 million. Several New York counties, operating a pool to cut administrative and underwriting costs, issued similar bonds for $117.1 million last December, and in March, the State of South Carolina issued bonds for $934.5 million. New York State has not yet taken the step.
In Nassau, proceeds from securitization were consumed in one budget year, in contrast to the Suffolk plan, which would stretch out the benefits.
Robert R. Gregory, executive director of the New York State Association of Counties, said he expected more counties to use securitization.
"The basic question is, do they want to continue with the inherent risks involved in the master settlement agreement or get out from under that liability?" he said. "Everyone on the market side will tell you the market has a certain appetite for these kinds of bonds."
Mr. Caracciolo said last week that he did not expect the Suffolk Legislature to approve the Gaffney plan. "I believe we pretty much put the nail in the coffin on that -- at least I hope so," he said. "Now we have to look for alternatives."
The county has until Nov. 20 to adopt a budget, with or without securitization.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Changes at the Top?; 
Unaccustomed Vulnerability in the Luxury Market

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
DURING the two weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, the suburban real estate market around Manhattan ground to a halt. "We were numb" is a phrase heard repeatedly. Since then the lower and middle range markets have returned to some semblance of normalcy, but the top of the luxury market, traditionally impervious to economic conditions, has begun to show unaccustomed vulnerability. 
 Now, in the aftermath of a cataclysmic event landing on the back of a faltering economy, brokers in the elite communities where a preponderance of financial and corporate executives choose to live are concerned about the impact on that rich source of clients. 
 Of all such areas, Fairfield County appears to be most susceptible to a downturn because of the quantum leap in the numbers and prices of trophy homes built there in the 90's, compared with the older established suburbs of Long Island, Westchester and New Jersey. 
In Greenwich, the most resilient of wealthy communities because of a substantial number of very high priced homes, Linda Hodge, vice president of Preferred Properties, a Greenwich-based company that specializes in estates that can exceed $25 million, said demand seems to have decreased but has not totally dried up. 
"I've shown an $8.5 million house three times," she said in a telephone interview conducted while "I'm sitting in a $10.5 million house waiting for my customer to show up."
"Activity is there," she said, "but it's an unnatural world, and it remains to be seen how consumer confidence shapes up over the next selling season. Customers are looking for some relief in prices, but it's too soon to evaluate." 
For years she has watched as high-end sellers spurned requests for concessions. "The inherent value of the property is something they are not willing to forgo," she said. "They can just wait. So the high end is insulated to some extent, but the ripple effect is there."
Assessing where the current market stands and what lies ahead, Nicholas S. Perna, former chief economist at Fleet Financial Group, currently head of Perna Associates, an economic consulting firm in Ridgefield, and a member of the economics faculty at Yale, said: "Apart from Sept. 11 there were forces already at work that were going to take the wind out of the sails of high-end homes.
"Corporate profits have declined deeper than they have in 50 years, so a lot of those year-end bonuses that many of these people leverage to live on are not going to be there. To me it's inevitable that the economy and Sept. 11, which aggravated those economic forces, will act as a depressant on the sale of high-end real estate."
While activity is normally a bit slower this time of year, Joan Gallagher, manager of the Preferred Properties office in Darien, said: "In all honesty, Sept. 11 has affected everyone and everything. We still have sales, but there isn't much confidence. There's hesitation that's affecting the high end, and even though interest rates are low, people dealing with the big numbers are unsure." In the $2 million to $10 million market segment, " there have been reductions in prices, but no great bargains," she said. "Houses are staying on the market longer because people feel prices will go down further."
"We are turning from a seller's to a buyer's market," she said.
According to Marcia Charles, a broker in the company's New Canaan office, where upper end homes sell for $2.5 million to $5 million, "our job market is more diversified -- people work at UBS Warburg and GE Capital here in Fairfield County, so I think Darien and Greenwich may be seeing a bigger impact." The difference in population makeup is attributable in part to Wall Street commuters, who may prefer coastline communities like Greenwich and Darien, where they do not have to change trains at Stamford, as New Canaan commuters do. 
BUT, Ms. Charles said: "I have to say that new construction between $2 million and $5 million has been slow. We have had about 16 new homes on the market for several months, and we have seen reductions in houses that have been on for a while. I think builders who don't get their price for new construction will wait until the spring market."
One former New Yorker who owns a financial services company with offices in the Mercantile Exchange Building, a block from the World Trade Center site, is moving his family and his business to Greenwich. His offices were damaged, "but we were cushioned by the American Express building, and we went back to work the following Monday," said the executive, who talked on the condition that his company not be identified. Last May he made a down payment of more than $3 million on a 14,000-square-foot house now under construction on three acres in Greenwich, where he and his family have been renting. The house will be ready for occupancy in January. 
"It's a big purchase," he said. "I can't back out, and I'm frightened of where the market is going." Recalling a market downturn that followed the stock market plunge 14 years ago, he said: "Back in '87, real estate didn't start coming down until '89. I expect it to happen again. The bubble hasn't burst yet because everyone thinks their houses will go on being worth $ X million." 
Soon he will move his offices to Greenwich or a nearby town. "I've had enough of downtown and commuting," he said. "Some of my colleagues had meetings in the World Trade Center that day and didn't make it. Going down there every day reminds you of the death and destruction. It's kind of a sad place to work."
But there have not been enough corporate relocations yet to produce a flood of house shoppers. James Fieber, head of the Fieber Group, developers of upscale housing in Connecticut and Texas, said, "Traffic has slowed considerably, but we are getting more bona fide buyers at our New Canaan, Greenwich and Orange sites."
In other areas reactions are somewhat more positive. Homes for sale in Rye, N.Y., priced up to $6.4 million from before the terrorist attack, "don't fly off the market," said Martha Bentley, manager of the real estate firm Merritt Associates, "but an initial slack-off following Sept. 11 seems to have ended. Four homes priced over $1 million and one at $3 million sold almost immediately."
In Scarsdale, Lynne Clark, vice president of Julia B. Fee Real Estate, said: "Three houses are on the market at $5 million, and 11 houses, started on spec before Sept. 11, are still under construction, priced over $1 million. We haven't had a stampede, but I feel our market is quite stable."
ON Long Island, Joan Nahles, manager of Daniel Gale Real Estate in Manhasset, said: "This is a big Wall Street town, hit very hard with at least 40 deaths out of a population of 25,000. Certainly, one or two buyers wanted to wait, but sales of $900,000 and up are strong. We've seen some reduction in price, but we still have buyers anxious to get what they want and willing to pay for it.
"Property remains constant," she continued, "unlike the stock market. Sellers have doubled and tripled their money."
David Lurie, head of Lurie Real Estate in Great Neck Estates on Long Island, said: "A large number of wealthy Iranian families are in the area, where homes are priced from half a million to around $2.2 million. Prices are holding up, but we are not getting the calls we used to get for high-end houses, so I assume that in the near future prices will start to fall."
In Basking Ridge, a village within Bernards Township, N.J., Elsa Lisciandro, manager of the Weichert Real Estate office said: "The village lost 11 people. You could not call your clients. It didn't seem appropriate. Then, all of a sudden they started calling us. Some people are relocating out of New York and some are local upgrades. I've been in the business for 25 years, and I'd say we're going into a normal market."
But while Maggie Schimts, manager of Bergdorf ERA in Bernards Township, finds that interest in million dollar houses is coupled with a reluctance to buy. "It's more difficult to get them into a contract," she said. "There is the uncertainty about jobs and bonuses."
A Bernards Township developer, Bruce Bocina, lost three customers who worked for Cantor Fitzgerald at the World Trade Center and had binders on million dollar homes. "A lot of people in this area work in Lower Manhattan," he said. "There is a tremendous residual effect. Obviously, it has affected our business, although now there are other people looking from Manhattan, and local people who are upgrading."
He continues to complete sales of houses priced from $750,000 to $3 million. "Some have been sold; some will come on the market in December," he said. "We hope customers will be buying."
Mr. Perna, the economist, said, "The good news is that unlike 10 years ago, when the recession in the Northeast was far worse than in the rest of the country and prices fell precipitously, there is no reason for our recession to be appreciably worse than it is anywhere else."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 11, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the luxury home market described train service from New Canaan incompletely. Not all Metro-North commuters to New York have to change at Stamford; several trains a day in each direction are direct. A picture caption with the article misstated the price and ownership of a new house in Greenwich. It was built for its owner at a price of $8 million; it is not on the market for more than $7 million.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Retail Leasing; 
At a Rockefeller Store, It's All Pokemon, All the Time

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
BUGS BUNNY is leaving town and Mickey Mouse has retreated from Times Square. But that's O.K.; Pikachu is moving into Rockefeller Center.
 The American branch of the Pokemon Company of Japan, which manages the rights to Pokemon cartoons, games and collectible figures, is expecting to open its first retail outlet later this month at 10 Rockefeller Plaza, on 48th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas. The 17,000-square-foot store will have two retail levels and extensive interactive displays intended to appeal to children who watch the animated cartoons on television and play the games on specialized display toys. 
 Even though the Pokemon phenomenon has lost some momentum in the United States, company executives still see a viable market for the toys and games. The worldwide business had revenue of $4.3 billion in the most recent year, and the cartoons are broadcast in 65 countries in 30 different languages. The store is scheduled to open on Nov. 16. 
The move into New York by Pokemon comes at a time when stores operated by entertainment companies, like Warner Brothers and Disney, have faded in appeal. Warner Brothers, which sold souvenirs and clothing emblazoned with images of Bugs Bunny, Tweety Bird and other cartoon characters, closed its flagship store at 57th Street and Fifth Avenue last year and closed the smaller one in Times Square last month.
Disney's store in Times Square, which sold similar merchandise with depictions of Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and cartoon characters from its library of films, was displaced by new construction last year, and real estate executives report that sales have softened at its Fifth Avenue store.
Nevertheless, some brokers who specialize in retail space say the Pokemon store could buck this trend because it is new to the city and is in a place that attracts both local traffic and international travelers. Indeed, some think it can provide a place where parents can take their children and escape for a little while from the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center.
"Warner Brothers got tired and worn," said Alan Victor, an executive vice president of the Lansco Corporation, a brokerage company that represents retailers. "They didn't make the movies to back up the stores. There was no reason for people to go back to the stores." He added that Disney's stores appeared to be having a similar problem.
He said the Pokemon Center, as it is officially called, would be opening in a soft retail environment caused by the slowing national economy and the reduced numbers of tourists, as people have cut back on travel since Sept. 11.
Nevertheless, he said, Rockefeller Center is one of the best known landmarks in the world, with NBC's "Today" show broadcasting from there and with holiday season events set to open soon. "NBC brings a lot of traffic, and who knows how many people will go there to see the Christmas tree and the show at Radio City Music Hall," he said. "If they can keep their merchandise fresh, they could do well."
Pokemon's timing is just about right, said Faith H. Consolo, vice chairwoman of Garrick-Aug Associates, another broker specializing in retail space. "Warner Brothers and Disney were about things, T-shirts and teddy bears," she said. "Pokemon is more about entertainment. It is a fantasy store that is almost like going to the movies."
Sales of game-oriented electronic goods have increased since the attacks, Ms. Consolo said, indicating that people are seeking fantasy and an escape from reality. The Pokemon store, she said, "will be like visiting an old-time arcade."
Executives of Pokemon USA and their store designers are emphasizing entertainment and tie-ins with existing cartoons, games and figures. The store will be the only one in the United States devoted entirely to Pokemon products, and 40 percent of the merchandise will be available only at the store, the executives said. There are two similar stores in Japan.
Writers and cartoonists for Pokemon -- the word is a Japanese contraction of "pocket monster" -- are constantly inventing characters to use in the cartoons and games and to provide new objects for parents to buy. According to David Hillenbrand, general manager of Pokemon USA, there are 251 Pokemon characters, up from 151 a year ago. Pikachu, by the way, is the favorite creature of Ash Ketchum, the lead character in the series.
Because Rockefeller Center is a designated landmark, the store's design had to work within a tight set of rules imposed by the Landmarks Preservation Commission and the complex's manager, Tishman Speyer Properties. For instance, the store could not have any exterior signs.
"This is a 1937 Art Deco masterpiece, and we have gone back to the original drawings and articles about it to get the details right," said Alec Zaballero, an associate at the Phillips Group, the architects for the renovation of the store space, which was most recently a microbrewery.
Fortunately, the building, which is just south of where the "Today" show is broadcast, is encased on two sides with glass. Mr. Zaballero said the glass in the top-level panels appeared to be part of the original facade. Having the glass walls reduces the need for signs because the brightly lit interior is ample advertising for passers-by.
The new doors to the store are brass, in keeping with Rockefeller Center tradition, and the door pulls duplicate the pattern of the originals, Mr. Zaballero said. "We have had to blend a 21st-century store into a 1937 building," he said.
Pokemon is renting the ground floor, a mezzanine and a lower level, which will be used for storage. The two retail floors will be connected by a glass-enclosed elevator in addition to a staircase. Real estate executives said first-floor space in Rockefeller Center rented for about $250 a square foot, with mezzanine space costing about half that and the lower level about $50 a square foot.
The upper floor will be equipped with three domes, each illuminated by light-emitting diodes capable of generating millions of different shades of color. There will be a sound and light show every hour that will feature a large Poke ball -- in the cartoon, children are supposed to carry their creatures in hand-held Poke balls. The suspended ball will spin and then split open, emitting smoke and laser light.
I T is going to be a choreographic experience," Mr. Zaballero said. "The kids will see an animated cartoon come to life; it won't just be on television anymore."
Because children are the main audience, Mr. Zaballero said Phillips Group designers scaled the store for the short of stature. "We've spent a lot of time looking at things from the three- to four-foot level," he said. "The equipment is designed for kids' comfort."
That equipment includes an interactive device called the Ultra Pokedex, which contains the database of the Pokemon world. Included are statistics about the various characters and video clips of them in action that can be called up using a touch screen. Children can also test new games before deciding whether to buy them.
The space will also be furnished by replicas of Pokemon characters, sized as they are in the Pokemon world, from a foot-tall Pichu to a Charizard that is six feet tall. The characters will move and act as they do in the cartoons, games and videos. Over all, Pokemon executives said, only about 20 percent of the space in the store will be dedicated to retail sales.
The basic strategy is to make the store a continuing and often changing show, Mr. Hillenbrand said. "The lights are visible from Fifth Avenue, and they will tend to draw people inside," he said. "We want to create an event, not just a one-time shopping experience. We want people to have a reason to come back."

HEADLINE: York, Me., Tackles Commercial Demand 

BYLINE:  By DAVID J. WALLACE

DATELINE: YORK, Me. 

 BODY:
Year-round residents of bucolic New England towns have a well-founded fear that vacation homes and weekend visitors will slowly change their local economy and culture. They worry that restaurants will force out supermarkets and antiques dealers will displace hardware stores or other shops that offer staple items.
 The citizens of this historic seaside town have voted three times since 1999 to limit residential construction, but the area's commercial growth has presented another challenge. Some activists have called for replacing stores with homes. Office and industrial space is limited, concentrated along Route 1 -- the two-lane primary north-south artery -- and has spawned traffic congestion that lasts even after summer tourists go home. 
 Demand for commercial space, some of it from residents who want to open businesses in their homes or nearby, poses an unusual urban planning problem in this town of 14,000 about 15 miles north of the New Hampshire border. Much of the town sits atop wetlands and some longtime residents worry about how development will coexist with rocky beaches, beautiful creeks and the 17th-century York Village. 
York's five-person planning department has been overmatched, leading to stacks of blueprints at Town Hall awaiting even the most rudimentary review. Delays have stretched as long as two years for developers to get approval from neighbors and regulatory agencies, arrange financing and start construction.
One of the town's largest new corporate offices, however, got public support instead of opposition. When a large chain hotel was proposed for a prominent piece of state-owned land several years ago, the town intervened to support Stonewall Kitchen, an upscale food purveyor that was scouting for a new headquarters in the area. In April 2000, the company, which had its start at nearby farmer's markets, opened a headquarters, outlet store and production complex that draws thousands of tourists each year.
Jonathan King and Jim Stott, Stonewall's owners, have based the company in York since 1995 and in neighboring Kittery, Me., before that. The headquarters store is expected to have sales of $3 million this year, Mr. King said, and the number of visitors has surpassed expectations.
Instead of a hotel tower, a farmhouse-style structure lavishly surrounded with flowers and birch trees now sits at York's gateway intersection of Route 1 and an off-ramp from Interstate 95. Visitors relax in Adirondack chairs under pergolas out of sight of passing cars, and plans have been approved for a 70-seat cafe.
"We wanted to build a brand, not just a new plant," Mr. Stott said. "It was important to us to make this a showplace." He pointed out such details as a pressed tin ceiling and sliding barn doors that separate the test kitchen from a conference room.
Stonewall invested nearly $8 million in the 55,000-square-foot faux farmhouse with rooflines of varying heights. Distinctive features inside and out increased the price by about $1 million over the original budget. The town offered a $3.5 million industrial revenue bond at a 3.5 percent interest rate to help the project as well as a $400,000 grant, with the balance coming from the company's founders and investors.
Other start-up companies have found a shortage of commercial space, said Steve Burns, the town planner. Demand for commercial space, he said, is slower and steadier than for residential and more fluid as merchants enter and leave the area. The town's commercial users are storage facilities and light industrial tenants, like woodworking shops. No study has addressed the town's maximum commercial capacity. 
On the residential side, more than 1,000 new housing units have been built since 1990 and requests for 130 new housing units per year have made this Maine's second-fastest growing town. "The sentiment here is antigrowth," Mr. Burns said, "but you can't stop it. It's a fundamental fairness issue for people who own property and we've never had an external control like the limits of a water, sewer or school system." 
Mr. Burns estimates that the town's population of 14,000 doubles when overnight guests are included in the summer peak season and may actually triple when daily visitors are counted. Only a 90-minute drive north from Boston, the town attracts home buyers who work in the suburban Route 128 technology corridor.
Empty-nest retirees are a large constituency in York, but they compete for home sites with a growing number of entrepreneurs who run businesses from home.
Andrew Siegel and his brother, Ron, own the When Pigs Fly Bakery, a bread maker that expanded this summer to 25,000 square feet of production space, with a retail store. The 50-employee company sells bread as far south as New Jersey, thanks to a location close to Interstate 95. The brothers, who grew up in nearby Wells, Me., started the company in 1993 and scouted the current site for years waiting for the chance to expand. "You couldn't find this kind of space in Boston," Andrew Siegel said. "And York is a family-oriented community. You can build a nice house here and be close to the ocean." 
York is a 55-square-mile territory -- nearly as big as Boston -- ranging from seaside cliffs to hilly interior land near creeks, ponds and reservoirs. In its 300-year history, several independent towns and villages have been combined, merging their various personalities: the beachfront motels, the Route 1 commercial corridor, the historically protected area and inland homes on heavily wooded property. Most homes have septic systems, and a recent survey estimated that 4,000 new homes could be built before usable sites were exhausted.
Mr. Burns said he feared the loss of York's traditional New England village pattern of land use, where Main Street stores have apartments above them and sit alongside libraries, churches or gas stations. He said he hoped the town could avoid modern zoning standards that concentrate residential, commercial and industrial land in discrete sections. Many residents operate small businesses from their homes and may have trucks, small craft shops or assembly operations in their garages.
The town has strict zoning requirements that make fast-food restaurants impossible. Meanwhile, culinary destinations like Stonewall Kitchen, along with other shops that sell pies and baked goods, have caused growing pains. Stonewall rents warehouse space in town and relies on local suppliers like as Carpe Diem Coffee Roasters.
"We employ 175 full-time people in slow season and 400 in our fourth quarter," Mr. King of Stonewall said. "But York County has no tax incentives and there's an unemployment rate here of 1.5 percent. We wanted to stay in Maine. To say 'Made in Maine' is a lure for our buyers." 
Last year, the Chamber of Commerce created the Government Affairs Steering Committee at the request of members concerned by antibusiness sentiment. One resident even proposed eliminating all businesses over time by requiring that property be converted to residential use when the current owner either retired or sold the site. Cathy Goodwin, the organization's executive director, said her group might develop an alternative.
Among the blueprints awaiting review at Town Hall is a proposal for 16 small workshops, complete with small offices and truck bays near Route 1. These could provide rented 30-foot-by-40-foot spaces for companies that are too big for home but too small for most industrial facilities.
Michael Conlon, a real estate broker at Century 21 Atlantic Realty, conceded that traffic has got progressively worse in his 15 years in the business but said that few developers have given up on their projects.
He said that the town just got its first large grocery store, while losing a smaller rival that had beaten back several attempts at competition, an indicator that both retail and commercial real estate follow quickly behind home construction. "It's been a case of supply and demand," Mr. Conlon said. "Commercial growth has come along with the increased population."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/25 to 41 Harrison Street; 
A Historic Renovation Improving With Age

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
BUILT almost two centuries ago, the simple brick houses at 25 to 41 Harrison Street were singled out for preservation in the 1960's in an urban renewal district in which hundreds of 19th-century industrial buildings were demolished. At first, this peculiar little enclave, in the shadow of the giant Independence Plaza housing project, had a synthetic character, but the passage of time has gradually added the patina of age.
 The area north of Chambers Street along Hudson, Greenwich and Washington Streets boomed with residential construction in the late 1700's and early 1800's, especially around the time City Hall was being built at Chambers and Centre Streets, in 1802 to 1812. Just south of Jay Street, Jonas Wood, a merchant, built a house at 314 Washington Street in 1804, across from the 1796 house at 317 Washington Street of John McComb Jr., who designed City Hall with Joseph Mangin. 
 A block north, at the southeast corner of Washington and Harrison Streets, row house construction peaked in the late 1820's, when different owners put up six chaste Federal-style houses at 29 to 33 Harrison Street and 327 to 331 Washington Street. These owners were also prosperous, like Wilson Hunt, a Pearl Street dry goods merchant, who built 327 Washington Street (now 41 Harrison Street, reflecting a renaming of that segment of Washington Street), and Ebenezer Miller, a Greenwich Street printer, who built 33 Harrison Street. 
Elite development continued to move north and toward the center of Manhattan, but by the 1850's two of the original six families were still in occupancy. But after the Civil War all the houses fell several rungs on the social ladder -- the 1870 census indicates that 31 and 33 Harrison Street had been combined into a single boarding house with 20 tenants, mostly foreign-born workers.
By the 1890's few people lived in the houses -- the lower west side had become the largest market area in New York, and the lofts and warehouses in what is now TriBeCa were also going up on the blocks west of Greenwich Street. But somehow the 314 and 317 Washington Street houses survived, as well as the six houses at the corner of Harrison and Washington Streets.
The 1893 King's Handbook of New York City described the market area as "a scene of wonderful animation and interest, crowded by myriads of purchasers, amid the flaring of oil torches, the shouts of the vendors, the strange commingled smells of the fruits and meats and countless other oddities."
By 1930, the fine plasterwork and mantels of Mr. Miller's house at 33 Harrison Street had been torn out and it was occupied by the Columbus Celery Company. And Mr. McComb's house had been similarly altered, occupied by the produce merchants Silverblank & Arbeiter. Although the houses had lost their ground floor facades, most of them retained their slim dormers and peaked roofs.
The 1939 W.P.A. Guide to New York City praised the "rude vitality" of the district, especially during its usual nighttime operations: "A weird spatter of lights provides illumination, and in the glow truck drivers, farmers, tally keepers and inspectors work at a swift pace. In winter, the streets are lined with bonfires around which the men warm themselves."
At the same time that the World Trade Center was being built, from 1969 to 1973, a wide swath of buildings north of Chambers Street along the Hudson River was being cleared for the Washington Market Urban Renewal Area. The young Landmarks Preservation Commission identified as worthy of preservation the six houses on Harrison and Washington Streets, plus the McComb and Wood houses, and also 315 Washington Street (also designed by Mr. McComb). The late 19th-century brick and stone industrial buildings west of Greenwich Street were considered of minor interest and were demolished, although in the 1990's the commission designated four TriBeCa Historic Districts, east of Greenwich Street, which had very similar buildings.
THE architects Oppenheimer, Brady & Vogelstein and John Pruyn designed the overpowering 40-story Independence Plaza North on Greenwich Street from Duane to North Moore Streets. The three Washington Street buildings were relocated to the east end of the Harrison Street row, making six houses facing Harrison Street in all. Herbert Oppenheimer says the ground floors of the houses had been heavily altered or destroyed during their period of commercial use, and so the doorways, windows and lower facades were almost all new. He says the contractors sandblasted the replacement brick to age it, but "we didn't want it to match perfectly."
But the rebuilt exteriors, completed in 1975, struck a tinny note. Paul Goldberger, writing in his 1979 book "The City Observed: New York," criticized the recreation of the long-vanished residential character of the buildings, compared with the vitality of the commercial area of TriBeCa. "There are facades at Disneyland that look more real, and all that these houses make you want to do is run back again across Greenwich Street where old buildings are still real and not kept alive by artificial respirator," he said.
But when the city put the houses on sale, many people were eager to buy. "My husband and I liked to walk down to this area; we used to dream about what it had been like," said Eugenia Wiener, who had been living on 20th Street with her husband, Norman. "But one day the whole place was leveled, except for these houses." The city offered the houses for sale, with unfinished interiors, for $35,000 to $75,000, and began transferring title in 1976.
Most of Washington Street in this section was destroyed, except for a Belgian block section just south of Harrison Street, and Mr. Oppenheimer's firm created an L-shaped court reaching around to the back of the houses.
Now, more than two decades later, the renovation of 1975 is beginning to show its age. At 27 Harrison Street, the old McComb house, the architect Gregory Talmont designed a new slate roof, finished earlier this year, to replace the old wooden one. At 25 Harrison Street, the old Wood house, Barrie Mandel says she has to replace her rotting clapboard side wall. Ms. Mandel, a real estate broker at the Corcoran Group, says that she would have preferred to have a real brick wall but that -- because of limited width -- "it would have to be those fake bricks, which I dislike" so she is retaining the clapboard.
Scott Frances, a photographer, moved into 31 Harrison Street with his mother and father when he was 21, and now owns it. He says that, by modern preservation standards, much of the exterior restoration was crude and unconvincing. But he likes the picturesque, relaxed character of the enclave.
"My kids have been born and raised here," he said. "You can let them play in the back and watch them from your kitchen window. It's not like the rest of New York City." 
Mr. Frances also says that his view of the buildings has changed over the decades, as the new material has weathered. "The houses have gained in age over 25 years," he said. "Now they look old again. It's a question of time, and patina."

A Costly Home Away From Home

BYLINE:  By ALINA TUGEND 

 BODY:
WHEN Anders and Yvonne Iversen transferred to Larchmont from London last year, they were told they could spend up to $3,700 a month on rent, and the company would pick up 75 percent of the cost.
 After scouring southern Westchester, the Iversens came to the conclusion that there was nothing at that price that would suit their family of four and asked for an increase to $5,000 a month. 
 With that, they were able to rent a four-bedroom house in Larchmont.
"When I first came over here, I was expecting a big house," Ms. Iversen said. "After seeing a few houses I was just happy to get one in good condition. We saw some awful ones." 
The Iversens got off fairly cheaply, according to relocation experts. Rent for a family of five in the Westchester area starts at $5,000 and goes up, said Sylvia Ehrlich, a partner in the Manhattan-based relocation firm Intrepid New York.
In Westchester, where there are usually few rentals available and many people looking, anecdotal evidence suggests that company subsidies to executives from abroad and other corporate transferees are skewing rents.
"There's no question the expat community drives up the rental market," said Ms. Ehrlich, whose company helps relocate about 350 to 450 people annually. Her company's services include finding housing, schools, child care and financial services.
She said that while Westchester is a sought-after location, it also is "one of the hardest places to find single-family homes in good shape; in a given day, we may only have three houses to show in Westchester." 
A list of available rentals in southern Westchester in October showed prices ranging from $2,200 for a 1,100-square-foot place in Mamaroneck to $9,000 for a 4,000-square-foot home in Rye.
It's not just people moving from overseas who are driving rents up -- people relocating within the United States can also arrive backed by generous relocation packages. 
"Nearly 50 percent of all foreign and domestic corporate relocations are renters instead of buyers," said Elizabeth Nunan, vice president of relocation for the real estate firm of Houlihan Lawrence. She relocates more than 1,000 families a year in the tristate area. 
Ms. Nunan attributed the high number of transferring workers seeking rentals to the decline in company-owned housing. Most companies have sold off such property, she said, because it was too costly to maintain.
Companies also are very wary of allowing their transferring employees to buy homes for the short term -- typically three to five years -- while they are in the country, Ms. Ehrlich said, because the costs associated with buying, like closing fees and mortgage costs can be "infinitely higher" than renting. The employee also usually remains unsettled and in temporary housing for an extensive period of time, she said, because the buying process usually takes much longer than finding a house to rent. 
While some companies offer employees the same resettlement package whether they buy or rent, others punish employees who choose to buy instead of renting by cutting their monthly housing stipend in half, Ms. Ehrlich said. Or companies may agree to the same monthly stipend but refuse to pay the associated costs of buying a house. Also, the pool of rental properties has decreased substantially over the last two decades, Ms. Ehrlich said, because new tax laws made owning rental property less attractive. 
She said that it was too early to tell whether the attacks of Sept. 11 and the subsequent terrorist threats would have an effect on the market. "There's a little softening in the market, but inventory levels are still limited," Ms. Erlich said. In addition to foreign transfers, "there are people in the city looking for rentals in the suburbs now."
A survey by Expat Exchange, a Web site that provides information to those who are relocating, found that 30 percent -- the highest percentage of those queried -- said the most important factor when choosing a town in the United States to live in is housing options. The second most important was a short commute to work.
Young and single people most often choose Manhattan as their home. Many international families also choose Manhattan, Ms. Ehrlich said, because they are often used to an urban lifestyle. 
Nonetheless, both foreign and domestic transferees with families frequently seek out the suburbs, and Westchester is one of the most popular.
"The usual preference is for Westchester or Connecticut -- they've heard the buzz about those places, rather than New Jersey," said Tory Masters, also a partner at Intrepid New York. Long Island is also not usually high on the list, Ms. Ehrlich added.
There are several reasons for Westchester's popularity. Historically, Westchester is home to many global headquarters, like I.B.M. in Armonk and MasterCard in Purchase, so employees often found housing close to their jobs.
In addition, international schools -- the French-American School in Larchmont, the German School in White Plains and the Keio School (Japanese) in Purchase and the Darul Arkam Islamic School in Mount Vernon -- lureg foreign transplants to Westchester. The number and variety of such institutions keep expanding. Recently, the Lyceum Kennedy in Ardsley opened Japanese and French schools.
One couple who rented a home in Larchmont for $8,000 a month is a case in point. The wife said many of the expatriates she met in Hong Kong -- where rents often are more than $10,000 a month -- chose to move to Greenwich when transferred to the New York area, because they see it as having a higher standard of living than Westchester. She and her husband selected Larchmont because she wanted her children to attend the French-American School.
They receive a generous company package that not only covers their rent, but also tuition and includes shipping of all household of furniture, as well as a $15,000 "curtain allowance" to decorate the home and first-class seats for a home visit to Scotland every year.
Ruth Chizzini, director of relocation for Julia B. Fee Real Estate in Rye, said that it's not only those relocating from overseas who receive large subsidies.
"Some people from the U.S. have big packages, especially if they're coming from a place like San Francisco or Washington, D.C.," she said.
Even with the slowing economy, no one expects to see any real downturn in relocations any time soon. 
"The global economy is rooted in the corporate culture," Ms. Masters said. "Being sent on assignment all over the world is becoming the norm."

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Love in a Hurry 

BYLINE:  By FRANCINE PARNES 

 BODY:
DAIL METZGER, who runs a Connecticut and Westchester matchmaking service, says that in a post-Sept. 11 world, people are looking for love. Not only did calls from her clients double after the terrorist attacks, but also Ms. Metzger herself is re-examining a longtime platonic friendship for romantic possibilities.
 Deborah Schwartz, originally from Rye, became engaged to Dr. John Meer only four days after the hijackings. Suddenly just a five-month engagement will do. 
 Bob Barclay of Mamaroneck is back in touch with an old buddy from the post-college, ski-bum 1970's. After Mr. Barclay fled his office at the World Trade Center, the friend looked him up, at first fearing the worst. For two men who have reunited only twice in nearly a quarter-century, there is a lot of catching up to do. 
Throughout Westchester, as around the country, people are creating new ties and renewing old ones. Since the attacks, the clock seems to tick faster for rituals of romance. Other people are reconnecting with family or faraway friends. Still others are considering retiring early, adopting a child, acquiring a pet or putting off plans for divorce.
At the Singles Network, which has a branch in Hartsdale, Ms. Metzger said: "The week the world stopped, we stopped, too. Business froze. Then we were deluged for about three weeks, with five or six appointments each day; normally we have about three." Business remains better than usual. 
Sept. 11 is changing the way people approach their personal lives, Ms. Metzger said. "The good relationships are being cemented; the not-so-good ones are ending. People are saying, 'I have to make a change,' or 'I want someone to go home and watch TV with.' You see so many news stories in which people have been lucky to have loved so much. You look at your small life and think, 'I would like to be in a relationship.' " 
Ms. Metzger herself has begun to look at her friend, with whom she has a good time and laughs a lot, in a new light. "He's the same as he always was, but life around me is no longer the same," she said. "We're seeing if we want to take this relationship to another level."
For some, the answer is clearly "yes." Ms. Schwartz, the bride-to-be, who is returning to Westchester for her wedding, said, "Certainly after the attacks, there is no reason to wait." Her preferred venue, the Glen Island Harbour Club in New Rochelle, was available in either a few months or a year. She took the short route. In three weeks Ms. Schwartz, a private investigator in Manhattan, arranged for her gown, venue, rabbi, caterer, band, photographer, attendants and invitations. "Before, I would have said, 'A five-month engagement? Forget it.' I don't want to sound fatalistic, but look at how much can happen in one day." 
Dr. Meer, her fiance, is an internist and pediatrician who had been planning to propose after taking his medical boards at the end of August. "Despite the events, I wanted to forge ahead and give us both a sense that we were going to move on and have a happy life together," he said. His job now also involves treating survivors for post-traumatic stress disorder. 
Millie Martini Bratten, editor in chief of Bride's magazine, spoke with retailers during the New York showings of bridal collections in early October. "We've heard from bridal buyers in stores nationwide," she said. "Brides-to-be are referencing, 'I want someone to call me when they are in trouble or danger. And I want someone to care for me in that same way.' " 
Many unmarried couples have a new willingness to commitafter the collective mood of loss. "All the stories about people who had lost a fiance created this greater sense of 'Omigosh, I can't let this one get away, let's go ahead with it,' " said Carley Roney, a Manhattan-based co-founder of TheKnot.com, an online wedding resource. Traffic early this month on her site was up 17 percent for marriage license inquiries.
At a popular wedding venue, The Castle at Tarrytown, bookings for weddings are up about 25 percent over last year, said Michael Colquhoun, director of sales. "I don't know if I can attribute it totally to the attacks, but a small percentage of people are moving up their dates."
At Crabtree's Kittle House in Chappaqua, inquiries for weddings are up approximately 40 percent. "We seem to be almost inundated with phone calls and people coming in to look at the facilities for a wedding reception," said John Crabtree, the owner. "Rather than being concerned about the economy and counting their woes, they are counting their blessings." 
OTHER relationships are being forged outside the romantic realm. For Bob Barclay, a Verizon Communications sales manager, the crisis revived a long-dormant friendship. After college, in 1971, he and Lou Favata lived in a cabin in the woods for three years near Lake Placid. "I was a waiter, he was a bartender," Mr. Barclay said. "He taught me how to cook and drink brandy, I taught him tennis."
After the attacks, "We made a commitment to see each other in weeks or months, not years," Mr. Barclay said. 
He said his friend, now divorced, might have a shot at repairing his marriage, too -- the former couple connected by phone over mutual concern for Mr. Barclay. "Neither wanted to call my home in case the news was bad," he said.
"I would not be shocked if in a year they are living together," he continued. "They are both alone. The way the world is now, stranger things have happened." 
After the attacks, some telephone lines led to former lovers. 
"My very first call was to my ex-husband," said Michele Weissman, a lawyer from Nyack, who later called four former boyfriends. "I needed to hear his voice; we're still very close. My immediate reaction was to reach out. I was taking stock and letting people who had been in my life know they were important to me."
One old flame wanted to meet. "I wasn't calling to rekindle things," Ms. Weissman said. "I was thinking, we lost a fire captain, the husband of a close family friend, and this tragedy made me realize not to take anything for granted." 
Sharon Abrams, a personal trainer from Spring Valley, has revamped her approach to dating. 
"My new way of thinking is, if the guy is interested, he's the one who comes to me and asks me out, not the other way around," Ms. Abrams said. "I used to offer to split the check, and nine times out of 10, the guy is like, 'O.K.' But he should know better. What I've learned from the attacks is, life is short. I don't have to compromise anymore or push when something's not there." 
Gilda Carle, a Yonkers psychotherapist, has been hearing more about one-night stands lately. At a recent singles seminar on a Saturday night at the Jewish Community Center on the Hudson in Tarrytown, she said that some people were looking for love for all the wrong reasons.
In black leather stovepipe pants and a lavender leather jacket, Ms. Carle held the attention of a packed room of approximately 65 women and 15 men, many of whom had traveled across the Tappan Zee Bridge to hear about the finer points of dating today. 
"I have received more and more e-mails from people who hooked up immediately after the World Trade Center attack," Ms. Carle said in an earlier interview. "They are looking for instant comfort, instant love. People have been so distracted by worrying about terrorists, they have neglected to worry about the people they date and sleep with."
Ms. Carle said that more people are joining the online matchmaking service Getgaga.com to which she is a relationship consultant. "After the World Trade Center bombing, our numbers climbed," she said. "Then after the anthrax scares began, the numbers climbed again. Each time there's a crisis, singles are more aware of their life without a partner."
Elsewhere, singles are happy just to meet and greet. At Mighty Joe Young's in Hartsdale, a restaurant with an active bar, "everybody's been mingling more," said Timothy Kiyotoki, a manager, at the jungle-theme bar with palm-tree-and-safari-animal decor, exotic masks and zebra-print tables. "I am seeing more new faces. It used to be two girls or guys coming from work, now it's a group of four or five.
"It's depressing to stay home and flick on the same news reports," he added. "They come to meet someone at the bar, either to spark romance or brush up their dating skills."
For the Single Gourmet, an Eastchester-based dining club, a get-together in an old fieldstone mansion at the Renaissance Westchester Hotel in White Plains less than three weeks after the attacks attracted more than 100 participants. "When you have 135 single people coming to a social on a Sunday, it supports the fact that they prefer not to be alone," said Nancie Hart, the director. One of Ms. Hart's clients, Robert W. Villani, a White Plains lawyer, is weighing early retirement next year at 60. "I'm divorced, I'm not looking for a relationship for the sake of a relationship," he said, "but I would be much quicker to explore one now.
"Someone I knew who died at the World Trade Center had just started working there this year and was planning on early-retiring in Florida in a couple of years," he said. "You know that old adage, man plans but God disposes? The events of the 11th tell us we can't assume we will reach 65 or 70 -- or even 25. Somebody who is 18 and will die at 24 is already old."
Tina Ritsatos, 19, who is completing a two-year program at Westchester Community College, is likewise recalibrating her future. She planned to apply to New York University for her junior year. "Now I'm thinking of Marymount College in Tarrytown," said Ms. Ritsatos, who lives in Yonkers with her family. "It's only 15 minutes away from my house. This is a time to be around friends and family, people you trust. This tragedy has made me appreciate them 10 times more." 
Her family, she said, tended to do things individually, but now they talk more and go out to movies and restaurants. "It feels like something that needs to happen, that we all want to be together," she said. 
Even in class, Ms. Ritsatos has noticed: "I see people sitting closer to each other. They used to be scattered around the classroom, but now there are no big gaps." 
At the college, Sarah Rabinowitz, the personal crisis counselor, said the tragedy has been a wake-up call to young people who think nothing can harm them. "They get on motorcycles, bungee jump, take all kinds of risk," she said. "At that age, they normally want to assert their independence from their families, but today's events are pulling them back into the family system for a sense of safety and support." 
Other families are connecting through adoption. Mary L. Durel of Family Service of Westchester in White Plains said that about two weeks after the attack, the service heard from around 15 couples in 10 days seeking to adopt, up by approximately 15 percent.
As people consider their connections, Ms. Durel said, "the natural extension is to think about having a family, whether it's a family that is your biological family or extended family or close friends or even people in the neighborhood."
SOME are adopting pets. At the Elmsford Animal Shelter, "Since the attacks, adoptions have picked up considerably, at least 10 percent," said Mimi Stone, president of the Central Westchester Humane Society, which runs the no-kill shelter. One of the New York City firefighters who had been on his honeymoon when the attacks occurred returned early; several his friends and fellow firefighters had been killed. "He came here with his wife one day," Ms. Stone said, "and they adopted a Labrador-mix puppy. He was talking about his experience, how sad it was. We feel there is a tie-in. People are enjoying coming to the shelter. They come, they just fall in love."
Dale Schweizer, manager of Puppy Club Kennels in Mahopac, said people looking for companionship -- the elderly, single people -- are buying puppies. His sales are up around 15 percent. 
For some couples, a shaky relationship now seems preferable to divorce. Margaret Tyre, a matrimonial lawyer in Rye, said that some potential clients are reconsidering splitting up. "Clients feel they need time to evaluate their relationships," she said. "Divorce is an enormous stress to children of any age, and clients are fearful of adding any further insecurity to their children's lives." 
But while relationships are evaluated, not each one is deemed a keeper. 
Peter Nardone, a Scarsdale lawyer, said that for one of his clients, who worked at the World Trade Center and survived the attacks, it signaled the time to end her troubled marriage: "She decided that with the upheaval in her business life, she would try to regain some normalcy in her personal life," Mr. Nardone said. "She couldn't have upheaval in both places. After her workplace was destroyed, she needed to make her home a sanctuary for herself and children. So she decided to proceed with divorce."

Job Growth and Unemployment Tick Upward in Westchester

BYLINE:  By Corey Kilgannon 

 BODY:
As layoffs continue around the nation, job growth in Westchester was measured at a record high for the month of September, according to the New York State Department of Labor, although the numbers don't reflect changes in the economy since Sept. 11. The department reported 419,300 jobs in Westchester currently, 4,700 more than in September 2000. 
 "In terms of job growth, New York State is outpacing the nation and Westchester's outpacing both of them," said Frank M. Surdey, the department's principal economist. 
 Only two large job markets in the state, Albany and Long Island, now have a faster job rate growth than Westchester.
Although there are more people seeking jobs, Westchester's unemployment rate also grew last month, to 3.8 percent, compared with September 2000, when it was 3.2 percent.
The county has the 27th lowest unemployment rate of 62 counties in New York State. Of the state's seven largest job markets, Westchester had the third lowest unemployment rate for September.
Mr. Surdey cautioned that most of the data was collected before the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center, "and we can't gauge the effect of the collapse until next month's numbers." Corey Kilgannon

 BODY:
Purchase College may be best known for the performing arts, but this time the spotlight is on the social sciences division. 
 Professors from the division, as well as groups like the Friends of the Social Sciences, the Westchester Center for Economic Education and the Purchase Student Action Coalition, have organized a series of free public programs focused on United States foreign policy and the turbulent world climate. 
 The series, "Globalization and the Current Crisis," began last month with topics like "Globalization, Why the Fuss?" and "Why Do They Hate Us?" The programs continue on Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. with "Patriotism and the American Left"' Future events include "A Clash of Civilizations" on Nov. 15 at 4:30 p.m. (with philosophy readings on ideas of good and evil); "United States Foreign Policy in Central Asia and the Middle East in a Post-Taliban Era," on Nov. 28 at 4:30 p.m.; and a wrap-up session on Dec. 4 at 4:30 on the topic "What Have We Learned, and What Do We Still Need to Understand?" 
All sessions will take place in the Fireside Lounge of the Social Sciences building. Dr. Peter F. Bell, a professor of economics and director of the Westchester Center for Economic Education who will lead the concluding discussion, said the series brought together a diverse group of faculty from social sciences and humanities to shed light on the events of Sept. 11 and their aftermath.

HEADLINE: When Getting There Isn't Half the Fun 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
LONG before the rush hour train leaves Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, commuters are inching toward the favored track. The experienced ones have learned to place bets early, and they cluster at the top of the stairways.
 The more savvy New Jersey Transit commuters abandoned the station's main concourse long ago. Instead, they position themselves on the lower level, where amid the darkened halls -- with the low ceiling closing in from above and a sea of fellow passengers crowding in from all sides -- they almost lean like sprinters before the starting gun, anticipating. 
 The train is finally announced and the pack surges. No one speaks as commuters sway and jostle for position. The crowd thunders down the staircase and fans out onto the waiting trains. At last, the harried commuters can collapse into the empty seats, which will be gone in seconds. 
Stragglers fill the aisles and wedge tightly into the vestibules. No one bothers to read signs urging passengers not to ride between the cars. No one can see them anyway; riders are already crammed against the doors.
"It is like a herd of cattle rushing to be fed when they have not been fed for three weeks," said Margo Wheeler, a graphic designer who commutes between Manhattan and Metuchen. "You don't even have to walk, you are just pushed along."
That was true even before Sept. 11.
Today, New Jersey's mass transit system -- stretched thin for the last several years -- is being pushed well beyond its capacity. 
If the trains seem crowded, many bus lines are in worse shape. Even before the attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 14,000 riders could not find seats on New Jersey Transit commuter buses.
In addition, the PATH system, whose trains used to carry about 38,000 riders to Lower Manhattan each business day, is partly crippled. With the Exchange Place station in Jersey City shuttered and the PATH tunnel to Lower Manhattan closed for the foreseeable future, riders have had to find alternative ways to get to work. Many are taking ferries or the Midtown PATH lines, while others have shifted to New Jersey Transit for the whole trip.
PATH platforms in Midtown Manhattan are so crowded that riders often have to wait for several trains to pass before being able to enter. To try to cope with the crush, PATH officials have designated the Christopher Street station one-way -- for exiting passengers only -- during the morning rush hour.
"Some of the stations, like Christopher Street and Ninth Street, are seeing 150 percent of capacity," said Michael P. DePallo, director and general manager of services for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. "They were really not built to accommodate this number of passengers."
New Jersey Transit is facing an equally difficult situation. Since the attacks, some trains have seen as much as a 44 percent increase in ridership in and out of Manhattan. That was the kind of increase planners expected over the next 10 years; instead, it came in a week.
Jeff Warsh, the director of New Jersey Transit, put it most succinctly: "We are in a crisis situation."
In the anxious weeks since the twin towers were obliterated, New Jersey Transit has scrambled to ease the difficulties, but officials say that in the short term, there is little that can be done.
For now, Mr. Warsh says his agency has added cars to existing trains and plans to buy more equipment in the next several months. But transit officials also hope that people will try to vary their commuting times.
"The best way we can provide short-term capacity is for employers to encourage staggered hours," Mr. Warsh said. "We are in the middle of a very serious crisis, and it is not going to get any better quickly."
The crunch has come at a particularly difficult time for the transit agency. New Jersey Transit, already overcrowded, had planned a major expansion next year, the opening of the Secaucus Transfer Station -- which would have crammed even more riders onto the trains. Now, however, those plans are in doubt. At the same time, the agency has run out of money just when it would like to buy a new fleet of double-decker rail cars at a cost of about $500 million per train, but for now it cannot afford to. Planners project a shortfall of more than $1.5 billion over the next four years.
THE short-term cause of the overcrowding on the trains is painfully obvious: PATH riders can no longer reach downtown Manhattan, and single-occupant cars cannot use the Lincoln or Holland Tunnels during the morning rush hour. But many people who follow mass transit closely in New Jersey say the effects will linger long after train service is restored to Lower Manhattan. For one thing, many offices forced to move their headquarters from the financial district have relocated to Midtown Manhattan or to New Jersey, resulting in a sharp change in commuting patterns.
"The dislocation and the relocation of offices from Lower Manhattan and the loss the PATH has resulted in a huge shift of people going to Midtown, either by transit, Amtrak or by the PATH uptown route," said James Weinstein, the commissioner of New Jersey's Transportation Department. "We have had more people riding our public transit system in all its modes than we have ever had."
Government agencies and private transit companies have struggled to provide alternatives. New York Waterways, the main ferry service between New Jersey and Manhattan, has increased its fleet to 35 vessels from 24.
But Arthur E. Imperatore Jr., president of New York Waterways, admitted recently that the response so far was not nearly enough.
"We need to create as much additional capacity as we can and add new routes where possible," Mr. Imperatore said. "We have been able to cope so far, but we have to look for ways to expand."
Bus companies are also trying to increase capacity. Coach USA, which owns a large proportion of suburban commuter buses that pour into the Port Authority bus terminal on Eight Avenue in Midtown Manhattan every morning, has shifted some of its charter buses into commuter service. As a result, said Tom Vitale, a regional vice president with Coach USA, which operates under such names as Suburban, Red and Tan, Shortline, Olympia Trails and Community Coach, the lines still have available seats.
On the other hand, many New Jersey Transit bus lines have reached their limit.
Cedrick T. Fulton, general manager of the Port Authority bus terminal, said the facility's 230 gates had been at operating at capacity for several years.
"When carriers ask for my space, we tell them we just don't have it," Mr. Fulton said.
He said there had not been a large increase in the number of buses entering the station since the attack -- about 70 percent of the 200,000 riders who pass through the terminal each day ride New Jersey Transit buses -- although ridership had increased. In addition, he said drivers had been experiencing delays because of added security at the Lincoln Tunnel, particularly during the evening rush. 
Mr. Warsh said New Jersey Transit had only seen a 3 percent increase in bus ridership since the attacks. But, he said, the small increase could be attributed to the fact that there was no room on the buses to begin with. Nearly two-thirds of the agency's 400,000 daily passengers of all types already take the bus.
"Capacity is the problem," he said. "You can't fit any more people."
For now, New Jersey Transit has added 15 new buses to its busy Route 9 corridor from Old Bridge. But local officials say the increase, while welcome, has still not kept pace with demand.
"Bus ridership is at 100 percent," said Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski, of Bordentown. "It was crowded before and now it is bursting at the seams."
Mr. Wisniewski, a member of the Transportation Committee in the Assembly, said the Legislature would have to consider increasing money for mass transit.
"There is clearly a need to increase capacity under the Hudson River," he said.
In fact, New Jersey Transit has already ordered 1,400 new buses, which it expects to roll out over the next two years. Many of those were intended to replace the aging Cruiser-style buses -- most of which are nearly 20 years old -- but transit officials said that they might keep some of the older buses rolling to meet the increased demand.
YET even when the new buses are on the road, the agency will still have a problem finding places to unload passengers.
"We have no more capacity at the Port Authority bus terminal and we have used up all capacity at the Lincoln Tunnel," Mr. Warsh said.
Jeanine Bauer, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a private research organization that studies transportation issues, said the bus terminal had always been been a choke point for New Jersey commuters.
"We have heard that a lot from Bergen and Rockland commuters -- the crowding is a longstanding problem and it has gotten worse," Ms. Bauer said. "There are not enough buses, not enough frequency and not enough platform space."
The Port Authority has plans to renovate its north terminal, which could accommodate as many as 25,000 additional commuters each day.
If the Port Authority decided to go forward with the plan, officials said the job could be completed within 15 months. That, however, is small comfort to riders swaying with the bus as it crawls around the helix toward the Lincoln Tunnel.
"In a perfect world, we would start construction sometime mid-year next year," Mr. Fulton said. However, he said the developer and the Port Authority were still discussing financing for the project.
"In the short term, there is going to be additional congestion and additional crowding," Mr. Weinstein said. "We are trying to respond quickly to the worst of the problems. But it is going to take time."
JAMES R. CANTWELL, who has been a conductor for New Jersey Transit for 37 years, has traveled between Trenton and New York more times than he can remember. But one trip that is burned into his memory is the 10:37 a.m. train out of Manhattan on Sept. 11.
It was the last train leaving Pennsylvania Station after the attacks on the World Trade Center, and people had poured down the stairs and crammed onto the platform. But Mr. Cantwell had to shut the train doors. Emergency officials deemed the train tunnels too dangerous, so the train left empty as people stared in dismay.
"I wanted to get these people out of there, but I had a notice to evacuate the train," Mr. Cantwell said. "I had all these people coming down. They had looks of horror on their faces."
For tens of thousands of people, New Jersey Transit has always been a lifeline. If there was any question of that, it was dispelled in the weeks after the attacks. Mr. Cantwell said the crowds of commuters have returned to his 12-car train. Most of the same faces are back, and many new ones have joined.
"If you get lucky enough to get a seat, you get a seat," Mr. Cantwell said. "If not, you are going to have to stand. They accept that."
There is not much choice. Before Sept. 11, New Jersey Transit trains carried 34,000 people into Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. every workday. Since then, the trains have been carrying about 50,000 passengers each day.
Yet it is difficult to say how each particular train is affected. For riders from Trenton or the North Jersey coastline, the increase is not really felt until the train arrives in Newark -- where people who used to take the PATH trains to Lower Manhattan pour on.
The problem is, the new riders have been added to train lines that were already seeing people standing each day because of the lack of adequate seating.
"There are probably 12,000 to 15,000 more people on those trains during the morning commute," said Steven M. Weber, a senior transportation planner with the Regional Plan Association. "Cars that were carrying 120 people before are now carrying 200."
The situation is even worse on New Jersey Transit's most popular line, the Midtown Direct. Crowding on that train, which travels from Morristown through the suburbs west of Newark is severe because riders who used to ride the train to Hoboken and take the PATH to the trade center or the ferry are now taking Midtown Direct.
Ms. Bauer of the Tristate Transportation Campaign said the Midtown Direct was so crowded these days that conductors could not even move through the cars to open doors.
"The conductor had to get off the train and walk along the outside, opening each door so that passengers could disembark," Ms. Bauer said.
PROBLEMS with capacity are nothing new for the agency, which had 8,000 train passengers and 14,000 bus riders standing each day before the attacks. Even before Sept. 11, Mr. Warsh said, New Jersey Transit had ordered 1,400 new buses as well as 200 new train cars and more powerful locomotives to handle additional passengers.
He said that the new train equipment, scheduled to enter service during the next two years, would create about 16,000 new seats. But rail cars -- unlike automobiles -- take a long time to finish.
"It takes two years for a rail car to be built," Mr. Warsh said, "and it needs to be safety tested."
The problem is, those 16,000 new seats are already spoken for. Next fall the Secaucus Transfer, a new train station under construction, is expected to open, allowing riders from Bergen County to transfer to trains that go directly to Manhattan. The long-promised station is expected to be immensely popular, and New Jersey Transit has estimated that 16,200 passengers will use it to transfer into the city.
While New Jersey Transit has spent more than $400 million on the project, planners already question whether the agency will be able to open the station because of the overcrowding. The problem is this: the Secaucus Transfer sits between Newark and New York, and planners counted on many riders leaving the trains at Newark and taking PATH into the city. Those seats were expected to be open for the new passengers from Bergen County. But because PATH is closed, riders are not leaving the trains, and there may be no room for the new passengers.
"I think Secaucus is a pretty big problem," said Martin M. Robins, director of the Transportation Policy Institute at the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. "They may be able to hold off on the opening of the Secaucus project until the reopening of PATH."
New Jersey Transit opened its Newark Airport train station on Oct. 21, allowing passengers to connect with the airport monorail system. Despite the sharp decline in air travel caused in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attack, transit officials said ridership to the station had been high. They said the new stop had been averaging over 1,100 riders a day, more than the 600 to 800 passengers they had been expecting.
The problem with waiting for the reopening of the PATH stations at Exchange Place and at the site of the World Trade Center is that Port Authority officials cannot even predict when that service will resume. According to the latest projections, it is likely to be about two years before service is restored to the World Trade Center stop.
For now, said Mr. DePallo, the PATH director, engineers had not even been able to evaluate the damage under the trade center, and it will be six months before they could say how long the stations would remain closed.
Even without the displacement caused by the attack, Ms. Bauer of the transportation campaign said that New Jersey Transit would have had severe problems opening the Secaucus Transfer without creating a logjam.
"The Northeast Corridor and the Midtown Direct trains were at capacity anyway," she said. "They could not fit another body onto those trains."
There are differing views about the project -- particularly within New Jersey Transit and the state's Transportation Department.
For his part, Mr. Warsh said his agency still planned to open the new station as scheduled, and insisted that New Jersey Transit could cope with the new riders. Mr. Weinstein, the transportation commissioner, said the project was crucial to northern New Jersey, particularly because it could ease some of the road congestion in Bergen County.
But he said he recognized that the additional crowding had placed new strains on the system. 
"That is something we are clearly going to have to re-evaluate," he said."I don't think the whole thing has settled out, and because of that you can't make plans."
ANYONE who has heard of Senator Jon S. Corzine knows he spent years working on Wall Street, rising up through the ranks at Goldman Sachs to become its co-chairman. But how many people know that Mr. Corzine spent a good portion of his lifetime driving through the predawn darkness and watching the sun come up over the Manhattan skyline? "I got up every morning at 5 a.m. to car-pool into New York to avoid the traffic and the congestion on the trains," he said. 
The commute, whether fighting tunnel traffic or cramming onto a bus or a train, has always been the down side to living and working in the New York region. Even before the current crisis, the difficulty of moving employees into and out of the city was driving businesses out of New York's financial district.
But in the end -- as Senator Corzine and most transportation planners agree -- there is not much that New Jersey can do to expand the capacity of mass transit into New York without building a new tunnel under the Hudson River.
Senator Corzine, who campaigned on the promise of improving mass transit in northern New Jersey, said that short-term "patchwork" solutions might add some space, but a real solution would require a huge expansion.
"It is more essential than I can put into words," Senator Corzine said.
Although talked about for decades, a serious proposal to add a second tunnel under the Hudson River for passenger trains has been discussed endlessly since the mid-1990's. Mr. Robins of Rutgers shepherded the plan as part of a joint project between New York, New Jersey and the Port Authority called Access to the Region's Core.
Mr. Robins estimated the project would cost from $3 billion to $6 billion. The least expensive plan called for running a second rail tunnel from Pennsylvania Station in Newark to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan, and building a second passenger concourse beneath the existing station in New York. The project, which was estimated to take about 10 years, would almost double the number of people who could cross the river on trains.
The more ambitious -- and more expensive -- project would involve a tunnel running from New Jersey to Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. That project would allow for interconnection between all of the commuter rail lines in New York -- New Jersey Transit, Metro-North and the Long Island Rail Road.
For now, however, Mr. Robins said, the project was stalled for one big reason: money.
There are many competing projects with proponents clamoring for funds, and the tunnel advocates have not presented a united front to the federal government. In fact, Mr. Robins said, while New Jersey officials had generally supported the tunnel, most New York leaders had either distanced themselves from it or opposed it altogether.
"It is soft opposition, but it is opposition," Mr. Robins said. "The City of New York under Mayor Giuliani does not want to hear about it. Their attitude is that it is going to drag people from jobs in New York to New Jersey."
Without federal support -- which means New York as well as New Jersey pushing the project -- the tunnel will move ahead with all the speed of the 5:45 leaving Pennsylvania Station in a snowstorm. Not only is New Jersey ill-positioned to build the tunnel by itself, but the fact is that New Jersey Transit is already facing a serious financial crunch. 
It is the paradox faced by all of the country's government-subsidized railroads: the more customers they attract, the more money they lose. Nor is the problem as simple as the inability of conductors to collect fares because they cannot walk through the trains -- although that happens frequently these days. Ticket sales meet only part of the cost of running the railroad; the rest comes from government subsidies.
More customers mean more wear and tear, more equipment, more salaries. And unless government subsidies rise along with ridership, the railroad begins to lose more money. But in fact in the 1990's, as ridership soared, subsidies for New Jersey Transit operations actually fell, though they increased a bit in the last two years.
"There is no question that mass transit is critical to our economy," said Curtis Fisher, program director for the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group. "We have to make more of an investment in transit. We can't continue to absorb these 30 percent increases in use without stress on the system."
Indeed, New Jersey Transit's five-year financial plan shows the signs of impending financial problems. The document predicts a deficit of more than $1.5 billion for the period. Perhaps more troubling, it shows that the only way the transit agency can continue to pay for its operations is by diverting money from its capital budget, a sure sign of long-term problems.
"The operating budget has been grossly short-changed for a number of years," Mr. Robins said. "They have had no fare increase in 10 years, and for a number of years money was decreasing from the state."
The way Mr. Warsh sees it, money difficulties are already being felt on the train lines. He said one crucial way to ease congestion between Newark and New York was to add bilevel train cars, which Long Island Rail Road is already using. While there is practically no more room for additional trains during rush hour -- only so many can enter or leave New York at any time -- adding another passenger level would provide about 16,000 more seats.
Mr. Warsh said his agency wanted to buy 200 double-decker cars, and had asked builders to provide proposals for the new designs.
But to Mr. Robins, the issue is not the technical design but the financing.
"In 1998, they decided they were going to buy the bilevel cars," Mr. Robins said. "I would assume they have had the specs for some time. They don't have the money."

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES; 
Who Best Protects Shareholders? The Shareholders

BYLINE:  By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
GIVING shareholders more rights is good for a company to do.
 That is not a political judgment. It appears to be an investment truth, though discovered only recently -- in a study that found that the stock prices of companies that place the most restrictions on their shareholders' rights have lagged behind those that had the fewest such limits. 
 The restrictions take many forms. Particularly well known is the poison-pill defense, which aims to immunize management from hostile takeovers. Others include the staggered election of company directors -- which keeps shareholders from throwing out an entire board in any given year -- and requirements for supermajorities in voting. These changes make it difficult for shareholders to exercise real influence or control. 
But as many and varied as the restrictions can be, their net impact on long-term performance has been negative, according to a new study by three researchers -- Paul Gompers, a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School; Joy Ishii, a graduate student in economics at Harvard; and Andrew Metrick, a finance professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. The team studied 24 ways in which a company may restrict shareholder rights and combined them into an overall index. A low reading meant that a company imposed few restrictions. 
Working with a database of companies representing 90 percent of the market, the team constructed 10 portfolios, according to those companies' index values. The portfolios were reconstructed periodically. From Sept. 1, 1990, to Dec. 31, 1999, the researchers found, the portfolio with the lowest index values gained 9.3 percentage points a year more, on average, than the one with the highest values. While the other eight did not always adhere to the pattern, the performance difference between the extremes has withstood attempts to explain it away.
To put the researchers' findings in perspective, consider that the performance difference is almost double the five-point margin of victory that growth stocks had over value stocks during the same period -- a heyday for growth investing -- according to the Standard & Poor's 500/Barra indexes. 
But how could a difference of such magnitude have escaped notice? For one thing, researchers couldn't have detected it until recently. Widespread shareholder restrictions are relatively new; most companies did not impose them until the mid-to late 1980's.
Furthermore, to the extent that shareholder restrictions could have been studied, previous researchers tended to focus on the immediate market impact. But over the short term, that impact is ambiguous. For example, even though a poison-pill defense turns out to be a long-term negative, the market may react to it positively over the short term because it may signal that a hostile takeover attempt is imminent.
Why would companies that restrict shareholder rights be such poor performers? The authors of the new study are careful to stress that the jury is still out. Maybe the restrictions lead to a deterioration in a company's culture -- away from shareholder responsiveness and toward immunity from competitive pressures -- and eventually to poorer fundamentals and inferior stock performance. Or maybe the restrictions on shareholder rights are just symptoms of a deterioration caused by something else.
I find it safe to say, however, that investors should begin to pay more attention to a company's culture. Assuming that restrictions on shareholder rights are either a cause or a symptom of cultural deterioration, an investor should be less inclined to buy, and more inclined to sell, a company that chooses to impose them.
That also means that investors should consider a company more favorably if it relaxes previously imposed restrictions. Companies that imposed heavy restrictions were so beaten down by the market over the last decade that changes in their corporate cultures could unleash enormous potential.

HEADLINE: OUT THERE: Colombia; 
Who's the Fairest of Them All?

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia 

 BODY:
ANDREA PAOLA GARZON, tall and impossibly thin, takes her beauty seriously.
 Every day at 5:30 a.m. she hits the gym for a strenuous workout, followed by a massage, a thermal bath and a stint on the tanning bed. What the six-hour morning regimen has not altered, plastic surgery has: she has undergone a breast lift. 
 It may sound extreme. But Ms. Garzon is vying to win Colombia's National Beauty Pageant, a 17-day extravaganza that began on Oct. 27, turning everyone's attention -- if only briefly -- from the country's most intractable problem: a civil conflict that has lasted for decades and claims thousands of lives every year. 
"This is a tremendous sacrifice, to have surgery and do all this work," said Ms. Garzon, 21, who holds a fashion design degree. "People think being a beauty queen is to put on a dress and go, but they do not take into account all the sacrifice and hard work."
Beauty is a national obsession in Colombia, readily apparent on the nightly newscasts, which often end with shots of bikini-clad young women. The economy as a whole may be faltering, but cosmetics companies and spas thrive, as do matchmaking services that find Colombian women for American lonely hearts.
The pageant, in Cartagena, has 400 journalists accredited to cover it, and takes the mania to a new level. Would-be beauty queens spend tens of thousands of dollars on wardrobes, travel, security and other expenses. They hire "preparers" to teach them how to walk regally, answer questions from the media and discuss the government's troubled peace talks with leftist rebels. One well-known consultant, Javier Murillo, even invites legislators, scholars and Colombia's former national police director, Rosso Jose Serrano, to brief contestants on Colombia's turmoil.
"A queen gets asked questions," explained Diana Quimbay, 23, a contestant and recent university graduate, "so you have to be prepared."
As for the high cost, in some cases contestants' wealthy families foot the bill. And though the country's per capita income is $2,000, provincial governments -- ever proud of their local queens -- have used public funds for the queens' preparation without arousing complaints. But usually, contestants have corporate sponsors.
Critics see the obsession as a step backward in a country where women have made impressive headway in recent decades. They note that more than half the university students here are female, and that women are well represented in the professional class. More than 30 of the 263-member Congress are women, as is one of the leading presidential candidates, Noemi Sanin.
"The advances of a country should be measured by the advances of its women," said Florence Thomas, a leading feminist at National University in Bogota. "But this is humiliating. For me, it is like a horse fair, where their faces and nose and hair and bust are assessed."
Ms. Thomas and others also question how a pageant and the accompanying media blitz can be justified when Colombia is struggling with civil strife now in its 37th year.
But there are scholars who see a relationship between the conflict and the pageant mania. Michael Stanfield, a Latin America specialist at the University of San Francisco, is writing a book about it. His thesis is that Colombians, bedeviled by violence and a floundering government, use pageants to try to project what is good about their country. Their soccer teams may often fail on the world stage, but with the pageants, they can show off.
"Colombians need the hope of beauty, they need the presentation of beauty, to feel connected, to feel proud," Mr. Stanfield said. "You occasionally have a Colombian win a stage of the Tour de France or someone winning a car race, but nothing rallies that sense of national identification like the beauty queen."
Pageants have a long history here; upper-class women in the colonial period held some of the first, using slaves as contestants. It was a way, Mr. Stanfield said, for the elite to display power, since the contestants wore dresses and jewels belonging to their masters.
Modern-day Colombia has hundreds of pageants each year, honoring natural resources like coal and coffee, or cultural icons, like Vallenato music. None, though, compare in size, scope and cost to the National Beauty Pageant, which has been crowning queens since 1934. This year, 9 out of 21 contestants sought the advice of Alfredo Barraza, a fashion designer, who keeps a portrait collection of his pageant winners -- 14 so far. He has counseled this year's clients on everything from fixing crooked teeth to plastic surgery. And he designed their dresses -- 144 in all, 16 for each contestant.
That many are essential, for the various pageant events: cocktail parties, solemn wreath-layings, tours of poor neighborhoods, prayer services. The outfits must match perfectly with the event -- not too showy for those serious functions, not too plain for those meant to dazzle. So there are light dresses for Cartagena's steamy nights, business suits for news conferences and then the folk get-ups for the Night of Fantasy event, which highlights Colombia's regional styles. The most important, though, is the elegant gown they wear for the coronation, Nov. 11 -- when there is an even chance that one of Mr. Barraza's clients will take the crown.
"I like to win," Mr. Barraza said. "This is my job, and I go to win."
For the contestants, his advice is gospel. "I'm like a sponge," said Johanna Cure, 23. "They tell me everything I need to do, and I just soak it up."
And if Mr. Barraza thinks a contestant's nose is crooked or her legs have cellulite, who is to argue?
"I fixed my bridge," said Consuelo Guzman, 19, touching her nose. "I am fine with it. If you are going to feel good about yourself, what is the problem with that?"
Mr. Barraza said his role was to help his charges find the talent they might not have known they had. "Look," he said, "many of the girls are beautiful physically on the outside, but inside they have not found that inner beauty."
To help the contestants reach that inner beauty, Mr. Barraza and other preparers say, they are urged to read newspapers and books. "I read a lot," Mr. Barraza explained. "So I know what they should read. Charisma, there is a good book on that, so I tell them: 'Read this book so you know what charisma is. A queen has to be charismatic.' "
On a recent day, Mr. Barraza's home buzzed with energy. His 10 seamstresses, many of them relatives, were on hand. A local television crew waited to interview contestants. One of them, Ms. Quimbay, sat in an adjoining room while Mr. Barraza applied her makeup. Another, Johana Acosta, 20, waited for a fitting. Still others waited for a moment with Mr. Barraza, as always in a flurry of activity.
Some have won their places in the competition through victories in local pageants; others have been appointed by government officials. For many, the pageant is the culmination of a lifelong dream -- the highest honor a woman could hope for.
"A queen is the bright face of the country," Ms. Garzon said. "In Colombia, a queen is always seen as someone who is very important, an example to follow."
Yet it is clear when talking to contestants that while winning is paramount, losing is not bad either. At least they have created professional possibilities for themselves. After all, newscasts are stocked with former contestants, as are the soap operas and Colombia's red-hot modeling industry.
"They are on television, doing radio; they are professionals," Raimundo Angulo, the pageant president, said of former contestants. "So this has opened doors for them. Beauty has allowed them to reaffirm the talent that they have."

Marked Bills for Patriotic Purchases

BYLINE:  By SOREN LARSON 

 BODY:
A New York-based artist is putting the tools of capitalism to double use -- combating fear as well as recession -- by putting his mouth where his money is. The artist, David Greg Harth, has been stamping United States paper currency with one of two phrases, "I am not afraid" or "I am not terrorized." 
The bills are then put back into circulation in the time-honored way with the goal of providing subliminal comfort to skittish consumers.
 "The point is that I will continue doing what I do," Mr. Harth, 26, said. "I will create art, go out for dinner, go to a concert. The terrorists want to kill us by destroying our economy and productive spirit. It's not going to happen. We will continue to be free to play, work, earn -- and spend." 
 Don't be surprised if one of the declarative dollars ends up in your wallet, because Mr. Harth is hoping to mark at least 100,000 of them with his red or black slogans. He has friends stamping away across the country and even has a connection working in Berlin. So far, more than 25,000 bills have been stamped in the United States, Mr. Harth said. 
This is not unfamiliar territory for him. In 1998 Mr. Harth tagged bills with the legend "I am America." But this time around there's a greater workload -- and a sense of urgency.
Those interested in joining Mr. Harth's stamp act may visit www.davidgregharth.com/dollars. He will send a stamp (free, but it must be returned) or exchange a check or money order for marked bills. SOREN LARSON

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Drugs Aside, Drugstores Feel the Pain Of Prudence

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
ON the face of it, the nation's big drugstore chains, which generate $180 billion in revenue, would seem to be immune to turns in the economy. 
 Recession or no recession, people need drugs. And as the nation grays, more people need more drugs. 
 That is the logic. The reality is something else. Drugstore sales are slumping. Chains are closing stores and laying off workers. Investors have been dumping the stocks. 
Mark Husson, food and drug retailing analyst at Merrill Lynch, spoke about the business last week. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. Why are drug chains slumping?

A. First, there has been a slowdown in comparable-store sales and a heating up of the competitive environment.
The industry gets about 60 percent of its sales from drugs, which are nondiscretionary, and about 40 percent from convenience items. Profit margins are higher on convenience items. 
In normal times, people go into the drugstore thinking they need 1.5 items, and to their surprise they come out with 2.3 items. 
In tight times, you go in for 1.5 items, and that is what you come out with. And the stuff they are not selling, the candy, the Big Mouth Billy Bass, the weight loss pills, is the stuff with the highest profit margins. 

Q. What is the other factor?

A. The second problem is what is called shrinkage, which is another word for staff and customer theft.
Rite Aid and CVS have talked about this, and Duane Reade is starting to talk about it. 
And the reason it is more of a problem now is that retailers sell a lot of expensive stuff, from home diagnostic kits for diabetes to smoke-cessation products. 
During the last recession, in the early 1990's, technology wasn't good enough to quantify the shrinkage amount. Now they know precisely what is happening. 
Shrinkage is up about 30 basis points. Typically, it runs at 1.5 percent of sales. Now, it is about 1.8 percent of sales. 

Q. Who competes with the big drug chains?

A. Outside of New York City, all the discretionary stuff you buy in the front of a drugstore you can get at a convenience store, a mass merchant or a supermarket.
It's interesting that in the United States, 70 percent of all drugstore customers are women, and 70 percent of all 7-Eleven customers are men. America has evolved where men buy stuff at convenience stores and women go to drugstores. 
Outfits like Wal-Mart are not viable competitors on the drug side. But on the convenience side, the Wal-Marts, the Kmarts and Targets have always been extremely competitive.

Q. Are drugstore stocks defensive investments?

A. Drugstores have not proved themselves to be as defensive as food retailing stocks. And next year, when you are looking for something aggressive, they won't have as much upside potential as electrical or home improvement retailers, like Home Depot.
If you want defensive growth, I would much rather own food distributors like Sysco or Performance Group, which supplies restaurants. 
That said, as long as gross margins go back to normal after this decelerating phase is over, then drugstores are great investments. That should happen, but we can't say definitely when it will. 
We are worried enough about the gross margin problem right now not to have any direct buy recommendations on the drugstore chain stocks right now. We would not mind accumulating Rite Aid and Walgreen on the dips, but we would not out-and-out buy them right now.

Q. When will Rite Aid be profitable again?

A. On an earnings-per-share basis, I would expect Rite Aid to become profitable in about three years.

Q. Walgreen, CVS and Rite Aid represent 30 percent of the market. Are smaller chains worth a look?

A. Duane Reade and Longs Drug Store are not national, but they are fine little companies. Duane Reade's sales per square foot are among the highest in the country, no matter what the good is being sold. At $900 per square foot, per year, it is twice the industry average. And they have made it extremely hard for others to get into the New York market.

Q. Does the aging of America make these companies viable long-term investments?

A. Once you get to age 55, your body starts malfunctioning. It is not going to be long before we see large numbers of malfunctioning bodies.
As a result, we see drug sales growing at a compound forward rate of 9 to 10 percent a year, year after year after year. By 2010, drugs will likely represent about 80 percent of drugstore sales.

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS: VOWS; 
Rebecca Odes and Craig Kanarick

BYLINE:  By EMILY EAKIN 

 BODY:
"SHE swirled into class late, like a tornado, with a whirlwind of hair flying, and my impression was 'Wow, this woman is completely interesting,' " said Craig Kanarick, recalling his first encounter with Rebecca Odes, then a student in his New York University course on interaction design in 1996. 
 Ms. Odes, 32, was equally interested but had a complaint. During a break in the three-hour class, she asked Mr. Kanarick, who was a founder of Razorfish, a digital services firm in New York, why his lecture did not correspond with the course description. "Are you going to stick to the syllabus?" demanded Ms. Odes, a founder of gURL.com, a Web site for teenage girls, which she created with two N.Y.U. classmates that year. 
 That was the start of a freewheeling conversation about art, color theory and Web design, which took place each week after class and, after semester's end, continued over a series of increasingly romantic dates. 
One involved a five-day low-tech stay on a Caribbean island. "No phones, no cars, no television" Mr. Kanarick remembered. In another they made a trip to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. 
"I had always felt intimidated by art," said Mr. Kanarick, 34, whose life before Ms. Odes had been primarily about computers. "She gave me a whole new set of eyes. I'm a real geek. Not a new geek. I'm old school." 
He had his first e-mail address in his freshman year at the University of Pennsylvania, 1985, when virtually the only people online were other computer science majors. At 26, he teamed up with a friend from nursery school to start Razorfish, which became a hot property of the new economy. 
Ms. Odes, on the other hand, studied art at Vassar and taught herself to play bass guitar. By the end of her freshman year, an indie-rock band she formed with two other students, Love Child, was playing in Boston clubs. They toured the United States and Europe before breaking up. Ms. Odes managed to squeeze in a year studying painting at the Art Institute of Chicago before joining Silicon Alley. "My life had been enshrined in the music scene," Ms. Odes said. "Craig was different: a real professional person." 
Their relationship was tumultuous. Once, they separated for a year and a half. But after the dot.com failures, Mr. Kanarick and Ms. Odes remained intact. The businesses they had started were too, although Mr. Kanarick left Razorfish in May. (He is now an apprentice cook at Babbo, the hip downtown restaurant, and a publisher of Bust, a feminist women's magazine.)
"They're a brilliant, uncompromising couple," observed Michael Stipe, the rock musician, with whom Mr. Kanarick has worked.
Ms. Odes and Mr. Kanarick were married on Oct. 27 at the Angel Orensanz Foundation, a crumbling former synagogue on the Lower East Side. Evidence of their first major creative collaboration was everywhere. Before the ceremony, amid flickering candelabra, guests sipped a cocktail of pear, litchi, pomegranate, sour cherry and prosecco. 
The bride wore a filmy white corset dress with a blood-red sash by Peter Soronen, a New York designer, from a sketch she drew. 
After the ceremony, the guests feasted on delicacies like flying fish roe, a collection of Moroccan salads and Peruvian blue potatoes, and they danced to an 11-piece jug band. At one point, they crowded around a three-tier stand covered with lavishly iced cupcakes. On the top stood remarkably lifelike figurines, painted by the bride, of the couple embracing. 
"Rebecca has always been a very creative, passionate, vibrant person," said Esther Drill, the bride's oldest friend, one of the gURL.com founders. "Other people she went out with just couldn't match her intensity. But Craig does. He has an obvious appreciation for who she is. He rounds her out."

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY; 
It's Time for Teamwork on New Drugs

BYLINE:  By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
NOTHING weakens our faith in the sanctity of intellectual property like a little bioterror. After anthrax started killing Americans, the Bush administration put the arm on Bayer to provide Cipro, the best-known treatment, on the cheap, lest the company's patent be abrogated.
 Until recently, at least, bioterror didn't strike every day, so the case of Cipro seems a special one. But, in fact, it is only the latest episode in a long-running melodrama of dysfunctional family life -- the family ties in this case being the uneasy marriage of government and the pharmaceutical industry. 
 The government, remember, pays for much of the basic scientific research in this country. And the United States issues the patents that protect the drug companies' lifeblood -- the fruits of their research and development spending. As the issue of AIDS in the third world has already demonstrated, the eternal problem is how to balance the needs of the desperately ill, who often cannot pay, with the needs of investors, who insist on a solid shot at profits if they are to go out on a drug-development limb. 
Several solutions have been proposed in recent years. Michael Kremer, a Harvard economist, suggested that the government buy drug patents at prices set by auctions. These auctions would serve as mechanisms for setting the price the government would pay; private bidders would participate because, in a certain percentage of cases, the government would step aside and the highest private bid would win. But what if bidders collude? Or, conversely, what if private parties lose interest because they aren't winning enough patents?
Jenny Lanjouw, a Yale economist, proposes that companies could patent a new drug in the industrialized world or in the developing countries, but not both. Companies could thus choose their most profitable market, typically the industrialized countries, and leave the third world to low-cost producers. That would make AIDS medications, for instance, available in Africa at much lower prices.
Unfortunately, a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that even in countries of sub-Saharan Africa where there are no relevant patents, AIDS drugs are unaffordable.
What to do? First, the government needs to become the monopsony, or sole, buyer of drugs, a technique used by some European countries to help offset the monopoly pricing power of patent holders. Second, a government panel of scientists should designate the highest-priority ailments based on prevalence, years of life lost and cost to the economy. Drugs for these conditions would receive full 17-year patents. But medicines aimed at hair loss and other lesser maladies would receive much shorter patents.
Third, and perhaps most important, the government would make mandatory dollar-for-dollar matching grants to pharmaceutical companies for research and development in return for a 50 percent stake in any resulting patents. It's hard to imagine a better public investment: drug companies are immensely profitable, and by doubling what is spent on research, we would save lives and ease suffering by accelerating drug discovery. And by blindly matching private spending, the government can ride along with the best decisions of the marketplace without big investment-allocation headaches. The drug industry should welcome this new money, especially since it is tied to the sanctity of its patents.
Over time, the government's 50 percent patent portfolio will throw off a lot of cash. That could be used to finance new drugs to fight lethal ailments that are too rare for drug companies to otherwise address economically. In an emergency, the government could cut a drug's price by forgoing its profit share. It could even sell its stake, say, in a dermatitis drug patent to buy one for a malaria drug, whose distribution it could afford to subsidize. If the fund grew very large, it could become self-perpetuating.
Best of all, the cost would be relatively small. The pharmaceutical industry says it will spend roughly $30 billion this year on research and development, counting foreign spending in this country. That may sound like a lot, but the United States government will spend almost as much this year on farm subsidies alone. And that expenditure buys us only more expensive food -- not a bad idea if it kept us thin, but no such luck.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE; 
. . . and Students Go on Assignment, Dollars in Hand

BYLINE:  By JESAMYN M. GO 

 BODY:
Gay Snodgrass, a professor at New York University, wanted to help the local economy recover after the Sept. 11 attacks, but she thought that spending the money herself would be overindulgent. So when her husband suggested that she turn her psychology students into designated shoppers, she fell in love with the idea, and so did her N.Y.U. colleague Ted Coons. 
 The two professors then gave $6,500 of their own money to 305 students, about $20 each. 
 "We thought it was a joke," said Michelle Perna, a sophomore. "Nobody expects to receive a $20 bill at the end of a psych lecture."
So what did the students buy?
Betsy Williams, who previously thought it was uncool to do touristy things, spent her money on a carriage ride around Central Park. She also shopped for tourist souvenirs -- postcards, pins and small flags -- near her dormitory on Water Street, which was evacuated for a few weeks after Sept. 11.
Some spent the money on mundane items. Lin Wang, a freshman, bought sandpaper. "I finally sanded the hinges of my roommate's squeaky drawer," she said.
A romantically inclined student approached a girl he had been admiring in class and asked her to join him for dinner in Little Italy. Another went out to get a fake ID card south of Washington Square. Why? "So I can further stimulate the economy," the student said.
Many students spent their cash on frivolous items, from expensive nail extensions to a good haircut to a second ear piercing. Others added to the money and escaped from their meal plans at downtown restaurants, or defrayed the cost of Broadway shows, from "Les Miserables" to "Reefer Madness."
"They were floored when I told them I was giving them money," Professor Snodgrass said. "They couldn't have been happier than if I announced they were all getting A's." JESAMYN M. GO

HEADLINE: Voices From a Place on the Verge 

BYLINE:  By ANNE HEMMETT STERN 

 BODY:
ONLY yesterday, or so it seems, the meatpacking district on the far West Side of Manhattan was the hottest place in the city. Restaurants, nightspots and expensive retailers were sprouting with a vengeance among the wholesale meat houses. By late summer, even as the economy sagged, the cluster of blocks south of 14th Street and west of Ninth Avenue seemed destined to become a second SoHo.
 Then, as a bright September morning shockingly turned black, the district suddenly found itself on the frontier of Manhattan's shutdown. Its shiny future seemed uncertain. 
 News on the home front and abroad remains bleak, and a scrim of dread continues to shroud the city. At the same time, sporadically but unmistakably, the meatpacking district is eyeing the future. The 24-hour activity has resumed. High-heeled shoppers in designer clothes pick their way over the Belgian cobblestones, past meatpackers wearing blood-smeared white jackets. In front of stylish new galleries, the streets are often clogged with trucks and workers. Clubs and signature restaurants, like Pastis on Ninth Avenue, are packed once more on the weekends. 
There's construction, too. A new restaurant called Meet is being built in a vacant meatpacking plant at Gansevoort and Washington Streets, and an another, operated by the four-star chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, will open in a warehouse at Ninth Avenue and 13th Street. Developers are seeking permission to erect a slender, 32-story residential tower designed by the illustrious French architect Jean Nouvel and flanked by two smaller buildings, in the heart of the district, although preservation groups see the project as a threat to the district's character. The fierce debate over a proposal to designate the Gansevoort Market as a historic district has resumed. Both the tower and the landmarking issue are bubbling up in meetings of Community Board 2. The district's eventfulness has returned. 
The story of the meatpacking district, however, is not simply about real estate. More centrally, it is about the diverse inhabitants -- old-timers reluctantly moving on, newcomers staking a claim -- of this fast-changing neighborhood. It is their stories that give a human face to the transformation taking place.
Before Sept. 11, they were already being swept along in the powerful wake of urban change. Afterward, life seemed to slow to a near stop. But like the rest of the city, those in the district are struggling to find ways to move on. Here are their voices.

Metal Sculptor
Jeffery Mase
Jeffery Mase moved to the district in 1980, at 22. He had just finished art school at New York University, and his 1,400-square-foot ground-floor space on Ninth Avenue, previously a meatpacking plant, rented for $450 a month. 
"I like a grittier New York, personally," he said of the changes in the district. A compact man with a serious demeanor, he recalls the meatpackers of the early, lawless days "in white, bloody jackets with pistols in their pockets and cigars in their mouths." By contrast, many shoppers at the new stores strike him as "well-dressed women with baby-doll faces." 
Mr. Mase can usually be found welding at a vast workbench in his studio while jazz pours from a stereo. His commissions include the marquee entryway of City Hall, the fancy Duane Street restaurant, but he also creates his own pieces, some of which he describes as "vignettes of a vanishing New York." The host of an informal salon, he often throws back his welder's mask to greet other artists who regularly pop by to borrow books or chat. They sit on stools by his old forge stove, reading, or settle into the sofa, often staying on for dinner parties. 
Having spent more than half his life working and living in the district, Mr. Mase calls his studio "my anchor." But like many other local artists, he will soon be leaving. He has struck a deal with his landlord -- he wouldn't say for how much -- and will be out of the district by February.

AFTER SEPT. 11
"I know a lot of people are talking about leaving New York right now. It might be the sensible thing to do, but I don't feel it." He plans to stay in the city he loves. "I saw a space the other day," he said. "A block from the World Trade Center." Has the attack affected his work? "I think work is overrated," he replied.

Co-owner, Heller Gallery
Michael Heller
With his close-cropped gray hair and impeccable attire, Mr. Heller often acts as the public face of Heller Gallery, which he owns with his brother, Douglas. But Michael Heller exhibits a reserve similar to that of his ever-present basenji, a breed of dog known for not barking. 
"Having been pushed off Madison Avenue, I sympathize with the meatpackers," said Mr. Heller, 51, who was born and raised in Far Rockaway, Queens. "But I limit my sympathy, because they're out of step with the times."
The first Heller Gallery opened on Madison Avenue 27 years ago, quickly moving to the more affordable but relatively desolate SoHo. Two years ago the brothers made a similar landing, on West 14th Street near Washington Street. With expansive wood floors and pristine white walls, the gallery has a churchlike quality. It is hard to believe that meat hooks once rattled along overhead rails. Light glances off glasswork, the gallery's specialty, casting color into the air. In this space, the Hellers sell lustrous decorative art objects that can fetch tens of thousands of dollars apiece.

AFTER SEPT. 11
"I still get emotional talking about it," Mr. Heller said of the attack. "And I don't generally show much emotion." Though he and his brother are, in his words, "reassessing everything; advertising, everything," Mr. Heller has no worries about the gallery's long-term future. "We're still selling things," he said. "And we do believe the opposite of war is creation, including art." Even at this moment, a new installation of massive pieces cast in the Czech Republic is taking shape.

Owner, Master Purveyors
Sam Solasz
Sam Solasz, a Polish-born survivor of the Nazi concentration camp Treblinka, came to America in 1951. "I went to the meatpacking district the day I got off the boat," he said. "That afternoon, I got a job." Now 73, Mr. Solasz and his two sons own Master Purveyors, whose customers he describes as "the finest hotels and restaurants in New York," including Peter Luger and the Hilton Hotel chain. "By me, you can eat off the floor in the coolers," he said. 
For 44 years Master Purveyors was on 13th Street near Washington Street. But last spring the landlord refused to renew the lease, and the company relocated to Hunts Point Terminal Market, a 60-acre site in the Bronx surrounded by chain-link fence topped with razor wire. "Reminds you like you're in the war," Mr. Solasz said, his blue eyes clouding. "In a camp." 
His bright yellow trucks must travel much farther to reach their customers, and Mr. Solasz misses his old digs. "It was so alive," he said of the district during its heyday, which extended from the 50's through the 70's. "You couldn't move on the streets. There were five policemen on horses taking care of the traffic. You took an hour to get out of the market." He shook his head. "Today, you're flying through."

AFTER SEPT. 11
"Somebody above is watching over us," Mr. Solasz said of his good fortune at being far from the site of the attack. The company's accounts included Windows on the World and the Millennium Hilton, which together, he said, brought in $100,000 a month. "I feel bad, sick to my stomach," he said, saying he has lost many friends with whom he had done business for years. "Now the plan is to pick up more business to cover the losses. We'll get it."

Owner, Restaurant Florent
Florent Morellet
Born in France, educated as a city planner in London, Florent Morellet came to New York in 1978. Learning that he was H.I.V. positive seven years later, he nonetheless radiates energy and occasionally presides over his restaurant in drag. "People always call me a pioneer," said Mr. Morellet, 48. "I don't see myself as that. I came to the market because I liked it, not to change it." 
Change it he did, opening Florent in 1985, drawing a trendy crowd to a gritty outpost. But Mr. Morellet worries that the neighborhood's distinctive character may soon be erased, and as a result he is a co-chairman of the Save Gansevoort Market Task Force, which is seeking landmark designation for the market. On Bastille Day last July, the restaurant held its annual party, featuring can-can girls and drag-queen chanteuses. Mr. Morellet held court as "Meat Market Marie" (Antoinette), wearing a tiara made of plastic steak garnished with faux hot dogs, perched atop a cloud of white wig. The headpiece's trim, along with the busboys' aprons, smeared with fake blood, read, "Save Gansevoort Market."

AFTER SEPT. 11
"The show must go on," Mr. Morellet said of his business, adding that the activity has helped keep his mind off the "depression and horror and depth" of the attacks. "I want to keep doing whatever I've been doing." This includes going "full steam ahead" with the task force's campaign and, on Halloween, holding a party at Florent with a Catholic school theme at which he dressed as a mother superior. "I'm a recession-free type of restaurant," he said. "People always want to go somewhere fun."

Transgender Prostitute
Kelly Michaels
"This year has been all-out war on transgender prostitutes," said Kelly Michaels, absently hiking up the straps of her purple tank top and cream-colored bra. Hormone therapy and surgery have made her look feminine, although she hasn't been able to afford a full sex change. Ms. Michaels, now 30, said she has worked the streets since her parents abandoned her in a Los Angeles bus station when she was 8. Five years later she found her way to New York and soon discovered the meatpacking district. 
"This used to be a street of opportunity where a girl in her right mind could survive," said Ms. Michaels, who lives in an S.R.O. building in Harlem. As she remembers the 80's, "If you came down here, you were either a trucker, a hooker or a john." Now it's harder to find business, but work gets done. 
"I got to go," she said. "I got a trick coming." The trick was a clean-cut young man in a silver Mercedes with New Jersey plates and a baby seat in the back. No deal, though. "He asked me if I like dolls," said Ms. Michaels, turning away from the car in her high-heeled black boots. "And they call us the freaks."

AFTER SEPT. 11
How has she been since the attack? "Fine," Ms. Michaels said somberly. "I didn't know anybody that died or anything like that." She said she earned about $100 a night before Sept. 11, but that has dropped to less than $200 a week. "People are angry right now," she said. "They're looking for someone to take it out on. I don't think they're picking us up now for sex. They're picking us up to get that grudge out." Since the attack, she has also noticed more bottle-throwing and harassment, usually from people with flags on their cars. "It's rough enough that it's forcing girls to look for other options," she said. She herself hopes to be off the streets before winter, leaving her S.R.O. and working as a dominatrix out of an apartment.

Concession Stand Operator
Jason Adame
"Every time I got the chance, I snuck out of school and went down there," said Jason Adame, 20, who started spending time in the district when he was 11. He would help his father, then the superintendent of 430 West 14th Street. Later, the son started working in the concession stand outside the building, which his father still runs.
The stand leans like a discarded appliance box against the Washington Street side of No. 430. Through a sliding plexiglass window, Mr. Adame and his father sell snacks, from Power Bars to beef jerky. They could soon see competition from Starbucks, but their top-selling item, a cup of coffee, still goes for 65 cents. 
When Mr. Adame walks through the neighborhood, meatpackers honk their horns and wave from their trucks. Having known them since he was a child, he automatically waves back. "They look out for me," Mr. Adame said. Like so many salty uncles, they taught him about contraception, kept him out of fights and urged him to stay off drugs. They also gave him driving lessons in their trucks. 
When Club Mother was open on the building's ground floor during the 1990's, the stand's late-night clientele was a mix of meatpackers, clubgoers and transvestites. "I remember one time when I was about 14," Mr. Adame said, "and a man in a black mask and leash and leather underwear was being led into the club. The meat guys just laughed." The stand is open from 1 a.m. to 1 p.m. to accommodate the meatpackers. But as they continue to leave the district, business is steadily dwindling.

AFTER SEPT. 11
"We used to be all confident," Mr. Adame said, referring to Americans in general, "and now a piece of that is gone." Before the attack, the stand brought in $600 or $700 a day. Now the take is $200 to $400, he said. With business still fading, the Adames have decided to leave the stand later this year. The father has already gone back to Chilpancingo, the small city in Guerrero, Mexico, where he was born, and the son plans to join him once the stand closes for good. "I'll take a nice little vacation," he said. Then he will either study architecture or open a clothing store in Mexico. "We'll see how it goes," he said. "First I've got to sharpen up my Spanish."

HEADLINE: The Glorious, the Gaudy: 5 Decades of T-Birds 

BYLINE:  By JIM MOTAVALLI 

 BODY:
THE lights dim, the curtain rises and glamorous fashion models pull the wraps off the retro-styled, nostalgia-inducing 2002 Ford Beaver.
Doesn't sound right, does it?
 Yet the name of nature's dam builder was once considered for the car now known as the Thunderbird, whose rich history reaches back to the 1955 model year. Or the T-Bird might have been called the Detroiter, a name whose luster faded as the fortunes of the Motor City declined. And another label once considered, the Hep Cat, would seem as hip today as "23 skidoo." 
 It was a young Ford stylist, Alden Giberson, who gave the Thunderbird its evocative name. Having lived in the Southwest, he had heard the Native American legend about a creature whose flapping wings created thunder and winds. The name stuck -- Mr. Giberson was rewarded with a $95 suit -- and Ford rolled out its two-seat convertible as an answer to Chevrolet's sporty Corvette. To most buyers, it didn't matter that the pretty skin covered off-the-rack Ford parts, or that vague steering and a low-revving V-8 made the T-Bird more suitable for turnpike cruising than for weekend racing.
In 47 years, the Thunderbird has come full circle: from jaunty two-seater to flashy personal coupe to bloated luxury barge -- and now, back to its roots. And even as the new car evokes Ford's glory days of the 50's, the company is returning to day-to-day control by a member of the founding family, for the first time in more than two decades. Last week, William Clay Ford Jr. became chief executive as well as chairman.
Few cars are as evocative of the 50's as the 1955-57 T-Birds. While the models that followed sold better, only the two-seaters qualify as American icons. Still, some other generations are of interest to collectors, and the arrival of the '02 Thunderbird, after an absence of four years, may stimulate a broader interest in previous models.
"I think the new car will complement the old ones," said Al Walentis of Mount Penn, Pa., who runs a Web site, TBirdFans.com. "This will help build interest."
The T-Bird supports several national collector clubs. Rick Carey, an automotive historian in Mystic, Conn., said he did not expect the new car's arrival to affect prices of early models very much. "The supply of classic T-Birds is pretty substantial, so a blip in demand can be met without forcing prices up," he said.
Here is a look at each generation of T-Birds, and how they have fared in the used-car market:

CLASSIC BIRDS The T-Bird roadster may have been hastily conceived to compete with the Corvette, but it was an instant success. The entire production run was sold out, and there were waiting lists of eager customers.
The early T-Bird underwent small changes during its three-year run. In '56, the car got a 12-volt electrical system, the famous porthole hardtop and a "continental kit" -- a covered spare tire perched on the rear bumper. Larger but graceful tailfins arrived for '57.
It is easy to understand the enduring popularity of these cars, which look good from any angle and represent a rare instance of restraint from a period of over-the-top styling. And the car succeeded in its principal task: slaying the Corvette in the market. In just three years, Ford sold 53,000 T-Birds, more than three times the Corvette's total for five years.
Early Thunderbirds have always been popular with collectors, so there are many restored examples at premium prices. A rare supercharged "F" Bird once owned by the animator Mel Blanc brought $145,500 at a Christie's auction in 1997. A fairly plain '56 sold for $178,500 in 1999 -- but its first owner was Frank Sinatra.
Sales: 14,190 in model-year '55; 16,763 in '56; 15,173 in '57
1955 base price: $2,695
Recent prices: $30,000 ('55, full frame-off restoration); $65,000 ('56, perfect and unrestored, driven just 89 miles); $100,000 (rare, supercharged '57)

SQUARE BIRDS For 1958, Ford sought to broaden the T-Bird's appeal by adding a back seat. The square, four-passenger model was no sports car: it weighed more than a big Ford sedan. Still, it won on racetracks.
Motor Trend magazine made the '58 its Car of the Year. Annual sales quadrupled those of the two-seater, proving that the change made good business sense. The styling has a certain blunt appeal today, and prices are gradually rising. A concours-winning '60 convertible brought $54,000 at the Barrett-Jackson auction in Scottsdale, Ariz., in January.
Sales: 48,482 in 1958; 72,859 in '59; 81,555 in '60
1958 base prices: $3,630 hardtop; $3,914 convertible
Recent prices: $22,500 ('60 convertible, good driver); $8,500 ('58 hardtop, needs work)

BULLET BIRDS These cars' clean lines fit neatly with the era's fascination with space exploration and supersonic flight. The oversize round taillights looked like jet turbines and the interior resembled an airplane cockpit (complete with "Swing-Away" steering wheel). As for performance, a '61 hardtop with a 390-cubic-inch V-8 could reach 60 m.p.h. in 8.5 seconds, despite a weight of two tons-plus.
The most sought-after model today is the Sports Roadster, which mimicked a two-seater with a rather odd fiberglass cover over the rear seats. A very original '63 Sports Roadster with a 340-horsepower tri-power engine and desirable Kelsey-Hayes wire wheels brought $84,800 at last year's Barrett-Jackson auction.
Sales: 85,142 in 1961; 74,306 in '62; 67,871 in '63
1961 base prices: $4,170 hardtop; $4,637 convertible
Recent prices: $14,500 ('61 hardtop, all original); $23,900 ('62 Sports Roadster, restored)

FLIGHT BIRDS If 1961-63 T-Birds hinted at the Space Age, those of 1964-66 looked as though they were ready to take off, complete with "Flight Deck" instrument panel. Power disc brakes (an option on the '65) meant that the T-Bird could stop as well as go. On the '65 and '66, the rear turn signals lighted in sequence, like a neon sign on the Las Vegas Strip.
These are considered the last of the classic Thunderbirds, and because of 60's nostalgia, they retain a strong following. Landau models, which came with vinyl roofs and fake carriage trim, were the most expensive hardtops.
Sales: 85,661 in 1964; 72,132 in 1965; 68,816 in 1966
1964 prices: $4,486 hardtop; $4,589 Landau; $4,853 convertible
Recent prices: $6,950 ('64 Landau, good driver); $14,500 ('66 convertible, unrestored)

FLIGHTLESS BIRDS "The 1967 Thunderbird represents one of the most dramatic styling changes in industry history," Ford says. But many collectors say the shift from sporty to luxurious was a change for the worse. All T-Birds had put on weight and society airs, and a new four-door model made purists cringe. The public's response was lukewarm, and it remains so today.
Sales: 57,313 in 1967; 67,373 in '68; 49,381 in '69
1967 prices: $4,603, two-door hardtop; $4,704, two-door Landau; $4,825, four-door Landau
Recent price: $3,895 ('69 two-door Landau)

BEAKED BIRDS The '70 T-Bird thrust an aggressive, Pontiac-style nose at an indifferent public. Insurers hated the accident-prone prow, and owners griped about pumping premium fuel for the thirsty 429-cubic-inch V-8. Prices went up and sales went down despite a "Special Brougham package" and lots of gadgets.
Sales: 40,868 in 1970; 41,801 in '71
1970 prices: $4,961, two-door hardtop; $5,104, two-door Landau; $5,182, four-door Landau
Recent price: $3,000 ('70 Landau)

FLABBY BIRDS Given the chance to redesign the Thunderbird completely, Lee A. Iacocca, Ford's president, ignored the fading cries of purists and made the '72 even bigger and more ostentatious. Now based on the Lincoln Continental Mark IV, the T-Bird weighed in at more than 4,500 pounds before options. The lapse in taste was rewarded with higher sales, though interest flagged quickly after the '73 model. Collectors are perfectly happy to let these cars rust away, though there's a spark of interest in the one-millionth T-Bird, an Anniversary Gold '72 with a commemorative plaque.
Sales: 58,731 in 1972; 79,759 in '73; 47,646 in '74; 36,803 in '75; 91,104 in '76
1972 price: $5,293, two-door
Recent price: $2,500 (1972, new paint, 105,000 miles)

SHRUNKEN BIRDS After the nation's first fuel crisis, the Thunderbird -- 10 inches shorter and 900 pounds lighter -- was a shadow of its former self. Though the new car was based on the Ford LTD, it was still rococo, with "opera windows" in the roof pillars and concealed headlights beside a square, convex grille.
The public liked the smaller size, and they loved the upscale Town Landau, with an aluminum applique that wrapped over the roof. After purchase, owners were mailed a personalized "gold finished" nameplate. Even more sought-after is the Diamond Jubilee Edition, commemorating Ford's 75th anniversary. Color choices included Pastel Beige with Ember vinyl roof. The Jubilee even had owners' initials hand-painted on the doors. Proving that there's no accounting for taste, these were the best-selling Birds ever.
Sales: 322,517 in 1977; 304,430 in '78; 215,698 in '79
Original prices: $5,063, '77 hardtop; $10,106, '78 Diamond Jubilee
Recent price: $2,500 ('78 Diamond Jubilee, needs work)

LOW-RENT BIRDS Downsizing continued with the 1980 models, based on the pedestrian Ford Fairmont. Still, T-Bird styling cues abounded, including opera windows, neoclassic grille and covered headlights.
In '80, Ford used yet another anniversary gimmick: the T-Bird's 25th birthday. Owners of the high-priced Silver Anniversary car could sink into "velvetlike knit velour" seats. One advantage of the downsizing was better fuel economy: 29 m.p.g. on the highway. In 1981, Ford shocked purists by introducing a six-cylinder engine. Sales plunged.
Sales: 127,248 in 1980; 69,775 in '81; 49,585 in '82
1980 prices: $6,432, hardtop; $10,036, Town Landau; $11,679, Silver Anniversary
Recent price: $3,000 (46,000-mile '80 in original condition)

AERO BIRDS The T-Bird finally flew again in 1983, with aerodynamic styling that presaged the future Taurus and was considered radical in its day. To the chagrin of buyers over 40, the traditional look was out as Ford pursued youth. A new model, the performance-oriented Turbo Coupe, could be ordered with a five-speed manual transmission and special handling packages. Enthusiasts, and the automotive press, went wild.
Sales: 134,710 in 1983; 154,865 in '84; 157,209 in '85; 140,713 in '86; 132,623 in '87; 117,866 in '88
1983 prices: $9,485, V-8 hardtop; $12,516, Heritage; $11,790, Turbo Coupe
Recent price: $2,000 (Turbo Coupe, loaded, 95,000 miles)

SUPER BIRDS Ford spent more than $1 billion to develop the '89, and for its money, it got a handsome wedge shape. Young men lusted for the year's favorite car-magazine cover model, the Super Coupe, which used a supercharger to extract 215 horsepower from the 3.8-liter V-6. Nascar wins helped to bring customers into showrooms, too.
Traditionalists wanted the V-8 back, and Ford obliged in 1991 with the motor from the 5.0 Mustang. But the market for coupes was shrinking; when sales sank below 70,000 in 1997, Ford clipped the T-Bird's wings and a five-year hiatus began.
Sales: 120,645 in 1989; 106,124 in '90; 74,189 in '91; 84,186 in '92; 122,415 in '93; 130,713 in '94; 104,254 in '95; 68,577 in '97
1989 prices: $14,612, coupe; $16,817, LX; $19,823, Super Coupe
Recent prices: $2,000 ('89 Super Coupe, loaded)

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: TIMES SQUARE; 
On Once-Bawdy 42nd Street, The Last Dirty Picture Show

BYLINE:  By KELLY CROW 

 BODY:
Perhaps Peep-O-Rama, at 121 West 42nd Street near Avenue of the Americas, never meant to make history. Awkwardly sandwiched between a Tad's Broiled Steaks and a Touch of New York souvenir shop, its neon red-and-black marquee is kept unlighted,day and night. Inside, the workers behind the counter are polite but reticent. 
 Recently, though, Peep-O-Rama, a sex video store, became the last of its kind along the entire stretch of 42nd Street, a lone survivor of Times Square's seamy past. Three similar stores on the same block have closed in the past year; the latest shut down in late summer. Ten other sex-oriented shops still dot the area, down from 96 in 1977 and 35 in 1987. But only Peep-O-Rama remains on what was once the most X-rated of streetwalking strips, 42nd Street. 
 By the turn of the last century, the street from Madison to Eighth Avenues was lined with "silk hat" brothels and burlesques; discreet men in carriages gave way to giddy soldiers on leave in wartime. During the Depression, male prostitutes filled its sidewalks as barkers lured customers into theaters to see nude dancers.
By efforts of reform and economy, those establishments gave way to the "Midnight Cowboy" era of peep shows, massage parlors, pornographic bookstores and strip clubs in the 1960's and 1970's. Through it all, there were campaigns to clean up the Square, most famously in 1995, when the city passed strict zoning laws governing sex-related businesses. High real estate prices also did their part; the street now glows with multiplexes, a corporate sheen. 
Two weeks ago, a City Council committee approved amendments to the 1995 laws, including tighter definitions aimed at what officials call "sham compliance" by video stores and bookstores. But could a case ever be made for preserving Peep-O-Rama or its facade for Times Square posterity? 
Discussion is scarce. The Landmarks Preservation Commission and the New-York Historical Society would not comment; neither would the Mayor's Office of Midtown Management.
Gary Brandt, a landlord of the shop, said Peep-O-Rama had been on 42nd Street since 1950, first as an adult movie theater. Mr. Brandt said he was not sure how long the business would stay open, although, he added: "The character of this street is so well documented in movies and books and tourists' snapshots that the store is already in a time capsule of sorts. Any historical designation rings hollow to me."
But for William R. Taylor, editor of "Inventing Times Square" (Johns Hopkins, 1991), the lasting presence of a sex-oriented shop on 42nd Street is as significant as the Tenement Museum of the Lower East Side.
"A big city should, in some way, be able to write its autobiography in places," he said. "New Yorkers love our underworld in film and fiction, so it makes sense to somehow preserve it in reality." KELLY CROW

HEADLINE: The Sex-Worker Literati 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
TRACY QUAN, the 30-something author of "Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl," sat in the generic chill of an Upper East Side Starbucks and talked about how one goes about having sex with strangers for money. 
 "See that building?" she asked, narrowing her almond-shape eyes at an anonymous tile brick apartment across First Avenue. "It's a perfect working-girl apartment. It's anonymous, there's no nosy doorman, but it's still an appropriate building in a relatively safe place." She laughed and added: "And I ought to know." 
 American readers ought to know, too, if the onslaught of new books by strippers, prostitutes, hustlers and pornographic film actors is any indication. Suddenly, it appears that sex for hire is to pop literature what cocaine and models were to fiction in the 1980's and Prozac was to the memoirs of the 90's -- obligatory references in works aspiring to urban realism. 
Whether a novel about prostitution like Ms. Quan's or a memoir of a male street hustler in Hollywood, the books are selling and, to the annoyance of some critics, trying to be part of a no-shock zone in American culture. At least one Barnes & Noble, on East 86th Street, displayed Ms. Quan's "Diary of a Manhattan Call Girl" alongside Harry Potter books and "Jack: Straight From the Gut," the best seller by John F. Welch Jr., retired chairman of General Electric.
Though some critics see the genre as only the latest attempt to market titillation, their authors insist their aspirations are mainly literary. In the last 18 months, at least a dozen books have explored the inner lives of prostitutes or strippers. Rick Whitaker's memoir of male prostitution, "Assuming the Position" (published by Four Walls Eight Windows), was followed by J. T. LeRoy's "Sarah" (Bloomsbury), an autobiographical novel about a 12-year-old boy who so idolizes his addict-prostitute mother that he dresses like a girl and performs sex acts at a truck stop. Mr. LeRoy's work has achieved cult status since Courtney Love and Angelina Jolie conducted a public fight over which actress would play the role of the addict-prostitute in the film.
In recent months, along with Ms. Quan's autobiographical novel, Lily Burana's "Strip City" (Talk Miramax) and Alexa Albert's "Brothel: Mustang Ranch and Its Women" (Random House) have also been selling well. And Tristan Taormino, an author of sexual how-to manuals -- her most recent is "Pucker Up: A Hands-On Guide to Ecstatic Sex" (HarperCollins) -- said she was now working on a personal book. 
Early next year, HarperCollins will publish David Henry Starry's memoir, "Chicken: Self Portrait of a Young Man for Rent," and in the spring will reissue "The Happy Hooker," Xaviera Hollander's 1970's best seller. And Ms. Hollander has been signed to write a memoir about discovering her sexuality as a child. 
Reviews for Mr. LeRoy's and Ms. Burana's books have generally been favorable. Ann Powers, writing in The New York Times Book Review, described "Sarah" as "a wonderfully dirty, picaresque roman a clef." Also in the Book Review, Kate Sekules praised Ms. Burana's "candid, juicy, streetwise prose." 
On the other hand, Michiko Kakutani, commenting on Ms. Albert's book in The Times, said it "provides an often intriguing look at the economics and emotional dynamics of the brothel but is seriously undermined by the author's lack of reportorial skills."
Sex memoirs are nearly as old as the world's oldest profession. The 11th-century "Tale of Genji" is a biographical account of the sexual exploits of a Japanese prince in the demimonde. Some critics argue that the current rush of titles originates not in an increasingly sex-obsessed America but in changing feminist attitudes. Susan Griffin, the author of "The Book of the Courtesans" (Broadway), a history of courtesanship from ancient Greece to the belle epoque, published this year, says that in the last decade many academic feminists have shifted their position on prostitution. 
"Feminists are now starting to look at sex work as an undeniable part of women's lives, and not with such a baleful, shameful eye," she said. "This is something that women have had to resort to when options were narrow, and let's not join in the chorus of moralizers -- who often, by the way, are the patrons -- but let's study sex work as we would any other phenomenon in our society."
Ms. Burana, who stripped her way across the United States for her book after she became engaged, said she was secretive when she started as a stripper because she feared the disapproval of friends. 
"It was the late 80's, and feminist politics were strict," she said. "Then the stick got bent in the other direction. Suddenly it was 'Stripper power! Thumbs up!' " 
Think of these books, Ms. Burana instructed, as the literary equivalent of thong panties. Ten years ago, only professional strippers wore thongs, she said. Now average women buy them at Kmart and Victoria's Secret. An elevated sexuality in popular culture -- Britney Spears's hot pants, the charged images in music videos -- saturated the country when Ms. Burana wrote her book, she said. In 1997, when she started the strip tour, she was able to find appropriate outfits only in boutiques that catered to the sex industry. 
"By 2000, I was buying my outfits at Contempo," she said, referring to a shopping-mall clothing chain. "The clothes for teenagers have become so strippified. I was a little alarmed. These aren't clothes for a 30-year-old. These are for 16-year-old girls who are going to a party with their peers. All of a sudden I had this mad flash of protective conservatism. But it was a cultural marker." 
Christine Stolba, a senior fellow at the Independent Women's Forum, a conservative research institute in Arlington, Va., said she thought of the sex books as "a self-centered literary seraglio." 
"We're not so blase, even in the post-Clinton years," Ms. Stolba added. "We know that this is different than being on Temptation Island. The big problem I have with these books is that the authors think their personal experience has anything to teach society at large. I don't think a fun book about being a prostitute is going to teach women, especially young women, anything of value." 
Furthermore, Ms. Stolba said, the memoirs are a bald attempt to cash in on titillating subject matter. 
That's a line of attack that Ms. Burana said she had heard before. 
"There is that accusation that you are Gordon Gekko in spandex, and that this is all about greed and opportunism," she said. "To suggest that these books are about opportunism is the critical equivalent of saying, 'Your mama wears army boots.' " 
Ms. Quan said she was unaffected by criticism of her motives.
Besides, she said, she has hit her own cultural milestone. She is to appear with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist at the Meet the Authors Night and Book Fair in Washington on Nov. 28. 
"If that's not being part of the Establishment, I don't know what is," she said. "I can't wait."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Rumbles Of Warning As Housing Weakens

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
THE already sinking American economy is developing a new leak. 
 The leak is in housing, not only home construction but also home sales, home prices, home remodeling, rents, brokerage fees -- the whole industry. All have weakened since June, by enough to pull down the growth rate of the entire economy. Instead of contracting at an annual rate of four-tenths of a percent in the third quarter, as the government said last week, the economy would have declined only half that much, just two-tenths of a percent, if housing had been as strong in the third quarter as it was in the second. 
 "People were asking me only a couple of months ago if a bubble was developing in home prices, like the bubble that developed in high-tech stocks," said Nicholas Retsinas, director of Harvard's Joint Center on Housing Studies, referring to the persistent strength in housing that defied a sinking stock market and economy. "They are not asking me that question anymore, absolutely not."
The leak is still small. No one is claiming that home prices are actually falling, at least not most home prices. But they are rising more slowly. The statistical and anecdotal evidence is now clear on that point, and on a couple of others. Without anyone having really noticed, sales of new and existing homes have inched downward since June, despite steadily falling mortgage rates. And home construction is off its peak, having begun to fall before Sept. 11, and certainly afterward. 
Anecdotal evidence of a weakening housing sector is also proliferating. Mr. Retsinas, for example, says landlords in Boston, his hometown, are beginning to offer rental incentives. Without lowering the actual rent, they are waiving payment for the first month or two. "That way, the amount on the lease remains unchanged, and thus the value of the rental dwelling," he said. 
In Cincinnati, Sibcy Cline, that city's biggest real estate broker, reports that inventories of unsold homes are rising, and while actual sales have not dropped, home prices are going up much more slowly -- at a 2.5 percent annual pace, half the rate early this year. "People selling their homes are becoming more realistic about the prices they are asking," said Robert Sibcy, the chief executive. 
Mr. Sibcy shares many forecasters' view that the economy will rebound by early next year, before layoffs and rising unemployment begin to really affect housing. "Housing may just miss the recession," he said. 
Or housing may swing from a source of support for the economy to a drag, as the third-quarter data suggests. Falling mortgage rates may have kept housing robust through many months of sluggish economic growth, but other factors are now weighing in. The surge in layoffs and the terrorist attacks appear to be making people cautious, particularly about buying a home. Then, too, falling stock prices may finally be taking their toll on housing; while stocks were rising, wealthier households used the gains to remodel or to buy new homes. The housing market, in effect, may be following the stock market down. 
Whatever the explanation, housing has a multiplier effect potentially greater than that of the stock market. Housing, not stocks, is the principal asset for the middle 60 percent of all households, those with annual incomes of $30,000 to $75,000, according to Edward N. Wolff, a New York University economist who studies household wealth and income.
WHEN home prices rise, these households feel wealthier and are quicker to spend their weekly pay. And when mortgage rates drop at the same time, there is a great willingness to refinance and turn, say, a $100,000 mortgage into $105,000, for the same monthly payment. 
Refinancing has indeed surged, and half the households that refinanced in the last year increased their mortgages, Mr. Retsinas said. They cashed out the extra equity from rising home prices. That extra cash, available for consumption, helped to prevent a sluggishly growing economy from tipping into contraction, until last July. The wealth effect from rising home values turned out to be enough to offset the damage from the plunge in stock prices. 
Now new studies are turning up "strong evidence," as Robert J. Shiller, a Yale economist, put it, that variations in housing market wealth have much more effect on consumption than any wealth effect from stocks. The stock market grabbed the headlines as the great source of stimulus in the booming 1990's, while housing did the heavy lifting. And now that housing is shifting toward reverse, mortgage refinancing is likely to become more of a means of lowering installment payments than sustaining consumer spending. The damage to the economy could be considerable.

HEADLINE: Word for Word/Sept. 11 Seminars; 
Academe on War: Man (and Woman) The Psychobabble Detectors!

BYLINE:  By TOM KUNTZ 

 BODY:
AMERICA is at war, and following suit, the nation's professoriate is rapidly deploying courses. Notably, the University of California at Los Angeles has just launched 49 undergraduate seminars across a range of disciplines to address "the innumerable issues arising out of the events of Sept. 11." The courses include "Navigating Between Blithesome Optimism and Cultural Despair" and "Implications of World Crises for Student Stress and Academic Achievement: Coping Strategies."
 Eyebrows are already being raised. Citing the U.C.L.A. courses and other such developments in the United States, Bryan Appleyard, in a commentary for The Sunday Times of London, wrote that "an unprecedented assault on mainland America is being turned into sentimental psychobabble, an occasion for nationwide counseling or politically correct pseudo-courses." 
 But judge for yourself. Here are excerpts from some of the course descriptions (a couple with grammatical errors), posted on U.C.L.A.'s Web site at www.college.ucla.edu/hnrs98. TOM KUNTZ
Course: "Navigating Between Blithesome Optimism and Cultural Despair"
Instructor's description: I intend to share the sense of crisis about my teaching mission that I experienced on Sept. 11, and examine the context of Enlightenment values that have given meaning to my life's work. My faith in the unlimited creativity of human beings in solving the problems of their environment, in the capacity of the imagination to invent new solutions to economic, physical and psychological dilemmas, in the liberation of mental energy and fresh ideas from the fetters of dogma and fear, was sorely tested on that fateful Tuesday. I will attempt to dissect and comprehend the events through their representations, for only through understanding can we prevent future recurrences of such events.
Course: "Women's Participation in Political Violence"
Description: The course poses the question: What is women's relationship to political violence? Using a feminist lens, the course examines the participation of women in radical political movements in the late 20th-century United States. Women are often not the director actors in violent acts; more often they are victims, participants or accomplices. The course tries to understand the motivations, complex behaviors and world views of radical women.
Course: "Echoes of Terror in Brain, Mind and Literature"
Description: Traumatic historical events, such as those of Sept. 11, evoke both shared and highly individual responses. In this seminar, we will discuss ways in which people cope with public terror in their lives. We will examine the neurobiological and psychological effects of terror and the transformation of these responses into creative expression.
Course: "What the U.S. Should Do to Be Popular in the Third World"
Description: The reasons for the unpopularity of the U.S. government in the third world are examined. The persistently negative reaction of the Latin American left wing against U.S. trade policies; the 20th-century condemnations of the U.S. by essentially all communist countries; the Ugly American in Southeast Asia; the demonstrations against our W.T.O. meetings; and the growing Arab hatred of the U.S.: Are these hatreds coincidental? What do they have in common? Although our policy makers clearly desire to help these countries, have we subconsciously evolved policies that are highly economically inefficient and essentially exploitative of the third world?
Course: "Implications of World Crises for Student Stress and Academic Achievement: Coping Strategies"
Description: sic Exploration of the relationship among world crises, students stress as they relate to student achievement. Students will maintain a journal during the quarter, including interviews of other students. Enrollment limited.
Course: Understanding the Unthinkable and Incomprehensible
Description: In this course we will try to understand two fundamental questions that are raised by events of Sept. 11. First, how can people unleash acts of terror on innocent citizens? Second, what are the consequences of mutual cultural ignorance? . . .
Course: "Terrorism and the Politics of Knowledge"
Description: While the world rightfully stands united in its condemnation of the bombings of Sept. 11, the American mainstream media has remained impervious to those critical voices which have also drawn attention to America's own record of imperialistic adventurism and the relation of the W.T.C. bombings to American excesses in Iraq, Sudan and the Middle East. This seminar asks fundamental questions about how we constitute terrorism and its agents. What are the categories of knowledge deployed to understand terror? Should the continuing sanctions against Iraq also be considered a form of terrorism? What is the relationship of the bin Ladens of this world to Western state terrorism? Who defines and names terrorism, with what authority, and with what consequences?
Course: "Culture and the Deferral of Violence"
Description: Exploration of the hypothesis that human language and culture sic is essentially a means of deferring violence, and its application to the current situation.
Course: "Terror & Society in Bergman's Films"
Description: Drawing on two films by Ingmar Bergman about terror, questions will be asked about the origins of terror in Society and, in particular, within male/female relationships. Possible reduction in the threat of terror will be explored.
Course: "War, Terror and Violence: Reflecting on Machiavelli"
Description: Is war a legitimate instrument of politics? Can war be a just act of the state? How do wars waged by states differ from acts of violence by individuals? Why is the word 'terror' used for some acts of violence? This seminar will explore these questions from the point of view expressed by Niccolo Machiavelli in parts of "The Prince," a book written almost five centuries ago but often cited today when such questions are discussed.
Course: "Literature as Mourning: China and Greece"
Description: Examines texts from world literature, especially the Chinese and Greek traditions, as responses to the loss of loved ones and as ways of managing, cultivating and redirecting the force of grief.
Course: "Beyond Tears: Evidence, Fact and Crisis"
Description: An exploration of the evidentiary concepts that may help students and citizens avoid being misled by those who manipulate crisis for their own ends.

HEADLINE: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS; 
Comfort Shopping, Premium Pricing

BYLINE:  By LYNNLEY BROWNING 

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn. 

 BODY:
FASHION-CONSCIOUS shoppers, distracted more by economic and political concerns than by the latest Prada tote, are shunning luxury goods. Purveyors of opulent wares are bracing for a lean Christmas. In Susie Hilfiger's opinion, that means it's a perfect time to sell $540 cashmere bunting bags for babies.
 Ms. Hilfiger, who is separated from the fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger, is the founder and owner of Best & Company, a retailer of costly clothing and furnishings for children. The private company, with a store in this leafy New York suburb of multimillionaires, is betting that in a world worried about the economy, anthrax and Afghanistan, wealthy Americans want what Ms. Hilfiger calls "comfort shopping." 
 In August, Best opened a boutique offering $510 hand-smocked silk toddler dresses and $4,700 rocking horses in Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan. It is preparing to photograph for a spring catalog in the West Indies, where some customers own estates. It is redesigning its Web site so that clients can buy a $5,000 Margarete Steiff toy giraffe or a $1,200 Silver Cross baby carriage online. And Ms. Hilfiger is thinking of opening shops across the country. 
In the uneasy world that has emerged since Sept. 11, Best strives to be Old World.
There is nothing Old World about prices at the store here, where leather club chairs nestle among Oriental rugs and sterling silver curl boxes line mahogany cabinets. There are $6,000 English pedal cars (an antique one costs $20,000) and $380 silk christening gowns. There are 19th-century embroidered cloths, first editions of children's books and hand-painted furniture from Dragons of Walton Street, which outfitted Prince William's nursery.
Best also sells children's basics like cotton baby shirts and Levi's, as well as other, more midrange items like $78 lamb's wool sweaters. The company seeks to be what Ms. Hilfiger calls a "lifestyle brand," with one-stop shopping and old-fashioned service -- sewing name labels into a boarding-school wardrobe, for example, or packing a camper's trunk with a Best riding habit.
"This is not a luxury experience," said Ms. Hilfiger, who has been a fashion designer for more than 20 years and has four children ages 6 through 16. "It's a timeless, sensible background. The way you feel when you shop here is like holding a warm cup of cocoa."
BEST resurrects the name and ambience of the fabled Fifth Avenue emporium that was a favorite among wealthy New Yorkers until it went bankrupt in 1971, after 122 years in business. Ms. Hilfiger acquired the trademark rights to the abandoned name without cost and opened the Greenwich shop in 1997.
Since the attacks, spending has been regarded as an almost patriotic duty. But the more frugal-minded may question the appropriateness of spending $350 on a cashmere baby throw in increasingly lean times.
Although people may be feeling a renewed commitment to family since Sept. 11, said Juliet Schor, a professor of consumer psychology at Boston College, "excess and exclusivity do not feel comfortable or important to people right now."
That was not necessarily the mood on a recent October afternoon at the 4,500-square-foot Best store here. Over the course of an hour, perhaps a dozen well-dressed customers came in to buy cashmere baby sweaters, bow ties and leather shoes. Six of the $4,700 rocking horses have been sold so far this year, more than in all of 2000. And sales of cashmere crib blankets have picked up this year, to about a dozen a month. 
"Right now, purchases for the self seem indulgent, but purchases for children reinforce a sense of family," said Ellen H. Keogh, 44, who as president of Best oversees its business. Ms. Hilfiger, 43, designs many of its clothes and decorates clients' nurseries and playrooms.
Sales at the Greenwich store dipped slightly after the attacks, and the drop notched down sales projections for the third and fourth quarters by 10 percent, said Ms. Keogh, who was previously a staffing manager at PepsiCo. About half the store's customers are from Greenwich -- many of them Wall Street executives -- and the remainder are from elsewhere in Connecticut as well as Long Island and New Jersey.
But the Bergdorf boutique, which opened in August, has not had a slowdown in recent weeks, said Ronald L. Frasch, chairman and chief executive of Bergdorf Goodman. 
"The person who's looking for a quality product for their children is still going to be looking for a quality product for their children," Mr. Frasch said. Sales had exceeded his expectations, he said, although he declined to provide figures. Anne Randell, a spokeswoman for Best, said sales of luxury products at the Bergdorf boutique were outpacing those at the Greenwich store.
ALTHOUGH Best's sales have quadrupled over the last four years, the company expects revenue this year of $7 million, the same as last year. Unlike many other retailers, Best said it had not canceled or reduced any orders from suppliers in recent months.
That does not surprise Gregory J. Furman, chairman of the Luxury Marketing Council, a trade group in New York. Amid economic and political uncertainty, he said, many wealthy shoppers want "things that bring emphasis to the home and family and bring joy and warmth."
Best may also be tapping into the guilt felt by extremely wealthy parents about the time they spent working during the recent economic boom. Parents who spend more hours at the office and fewer at home "may feel they have neglected their children and are trying to make up for it" with high-ticket purchases, said Lars E. Perner, a visiting professor of marketing at the University of California at Riverside.
Best, which has 19 employees, closed its Nantucket store last January after its lease was not renewed. (Its building was put up for sale.) Business there was too seasonal to warrant looking for new space, Ms. Randell said.
But the company aims to grow, though not into a mass luxury brand like Gucci. Over the next three years, Best plans to open at least five freestanding stores and boutiques in luxury department stores like Neiman Marcus, which, like Bergdorf Goodman, is owned by the Neiman Marcus Group. While no stores are scheduled to open anytime soon, possible locations include Los Angeles, Palm Beach, Fla., and Chicago. Ms. Keogh said the company had not scaled back any expansion plans but declined to provide details.
Best said its Web site, under construction, will be a cyberspace version of its white-glove service. Best's catalogs, issued sporadically in previous years, will appear regularly starting next spring. Best declined to provide details on how Ms. Hilfiger will finance its growth.
The expansion strategy may work, said Kristine Koerber, a luxury-retail analyst at W. R. Hambrecht in San Francisco. "If you can afford to expand now, it makes sense to gain market share," she said, adding that several mass-market retailers like Pottery Barn entered the market for higher-priced children's goods. 
Sandra Chollet, a merchandising manager for luxury baby clothes and furnishings at Barneys New York, the department store, echoed that view. "The baby business has not suffered -- if anything, people are being even more generous with their buying since Sept. 11," Ms. Chollet said.
BEST'S competitors, at least in luxury clothing, include private boutiques on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the French chain Tartine et Chocolat, and the children's lines of designers like Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana and Paul Smith, which are sold mainly in specialty stores like Barneys.
But Ms. Keogh said that no competitors carried both deluxe children's furniture and high-end clothing, and that brands like Dolce & Gabbana were not in line with what she called the new conservative taste. 
That taste, some marketing consultants say, reflects not only a new form of conspicuous consumption but also a longing for a bygone era. 
Best's image "captures the spirit of wanting to go back to a more innocent time," said Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting company, referring to the time before Sept. 11. "People are looking to refocus their spending, and they've recognized that our children are important because we may not come home tomorrow."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Clifford Greenberg; 
Baron Small Cap Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
MANY investors in small-capitalization stocks look for rapidly growing technology and biotechnology companies. But not Clifford Greenberg, who runs the $600 million Baron Small Cap fund.
 "There's no rocket science in this fund," Mr. Greenberg said from his office in Midtown Manhattan. "I buy industries and businesses that I can understand." 
 As a result, his fund owns no technology or biotech stocks, even though the average small-cap growth fund has a technology stake of 25.4 percent, according to Morningstar Inc. (Morningstar does not break out biotech from technology and health care.)
The fund returned 14.4 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 11.4 percent for its small-cap growth group and 0.8 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, Morningstar said. It lost 17.1 percent in the 12 months through Thursday, versus a 25.1 percent loss for its group and a 22.7 percent decline for the S.& P. 500.
Mr. Greenberg, 42, sifts through United States companies with market capitalizations of $100 million to $1.5 billion. The fund wants to buy, he said, "when we can make a 100 percent return over the next 18 months because, in our opinion, the stock is priced incorrectly."
To pick the 50 or so stocks in the portfolio, he uses no computer screens. Instead, he works with 14 industry analysts at the Baron Capital Group to find what he calls classic growth companies, fallen angels and special situations.
Classic growth companies, he said, can enjoy annual earnings growth rates as high as 50 percent or 100 percent. Fallen angels are distinguished by steeply declining stock prices. "These are companies where we believe the long-term prospects are great," he said, "and the short-term problems that knocked down the price are insignificant."
Special situations include companies that are emerging from bankruptcy or those with new management or new products. 
He spends much of his time talking with companies' executives. "We're significant shareholders in most of the companies we own, and we have close relationships with management," he said. "We want to understand their business plan and keep a close watch on how the business is developing."
He seeks companies with price-to-earnings multiples that are no higher than the companies' projected earnings growth rates. And he wants businesses with strong growth prospects for at least five years; one-quarter of the companies have been held since the fund's inception in 1997. He sells when a company's shares have met his price targets or when its business fails to develop as anticipated.
The fund's biggest position is in the Career Education Corporation, a company in Hoffman Estates, Ill., that provides a variety of post-secondary education at 38 campuses in the United States, Canada, Britain and the United Arab Emirates. He anticipates that earnings will grow 30 to 50 percent a year for the next three years.
"They buy a small local college with a good reputation that teaches one curriculum," he said. "They take over management, recruiting students from local high schools and outside the area, and add additional curricula." The company's schools offer programs in business administration, interior and graphic design, computer programming and other disciplines. Its campuses include Briarcliffe College on Long Island and Katharine Gibbs Schools around the country.
He bought the stock at $4 in 1998 and added shares at $21.90 in September. They closed on Friday at $28.74; his 12-month price target is $45.
MR. GREENBERG bought shares of California Pizza Kitchen, a restaurant chain based in Los Angeles, at $23.70 in the initial offering in August and added shares at $17.36 in October. The company operates about 100 restaurants nationwide, concentrating in California. The stock price has fallen, he said, because investors have worried about the California economy. "They charge $10 for a meal, so even if unemployment rose, it wouldn't affect their customer base in California," he said. Management is expanding the chain rapidly, he said; he expects per-share earnings growth of 25 percent a year.
The shares closed at $17.92 on Friday; his price target is $30.
Mr. Greenberg said catalysts for his investment in AMC Entertainment, the movie theater company based in Kansas City, Mo., were a company recapitalization and an industry consolidation that has closed down other companies' theaters, to the benefit of chains like AMC.
He bought shares at $6.97 in April and more at $9.39 in October. The stock now trades at $12.01; his price target is $18.

Hands Out,Even in a Time Of Crisis

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
WHERE'S Frank Capra when you need him? 
 Surely, he would know how to make entertainment out of the greed and rank opportunism that has characterized behind-the-scenes Washington since Sept. 11. The moment it became clear that lawmakers would be bailing out troubled industries, passing a stimulus package to restart the economy and putting some teeth into money-laundering laws, the lobbyists moved in. 
 Alas, with Mr. Capra gone and his kind of movie a thing of the past, Americans may never enjoy the spectacle of wealthy corporate lobbyists swarming the Capitol steps, lunging for handouts at the whiff of crisis. Instead, they'll suffer through it. 
Whatever happened to the idea of everybody pulling together, setting aside self-interest for the sake of a wounded country? Is grabbing for all you can now so imbued in corporate culture that executives don't remember what it is to act with honor? 
Richard Sylla, professor of business history at New York University's Stern School of Business, said corporate lobbying for tax breaks during a crisis is a relatively new behavior. "Taxes went up in World War II and nobody seemed to object," he said. "There was more of a spirit of cooperation. It was more 'What's in the national interest?' than 'Can you do something for us?' "
One egregious me-first move now gaining traction is repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax, created in 1986 to keep profitable companies from using loopholes to eliminate taxes. Even worse, the House plan would return all the A.M.T. ever paid by these corporations. That would send billions in rebates to I.B.M. and Ford Motor and hundreds of millions to General Motors, General Electric, Texas Utilities and DaimlerChrysler.
If corporate America were groaning under the weight of onerous tax rates, repealing the alternative minimum tax might be acceptable. But while the presumed corporate tax rate is 35 percent, loopholes bring the effective average tax rate for big companies way down. Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal advocacy group in Washington, calculated the effective corporate tax rate at 20.1 percent in 1998, on average, down from 26.5 percent in 1988.
While I.B.M. reported $5.7 billion in pretax profits last year, Mr. McIntyre said its federal income tax bill amounted to just 10.8 percent of that figure. Without the alternative minimum tax, I.B.M. would have paid 7.6 percent. G.M. earned $2.9 billion, pretax, in 2000, he said. Even with the A.M.T., its federal tax bill totaled only 1.5 percent of that.
"Take the repeal of A.M.T. and park it next to the big goose in depreciation write-offs in the bill and we're back to the early 1980's, when half the biggest companies in the country were regularly not paying any taxes at all," Mr. McIntyre said. 
Big banks and financial industry groups mounted perhaps the most sinister post-Sept. 11 lobbying effort, trying to thwart some money-laundering provisions of the antiterrorism bill. Publicly, the corporations claimed support for the bill, which became law on Oct. 26. But several people who witnessed the furious lobbying efforts said some banks and industry groups tried to water down the bill into October. 
"The bill gives important weapons to the administration to fight money laundering," said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, who has pursued money launderers aggressively. "The only reason this bill was passed was because of the leadership of Carl Levin, Paul Sarbanes and Joseph Biden. They dug in their heels," he said of the three senators.
Even hardened Hill staff members were surprised at the opposition to two relatively basic provisions in the bill. The first required financial institutions to conduct due diligence about who their customers are and where their money comes from. The second, which the staff members say Citigroup worked especially hard to defang, prohibited American banks from opening accounts for foreign shell banks, those with no physical presence and no affiliation with another bank. Shell banks are post office box operations tailor-made for money laundering and are found in places like Egypt and Ukraine. 
IMAGINE requiring banks and brokerage firms to know who their customers are. Don't lawmakers realize how much due diligence can eat into profits? So what if asking such questions might have stopped a handful of terrorists from killing thousands of innocents in the World Trade Center? 
Richard Howe, a Citigroup spokesman said, "We strongly supported the anti-money-laundering legislation." The modifications were designed not to soften it, he said, but to make it more effective.
Still, Citibank has had dealings with shell banks. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations last February named it as holding accounts for two shell banks, one associated with criminal behavior. Billions of dollars moved through the accounts, it said, until they were closed.
Perhaps self-interested corporate machinations are de rigueur now, war or peace. Maybe putting profits before patriotism is the way that the world works today. If so, I want to get off.

Learning to Love Fannie and Freddie

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
MAE WEST undoubtedly had something other than the stock market in mind when she declared that "too much of a good thing can be wonderful." But it is a sentiment that pretty much describes the way Wall Street's security analysts now appraise Fannie Mae, the giant mortgage company.
 Of 23 analysts who follow it closely, 22 recommend buying its stock; the other recommends holding on to what you already have. 
 The earnings increases at Fannie Mae -- running at a 20 percent pace this year -- have repeatedly beaten expectations and have been so robust that it has been buying back its debt, holding down current profit for future benefit. Interest-rate margins have actually expanded, even though the company's chief financial officer predicted in January that they would shrink as they did in the refinancing boom of 1998. 
The Treasury's decision last week to discontinue sales of its 30-year bond should also help. Analysts said that this would lead to lower mortgage rates, implying more business for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and further widening of their profit margins as their securities become benchmarks.
But people who buy stocks are less enthusiastic than those who peddle them. The shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, its younger and smaller brother in the $5.9 trillion residential mortgage finance business, are relative laggards. They are selling at about 14 times projected earnings for next year, half the level of the Standard & Poor's 500. Three years ago, their multiples were in the low 20's.
"The markets work in mysterious ways sometimes," said Kenneth A. Posner, mortgage finance analyst at Morgan Stanley, who recommends Fannie Mae. 
Jayne J. Shontell, Fannie Mae's senior vice president for corporate development and investor relations, agreed. "It's an enigma," she said.
It did not help when Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor, sold a big chunk of Freddie Mac stock last year. Some investors apparently took his decision as a signal that heady returns were likely to slow. Investors may also be wary of political backlash against special government benefits that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, created to promote home ownership, still enjoy.
Fannie Mae predicts that a 20 percent profit leap this year will be followed by "mid teens" growth in 2002, its typical pace for the last several years. The only other companies in the S.& P. 500 to produce double-digit earnings growth every year since 1987 are Microsoft, Automatic Data Processing, Home Depot and Schering-Plough.
OUTSPOKEN bears are nowhere to be found, but analysts say investor reticence about the companies mainly reflects fears of recession and the possibility of less new mortgage business. More important, they say, are possible defaults by people with existing mortgages. Some investors, not aware of the companies' sophisticated hedging practices, may have thought that they would suffer as declining interest rates induced borrowers to refinance, paying off mortgages early. 
"There are people who are cautious, because they think it's as good as it's going to get," said Bruce W. Harting, who follows the stocks for Lehman Brothers. But those who study Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac professionally, like Mr. Harting, contend that so much of a good thing can indeed endure and prove wonderful for investors.
Jonathan E. Gray, an analyst who covers mortgage finance at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said that the stocks have the potential of increasing 20 percent or more. He believes Fannie Mae could be selling at $105 to $110, compared with the current $82.56, and Freddie Mac could be at $85, compared with $69.52. 
The federal government chartered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but later privatized them -- Fannie Mae in 1968 and Freddie Mac in 1989. Essentially, their business is buying residential mortgages from banks and others who originate them, paying for them with the proceeds from sales of their bonds in the market. Then they either package the mortgages for sale to investors or retain them in their own portfolios. They also guarantee third-party mortgages.
"The worry seems to be that the events of Sept. 11 will tip the economy into recession and this will lead to rising mortgage defaults and credit losses," said J. Timothy Howard, Fannie Mae's executive vice president and chief financial officer, in a conference call with analysts on Oct. 15. He said the parallel cited most often was the 1990-91 recession linked to the Persian Gulf war.
Wall Street generally agrees with Mr. Howard that such fear is misleadingly superficial. For one thing, Fannie Mae suffered little in the early-1990's recession, its total credit losses in portfolio and mortgage-backed securities rising by less than two-hundredths of 1 percent by 1994. If that experience were repeated now, growth in earnings per share would be trimmed by less than one and a half percentage points annually over the next three years. "That's not a very big hit," Mr. Howard said.
Moreover, the economy has fewer imbalances than it did a decade ago, housing is stronger and, most tellingly, Fannie Mae's book of business is considerably more solid. 
Homeowners' equity now averages 42 percent of market value, versus 30 percent in 1990, reducing the risk to lenders of a default. The percentage of guarantees carrying insurance or some other form of credit enhancement has risen to 36 percent from 24 percent. In addition, riskier adjustable-rate mortgages have dwindled to 7 percent of business from 17 percent.
"Concerns about impending Fannie Mae credit problems seem greatly overblown," Mr. Howard said.
Even the political winds have shifted to Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's backs. With federal charters and modest lines of credit to the Treasury, the companies benefit mightily from market presumptions that the government would come to their rescue if they had financial trouble.
That makes their borrowing costs less than those of competitors, several of whom have organized to prevent them from using their advantages to expand into other businesses. These advantages include exemption from registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission and from state and local income taxes. "They're too big to fail and too big to control," complained Mike House, a Washington lawyer who serves as executive director of FM Watch, whose members include banks, mortgage brokers and others who see a threat to their role in housing finance. A few members of Congress have joined in the criticism.
Fannie Mae, one of Washington's most ferocious lobbyists, and Freddie Mac have largely blunted the attack. "They did a really good job of handling the political risk," said Anna Dopkin, who holds both companies' stocks as portfolio manager of the T. Rowe Price Financial Services fund. And with terrorism and recession now such dominant concerns, she said Congress was likely to find little time for "messing around with one of the few parts of the economy that's held up."
ANALYSTS and others regard the critics' complaints as a testament to the companies' prospects. While barred by charter from originating mortgages -- in a whimsical moment, Franklin D. Raines, the chairman of Fannie Mae, offered to tattoo on his forehead that it would abide by this restriction -- Fannie Mae has been moving onto new turf like subprime loans while making increasingly effective use of powerful, proprietary technology. Its program of automated underwriting, for example, may threaten others in the business, notably mortgage bankers.
"We've got intermediaries who are losing their power," said Gary Gordon, mortgage finance analyst at UBS Warburg, who also rates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as strong buys. 
While the mortgage market itself may be growing at only 6 percent or so a year, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are viewed as likely to expand their share of a broader business. "This is really the key to our call," said Mr. Posner of Morgan Stanley, who figures on double-digit profit growth continuing for 5 or 10 years. Despite the huge size of Fannie Mae, he said, there is "lots of room" before it bumps any ceiling.

Patriotic Partisanship On Capitol Hill

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
EVER since the terror strikes of Sept. 11, President Bush, like some latter-day George Washington, has tried to position himself as a man above party, the commander in chief, for whom politics itself is slightly declasse.
 Mr. Bush has forsworn fund-raisers and campaigning as he pursues his mission to "rid the world of evil." His once omnipresent political guru, Karl Rove, is nowhere to be seen, strategizing far offstage. And the new standard photo op of this presidency is the stern faces of a war cabinet. 
 But politics goes on. There are programs to be fought over, and another election is always on the horizon. Partisanship may be a dirty word with an anxious electorate, but life without it is unnatural, even impossible, in Washington.
The ideological differences between the two parties remain profound. And so, despite the overwhelming support for the war effort on Capitol Hill, political combat returned with a vengeance last week in the House over whether airport security screeners should be federal employees.
Everyone reverted to familiar roles. Conservatives raged against government bureaucracy and accused Democrats of wanting to swell the ranks of organized labor. "It's all about union membership in a union that imposes compulsory dues that fund their campaigns," said Representative Dick Armey, the majority leader from Texas, in the days leading up to the House vote.
Senator John McCain, the Republican from Arizona, played the scourge of his party's right wing, noting that "some of the brave firemen and police enforcement people that have died in the World Trade Center were members of a union."
And Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, called House Republican leaders extremists who had taken campaign money from the airport security companies, "the special interests who did not want to lose their contracts."
Only Mr. Bush was out of character, a new convert to former President Clinton's faith in political triangulation. While the president worked hard, and successfully, behind the scenes to pass the Republican version of the bill, his administration signaled publicly that he would sign any reasonable measure to make it to his desk -- allowing him to look statesmanlike and to claim victory either way.
"He's trying to stay above politics," said Representative Thomas M. Davis III, the Virginia Republican who is head of his party's re-election effort in the House. Noting Mr. Bush's sky-high approval ratings, Mr. Davis added: "In a way that's good. A president with strong numbers helps the incumbent party."
But it is also a high-wire act. Mr. Bush's conservative base is complaining that the president they helped put into office is no longer reliably on their side. And Democrats are predicting that the vote to keep airport security private will prove a costly victory, reinforcing the view that on domestic matters, the Republicans are led by Mr. Armey and Representative Tom DeLay, two Gingrich-era hard-line Texas conservatives.
"I think Tom DeLay and Dick Armey will make the case for a Democratic House," Representative Nita M. Lowey, the New York Democrat in charge of her party's House campaigns, said succinctly.
Other crisis-era presidents may offer some perspective on Mr. Bush's task. Abraham Lincoln also sought to stand above party, campaigning for re-election not as a Republican but as the candidate of the union party. Franklin D. Roosevelt dropped the rhetoric of class warfare he had used during the Great Depression and used prominent Republicans in the war effort after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. "This is what presidents do in wartime," said Richard Shenkman, a presidential historian.
Maybe, but senators and representatives can't simply call themselves sub-commanders in chief. Especially in a recession, they have to show that they are better able to help their constituents than their opponents.
Both parties are already trying to figure out how to win the 2002 elections under these changed circumstances. The Republicans in Congress contend that they will be bolstered by Mr. Bush's approval ratings and the public's desire for stability (and hence incumbency) in a crisis. 
Republicans also say that issues of war and national security, which they said favor them, have displaced the Democrats' issues of education, health care and environmental protection.
Democrats counter that history is on their side -- that even popular wartime presidents see their party suffer in off-years. Roosevelt's Democrats took a beating at the polls in the off-year election of 1942, less than a year after Pearl Harbor.
"There was enormous support for Roosevelt," said Doris Kearns Goodwin, a presidential scholar. "But a long war was dragging on without many victories, and the price of the war was being felt throughout the nation. The sacrifices were being felt without the concomitant victories."
Similarly, the nation may be mired in an inconclusive war on terror next year, and the economy could still be in trouble. So Democrats plan to stay firmly at Mr. Bush's side in support of the war effort, while putting forth their own economic plans, with calls for increased unemployment compensation and more health care.
"There are clear differences on the domestic front, and we are going to have to articulate them," Ms. Lowey said. "People are so nervous. They are hurting. They are afraid. The candidates who show them they are on their side will be the ones who succeed."
INDEED, polls show that despite Mr. Bush's popularity, Democrats stand poised to win races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia and the mayor's race in New York City on Tuesday. 
It could well be that the political landscape is changing even now in ways that neither party has recognized. David Winston, a Republican pollster, has found that voters are fundamentally rethinking their values. And in what he calls a "bizarre bifurcation never seen before," voters feel optimistic about the direction of the country even as they say that the economy is worsening and that they fear for their personal security. He attributes the optimism to pride in the nation's response to terror, the sacrifices of New York's firefighters and police officers.
Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, is not just the Senate's lone doctor but also the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and recently he asked 17 Republican media advisers about the shape of the political future. 
"I asked each one to address the impact of Sept. 11 and the president's response on the next elections," Mr. Frist said, referring to 2002 and the control of Congress. "Every one of them said there was no precedent and we don't know. It was interesting. People don't even try to pretend there's a construct out there."

The Boom Is Over. What's Next?

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
DON'T count on going back to the days when the Nasdaq was a one-way bet, Alan Greenspan was omniscient and all-powerful, Bill Gates could be portrayed as the worst predator on the horizon and the biggest challenge for the unemployed was sorting out the job offers. 
 If there was any remaining doubt that the boom of the 1990's had expired, burying the assumption that the good times could continue forever, last week took care of it. 
 First the government reported that the economy contracted in the third quarter, signaling that the nation has almost certainly entered a recession, the first in 11 years. Then came a statistic that brought home the meaning of an economic downturn: the unemployment rate surged by half a percentage point last month, to 5.4 percent, the biggest one-month jump in 21 years. 
It is not clear when the economy will recover, or how robustly it will perform once the downturn ends. Economists are forecasting a relatively healthy bounce-back by the middle of next year, but their projections are little more than guesswork, especially given the raft of uncertainties about the course of the war and the possibility of further terrorist attacks.
Whenever the rebound happens, though, the character of the economy that eventually emerges from the recession is sure to be very different from the economy the United States enjoyed and grew accustomed to over the last decade. Humpty Dumpty cannot be put back together again.
Every business cycle has its own flavor, and it is impossible to know exactly what characteristics will define the next expansion. But it is a good bet that after a long period in which the virtues of unfettered capitalism have been almost unquestioned, the next new economy will reflect a wartime drift back to a recognition of the importance of government and a post-boom hangover induced by excessive faith in market forces to get it right all the time.
"The normalized economy will be wearing a different set of clothes on the other side of the recession," said Paul A. McCulley, an economist at Pimco, an investment firm in Newport Beach, Calif. "When we come out of it, the pendulum will again be trying to find the right place between unadulterated capitalism and enlightened government."
The prosperity of the late 90's -- what now seems to have been the final stage of a long expansion that began in the early 80's -- was shaped by and reflected a variety of influences, many of which were fading or changing even before Sept. 11.
Being the lone military and economic superpower, the embodiment of the triumph of democratic capitalism, turned out to mean being vulnerable, as well as being the envy of the world (and there is almost certainly a link between the two). 
The federal budget deficit turned almost overnight into a huge surplus -- which in turn disappeared just as fast. The democratization of the stock market meant that everyone could share in the riches created by the nation's entrepreneurial genius, and suffer along with the plutocracy when the bubble burst.
The pervasive sense of optimism, the national swagger that both reflected and helped fuel the high-performance economy of the 1990's has, temporarily at least, given way to a period in which Americans are looking over their shoulders to see what they did wrong, while peering anxiously ahead in the hope that they will see a glimmer of hopeful light.
BUT for all that it looks in retrospect to have been unsustainable all along, the 90's boom had plenty of characteristics that are well worth trying to preserve. Two in particular are likely to get considerable attention in coming months and years.
One is the benefit the upturn brought to people at the low end of the economic spectrum.
At a time when there was a political consensus to scale back welfare programs and encourage and reward work, the last expansion generated millions of entry-level jobs, allowing people who might previously have been unemployable to get a toehold in the work force. And while some of those jobs did not pay a living wage, incomes grew at a healthy pace across the economic spectrum and in black and Hispanic as well as in white households, helping to drive down poverty rates.
The other positive characteristic of the long boom was the edge it gave the United States in business efficiency. 
Beyond all the hype about dot-coms, technology really was transforming the economy in concrete ways -- in particular by helping to drive a resurgence in productivity, or the ability to produce more for less. After languishing for two decades, the growth rate of productivity -- the single best indicator of an economy's ability to expand in a sustainable way -- began accelerating around 1995.
WHEN productivity growth is strong, companies can make more money without raising the price of their products, and can afford to pay their employees more. Computers, more precise machine tools, faster communications -- companies invested heavily in all of them and more, seeking an advantage in a brutally competitive global marketplace.
Those issues and others will be considered in an atmosphere in which some of the assumptions about economic policy and the role of government in general are being re-examined. 
Under the pressures of war, the Bush administration, which until Sept. 11 held a fairly doctrinaire view of the benefits of small government and market forces, has already taken such interventionist steps as threatening Bayer with the loss of its patent if it did not drop the price of the anthrax-fighting drug Cipro. 
This week the House and the Senate will clash over whether airport security workers should be made part of the federal work force, with some Republicans joining most Democrats in arguing that the nation cannot rely on private industry to protect travelers.
"No one wants to have stupid government," Mr. McCulley said. "But no one wants stupid capitalism either."

HEADLINE: Nicaragua to Decide Fate of Ortega's New-Age Candidacy 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Throughout Daniel Ortega's third campaign to return to the Nicaraguan presidency, the slogan "love is stronger than hate" has been his New Age mantra. The question for Nicaraguans going to the polls on Sunday, however, is whether it is stronger than their memories.
 Mr. Ortega, the Sandinista leader, lost the presidency in elections in 1990 after more than a decade in power. Now, tied in opinion polls with the Liberal Party candidate, Enrique Bolanos, he concedes that his movement's concept of socialism was a utopian goal and says he accepts free markets and democracy. 
 He is popular among thousands of young people who never knew the hardships of life under his administration but who complain that corrupt officials are enriching themselves while opportunities for jobs and education are shrinking. 
Mr. Ortega has built a coalition that includes former political foes. Some of them, including his running mate, Agustin Jarquin, were once jailed by his government.
His opposition has been reminding voters, though, of the country's economic and social collapse during the 1980's, when inflation veered out of control and thousands of young people were drafted into the military.
The opposition has been supported in spirit by the United States government, which also played a role in Nicaragua during that era by financing the contra resistance army that ensnared the country in a violent and divisive war.
American diplomats have repeatedly expressed serious reservations about a Sandinista return to power and have criticized Mr. Ortega over his government's record of confiscated properties, human rights abuses and relations with foreign leaders who had financed, trained or sheltered terrorists.
Tonight, former president Jimmy Carter, who is heading an international delegation of electoral observers, criticized the strong statements that had come from Washington in recent months. "I personally disapprove of statements or actions by any country that might tend to influence the vote of people in another sovereign nation," he said.
Both leading candidates have offered ambitious programs that they contend will create jobs and help the poor while stimulating investment. While the appeals from both sides will do little to sway their own partisans, they could make the difference with the thousands of undecided voters, who may well determine the outcome of a race that seems too close to call.
"They are people who move between fear and desperation," said Carlos Fernando Chamorro, a political analyst and publisher of a political newsletter. "There is fear from the association of Ortega and the past conflict with the United States and an economy that was out of control. And there is the desperation over unemployment, poverty and corruption. Bolanos has the fear vote in his favor." 
Mr. Bolanos has clearly enjoyed the favor of American officials, including the United States ambassador to Nicaragua, Oliver Garza, who invited Mr. Bolanos to accompany him on a delivery of emergency food aid to hungry peasants. 
Governor Jeb Bush of Florida wrote an opinion article for The Miami Herald in which he said "Ortega's past and present clearly indicate that he neither understands nor embraces the basic concepts of freedom, democracy and free enterprise."
The opinion piece was reprinted as an advertisement in a local paper under a headline that said, "The brother of the president of the United States George W. Bush Supports Enrique Bolanos." 
Also, John Keane, the acting deputy assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, said last month that the Sandinistas still had in their fold hard-liners who were responsible for "abominations" of human and civil rights.
"Given their history," he said during a speech he delivered in Pittsburgh, "why should we believe assurances that they have changed, since there have been few concrete actions to demonstrate it?" 
Statements like his have taken on a new urgency since the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, with the United States stating that nations must show whose side they are on. Mr. Bolanos has seized on these statements in advertisements and campaign speeches, including his closing speech in his hometown of Masaya on Wednesday.
"If Ortega comes to power, that would provoke a closing of aid and investment, difficulties with exports, visas and family remittances," he said. "I'm not just saying this. The United States says this, too. We cannot close our eyes and risk our well-being and work. Say yes to Nicaragua, say no to terrorism." 
Mr. Ortega has avoided responding to those criticisms for most of his campaign, although some close supporters have repeatedly said they were willing to work with the United States to combat drugs and terrorism. But they have also criticized the American warnings.
"How is it possible for the United States to talk so much about democracy and then try to intimidate the people of Nicaragua to go to the polls with a pistol at their heads?" asked the Rev. Miguel D'Escoto, a former Sandinista foreign minister. "Is that a free election? No." 
On Thursday night, during a reception at the Hard Rock Cafe here, Mr. Ortega finally addressed some of the barbs, making reference to the country's past armed conflict.
"This country has been the victim of military operations and terrorism," he said. "We have the moral authority to condemn terrorism and to show our willingness to contribute to the United States' struggle against terrorism." He also said he thought the American criticisms would not have the intended effect.
"The will of the people has been defined," he said. "This will not be modified, regardless of their declarations."
In his closing campaign speech in Nindiri on Wednesday, Mr. Ortega told the crowd that he wanted the country to reject the politics of hate and confrontation that his opponents had espoused. As he spoke, several people waved American flags, including a huge one that fluttered over a billboard.
"That shows we want peace and good relations with the United States," said Adilia Gonzalez, a college student. "We show with that flag that we do not want war. We want unity and we want this country to move forward. What better than the support of the greatest power, the United States?"
While many Sandinista supporters said they believed that Mr. Ortega had changed, Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, a longtime Sandinista critic, delivered a homily the next day that questioned whether Mr. Ortega's transformation was sincere. 
Mr. Ortega, who faces unresolved accusations of sexually abusing a stepdaughter, was in the front row at the outdoor Mass with Rosario Murillo, the woman with whom he has lived for decades. Though he has insisted the abuse charges are without merit, Mr. Ortega did not go to trial since the Legislature refused to lift his immunity from prosecution as a member.
"Parents should look at their children as children of God and respect them as human beings," the cardinal said. "In electing our candidates we should see if they preach with the testimony of their lives, if they have been exemplary in their families."
The crowd cheered loudest when he said: "Do their acts support their words? Has the candidate always had that attitude or position or is it simply a change of direction with electoral goals?"
Beyond the accusations, whoever is elected will inherit a government crippled by debt and burdened by unemployment. And given the economic contractions being felt around the world, the winner will have little room to maneuver as he tries to deliver on campaign promises. Investment had already slowed to a trickle as businessmen wait for the outcome of the elections.
"Given the state of the U.S. and the hemisphere's economies, a quick rebound is unlikely," said Robert Pastor, a professor of political science at Emory University. "The days of utopia have passed. Latin America is into either incremental progress or none." 
Some experts see Mr. Ortega as having the advantage of not having been associated with the charges of rampant corruption that have afflicted the government of President Arnoldo Aleman. And unlike Mr. Bolanos, a successful businessman who was president of the private enterprise council, Mr. Ortega has support among some of the poorest neighborhoods in the country.
But Mr. Bolanos does have the confidence of investors. He is also perceived as undoubtedly honest, though as Mr. Aleman's former vice president, Mr. Bolanos waited until late in the campaign to distance himself from Mr. Aleman. In several recent speeches, Mr. Bolanos took pains to mention that he, Mr. Ortega and Mr. Aleman should not be above the law.
At the Liberals' closing rally, people streamed through the streets of Masaya insisting they would defeat Mr. Ortega.

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL; 
Jordan Lifts Wizards Out of Their Mediocrity

BYLINE:  By MIKE WISE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Matt Harpring was holding Michael Jordan down in the third quarter, using his forearms and his quick feet to stay with him. The crossover dribble did not freeze Harpring. Jordan's bobbing head did not rattle him. Nothing from the past was working.
 So, on a night when pro basketball ostensibly returned to the nation's capital, Jordan merely transported his game to the future. 
 A spin to the left. An exaggerated head fake. The high-arching rainbow, softly rolling around the rim and in. And the foul. The 3-point play that put the Washington Wizards ahead for good tonight at the MCI Center gave the clearest glimpse yet of what is in store for this reinvigorated franchise.
Sometimes passing off, sometimes plodding, but always snarling, a very old-school Jordan shelved athleticism and relied on his savvy. Before a sellout crowd of 20,674 and a first-ever, prime-time network television audience in November, Jordan and his team simply competed, beating the injury-depleted Philadelphia 76ers, 90-76, in the home debut of the game's most accomplished player.
Jordan's 20 points on 7-of-21 shooting and his 9 assists helped put the Wizards above .500 for the first time since 1999, when the team opened the season with a victory. Washington, now 2-1, rebounded from a 13-point deficit in the second half to blow out the Sixers, who were missing Allen Iverson, Eric Snow and Aaron McKie.
Whether this little run lasts does not seem to matter. Tonight, in a city that has known more infamy than excellence on the basketball court, a legend represented new hope.
"Once I realized I wasn't in an offensive rhythm, I just started moving the ball," Jordan said. "When you're not shooting the ball well, there are other things you can do on the basketball court to help the team. I was just trying to help my team any way I could."
The whole evening was mostly an homage to Jordan's playing career. Washington Mayor Tony Williams welcomed Jordan before the game, saying, "We happen to have our own economic stimulus package in the nation's capital."
By the time the "From North Carolina" refrain pulsated through the arena's sound system during player introductions, the crowd let out a thunderous ovation. At halftime, the singer R. Kelly sang "I Believe I Can Fly," a leftover from Jordan's animated movie.
Tony Metzger, a season-ticket holder since 1992, said the game was the most emotionally charged he could remember. "Can't imagine why," he said, smiling.
Simmy Martin, whose brother bought her tickets for her 14th birthday, said: "I came two years ago to a Wizards game. It was depressing. Nobody was here and it was a sad game. I wasn't inspired to come back, until Michael came back."
For Jordan, surely it beat watching from an executive-level suite with fewer than 10,000 people in the stands.
He had help. Richard (Rip) Hamilton was on the receiving end of several of Jordan's kick-out passes from the post. Hamilton scored 29 points, hitting 11 of 18 shots and keying a third-quarter run that effectively ended the Sixers' quest to win their first game of the season.
Philadelphia (0-3), the defending Eastern Conference champion, was led by Craig (Speedy) Claxton, who had 22 points. Claxton, a Hofstra graduate, wowed the crowed, knifing his diminutive frame through mounds of muscle and carrying the 76ers the way only an undersized point guard could.
Jordan struggled early, making only 4 of his first 13 shots. He looked out of sync, his reflexes seemed slow and his vertical leap was nothing to write Nike headquarters about. But as the game wore on, Coach Doug Collins put Jordan at the top of the key, a point guard's game in a small forward's frame.
"I really could not find my rhythm," Jordan said. "I'm struggling with my jump shot, but there was so much focus on me, I was able to get teammates involved. And Rip got hot and that really helped us a lot."
Jordan passed out of the double teams, penetrated and distributed at the last possible second. And as the lead grew to 20 points in the final minutes, the crowd rose and roared. Fast breaks and 15-0 binges, once a foreign concept to the Wizards, were suddenly part of the landscape.
As the game ended, Jordan congratulated each of his teammates. He did not have the look of a high school principal handing out diplomas, but it was close.
"The hunger to win is very strong here in Washington," Jordan said. "And that's something you can sense as a player."
Perhaps Billy King, the 76ers' general manager, best summed up the night: "Wizards-Sixers on NBC? In November? You believe this?"

HEADLINE: Deep-Running Similarities Link New York's Mayoral Rivals 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

 BODY:
Mark Green and Michael R. Bloomberg say they would be very different mayors at an enormously important time for New York City, when an economic downturn, the aftermath of the terror attacks and considerable shortcomings with the schools seem to demand exceptional qualities in the city's next leader.
 Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire businessman, characterizes Mr. Green as someone who complains about problems and himself as someone who solves them. Mr. Green, the city's public advocate, depicts Mr. Bloomberg as an elitist dabbling in elective politics for the novelty of it and himself as a public servant with a long record of doing the right thing. 
 Each insists that the next four years are too important for voters to take a chance on the other in Tuesday's mayoral election. Yet for all the attention to their different backgrounds, Mr. Green, the Democratic nominee, and Mr. Bloomberg, the Republican, are not unlike each other in other significant ways, including some of their underlying prescriptions for running the city. 
Few doubt that a Mayor Green and a Mayor Bloomberg would convey decidedly different public images. For starters, Mr. Bloomberg, who is divorced, has said that he would not make the mansion, which is the mayor's official residence, his regular home. He prefers the familiarity of his apartment on East 79th Street, he said.
Mr. Green has identified some of the people whom he would look to for advice, a list that is heavy on well-known Democrats in the city, from Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi to Stanley Brezenoff, a deputy mayor in the Koch administration. Mr. Bloomberg has been more circumspect about the makings of his inner circle, suggesting in a recent interview that he would draw from academia, business and government and that perhaps the best clue would be the guest lists for his dinner parties.
Almost predictably, their criticism of each other has been directed primarily at who they are and who they are not.
"Hopefully, more people as time goes on will find that my background makes the most sense," Mr. Bloomberg said on Friday about his improved standing in recent public opinion polls.
At their televised debate on Thursday, Mr. Green was asked to identify Mr. Bloomberg's main shortcoming as a would-be mayor.
"Of the two of us, I'm the only one who's spent time in the public sector," he said. "My rival hasn't spent one minute in public life."
In the final week of the campaign, the two have expanded upon those themes and intensified their attacks on each other's ability to govern. Mr. Bloomberg describes himself as able to unite the city, arguing that Mr. Green has encouraged racial divisiveness by running a tough primary campaign against Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president. Mr. Green says his record demonstrates his commitment to the city's diverse communities and criticizes Mr. Bloomberg for having little familiarity with the city's residents and for trying to buy support by spending a record $41 million on his campaign.
But in essence, both men have identified the same basic priorities in the next four years. Style and backgrounds aside, the choice between them is not dominated by significantly divergent views of where the city is or where it should be going. 
From rebuilding Lower Manhattan to keeping police officers on the streets, the two candidates differ on details and on some bigger issues in the campaign. Mr. Bloomberg wants to give police officers BlackBerry hand-held computers; Mr. Green has proposed using Palm hand-helds. More substantially, Mr. Green has a goal of keeping classes to no more than 20 children in the early elementary school grades; Mr. Bloomberg wants to decentralize decision-making and give principals the authority to decide what is best for their schools. 
"Having a healthy difference of opinion and working things out together, that is what politics really is about," Mr. Bloomberg said last week. "Politics is pulling together people and coming up with a common agenda that helps most people."
Above all, both Mr. Green and Mr. Bloomberg say they will demand improvements in the city's schools -- reflected in better test scores -- and they expect to be measured on their success as mayor on that promise. They also both pledge to hold down crime while increasing sensitivities in the Police Department to concerns among black and Hispanic residents about racial profiling. And they have promised to guide the city through its financial and economic problems by attracting new businesses, convincing those here to stay and shepherding the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan in a way that will benefit other parts of the city as well.
Mr. Green and Mr. Bloomberg even share a significant and seemingly irreconcilable budgetary quandary: each has identified the city's payroll as a major focus of his municipal cost-cutting efforts, yet each has said teachers, police officers and firefighters, who together make up the bulk of the municipal work force, should get pay raises.
There are other similarities. Even parts of their resumes could come from the same page.
Mr. Green and Mr. Bloomberg are both self-described liberals born at the time of World War II. Both are Jews with advanced degrees from Harvard. Both live on the Upper East Side (Mr. Green and his wife, Deni Frand, live on East 90th Street). And until last year, both were lifelong Democrats who were active in the party or contributed generously to it. Mr. Bloomberg even gave $1,000 to Mr. Green's re-election campaign in 1997. 
They have some personality traits in common as well.
Both have reputations for being strong-willed, ambitious and accustomed to getting their way. When it comes to self-description on the campaign trail, both have been prone to using superlatives. Mr. Bloomberg recently described himself as "the most experienced person in the world" in dealing with foreign governments; Mr. Green, who has never been a legislator, said in an interview in September that "if I had never been born" several of the city's more progressive laws would not have been enacted.
And each has been willing to adopt positions that in some significant way could influence how much support they win: Mr. Bloomberg by switching to the Republican Party and giving up longtime memberships in several exclusive social clubs, and Mr. Green by moderating his views and toning down his criticism of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Perhaps most significantly, the two men espouse approaches to running New York City that sound very much the same. They both talk about being a mayor-manager, assembling a diverse array of expert aides and advisers who would help guide them through difficult decisions. Both have promised administrations that would be more open and forthcoming than that of Mr. Giuliani.
"There's no perfect training to be a mayor," Mr. Green said in an interview last week. "We've had a couple of borough presidents, we've had a couple of Congress people, we've had a couple of citywide officials, we've had a prosecutor in the last half-century. And all of them had to be amazed and impressed at how much they grew in the last few months of the campaign and the first few months of the mayoralty. So I may be self-confident but I'm modest enough to know what I don't know."
On some of the most pressing issues that the next mayor is likely to confront, Mr. Green and Mr. Bloomberg have often drawn attention to their differences on the campaign trail.
Mr. Green, for example, likes to criticize Mr. Bloomberg for suggesting that new high schools should be built on Governors Island rather than in neighborhoods around the city and for minimizing the importance of teaching computer skills in schools.
Mr. Bloomberg faults Mr. Green for saying that the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan should be centered on the financial services industry when some of that industry lost interest in downtown years ago. He also questions how friendly Mr. Green would be to businesses in the city because as consumer affairs commissioner he led a crackdown on small businesses as a revenue-raising tool.
At their core, the proclivities of the two men even in the areas where they disagree are often more alike than not.
On schools, both want to build more of them. The question is where. Mr. Bloomberg has said he is not wedded to the Governors Island idea but offered it to encourage more creative thinking. On the downtown rebuilding, Mr. Green has stressed the symbolic importance of the financial services industry, but he also talked about luring other businesses as anchors, including those specializing in information technology.
Mr. Green had also proposed the creation of a new city-state agency that would oversee an aggressive effort to bring renewed economic life to the area around the World Trade Center site. Mr. Bloomberg rejected the idea and even ridiculed Mr. Green for suggesting it.
But Mr. Bloomberg has acknowledged all along that the rebuilding would have to be done through some kind of a cooperative city-state endeavor, and when Gov. George E. Pataki announced on Friday that he would create a new redevelopment authority, Mr. Bloomberg said he would not oppose it.
"You work with people rather than work against them," he said.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: INSIDE BASEBALL; 
The Owner Who Overpaid for Rodriguez Irks His Peers Once More

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Borrowing from "The Ugly American" of several decades past, Tom Hicks is becoming the Ugly Texan to other baseball people.
 Hicks, owner of the Texas Rangers, went a long way toward acquiring that reputation last winter when he coveted Alex Rodriguez so heatedly that he signed him for $100 million more than anyone else was prepared to pay. The Rodriguez contract instantly raised the ante for Manny Ramirez and Derek Jeter and will have an impact on the money teams will pay Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi this winter. 
 Just the other day Hicks enhanced his position as the Ugly Texan when he announced a double-barreled hiring: John Hart as general manager and Grady Fuson as his assistant. The only problem was that Hicks did not have the O.K. from their previous employers to name them to those positions. 
The matter, technically a tampering case, has been delivered to Commissioner Bud Selig. While it is too early to predict Selig's action, he will very likely assess a steep fine against Hicks for both hirings, though he will probably let them stand.
High-ranking baseball officials said Hicks violated the agreements he had with the Cleveland Indians to interview Hart and with the Oakland Athletics to interview Fuson. The officials said both clubs were furious over the way Hicks ignored their understandings, with the Athletics being more irate than the Indians.
"They are just beside themselves," one official said of the Athletics, who immediately filed a grievance against the Rangers with the commissioner's office.
Oakland officials gave the Rangers permission to talk with Fuson about the general manager's job, other officials said, but only the general manager's job. They said the Rangers did not have the Athletics' permission to offer the 44-year-old Fuson, the Athletics' scouting director, a lower-level job.
In Hart's case, officials said, Hicks had an agreement with Larry Dolan, the Indians' owner, that gave the Rangers permission to interview Hart and negotiate a contract if they so chose, but before hiring him, the Rangers had to negotiate compensation for Hart with the Indians. One official said the Rangers notified the Indians on Thursday that they had hired Hart but did not call to discuss compensation.
In announcing the hiring of Hart, Hicks also insulted members of minorities, whose road to high-level, decision-making positions is already strewn with roadblocks of disregard and land mines of insincerity. Hicks insulted them by not interviewing the only black or Latin on his list of candidates.
Omar Minaya, senior assistant general manager of the Mets, had an interview with a headhunter, as the other four candidates for the Rangers' job did, but that was his only contact about the position. Minaya congratulated Hart on his appointment but said: "I must express my disappointment. I was looking forward to the opportunity of interviewing with Mr. Hicks for the general manager position. I will continue to pursue my goal of being a general manager someday."
Telephone efforts to reach Hicks for comment were unsuccessful.
It became evident early in his search for a general manager to replace Doug Melvin, whom Hicks fired on the last day of the season, that Hicks wanted to hire a well-known general manager, either Hart or Dave Dombrowski of the Florida Marlins.
Hart, the Indians' general manager, had announced earlier in the year that he was retiring, though no one believed for long that he would really retire, and Dombrowski had made it known that he would consider leaving his position as president and general manager of the Marlins because of their uncertain financial future.
One story circulating about the Rangers' search for a general manager was that Hicks initially wanted to hire Dombrowski but that Dombrowski declined because the job was contingent on his taking Fuson as his assistant.
Other candidates for the job were Fuson and Dan O'Brien, the Rangers' assistant general manager. Fuson was highly recommended to Hicks by Scott Boras, the high-profile agent who negotiated the $252 million deal for Rodriguez.
Boras is another part of the Rangers' ugly story. Some baseball officials believe that Boras, having developed a close relationship with Rodriguez's benefactor, undermined Melvin's position as general manager. Then, one official said, Boras became involved with Fuson, pushing him for the job and spending time prepping him for his interviews.
Another official said word had circulated among general managers and others that the Rangers had already begun pursuing players who will be free agents, even though players cannot file for free agency until next week. The players the official mentioned included Chan Ho Park, a Boras client.

The A's and Free Agency
Twenty-five years ago, Charles O. Finley, outcast owner of the Oakland Athletics, suggested that the owners deal with impending free agency by declaring every player free every year. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn and the other owners greeted Finley's idea the same way they viewed the orange baseball he proposed using.
Marvin Miller, the players' labor leader, understood the implication of Finley's plan and held his breath until the owners rejected it. If every player were available each off-season, the demand would not exceed the supply. Ergo, players could be signed more cheaply than when only a handful of free agents are available at any one position.
The first class of free agents included the nucleus of Finley's powerhouse team, and that was the end of Finley's powerhouse teams.
A quarter-century later, the Athletics are faced with losing not their nucleus but their heart and soul. Jason Giambi was prepared to sign a multiyear contract last spring and forgo free agency, but the Athletics refused to include a no-trade clause. Giambi wanted protection against a trade to a wealthier team after giving the economically weaker Athletics a "hometown discount."
Now the Athletics are prepared to give their first baseman the no-trade clause, but they do not know if they will be able to sign him.
"We're going to file," Giambi's agent, Arn Tellem, said Friday. "What we said last April has no bearing now. That was then; this is now. He played all year with the pressure and the risk of injury with no security. He's now two days away from free agency and he intends to see what's out there, what his options are."
Eligible players can file for free agency during a 15-day period beginning the day after the World Series ends. Free agents can begin signing with clubs as soon as the filing period ends.
In past Novembers, eligible players have filed throughout the filing period. This year, however, most, if not all, eligible players are expected to submit their names immediately. They do not want to take a chance that with the collective bargaining agreement expiring next Wednesday the owners will take some action affecting the players' ability to be free agents and sign with any team.
"We'll be there when the bell rings," Tellem said.
Giambi will be one of the elite free agents. He will be joined by Barry Bonds, Juan Gonzalez, Moises Alou, Bret Boone, Johnny Damon and half of the Yankees' infield, Tino Martinez and Scott Brosius. John Smoltz will be the most intriguing pitcher available because he could attract interest as a starter, which he used to be and could be again, or as a closer, which he became this season.

By the Numbers
Everyone knows that Barry Bonds hit 73 home runs and that Sammy Sosa became the first player in history to reach the 60 plateau for the third time. But what about some other statistical leaders?
Vladimir Guerrero of Montreal grounded into the most double plays, 24, and tied for second in times caught stealing with 16, one behind Juan Pierre's 17. Colorado's Pierre, on the other hand, was the toughest to strike out, averaging one strikeout for every 23.6 plate appearances. Jose Hernandez of Milwaukee and Jim Thome of Cleveland struck out the most times, 185 each.
Ichiro Suzuki of Seattle was the toughest to double up, grounding into one double play every 230.7 times at bat, and he had the best batting average with runners in scoring position, .445.
Livan Hernandez of San Francisco allowed the most hits, 266, and the most earned runs, 132. In the American League, Rick Helling of Texas was No. 1 in a host of categories -- most hits allowed, 256; most home runs, 38; most earned runs, 124; most runs, 134.
If Helling thought he had a tough summer, wait until the winter. He is the A.L. player representative, meaning he will be knee deep in labor negotiations.

Same Old Same Old
President Bush watched four innings of Game 3 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium last Tuesday night. He sat with George Steinbrenner in the owner's box on the press level, arriving and departing through Steinbrenner's office, which is right behind the box.
During those early innings, according to another person in the box, Steinbrenner was grumbling about the ball and strike calls of the home plate umpire. As Bush was leaving, the person said, he remarked to Commissioner Bud Selig, "I see not much has changed."

HEADLINE: The Candidates on Major Issues in the Mayoral Race: An Overview; 
Education

BYLINE:  By Abby Goodnough 

 BODY:
Teachers' Salaries

MARK GREEN -- Mr. Green has consistently said that teachers need higher salaries, but unlike some of his opponents in the Democratic primary, he has never promised to close the sizable salary gap between city teachers and their suburban counterparts. In the wake of the terrorist attacks, he has continued to call for an increase in teachers' pay but has warned that it will take longer. Mr. Green has been careful not to publicly predict just how much of a delay will be necessary. But in recent weeks, he has said that the second call he would make after moving into City Hall would be to Randi Weingarten, the president of the teachers' union, to jump-start the contract negotiations that collapsed last spring. (Mr. Green has said his first call would be to President Bush.)

MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG -- Mr. Bloomberg has clung to the goal of raising teachers' pay despite the economic downturn and the shift in priorities caused by the terrorist attacks. But last week, Mr. Bloomberg said that he would impose a citywide hiring freeze that would apply to teachers along with all other city workers. This alarmed some education officials, because the Board of Education has predicted needing as many as 10,000 additional recruits by next September, mostly because of retirements.
But Mr. Bloomberg's spokesman, Edward Skyler, said on Thursday that Mr. Bloomberg would still allow hiring to fill classroom vacancies. He would not, however, allow the total number of teachers to grow, Mr. Skyler said.
Along with across-the-board raises, Mr. Bloomberg has proposed bonuses for every teacher in those schools whose test scores rise, a plan the teachers' union is likely to embrace as a preferable alternative to bonuses for individual teachers whose students outperform others.

Other Educational Issues

MR. GREEN -- Even more than increasing teachers' pay, Mr. Green has advocated reducing class size to 20 in kindergarten through third grade. But he has warned that he will not be able to do so as quickly as he had planned before Sept. 11.
His emphasis on class size reduction angered the teachers' union, which contended that the salary issue was more important; the union punished Mr. Green by endorsing other candidates in the primary and runoff elections.
Mr. Green has also pledged to continue hiring new teachers despite the worsening economy -- a difference that helped him finally win endorsement by the teachers' union last week. Increasing the number of classroom teachers would be a crucial component of Mr. Green's class size reduction plan, since the plan would require creating new classes.
Mr. Green also wants to give principals more power to assign teachers to grades and classes where they are needed. He advocates mayoral control of the school system, and wants to replace the seven-member Board of Education with a panel of educators who would advise the mayor but not have voting power. Like most city Democrats, Mr. Green is very strongly opposed to providing taxpayer-financed tuition vouchers to allow public school children to transfer to private schools.

MR. BLOOMBERG -- He said last week that reducing class size was an unrealistic goal given the city's precarious financial situation. Instead, he said, he would invest what limited resources exist after Sept. 11 into increasing the salaries of the city's 80,000 teachers. The starting salary is currently $31,910.
Mr. Bloomberg has said that he is not opposed to the concept of tuition vouchers, but it is "a politically charged issue the school system doesn't need." Mr. Skyler, his spokesman, said that Mr. Bloomberg would "not be leading the charge" for vouchers in New York City.
Mr. Bloomberg has, however, voiced support for allowing private companies to take over the management of failing public schools.
 Mr. Bloomberg would like to abolish the Board of Education and let the mayor appoint the chancellor, with the consent of the City Council. Unlike Mr. Green, he does not advocate creating an advisory panel to help the mayor shape education policy. Abby Goodnough

 VERNON CAN READ!
A Memoir.
By Vernon E. Jordan Jr.
with Annette Gordon-Reed.
Illustrated. 344 pp. New York:
PublicAffairs. $26.
 IF the racist who shot him in the back in 1980 had killed him, Vernon E. Jordan Jr. would be remembered as a genteel and effective civil rights leader and little more. But thanks to good surgeons and to Jordan's will to live, and not just live but go on climbing, "Vernon Can Read!" is the story of a black Southerner one generation removed from rural poverty thrusting himself up not only to help lead a great social movement but then to claw his way into the establishment. Unfortunately, the book stops just as his old friend Bill Clinton is elected president. Perhaps there will be another volume someday when Jordan feels ready to tell how a couple of good old boys made it to the top and what they did there.
The present memoir, written with Annette Gordon-Reed, a professor at New York University Law School, by necessity is more than a success story. It is also a recollection of the pain suffered and the bravery asserted by so many black Americans -- and more than a handful of white Americans -- in the struggle for political and economic equality. Jordan did not become a truly national figure until he was made executive director of the National Urban League in 1971. But before that he had earned the right to leadership. As a young lawyer, he walked through the mob with Charlayne Hunter to integrate the University of Georgia. He drove the lonely Southern roads at night to sign up members for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and to register black voters in precincts where either activity could get a black man lynched, and often did.
Through it all, there was a powerful personal ambition. An intriguing part of his story is its similarity to that of countless white boys of the lower middle class who came of age in the same scorned South, boys with proud, driven mothers who had pushed themselves and their children out of an utterly unromantic farm life and into the cities. Jordan's parents had fled the farmsteads for a better life in Atlanta. His father found satisfaction in a steady job at the post office. His mother, anything but satisfied cooking every day for white families, built a catering business that made her a figure of prominence in Atlanta's burgeoning black business community. She passed on her ambition. Before young Vernon left high school, he was a go-getter: chauffeuring, waiting tables, even a little nickel-and-dime bootlegging while working at a country club in a dry county.
Back in Atlanta after DePauw and Howard Universities, he sped through a succession of jobs in the civil rights movement and the federal government, before long finding himself appointed to influential government and then business boards. He was a natural choice to lead the one civil rights organization that had always been more reserved than flamboyant, more interested in economic advancement than in street demonstrations for basic rights.
When his luck almost ran out, it was not on a lonely back road in the South but at the door of a hotel in Fort Wayne, Ind., on May 29, 1980. He had just got out of the car of a white woman -- one of his board members -- when a bullet from a hunting rifle just missed severing his spinal cord. Jordan learned later that his assailant had intended to kill Jesse Jackson in Chicago but had settled on Jordan because Jackson was out of town. The man was acquitted on a dicey federal charge after the state decided not to try him. He was later convicted and sentenced to death for murdering two other black men.
Even before then, Jordan had decided to move out and up. He became a partner in the law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld in 1981, expanded his high-level corporate contacts and, one supposes, became very rich. He doesn't say. In fact, he has little to say about the private Vernon Jordan. He writes movingly about the death of his first wife from multiple sclerosis and a few other family events. But this is largely a public history. It is mildly refreshing to have a memoirist tell us that he is "congenitally private" and that some things are none of our business.

HEADLINE: HOLIDAY FILMS: ADAPTATIONS; 
'Remade in America': A Label to Avoid

BYLINE:  By DAVID EDELSTEIN; David Edelstein is the film critic for Slate.com.

 BODY:
WHEN we last encountered Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) -- the handsome, then nightmarishly disfigured, then surgically restored protagonist of the sexy 1997 Spanish psychological puzzler "Open Your Eyes" ("Abre los Ojos") -- he was either dead, dreaming or about to awaken from a virtual-reality coma in which his true love, played by that sultry toothpick Penelope Cruz, might or might not have been a figment of his imagination. "Abre los ojos," commands a woman's voice. What will Cesar look like when he next opens his eyes?
 Tom Cruise, actually. Well, his name will be David Ames, he'll speak English instead of Spanish and he'll be living in Los Angeles. But he'll still be chasing Penelope Cruz, he'll still be disfigured in a car accident and he'll still come to wonder if his life is a dream. Cesar will have undergone a transplant more perilous than any organ replacement: he'll have been wrenched from an artistically and commercially successful European film and plunked down into the strange new world of megabudget Hollywood-studio remakes. This way lie the battered husks of la femme Nikita, Martin Guerre and the heroes of "The Vanishing,""Nightwatch" and "Wings of Desire," among many others. Few complex characters have come through this journey with their souls intact. 
 "Vanilla Sky" is the name of this latest remake, and with Mr. Cruise on board, along with Ms. Cruz, Cameron Diaz and Kurt Russell, it's one of the holiday season's most enticing prospects. (It opens on Dec. 14.) The part is certainly a plum one for Mr. Cruise, who first gets to bask in his movie-star glamour and sexual potency and then to sport a pathetic-freak makeup job -- sure-fire Oscar bait. What remains to be seen is if the writer and director, the cheerfully down-to-earth Cameron Crowe ("Jerry Maguire," "Almost Famous"), will be able to straddle the eerie border between fantasy and reality that his Spanish predecessor, Alejandro Amenabar, occupies as if by birthright. 
Mr. Amenabar didn't come aboard for "Vanilla Sky." Perhaps that was because Mr. Cruise had hired him to direct his wife at the time, Nicole Kidman, in the summer's arty spook-show hit, "The Others." But I'd like to think that even if he hadn't been otherwise engaged, Mr. Amenabar would have been savvy enough to sell the rights to his story for a heap of money and then run like crazy in the other direction. He didn't need to revisit material he had thoroughly explored -- especially in the company of image-obsessed movie stars, obtuse studio executives and platoons of marketing people eager to try out sundry endings on fickle test audiences.
It would be terrific to report that Hollywood does not, contrary to popular belief, have a coarsening effect on the foreign properties it remakes. Terrific, but wrong. In this area as in few others, studios live up to their reputation as titanic forces of philistinism. Remakes don't, from the outset, attract artistic adventurers. Victor Drai, the producer who in the 80's turned the dim French comedy "Pardon Mon Affaire" into the even dimmer "The Woman in Red," and "The Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe" into the frightful "The Man With One Red Shoe," explained at the time why selling a foreign film to Hollywood executives makes for an easy day's work: "With a book," he said, "you have to tell them what kind of picture it will make. With a movie, you just show them." 
A successful American screenwriter -- currently adapting a Hong Kong action picture -- was even more explicit. "I don't have much wisdom to offer beyond this one deep insight," he said. "It's a whole lot easier to borrow a story than to think up your own."
The problem with translations goes deeper than lack of originality, though, to what one might term the DNA of cinema. In Richard Linklater's recent animated feature, "Waking Life," a professor (Caveh Zahedi) paraphrases the essential doctrine of the French theorist Andre Bazin: that film can capture "that guy in that moment in that space." Bazin called it "the holy moment" and argued that when you succeed in getting "ontological reality" on film, you have a permanent record of the "everlasting face of God."
God is palpably absent from, say, the American version of "The Vanishing," probably the most maladroit of all Hollywood adaptations. A filmmaker laboring to duplicate something he or someone else has already done doesn't have a prayer of discovering "the holy moment." He's too busy asking: "Uh, how did it go this last time? Where was the light? Was the guy standing here or there?" The spark, the fever of creation inevitably dies: the action feels predetermined, as if it had already happened a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
But that's theory. Here's practice: Over the last month, I've watched close to 100 hours of foreign films and their contemporaneous American counterparts without finding one -- not one -- remake that measured up to the original. Some, like Steven Soderbergh's "Traffic," are gripping in their own right, and a majority aren't out-and-out travesties. After all, "Pardon Mon Affaire" (remade into "The Woman in Red," 1984); "Profumo di Donna," 1974 (remade into "Scent of a Woman," 1992) and Coline Serreau farces like the 1985 "Three Men and a Cradle" ("Three Men and a Baby," 1987) weren't classics to begin with. Some work splendidly as Hollywood entertainments: "The Magnificent Seven" lacks the charge, the passion, the poetry of Akira Kurosawa's "Seven Samurai," but it's a rousing ensemble western on its own terms. And yet, next to Sergio Leone's lyrically distended "Fistful of Dollars," the Italian treatment of Kurosawa's "Yojimbo," "The Magnificent Seven" seems smoothed out, filtered through a committee, processed.
The Hollywood instinct to seize something small, foreign and idiosyncratic and make it bigger, squarer and slicker is hardly new. In 1939, in his quest to make an American star of Ingrid Bergman, the producer David O. Selznick imported from Sweden both the actress and her most sentimental vehicle, "Intermezzo." The Selznick version, directed by Gregory Ratoff, was a canny blend of continental elegance and Hollywood corn. The year before, the producer Walter Wanger had a huge hit with John Cromwell's "Algiers," a gussied-up but almost shot-for-shot remake of Julien Duvivier's "Pepe le Moko." There were small changes, however. Americans have no romantic tradition of suicide, so Pepe didn't stab himself in despair but took a slug in the back from a policeman. And other things got lost in translation. In "Pepe," Jean Gabin gazes at Mireille Balin and purrs that she reminds him of the part of Paris he loved best: "le Metro." Charles Boyer's ode to Hedy Lamarr in "Algiers" -- "You're lovely, you're marvelous, do you know what you remind me of? The subway" -- seems more likely to provoke a slap than a swoon.
Over the last several decades, Hollywood has devised its own informal set of import rules.

'FIX' THE PACING: Test audiences are monitored for yawns and backside-shifting, so a fragile thing like mood is the first to be jettisoned. When Miramax acquired the rights to Ole Bornedal's 1994 necrophile thriller "Nightwatch" ("Nattevagten"), the studio was so confident that it had a blockbuster property that it shelved the Danish original and put a 1998 American version into production with the same director and a cast that included Ewan McGregor, Nick Nolte and Patricia Arquette. What resulted was a slicker piece of work, but it doesn't weave the same kind of spell. Much of the original's horror comes from its draggy pace, from the long silences and endless tracking shots through clammy morgue corridors. Cracking the whip makes "Nightwatch" play like psycho-killer-business-as-usual. The faster it gets, the duller it gets.

STREAMLINE THE LIFE OUT OF THE NARRATIVE: The emotional core of "Nightwatch" isn't the rampaging necrophile. It's the story of two graduating law students terrified of growing up, losing their freedom, dying: the morgue and the killer are nightmare extensions of their morbid anxiety. The American version puts all the weight on the bogeyman. In a hilarious irony, the Danish buddies worry that their lives will become as false as "a Hollywood movie." So what do they cite in the Hollywood remake? A "USA Network movie." I guess there's always farther to fall.

NIX TEMPORAL TRICKS FOR THE STICKS: Forget disorienting leaps back and forth in time. You're not in Oz anymore, Toto -- you're in Kansas, a Kansas multiplex, where folks will be irritated by a lack of linearity. So the American "Vanishing" begins at the beginning, with the killer -- instead of with the man and woman who should be the focus of everything.

DOPILY OVER-ROMANTICIZE: "City of Angels," the American adaptation of "Wings of Desire," is cheekily honest enough to arrange its platoon of heavenly messengers on top of the Hollywood sign -- as if to signal that this won't be Wim Wenders's dreamy, Berlin-based meditation on anomie and spiritual rebirth but a piece of wet kitsch in which Nicolas Cage (especially hangdog-soulful in his long black trenchcoat) abandons his angelic perch to inhale the fragrance of Meg Ryan's bleached coiffure. His "fall" to earth makes her so deliriously happy that she hops on her bicycle, leans back and closes her eyes in ecstasy, and pedals straight into a logging truck. Mr. Wenders's original had its sentimental streak, but it left you yearning for something more profound than tighter bicycle-helmet laws.

RESPECT FAMILY VALUES: Other countries, especially France, have a more fatalistic attitude toward adultery. (They found the American sanctimoniousness over President Clinton's dalliances peculiar.) So adapting the 1975 French film "Cousin, Cousine" must have posed quite a challenge. An Oscar-nominated counterculture comedy that celebrates abandoning one's marriage (provided that one has been cheated on first, and that one engages in extramarital sex openly, proudly and without bourgeois guilt), the movie took a decade to remake -- by which time its thrust had been painfully dulled. In place of the original's blithely irresponsible climax, "Cousins" offers earnest discussion, hand-wringing and self-denial; instead of reveling in the abandonment of family, it says that conscientious infidelity leads to a new, improved family. You could argue that this is a wiser, more moral scenario. But I'll bet you had more fun at "Cousin, Cousine."
The American Civil War-era adaptation of "The Return of Martin Guerre" treats sex outside marriage even more gingerly. The French Martin is cold and sexually dysfunctional, so when a warm and hunky impostor (Gerard Depardieu) arrives, it's enough that he works hard and shows his predecessor's love-starved wife (Nathalie Baye) a good time in the sack. In "Sommersby" (1993) the real husband isn't just a creep but a racist, wife-beating murderer -- and he's dead to boot, so there's really no moral downside when the wife (Jodie Foster) jumps into bed with the pretender (Richard Gere). Together they create a racial, economic and sexual utopia: a scene in which whites and "coloreds" plant tobacco seed gives way to the hero's planting a different kind of seed in the heroine. "Sommersby" weaves a rich tapestry, but the simple and mysterious erotic heartbeat of "The Return of Martin Guerre" (1982) is here not even a murmur.

KEEP THE STARS STRONG, SYMPATHETIC AND ATTRACTIVE . . .: even when that irons out dramatic complexity. The American "Traffic" doesn't pay the same kind of attention to economics as its British television counterpart, "Traffik." But what really undermines its realism is Michael Douglas's making like John Wayne in "The Searchers." Then Mr. Douglas gets one of those scenes in which the politician spontaneously chucks his prepared text and extemporizes from the heart -- a cliche that he had already wrung dry in 1995 in "The American President." Have you ever seen an honest politician in a Hollywood movie successfully deliver a prepared text?

MISCAST A STAR, DON'T CAST AN UNKNOWN: Luc Besson's "Femme Nikita" (1990) makes little sense, but it's one of the most irrationally sexy thrillers ever made. The title character (Anne Parillaud) is a feral junkie who coldly kills a cop and is forced by the government to become a chic, supermodel-like assassin. She's taught how to dress and make herself up and act like a real lady -- all at the expense of her soul. Somewhere underneath the splattery action is a parable about how women are forced to surrender their autonomy and individuality to a patriarchal state -- a parable made less than feminist by the way in which Mr. Besson madly fetishizes his leading lady (whom he was dating).
The real focus is how Ms. Parillaud's little black dress rides up her muscular thighs as she clutches her big gun, and the ripeness of her flesh in her bra and panties as she points a long, long rifle. She's a squirmy but hard sexual object -- exactly what her American equivalent, Bridget Fonda, is not. In "Point of No Return" (what a flaccid title!), the set-pieces are virtually identical but have almost zero impact. It's possible that Ms. Fonda is a better actress than Ms. Parillaud, but she has a soft, needy, tremulous presence. She isn't an autonomous object, so there's no unknowability, no mystery -- and no erotic tension.

LEAVE NOTHING UNRESOLVED: Unlike the bracing ending of "La Femme Nikita," "Point of No Return" (1993) offers a tidy coda, appended after test audiences complained that they didn't understand what had happened to the heroine. It's the most embarrassing sequence in the movie -- and it brings us to the American "Vanishing," which manages to embody all ruinous principles above and more. The film is so deeply awful that a video store manager told me that not only didn't he stock it but that he would never work in a store that did.
The 1988 Dutch original, "Spoorloos," directed by George Sluizer, has a Bazinian "holy moment" in its first sequence -- largely thanks to Johanna ter Steege, a transcendent actress who makes her abandonment by her boyfriend (Gene Bervoets) in a tunnel so momentous that you can understand why he'd spend the rest of his life trying to dispel it. The comparable scene in the American remake, also directed by Mr. Sluizer, passes quickly and meaninglessly, as Sandra Bullock gives a coquettish little smile to show that she forgives her guy (Kiefer Sutherland) and would now like nothing more than a can of Diet Coke. This version is impatient to move on, past the woman who will vanish with no trace to a new, hash-slinging heroine (Nancy Travis), who will coax the protagonist back to life -- and ultimately rescue him from the tomb of his obsession.
The most indelible aspect of the Dutch "Vanishing" -- the turn that haunts everyone who sees it for days, weeks, years -- is its ghastly finale, in which the protagonist finally learns what happened to his girlfriend and joins her, first with horror and then with a kind of hysterical glee, in their prescribed destiny. At that point in the American "Vanishing" the movie still has half an hour to go, enough time for girlfriend No. 2 to make her way to the scene and engage in standard cat-and-mouse thriller games with the cretinous villain (played by Jeff Bridges like a nerd out of a "Saturday Night Live" parody).
What is it about this new ending that makes the film so overarchingly dreadful, so much worse than the sum of its parts -- and so representative? I think it has to do with its naked Americanness. The revised "Vanishing" stands for Hollywood-fed fantasy in the face of fear. It's how we wish that the original had turned out -- with true love and Yankee gumption trumping destiny, trumping an unfathomable foreign enemy, trumping foreign movies and their ambiguous sympathies and open endings. We can buy you and remake you, the American "Vanishing" proclaims: a fatal bit of hubris, with global implications.

HEADLINE: Looking for a Way Home for the Holidays 

BYLINE:  By NANCY HASS and LESLIE KAUFMAN; Additional reporting by Ariel Hart and Mindy Sink.

 BODY:
AS a convert to Hinduism, Douglas Brooks normally regards the holiday season skeptically, as a curious and overly commercial artifact of American life. This year, however, he feels the need to mark the end of the year meaningfully. So Mr. Brooks, a professor of religion at the University of Rochester, has created his own ritual.
 He has printed the names of thousands of the victims of Sept. 11 he found on the Web, and on Christmas Day plans to "sit in front of my gods" and intone the names aloud. "It may be only for me and not for them, but I wish these souls their peace," he said. 
 Christine Drumright, a handbag designer in Denver, will remain at home with her husband and two cats for Thanksgiving and Christmas, but she plans to visit relatives in Connecticut in early December. "It feels like a pilgrimage," she said. "It is my gift to my family. We are not exchanging presents this year." 
To counter a black mood under the pall of war and terrorism, Tom Fontana, who lives in Greenwich Village and produces the television drama "Oz" for HBO, has bought out the house for the Off Broadway musical "The Fantasticks" on Christmas Eve. He is inviting a legion of friends to spread a little corny cheer. "It's sort of sweet and Christmasy," he said of the play, which is closing in January after 41 years. "I guess what I'm trying to say to people is, you either believe or you're afraid." 
As the Thanksgiving kickoff to the season of making merry approaches, Americans are saying they want to mark this year of fragility and insecurity differently. Everyone from religious leaders to party planners, marketing gurus to toy sellers, who make it their business to parse and measure the collective psyche, are registering powerful tremors on their seismographs.
The trend could be described as the cyclical resurrection of home, hearth and spirituality, after an era of no-holds-barred indulgence, but it is not quite that simple. Americans are too familiar with the dysfunctional family, in pop culture and around their own dinner tables, to pine for a simple return to a Norman Rockwell America that never really was. 
Like Dorothy and Toto, Americans want to go home, but they have to invent their own path. This holiday season is about compromises and half-steps back to tradition, showing up in the unexpected popularity of board games to be played by a crackling fire, or the preference for Brahms rather than Britney Spears at office parties. The way home is not obvious, and it is being mapped by individuals rather than by political leaders or marketers with products to sell. 
Americans were undergoing "a shift in priorities" even before the calamity of Sept. 11, driven by months of economic deterioration, said J. Walker Smith, the president of Yankelovich Partners, a leading market research company. "We are now seeing that spike," he added. "People are expressing a claustrophobia with abundance." He predicted that a new set of traditions would emerge. 
Anxieties about the safety of air travel are causing many to forgo long-distance travel, instead driving to nearby relatives or adding extra leaves to their holiday tables to include "orphans" who won't make it back to their own family gatherings. Most airlines have reduced their flight capacity by 15 to 20 percent through the end of the year, and hotel occupancy rates are still about 20 percent below normal, according to the Travel Business Roundtable, a trade group for the travel and tourism industry. 
Cathy Pelaez, an executive vice president of Liberty Travel, the nation's largest privately owned leisure travel company, reports that despite bargain basement prices, overseas travel is down 30 percent and bookings to the Caribbean and Mexico are off 15 percent. "It is a different mentality," Ms. Pelaez sighed, "people are wanting to nest more than in the past."
Family is the universal sentiment, but it is being celebrated with modern flexibility this year. Julee and Kenny Shapiro, who live on Fulton Street, just blocks from the site of the World Trade Center, will celebrate Thanksgiving in a weekend house in the Berkshires that they have rented for years with a group of friends. But this season there will also be room at the table for more than the usual complement of housemates.
"A lot of our other friends are single and don't live near their families, so we're going to have to make room," said Ms. Shapiro, who still doesn't have phone service back at her apartment. "We don't want anyone to be alone this year." 
As West Coast transplants to New York, Gina and Tim Ryan usually celebrate Thanksgiving in their Upper East Side apartment with friends, but after Sept. 11, Ms. Ryan said, the couple "definitely felt like it was time to hunker down with family." They hadn't visited Mr. Ryan's brother's family in Pennsylvania in four years, but a week after the terrorist attacks, they booked a rental car and a hotel for Thanksgiving so they could go.
The reasons were not so much sentimental as starkly practical. "I felt it was important to be with family this year because, let's face it, we might not get another chance," Ms. Ryan said. 
If the urge to hunker down and hang together is jarring industries like travel, companies that specialize in products that encourage cocooning are in the green.
"Anything that will engage the whole family is more popular than we anticipated back in the summer," said Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for Toys "R" Us. Board games like Clue, Monopoly, Life and three-dimensional puzzles are all selling unexpectedly well, she said. "The K'Nex Screamin' Serpent Roller Coaster, a very elaborate construction kit, is an excellent example of the zeitgeist toy," she said, "because it engages the whole family for hours in the same place."
Beyond family, the search for spirituality, another holiday perennial, has come back with new vigor and with a new twist.
At Mariner's Community Church in Half Moon Bay, Calif., attendance has been soaring, as it has at many houses of worship across the country since Sept. 11. But people are not just returning to pray, said Glenn Park, the minister, they are asking questions. "People want to know if God is real," Mr. Park said. "They are struggling."
Reflexive acts of piety, like filling pews and contributing money to good causes, don't seem to satisfy either. Melody Neal, the director of resources at Chris Homes, a network of homes for needy youths in Atlanta, said that cash donations were down, echoing a lament of charities across the nation, as people diverted money to 9-11 relief funds, or tightened their belts for a recession. Volunteerism, however, is another matter.
"We have a program where volunteers can make homemade cookies for children," Ms. Neal said. "Three times as many people are wanting to do this project than last year, and it's all since Sept. 11. There's a lot more interest in people wanting to get their hands into something as opposed to just writing a check."
Terri Davis, an executive recruiter in Parker, Colo., certainly fits that description. For many years, Mrs. Davis has given money to the Denver Rescue Mission, a homeless shelter. This year, she will reduce her cash contribution and instead try to recruit the 22 families who live on her cul-de-sac to adopt a needy family each.
"This year, we really want to rally to the support of other neighbors," she said. "The emphasis needs to be placed on the intrinsic values of the holidays, rather than on toys and presents." She said her 7-year-old son will still get gifts, though.
Many parents of young children emphasized that Santa's bag would still bulge this year, if only to defy attempts by the country's enemies to undermine normal life. Still, retailers are deeply fretful that this year consumers will finally shut off the geyser of holiday spending, but the economy is the main culprit, not the threat of terrorism coming to malls or even mail-ordered packages. Overall holiday retail sales are expected to be flat, according to Merrill Lynch, which would make it the worst season in 33 years.
As a significant number of adults are seeking to separate this holiday season from the materialistic splurge of the last decade, it affects everything from gift buying to religious services to entertaining.
The actress Sarah Jessica Parker said that neither she nor her husband, the actor Matthew Broderick, feel much like celebrating. The couple live in Greenwich Village and, like many residents of downtown, still feel unsteady. "I just want to sit around and knit," Ms. Parker said. "I told Matthew that unless there was something he really wanted, I just didn't feel like buying anything."
"Home for the Holidays," will be the Christmas theme at Willow Creek Community Church, an enormous congregation in suburban Chicago that expects some 40,000 people to attend 10 Christmas services this year. Reflecting a more somber mood among congregants, the church is toning things down. "We are not going to have as large a service from a complexity standpoint," said David Stahl, a church spokesman. The church has canceled the full orchestra and is going with a six-piece band. "Services will have more of a singing around the piano feel," Mr. Stahl said.
At the Bronfman Center at New York University, Rabbi Andy Bachman predicted that the typical festive atmosphere surrounding Hanukkah will be "tinged with more serious spirituality this year."
"There seems to be a different feeling in the air," Rabbi Bachman said. "The whole old saw of Jews sort of pooh-poohing the whole holiday season, the jokes about them going out to Chinese restaurants on Christmas -- well, that's probably going to be less the case this year. I suspect that this is going to be a holiday season when values are brought to the surface." 
The holiday office party, which grew ever more elaborate as corporate profits rocketed in the 90's, will forgo the dancing girls and Champagne fountains this season. David Adler, the chief executive of bizbash .com, a New York-based online directory of caterers and other services for event planners, said the industry has lost an estimated $1 billion in bookings since Sept. 11, and the mood for parties going forward is restrained. "Instead of things like having Britney Spears sing at your corporate Christmas party," he said, "there will be lots of quartets playing beautiful music." 
Maria Thompson, the director of rentals and events at the Callanwolde Fine Arts Center, an Atlanta mansion used for corporate entertaining, said most companies are going ahead with holiday parties, but with a humbler tone than in recent years. "A company that has in the past had a mystery theater, tremendous entertainment and maybe flew singers in from the East Coast, or an orchestra," she said, "now they're looking at not even a sit-down dinner, but a buffet, with maybe ham, beef tenderloin, warm foods like a mashed potato bar." 
From comfort food to the comforts of home, Americans who had felt that only the bright and shiny future mattered, not the past, are rediscovering the tried and true.
"This was the year I was not going to go home for Thanksgiving, the first year in my life," said Marilee English, an advertising account executive who lives with two Siamese cats in Brooklyn Heights. "I was going to stay right here and make dinner for three friends." But that was before Sept. 11. 
When Ms. English's widowed father called from Michigan, she said, "I melted down. He said he wanted his girl at home. What could I say?" She booked a flight to Kalamazoo.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Not Relying on Aid From Bush in '02 Elections 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Despite President Bush's colossal job approval ratings, many Republicans who are running in the midterm elections next year say they do not expect him, even if he remains enormously popular, to help their own campaigns.
 If anything, some Republican lawmakers and strategists fear that the war and Mr. Bush's desire to appear bipartisan could prevent him from doing much to benefit them next year. And they are worried that the sagging economy -- underscored by the surge in unemployment announced this week -- could eclipse the war as a political issue and that voters could blame the Republicans. 
 The 2002 elections are a long way away, and no one can safely predict what the political climate will be next week, let alone next year. Even so, many Republicans are nervous that Mr. Bush is not thinking ahead to next year, when control of the House and Senate will be at stake, as well as a third of the governorships.
"There is a danger that the president is going to be worried about how to maintain his popularity and not sacrifice it," said Representative Mark Souder, Republican of Indiana. "When presidents are involved in tough international conflicts, very seldom do they want to use their inventory of good will helping House and Senate members. Even when they do help, it's like pulling teeth."
Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a close ally of Mr. Bush who because of term limits cannot run in 2002, said that if the president's popularity remains "at nosebleed levels, that's not a guarantee that we win" in elections next year. Already, Mr. Engler said, "the economy is bigger than the war in local elections."
Some Republicans also said that although they expect the public to continue to rally behind Mr. Bush on the war, that support will not carry over to other looming issues, notably the economy. To underscore that point, these Republicans note that in the two governors' contests this Tuesday -- in New Jersey and Virginia -- the Republicans are trailing in the polls.
Strategists on both sides say the outcome will turn on local economic matters and not the drive against terrorism. Advisers for the two Republicans have complained privately that they have not been able to capitalize on Mr. Bush's popularity because he has not campaigned on their behalf.
"What I worry about is that people will divorce the president from the party," said Tom Cole, a former chief of staff of the Republican National Committee. "You'll probably see that in New Jersey and Virginia. You'll see the American people drawing a very clear separation -- 'I support the president overseas, but on domestic issues I'm not letting that get in the way of my judgment.' "
The president, Mr. Cole said, was "doing the right thing as president to keep us united, but it's going to cost the president's party in terms of not having as much active participation from the White House."
One of the Republicans' top fund-raisers said that if Mr. Bush cannot raise money for candidates next year, "that's an enormous loss."
The most recent example of what some Republicans say is Mr. Bush tending to his own interests was his role in winning support on Thursday for a House bill that would place the federal government in charge of airport security. He opposed a version that would have made the baggage and personnel screeners federal workers. By backing the Republican alternative, Mr. Bush placated his conservative base, which he will need to be re-elected in 2004. But that could come at a cost for Republicans in swing districts next year, who could be accused of delaying a resolution and sacrificing safety.
"With Bill Clinton, it was all about Bill Clinton," said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon. "It wasn't about having a Democratic majority. If it becomes all about George Bush, the same thing could happen to them."
Many Republicans insist they are well poised for the midterm elections. Even if the president lacks coattails, they say, his popularity is building the morale of active Republicans and has been a boon to the party's efforts to recruit candidates. 
Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said the only way Republicans would suffer in 2002 would be if Mr. Bush were viewed by voters as not moving sufficiently to rescue a faltering economy -- which was what happened to his father when he ran for re-election in 1992.
"The only danger that I see right now is that if attention to what's happening in the war abated quickly and Republicans were not paying attention to the economy," Mr. Goeas said. "But Bush is not the only one who has learned from his father's past. Republicans have learned as well."
Charles Cook, who edits a respected nonpartisan political newsletter, said: "I'm becoming more and more convinced that the spotlight is going to be moving back to the economy, back to domestic issues. If the spotlight is the economy, I don't know how the Republicans hold the House. If the spotlight is where it is today, it would be hard to see how Republicans could lose the House."
Republicans seem the least worried about the Senate because the war has undermined Democratic efforts to recruit potent Senate candidates in some crucial races.
Yet Republicans are concerned about losing their slim majority in the House, as well as governorships. There are 29 Republican governors, but 23 of those seats are being contested next year.
The president's party almost always loses House seats in midterm elections, even when the nation is at war. In 1942, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt was wildly popular, the Democrats lost 55 seats in the House and 9 seats in the Senate.
While they may not be able to count on Mr. Bush, incumbent Republicans can take solace in the fact that, at least for now, the political climate favors incumbents. Just as Mr. Bush's popularity is at record highs, so is that of members of Congress. Voters seem to want to turn to seasoned leaders in times of crisis. That, of course, is also good news for Democratic incumbents.
Still, it is impossible to know now how the war or the hunt for the terrorists -- or the economy -- will play out.
"There's no way to foretell this election," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, who was reluctant to engage in his election-year pitch about how the Democrats will take back the House. "It's really, really cloudy. I could argue both sides of it. But I don't know a thing, and I don't think anybody else does either."

at an Internet Goliath.

 When the dot-com boom was in its heyday -- a period that lately seems more distant than ever -- the "first-mover advantage" was a popular idea. In the new economy, apparently, capitalism had become a raw sprint, to be won by those who were first to recognize and claim a new business "space." More recently, the dot-com unraveling has set in motion another competition: the race for first-mover advantage in recounting where the new economy went wrong. 
It seems likely that "The Godfather of Silicon Valley," by the journalist Gary Rivlin, was not conceived this way at all. The subject is a man named Ron Conway, a wealthy investor with a gift for networking. After amassing a fortune in the computer business, by 1997 he had started making angel investments in tech companies like Marimba. Usually angel investing refers to financial backing for a tiny start-up that can't get help from more mainstream sources. That's why it's angelic.
Conway, though, seems to have been trying to get a piece of deals that already looked hot, or that's the spirit that animated the two investment funds he soon formed. He raised tens of millions of dollars from the well-off folks in his apparently infinite Rolodex -- from those famous in the tech world, like Bill Joy and Esther Dyson, to those who are simply famous, like Shaquille O'Neal, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Henry Kissinger. Conway returned to the Rolodex and spread much of this money over a range of Internet start-up deals.
As you've already guessed, things have gone rather poorly. By early 2001, 43 of the companies Conway backed were out of business, and he had written off dozens more. Instead of scoring a return of 10 times their original investment, Rivlin concludes, it now seems possible that Conway's high-rolling investors may actually lose money.
This raises two questions. First, why should we care about the travails of Ron Conway? Rivlin does a nice job of telling his story in this brief book, and it's not his fault that by now such stories sound so familiar. Probably Conway seemed more interesting when he was the Most Powerful Investor You've Never Heard Of, but as it turns out he's just another dot-com also-ran. And few readers are likely to be outraged that Shaq isn't getting the return on investment he'd hoped for.
The bigger question is, what exactly made Conway and all his investors -- many of whom are smart people, or at least employ smart people to manage their money -- believe that they could earn such massive returns? A key moment Rivlin points to is the initial public offering of Theglobe.com, an online community business, in November 1998. "To some in the Valley," Rivlin writes, Theglobe's one-day leap from $9 to $97 a share "represented a critical inflection point," as "an overly forgiving stock market seemed to drop all pretensions of rationality."
Theglobe, famously, was the brainchild of two Cornell students, one of whom is Stephan Paternot. His book, "A Very Public Offering," written with Andrew Essex, begins on the morning of that memorable I.P.O. He and his partner, "dressed casually," settled in at the offices of Bear Stearns, their firm's underwriter. Briefly that day, Paternot, who is in his mid-20's and calls himself a "rebel," was worth $97 million.
Maybe because of his limited experience of life generally and business in particular, Paternot seems to have no real insight into the weird hothouse environment that made Theglobe's I.P.O. a landmark event. Instead he tells us the documents for the preoffering road show "were certainly sleek. We insisted that our S1 be matte black with hip green graphics, which was very much considered taboo." (There's a rebel for you.) And he goes on at some length about his briefly euphoric high life: Manhattan nightclubs were "mind-blowing." Flying in a private jet was "phenomenal." Making it to the top was "slammin'." O.K., that last example is actually from "Ice by Ice: The Vanilla Ice Story in his Own Words." But Paternot's offering is less like a business book than like a pop star's self-serving reminiscences of a fleeting moment at the top: every success is the fair result of hard work, every skeptic is a small-minded player-hater.
More seriously, Paternot still seems confused about the relationship between a business and its share price. While he claims he was frustrated that others focused on Theglobe's stock as it gradually sank into the single digits, his own anecdotes make it seem that there was more internal focus on ways to "goose the stock" than on building a profitable business. He grouses about those who doubted him and his partner "even though we'd just made them a 1,000 percent return in one day." In fact, those who made such a killing by flipping the stock the first day it was traded profited precisely from their skepticism. It was the suckers they sold to, who believed in Theglobe, who got crushed.
By the book's end Paternot has left the company, and he announces that he plans to "channel my creative drive into film." Theglobe's stock has been delisted, and, since the book went to press, its flagship site has shut down. Whatever "inflection point" caused people to bid the shares of such unlikely companies into the stratosphere has passed. But who were those people? Did anybody really believe this or that dot-com would eventually justify the nutty valuations they briefly achieved?
J. David Kuo believed. "Dot.Bomb," his memoir of life at the ill-fated e-commerce firm Value America, begins with him punching away at his laptop, trying to corral shares in that company on the day of market debut. "I had heard about the quick riches that e-commerce I.P.O.'s offered," he explains. The offering price was $21; Kuo got in at $72, "assuming it was still going to go to $100." This did not happen, of course, but it turns out that Kuo did land a job at the company, as a public relations executive. He got in at the top -- and was on hand for the whole ride down.
This means Kuo wasn't there for the company's creation or early growth; he seems to have dealt with this by interviewing those who were there, but he's often vague on his sourcing. A bigger problem is that a great deal of the book recounts office politics and insider bickering at a company that seemed marginal even during the peak of interest in dot-coms. Value America's main moment in the spotlight came as a result of its first-mover advantage among dot-flops.
As at Theglobe, executives there spent an inordinate amount of time worried about the sinking stock. (Maybe all happy dot-coms are different, but it seems unhappy ones are all alike.) On several occasions the company badgered stock analysts to issue positive reports -- especially the analyst for the investment bank that took Value America public. From the company's point of view, Kuo writes, this analyst "needed to be . . . telling the world that we were better than AOL or Microsoft had ever been. . . . That was the way this world was supposed to work." He should have been "pimping our stock."
Since ripping analysts has become such a popular pastime, it's worth noting that the Value America team never did get the support they wanted. (Theglobe.com had a similar problem with its analyst at Bear Stearns, who actually downgraded that stock.)
But here as elsewhere in the book, it's hard to figure what Kuo really makes of all this. Sometimes he seems to believe the company could have made it, sometimes he seems to be saying the whole thing was a house of cards all along. Craig Winn, the company's founder, comes across alternately as a visionary or a near-delusional tyrant. All these things could be partly true, I suppose, but they never really get reconciled; like Paternot, Kuo seems content simply to offer anecdotes, not judgments.
These first rough drafts of dot-com history mostly tell us things we know: how some of these companies soared and then crashed with dizzying speed. One suspects there is more to say about why this happened, and how our world really has changed (or not) as a result. Maybe the lesson -- a familiar one in the "new economy" -- is that that the first movers may not get the last word.

BYLINE:  By By James Traub; James Traub, a contributing writer for the magazine, writes regularly about New York politics.

 BODY:
In August, a poll appeared in this newspaper indicating that New Yorkers, a perennially discontented lot, had reached a possibly unprecedented level of contentment under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Barely a third of the respondents said that they would move out of the city if they could, down from 60 percent 10 years earlier. Only a quarter expected life in the city to worsen over the next 10 to 15 years, which was the lowest such figure the pollsters ever recorded. Though few respondents knew much about the six major candidates then vying to succeed Giuliani, who is barred by law from seeking a third term, the outcome scarcely seemed to matter; nearly two-thirds said they felt that New York would be as good a place to live, or better, under any of them. The city appeared to be running on rails. 
 It seemed, in that remote era, that the next mayor, whoever he was, would inherit a job shrunken back to normal size after the grandiosity and melodrama of the Giuliani years. Listening to the candidates' rather desultory speeches and debates, it was a fair guess the new mayor would retain the core Giuliani program while making symbolic and tonal changes -- no more concrete barriers at City Hall, no more savage mockery of critics -- that would allow him to pronounce an end to the Giuliani Era. New York no longer needed a Big Mayor. 
 And now, quite suddenly, it does. The next mayor will have to deal with the largest budget deficits in the city's history; he will have to guide a rebuilding effort of unprecedented proportions, and do so according to a coherent vision of the city's future he must forge; he will have to be the city's advocate in Washington; and he will have to play the Good Father to anxious New Yorkers. As John Mollenkopf, the director of the Center for Urban Research at the CUNY Graduate Center, put it recently, "There's a strong sense that we need a Colin Powell figure -- in command, confidence-generating, warm, good at soothing our cares and worries." 
Well, Colin Powell is busy, and the two candidates who made it through the primaries and are on the ballot in this Tuesday's election -- the Democrat Mark Green and the Republican Michael Bloomberg -- don't remind anybody of the secretary of state. 
It is strange to think what Rudy Giuliani's reputation might be today had the World Trade Center disaster never occurred. He would still have ranked as one of the big mayors, of course -- up there with LaGuardia, his hero, and a cut above figures like Ed Koch, Robert Wagner and John Purroy Mitchel, a reformer from the early part of the century. Giuliani achieved two extraordinary things. He made New York a significantly safer place at a time when a high crime rate was considered virtually part of the order of nature. And he established, if less permanently, a new ethic of limited government in place of the sprawlingly generous social-welfare state that LaGuardia himself did so much to create. 
But he did both of these things by the end of his first term. All of the big mayors before him ran out of gas eventually; Giuliani began to appear aimless -- shadowboxing against errant cabbies and jaywalkers -- not long after his re-election. Had it not been for Sept. 11, New Yorkers would have remembered the end of his second term for the epic bathos of his "good friend" Judith Nathan, his prostate cancer and his aborted Senate run. Indeed, the August poll found that Giuliani would have had a tough race against any of the four major Democratic candidates, none of whom the public seemed to know all that well.
The truth is that Giuliani was either not so engaged by or not so effective with problems that could not be solved through confrontation. It would be left to his successor to grapple with those issues, and so the next mayoralty was going to be about things like education, housing and public health. The pendulum appeared to be swinging at least slightly back to the left, which is to say back toward a more activist, ambitious government. Earlier this year, the Century Foundation and the CUNY Graduate Center published a volume of essays titled "Rethinking the Urban Agenda: Reinvigorating the Liberal Tradition in New York City and Urban America." The book serves as a blueprint for a post-Giuliani, and often an overtly anti-Giuliani, world, laying out progressive solutions to problems of welfare, homelessness, health care, taxation and criminal justice.
Attention to these issues found their echo -- albeit, a rather pale one -- in the Democratic primary, in which several of the candidates talked about increasing taxes to pay for teacher salaries and smaller class size and about resuming the ambitious public housing program begun under Koch. One candidate, Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president, played directly on a sense of estrangement in the minority community -- Giuliani was a different sort of big mayor to many of the city's blacks and Hispanics -- with his message about "the other New York." Ferrer was quoted as saying: "The good news is Rudy Giuliani is out of here in three months. And the better news is, if you help me become mayor, his policies are out of here in three months, too." 
Here, then, was the status quo ante on Labor Day, which traditionally is when people start paying attention to the mayoral campaign: a general expectation of prosperity and calm, a crisis mayoralty that had played itself out, perhaps a widening gulf between satisfied middle-class voters and dissatisfied poor and working-class ones. Then two aircraft were steered into the twin towers, and the status quo became irrelevant. The critique of Giuliani came to an immediate end, and so did hopes for a new era of government activism. Alan Brinkley, a historian at Columbia University and the author of an essay in "Rethinking the Urban Agenda," says: "All these ideas about the city stepping in and doing progressive things that the federal government didn't do -- I don't think it's likely to get anywhere. The new mayor is going to have to identify himself with reconstruction and with the anguish the city will still be recovering from."
Sept. 11 transformed both the mayor and the mayoralty. It may be that there has never been a moment when the mayoralty was so crucial and so charged with symbolic power. 
During one of the Yankees' recent playoff games, the big screen in right-center field flashed an image first of the American flag, then of the face of Rudolph Giuliani and then of the flag once again -- as if the mayor's face had itself become a banner of freedom and flinty resistance. His moral authority seemed boundless. On Oct. 1, he became the first mayor to deliver a substantive address to the United Nations, where he lectured the delegates like the head of a proud but beleaguered nation. 
But you have to look at the remainder of the mayor's day to fathom the extraordinary dimensions of this new job. From the U.N., he went directly to ground zero to give one of the almost-daily tours of the wreckage he was providing to global and national leaders, in this case a delegation of more than 100 members of Congress. And then he attended a funeral for an assistant fire chief and a memorial service for the hundreds of employees of the Cantor Fitzgerald bond-trading firm who died in the attacks. He was, all at once, an international, national and metropolitan figure.
I joined the press pool at ground zero when Giuliani gave his Congressional tour. The group stationed itself at the southwestern corner of the site, from which they could see the two great cathedral-like skeletons of the twin towers and the smoke curling from fires still smoldering underground. The mayor had changed into his monogrammed Police Department jacket and N.Y.P.D. hat, and as he offered his narrative of destruction and rebirth, the representatives huddled around him like awestruck pilgrims gazing at a holy sepulcher. It was very moving, and it was also brilliant theater.
"The businesses that have been dislocated are the core American businesses," Giuliani said gravely. "Their dislocation has something to do with the performance of the economy." Ike Skelton, a Missouri Democrat who towered over the mayor, said softly, "It's the saddest scene in the world -- every American ought to be here." Afterward, on the immense, drafty pier that the mayor was using as his makeshift command center, Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, vowed, "We will come back to New York again to see this town . . . rise from the ashes that we saw today."
Giuliani risked sacrificing some of his moral prestige when he tried to inveigle his way into a third term, or at least into a 90-day extension of his current term, but whatever ill feelings he may have created instantly vanished with the anthrax scare, which restored him to his role as New York's father figure. His combination of stoicism and empathy made him what he had never been before, and perhaps never even wanted to be before: beloved. And it is very likely that he will remain the city's beloved authority figure for the last two months of his term, though with his gift for going too far -- and then a little farther -- you can never tell. 
Who wants to succeed a beloved authority figure? It is a formula for failure. Anyone would seem diminished by comparison. On Primary Day, Sept. 25 -- actually the rerun of Primary Day, which was held but suspended on the fateful Sept. 11 -- I spoke to about 30 voters in Greenwich Village, Riverdale and Harlem, all highly liberal neighborhoods. About half of them said that the only candidate they really wanted to vote for was Giuliani, on a write-in ballot, and some of them were furious when election workers told them they could not do so.
Randee Mia Berman, who works for the state government, said that though she had volunteered for Mark Green, she had voted for Peter Vallone, the City Council speaker, simply because he was closest to Giuliani. "Giuliani made all the others look so small," she said. "Maybe it's an optical illusion because he looms so large. It's like 'Alice in Wonderland': the Democrats are the croquet players, and the mayor is the Cheshire Cat."
Greatness of soul had not, of course, been a prerequisite for the job when the candidates first presented themselves to the public earlier this year. Placed now in the impossible position of trying to seem bigger than they appeared to be, they only diminished themselves further, as when Mark Green rather defensively insisted that he would have done "as well or better than" Giuliani had. (Bloomberg actually topped Green in the braggadocio department when he said, "I have more experience in dealing with governments than probably anybody in the whole world.") Bloomberg, Green and Vallone all told me that they admired Harry Truman -- a small man who succeeded a very big man and turned out to be much bigger than anyone expected. Of course, F.D.R. was dead when Truman took office.
Mark Green likes to say that destiny nominates the right man for the moment -- pace Truman -- but it is not obvious what destiny has in mind in this election. Truman, like LaGuardia, Koch and Giuliani, enjoyed the unimpeachable authenticity of a humbly born son of the soil. Neither Bloomberg nor Green has this advantage. Both are polished men who not only live on the Upper East Side of Manhattan but also obviously belong there. Neither one talks New York: Bloomberg still sounds like Medford, Mass., where he was reared, while Green speaks with the deracinated accent of Great Neck, the well-to-do Long Island suburb from which he hails. And both men are products of the 60's, though very different aspects of the decade: in Bloomberg's case, the go-go financial years that made him a young millionaire at Salomon Brothers, and in Green's, the pamphleteering, ideologically charged era that made him a comrade in arms of Ralph Nader and a kind of gadfly without portfolio. 
Bloomberg is certainly the more unlikely of the two. He is an entrepreneur and political neophyte who argues that his experience founding and directing an extraordinarily successful company, the eponymous Bloomberg LP, gives him the managerial experience to run New York City; the tag line of his ads is "A leader, not a politician." He is, he says, a "pragmatist," not an ideologue; a businessman who looks for good solutions, not perfect ones. He says that he can instill in the city's work force the same kind of "esprit de corps" that has made Bloomberg LP so successful, thus increasing productivity and permitting the city to afford raises even in the tough times ahead. But New Yorkers do not share either the national contempt for politicians or the national reverence for entrepreneurs: Bloomberg has had trouble tapping into a vein of discontent or generating a wave of enthusiasm, and he has remained far behind Green in the polls despite shattering local records for campaign finance by spending close to $30 million of his own money. 
Until he began campaigning, Bloomberg had the same relationship to the city that most rich people do: he consumed its rarefied treats and enjoyed its hubbub from a safe distance. He lived, in the derisive phrase of Fred Siegel, a historian at Cooper Union, "inside a double bubble" -- the bubble of the Upper East Side and the bubble of the corporate boardroom. When I encountered Bloomberg outside a campaign event a few weeks ago, he exhorted me, with the most perfect earnestness and with something like wonder in his voice, to "go around the city," to see neighborhoods as he had -- something he has been telling journalists since the early days of the campaign. I had the impression that he had been overwhelmingly relieved to find that people in strange and exotic neighborhoods on the other sides of those bridges were receptive and friendly. Here was a man encountering the city for the first time (though his philanthropic activities had occasionally taken him out of his bubble before). It is not easy to imagine a figure whom New Yorkers would be less likely to identify with in times of trouble.
There is, in fact, something almost touching, but also disconcerting, about watching Bloomberg try to make common cause with people a world away from himself. This July, I heard him tell a Baptist congregation in Harlem how proud his father would be to know that his grandchildren had attended the finest universities in the Ivy League and that he himself sat on the board of the most exclusive charities. Working variations on an uplifting theme about the civil rights struggle, he said, "My daughter is a champion equestrienne, and her biggest competitor is a kid who is black."
Mark Green is, at least in politics, as thoroughgoing a professional as Bloomberg is an amateur. He has been in and around politics for 30 years and running for office for the last 20. Nobody works a subway more single-mindedly. Green is sometimes too nimble for his own good; he has a way of barely skirting disingenuousness that puts you in mind of Bill Clinton. When I reminded him, in a recent conversation, about his inopportune claim that he could have bested Giuliani's performance during the crisis, he turned to me with an innocent smile and asked what could possibly be wrong with the sentiment that "anyone who runs for mayor should aspire to do as well as or better than his predecessor." Green has many of Clinton's virtues as well: he is a serious thinker about issues, with an instinct for the available middle; a shrewd commentator who provides his own footnotes; and a centaur with the head of an activist and the hoofs of a pol. 
There is a kind of long-wave theory of the mayoralty popular among some conservatives and ex-liberals that dictates that reformers are predictably followed by restorers of status quo liberalism. Green appears, superficially, to be just such a figure. He comes out of "the movement" and is an old friend of the city's liberal lions; the mayor he puts you most in mind of is John Lindsay, the figure in whom big-city liberalism came to grief. But he is a much tougher and more ambitious character than the aristocratic Lindsay ever was. It is no coincidence that Green has virtually attached himself to the hip of William Bratton, Giuliani's first police chief, thus neutralizing fears that he would be soft on crime. He is, moreover, a supple figure who recognized immediately that the World Trade Center disaster had changed everything. In fact, one reason Green defeated Ferrer is that he seemed to have integrated this new understanding far more deeply than Ferrer had.
Green has a mastery of policy that he can match against anyone in city government. But one effect of the terrorist attack is that a fine-grained sense of where the debate is on policy solutions now seems to matter less than it usually does -- and character to matter more. New Yorkers want a mayor with whom they can personally identify and then follow. And Green is, like Bloomberg, rather cool to the touch. Even his appearance -- the white hair, the dark tan -- leaves an impression of glossiness, of high artifice. Green has the reputation of being too confident by half, and a bit smirky; Ed Koch, never one to mince words, called him "obnoxious." 
Green is obviously pained by this line of attack, which he describes as "an unserious and all-too-personal criticism from people who apparently couldn't criticize my record or vision." Whether or not he is obnoxious, Green does seem to lack the empathy, the intuitive connection, that makes Bill Clinton such a great politician. It is, of course, worth recalling that scarcely anyone attributed those gifts to Rudy Giuliani before Sept. 11. Leaders are not just born; they are also made.
In the immediate aftermath of the attack on the World Trade Center, the distinctions among New Yorkers that once seemed so salient disappeared. Green himself said: "Some emotional, unthinking people have said to me after Sept. 11, 'Oh, God, who would want to run New York City now?' In one obvious way, it will be easier to run New York City, not despite but because of the World Trade Center incident. There is an extraordinary solidarity that is supplanting the ethnic, racial and borough divisions that previously governed the city." 
But solidarity is an unnatural condition for New York, and it began to fray almost as soon as the political campaign resumed. In the runoff between Green and Ferrer, both men struggled to capture moderate-to-liberal white voters. Ferrer shelved his "other New York" message and briefly gained the upper hand. Green, suddenly faced with the shocking prospect of losing, took Ferrer on directly, running an ad in the final days that cited newspaper articles criticizing Ferrer's budgetary plans and asked, "Can we afford to take a chance?" Phone calls were made and fliers distributed -- not, apparently, by the Green campaign -- insisting that Ferrer would be the Rev. Al Sharpton's cat's-paw. In the end, Green carried almost all of the white vote and Ferrer almost all the Hispanic vote, as well as nearly 70 percent of the black vote. Green won by a bare 20,000 votes. 
It was a result almost guaranteed to provoke racial rancor, and it did. Ferrer and his supporters were outraged by Green's ad and by his insufficient condemnation of the calls and literature, though they scarcely violated local standards of decency. For a few days, all hell broke loose. Ferrer's principal backers, including Representative Charles Rangel, paid ostentatious visits to Michael Bloomberg. The Republican candidate, in turn, abandoned his high-mindedness in order to fish in troubled waters, solemnly noting that "we don't need people to pay lip service to pulling people together and then, in fact, in their personal lives, in their political lives, in their business lives, do the opposite." 
After a week of this mummery, Green promised to take the accusations more seriously, and Ferrer finally agreed to a mega-unity event at which practically every prominent Democrat in the state lined up together on a raised platform, like a summer-camp photo. Ferrer stood as stiff as a wooden soldier while Green intoned, with transparent insincerity, "I can hardly put myself in the place of someone who lost so narrowly and had to witness racial stereotyping at the end of a substantive and heroic campaign."
As soon as the ritual ended and before the questions began, Sharpton and Roberto Ramirez, Ferrer's chief adviser, walked off the stage. A few days later, I called Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic county chairman and leading figure in Hispanic political circles, to see how serious the split was. Ramirez was still exercised. He insisted that the primary campaign had proved that "it's O.K. to use the race card to vilify a candidate" and, more specifically, that "if you happen to be a Hispanic, there's going to be a double standard." He said that while Ferrer had promised to support the Democratic nominee, he was under no such obligation. Ramirez seems quite prepared to make mischief in the Hispanic community, as Sharpton has long done among blacks. And the occasions will arise, as these are precisely the communities that are bound to suffer most in the austerity measures to come. 
A few weeks after taking office, the next mayor will appear in the Blue Room of City Hall to deliver a very solemn message about the budget for the coming year. "New York City," he will say, "is facing the largest deficit in its history." Thanks to the recession that began gathering force well before Sept. 11, the city's Independent Budget Office was already predicting a deficit of $3 billion for the 2002-2003 fiscal year, which begins July 1. These projections often prove unduly dire, at least in normal times, but the collapse of the World Trade Center has changed everything. The city's controller, Alan Hevesi, predicts that in the current fiscal year the city will lose $738 million in tax revenue and 115,000 jobs. And then the losses will mount. 
Eugene Keilin, the chairman of the Citizens Budget Commission, compares the city's economic state today with that of the mid-70's, another time when a crisis dragged down an economy that was already soft. Keilin says: "I think the falloff in revenue will be sharper than anybody has been expecting. Wall Street is way off; theaters, restaurants, hotels, the tourist industry are way off; a lot of businesses aren't operating." Fiscal experts are now projecting a deficit of $4 billion to $6 billion for next year, with the larger number perhaps the likelier one.
How do you cut $6 billion from a $40 billion budget? You could raise taxes, of course; but even Mark Green, a big-government liberal, if a chastened one, says, "The last thing I want to do is raise taxes, because that makes it harder for residents or businesses to stay here when they may be looking across the river or across the country." Green says that a commuter tax, which would in any case only raise about $450 million, is "politically unlikely, but economically desirable." (Bloomberg opposes any tax increase.) Some proceeds can come from fines, license fees and other small revenue items, but everything else will come from cuts, and the main cost of city government is people. Giuliani financed a severance package for 15,000 employees when he took over, but the city may have trouble finding the money to do that. 
The next mayor will institute a hiring freeze that will produce attrition; but since attrition won't create anything like $6 billion in savings, he will almost certainly have to consider the dreaded final option of layoffs, which in turn means service cuts. Even layoffs pose a problem, however. Michael Jacobson, a former deputy budget officer in the Dinkins administration and now a fiscal adviser to Green, points out that several major city unions have now won no-layoff clauses and that about 90 percent of the employees who have been added to the work force as the city's economy has grown in recent years are policemen, teachers or caseworkers for the foster-care agency, the Administration for Children's Services -- all of whom are close to sacrosanct. Where will the cuts come from? Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, ticks off the list of "traditional suspects": parks, street cleaning, libraries, capital projects, housing, the City University. 
That first year will be a terrible time for the mayor, and the city. The city will be facing what Bloomberg calls "a triple whammy" with the police, who will have to do without expected large raises, who will likely be retiring in large numbers owing to a quirk in their pension plan and who will be hearing attractive offers as the market for private security grows. Bloomberg has no convincing solution to this problem; nor does anyone else. But Giuliani has made crime control a nonnegotiable issue in New York; any sign that the long-term drop in crime is reversing will send alarm bells ringing all over the city. Even if crime stays down, the informal quality-of-life tally that New Yorkers carry in their heads is bound to decline: streets will be dirtier; park repairs will take longer; libraries will be closed Saturdays; after-school and summer jobs programs will be curtailed.
The single greatest asset the next mayor will have is the universal expectation of sacrifice and the willingness, maybe not quite so universal, to accept sacrifice in the name of some larger good. David Dinkins could not persuade the teachers' union to accept a raise the city could afford at a time of shrinking revenues in 1990, and the city suffered the consequences of an unaffordable agreement for years. This time around, Fernando Ferrer had promised teachers a staggering 30 percent raise back in the pre-Sept. 11 era; now teachers understand that they cannot have the raise they believe they deserve. That is the good part. The bad part is that the same mayor who lays off city employees and asks all New Yorkers to live with austerity will be handing out tax abatements and subsidizing the construction of office buildings in Lower Manhattan. Green, in fact, says that the swift revitalization of Lower Manhattan "may require sacrifice from others." How is a mayor going to explain that to the "others"? In the new ethic of shared sacrifice, what sacrifice will he ask of the business community? Neither Bloomberg nor Green could give me a satisfactory answer. 
Cuts in the city budget do not fall equally on all New Yorkers. Blacks are disproportionately represented among municipal employees; the poor are the principal consumers of the kinds of social services, including public assistance and health care, that are almost certain to be sharply reduced. These were the voters who went to the polls believing that education, housing and other services remain the most salient issues. Both Green and Bloomberg talk about the importance of not losing sight of the pre-September concerns -- what Green calls "the homeland issues." Green promises to make inroads on these longstanding problems "by the time I'm done as mayor." Since Green expects to be mayor for eight years, this may not be very reassuring to voters who care about their children's test scores or who cannot afford a decent apartment. 
Alan Hevesi has estimated that the World Trade Center may cost New York an almost inconceivable $105 billion over the next two fiscal years in the form of lost wages and rent, cleanup costs, reconstruction and so on. As much as $40 billion may return to the city in the form of insurance. New York has appealed to Washington to make up as much of the difference as possible. President Bush agreed to give the city $20 billion worth of help the moment Senators Chuck Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton asked, and an administration official insists that despite a growing clamor for scarce dollars, that promise is ironclad. Giuliani's guided tours of the unspeakable are designed to keep the spigot open. Indeed, Fred Siegel has argued that the city should have found a way of giving the mayor the extra 90 days he wanted because no one else, and least of all a Democrat, could have equaled the exalted standing Giuliani enjoyed in Washington. 
There is a long tradition of presidents rewarding like-minded mayors and ignoring those who aren't. LaGuardia exploited his strong ties to F.D.R. to make New York the principal urban laboratory of the New Deal, while Lindsay was able to do much the same during L.B.J.'s War on Poverty. Abe Beame, on the other hand, never had a prayer with the Ford administration. No one in the Bush administration is going to tell either Mark Green or Michael Bloomberg to "drop dead," as The Daily News famously described the Ford administration's attitude toward Beame's New York, but neither the Nader's Raider nor the Silk Stocking Republican is likely to be a good fit with the national Republicans. One Republican strategist with close ties to the Bush administration describes the mayor's impending departure as "a big loss" for New York's status in Washington, though he adds that the city has already begun to lose altitude. "There was a moment when everybody had 'I Love New York' in their heart," he says. But when the state and city submitted a request for an additional $34 billion, including upstate rail projects that had obviously been dragged off some wish list in Albany, "it looked a little opportunistic."
The Giuliani administration, along with Senators Schumer and Clinton, is planning to submit a more modest wish list. But since Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the director of the federal Office of Management and Budget, has said that no additional funds could be made available until next year, it will fall to the next mayor, along with Gov. George Pataki and the rest of the New York Congressional delegation, to actually make the case. $

May the Force/Boss Be With You, in 3-D

BYLINE:  By CAREN CHESLER 

 BODY:
In an early scene in "Star Wars," the robot R2-D2 projects into the room a holographic image of Princess Leia, who implores Obi-Wan Kenobi to help defeat the Empire. Her image was lifelike and three-dimensional, but it was a cinematic gimmick reserved for the movies.
 No more. A Dallas company, Teleportec, has introduced technology to transmit holographic images of people over high-speed digital circuits. A chief executive can stand at a lectern in New York, for instance, while a three-dimensional, life-size image of him is projected onto a stage in San Francisco. The executive can remotely see the audience, and the participants on both sides of the transmission can communicate in real time. 
 "The optical portion of your brain insists the person is in the room because he meets all the criteria," said Philip Barnett, a vice president at Teleportec and one of its founders. "He's life-size, he's making eye contact, and there's no latency between when his mouth moves and you hear the words."
A special camera captures the subject's image, digitizes it and then transmits it to a remote location over any high-speed line capable of carrying audio and video signals. The image is then funneled through a beam splitter and projected onto a pane of glass, giving it a three-dimensional effect. Users can install the equipment in their offices and pay a subscriber fee of about $5,000 a month for each location, or they can rent conference rooms equipped with the technology for about $500 an hour.
Teleportec is pitching its product to executives of Fortune 500 companies, government agencies and educational institutions as a way to beam themselves to a remote location without actually having to be there. Executives from BP and Nortel Networks have already used the technology in giving speeches. And CB Richard Ellis, a commercial real estate firm with headquarters in Los Angeles, plans to use the technology to show clients properties in remote cities.
The system has reached the market at an opportune time for Teleportec. Many companies have cut travel budgets and are increasingly relying on various forms of teleconferencing in response to the economic downturn and concern about terrorism. 
HQ Global Workplaces, a Dallas company that rents videoconferencing rooms and plans to offer Teleportec's technology, says its more conventional videoconferencing business has doubled since Sept. 11.
"The National Business Travel Association says a one-day business trip costs $1,500," said Todd Foster, an HQ vice president. "We can do a videoconference for six or seven hours before you would reach that cost." CAREN CHESLER

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
A writer chronicling the Internet revolution recalls living the experience he covered.

BYLINE:  By Eric J. Savitz; Eric J. Savitz is returning to Barron's magazine, where he worked before joining The Industry Standard.

 BODY:
FOR a journalist, it was another dreary moment in the dot-com death spiral. On a recent morning, I found myself in a bankruptcy courtroom in San Francisco, reporting on the demise of yet another former highflier. In 2000, the company had surpassed $140 million in revenue, with well over 400 employees spread across four continents. And yet, when the hearing ended, the assets of this once-proud company had been sold for just $1.4 million. 
 Another Internet bankruptcy might have been a yawner, but I had a personal interest. The company being dismantled was my former employer: Standard Media International, the parent of the defunct magazine The Industry Standard. 
 As the self-proclaimed "newsmagazine of the Internet Economy," The Standard chronicled the spectacular rise and precipitous fall of the dot-coms. And I was there for most of it, joining the magazine as executive editor in November 1998, seven months after its debut, and riding it out to the bitter end. 
The Standard chronicled Internet business more intently than any other publication. We tracked the life and death of eToys, Webvan, Kozmo, and Pets.com. We wrote about the wild I.P.O.'s of companies like The Globe.com and the Internet Capital Group. We covered the whole alphabet soup of V.C.'s, B-to-C's, B-to-B's, A.S.P.'s, Icann and C.R.M. We delved deep into the wireless Web, "eyeball" counting, open source, e-mail marketing, hackers, slackers, browser wars and Napster. And when it all came apart, we wrote about that, too. 
Throughout 1999 and most of 2000, The Standard enjoyed astounding growth. Having averaged 64 pages an issue in the early going, we eventually found ourselves hitting 360 pages, the most our printer could handle. In 2000, we sold more ads in a single year than any magazine ever had. In late 1999, we attracted $30 million in venture capital from a group led by Flatiron Partners, in a deal that valued the company at $200 million. The employees got stock options. We actually thought we might become rich, like so many of the people we wrote about. 
And we lived the experience we covered. In the salad days, there were dot-com rollout parties in San Francisco every night -- even if none drew more buzz than the weekly gatherings on The Standard's roof. Like the companies we covered, we hired like mad and provided perks of every variety: fat salaries, twice-weekly massages, foosball tables and free sodas and snacks.
Like the dot-coms, we were dazzled by our own growth prospects, and we diversified like mad.
We started a European edition and a spinoff magazine called Grok. We licensed foreign language editions in Europe and Asia.
We produced expensive conferences in places like Aspen, Colo., and Barcelona, Spain. We sold research reports, distributed newsletters and operated an employment site. John Battelle, The Standard's founder, held a legendary staff meeting at which he said we could become the Dow Jones of the new economy. We almost believed him. 
But Dow Jones had nothing to worry about. After the stock market peaked in spring 2000, the appetite for Net I.P.O.'s faded. That made venture capitalists more wary, and they slowed their financing of new deals. All of that reduced ad spending, The Standard's main revenue source. Meanwhile, the broader economy slowed. By late 2000, we knew trouble was coming. We just didn't know how much. 
In January 2001, The Standard's first round of layoffs hit. That was followed quickly by a second, third and fourth round of cuts. We shut down Grok, and then closed the European business. Managers were forced out. Offices were consolidated. The great Internet bubble had burst in spectacular fashion, and we were at the epicenter. Attempts to find additional financing failed. The investment bank that was hired to find us a buyer didn't. 
On Thursday, Aug. 16, the staff was informed that The Standard's board, dominated by the majority owner, the International Data Group, had given up. The magazine was being shut down. 
On the following Monday, nearly 200 people lost their jobs. But the board decided to keep a small editorial team to run TheStandard.com, our Web site, while we sought a buyer. Eight reporters and editors stayed, three in New York and five in San Francisco, including me. This skeleton crew would stick around until we found a buyer -- or did not. 
The plan was to dribble out on the Web whatever copy had been written for the magazine but not yet published, post wire stories and whip up a few new pieces a day. That left the reporters the awkward task of calling sources who thought we had already gone out of business -- which we mostly had. 
While we wrote our stories and studied journalism job sites on the Web (where one opening was for a "poet's assistant"), the business staff tried to keep us afloat. On Aug. 27, the company filed for Chapter 11 protection. 
Talk about your new economies. A few months earlier, there was grumbling about the selection in the snack basket. Now we had more practical problems. Xerox reclaimed the copiers. Rented office furniture was whisked away. We stopped paying the guy who sorted the mail, so there was no more mail. Siemens repossessed the building's telephone switch, along with the phones. 
In the end came an eerie quiet, a tiny staff amid the dot-com detritus: Copies of absurdly fat back issues. Books on Internet business. Aeron chairs. Computer monitors by the hundreds, stacked to the ceiling. And everywhere, Industry Standard swag, the fossils of a once cocky company gone under: notebooks, mouse pads, sticky notes, tote bags, 8-balls, wallets, cuff links, tie tacks and piggy banks, all with The Standard logo. Boxes filled with T-shirts that read "Never Met a Bubble We Couldn't Burst." 
All the while, The Standard held talks with various potential buyers, including one group that included some of The Standard's venture investors. But then came Sept. 11. In an economy already on shaky ground, a recovery in the technology sector, so crucial to our revival, now seemed far, far away. Our most promising potential rescuer, that venture-led group, got the jitters and pulled out. No other buyer emerged. 
And so it was that on Sept. 24, three and a half years after the magazine's debut, I found myself on my final Standard assignment -- in bankruptcy court. 
That afternoon, for our Web site, I wrote a long piece on the hearing. But the International Data Group, which bought most of the assets, had no interest at all in restarting the magazine -- or having anyone continue to write for TheStandard.com. 
The next day, the rest of my colleagues and I collected our computers, our swag and our final paychecks. And as the last ones to leave the dot-com revolution, we turned off the lights and went home.

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report; 
Selling made-to-order clothing online without sending the customer to a tailor.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
BUYING a computer or airline ticket online is mainly a matter of convenience and price. But a pair of pants? 
 The typical retailer's response is to murmur a few discouraging words about "touch and feel" -- a redundancy referring to the inability of customers to judge the product online fully. And online clothing sales have done nothing to combat such gloom. While online sales are expected to account for more than a quarter of the personal computers sold this year and about 13 percent of airline tickets, less than 2 percent of all apparel sales are expected to be handled online, according to Jupiter Media Metrix. More vexing for e-merchants, perhaps, is that 30 percent of all apparel bought online will be returned, requiring a restocking or liquidation process that can ruin profit margins, according to retailers. 
 But the retailer Lands' End has high hopes for a new service it rolled out last week, enabling customers to buy $54 chinos that are made just for them. The service represents what could be the biggest customization effort to date for an online apparel retailer and, analysts said, the possible start of a trend within the category. 
Users of the feature, which the company calls Lands' End Custom, are asked to type in a handful of measurements -- like jacket size, weight and height for men, and height, weight and bra size for women -- and also answer general questions about the proportions of their hips and thighs, among other things. 
A software system determines a customer's weight distribution from this information and the trouser measurements conforming to it, then sends size specifications over the Internet to a factory in Mexico. The factory is equipped with computerized machines that cut the fabric for each order. Customers receive the pants directly from the factory, two to three weeks later.
According to Bill Bass, senior vice president of e-commerce and international sales for Lands' End, the new system has been in the works since December. "There were a lot of things to be worked out here -- not the least of which was, would the sizing algorithms work?" he said.
For every women's size 12, Mr. Bass said, there are "several million variations" in the cut of the pants. With so many ways to go wrong then, "we did tests in April and May with about 1,500 of our current chino customers, and a vast majority of them said they would definitely recommend it to a friend."
Beyond the threshold issue of whether the system would work loomed the bigger problem of whether the custom tailoring could be done for a price that would attract customers and leave the company with a comfortable profit margin. 
To ensure delivery within three weeks, Lands' End had to strike deals with new manufacturers in Mexico, rather than using its existing chino plants in Asia, Mr. Bass said. Aside from the cost of bringing two new plants on line, "it's simply more expensive to manufacture units of one than a thousand," he said. "Fortunately, with the technology we have in the process, those costs have come down."
Mr. Bass would not say how much it cost to produce each customized pair of pants, nor would he compare their profit margin to that of the company's noncustom chinos, which sell for $35 to $39.
But the profit margin per unit is only part of the equation.
"There's the potential for fairly significant savings, when you talk about not having to carry inventory," Mr. Bass said. "If you have too much stuff on hand, you have to get rid of it as overstocks. Not enough, and you disappoint the customers. This changes the economics of the business."
Analysts said the economics of customer satisfaction might also change. "This should be able to reduce return rates, which would be very attractive," said Chris Merritt, an analyst with Kurt Salmon Associates, a retail consulting firm based in Atlanta. Mr. Bass, of Lands' End, would not estimate the company's return rates, but Mr. Merritt said about 20 percent of the chinos bought online were returned.
In terms of custom-manufacturing apparel, Mr. Merritt said the closest cousin to the Lands' End effort was Levi Strauss & Company's Original Spin feature for its jeans. In that system, introduced in 1995, customers go to a Levi's store, where a clerk measures them and uses a computer to help configure a pair of pants that are custom-made and delivered to the customer's home.
According to Kendra Gourvitz, a Levi Strauss spokeswoman in San Francisco, the Original Spin feature will not be moved online. For one thing, the company does not sell products on its Web site, instead providing product information and referring customers to sites that do sell Levi's goods. But more to the point, the Original Spin system relies on face-to-face assistance, Ms. Gourvitz said, so "it wouldn't work online." 
Coincidentally, a former Levi's executive, Robert Holloway, is the person responsible for the Lands' End customization program. Mr. Holloway, who led Levi's brand marketing unit, had the idea for an online customization process shortly after leaving Levi Strauss in 1999, he said. That idea became Archetype Solutions Inc., the company which he now leads.
It was Mr. Holloway who brought the idea for customized manufacturing to Mr. Bass, of Lands' End, last year. Mr. Holloway said he worked with Lands' End to set up the manufacturing process in Mexico, and licensed his software to Lands' End in exchange for an undisclosed fee for each custom-garment produced. Lands' End also took a small equity stake in Archetype.
Mr. Holloway said there were "other major household brands" discussing possibile use of his company's system. But such deals must wait until early April, when a six-month exclusivity agreement with Lands' End is up.
Until then, the only other major retailer with a large-scale online customization system is Nike, which has offered customers the option of configuring their own shoes since November 1999. According to Mark Allen, general manager of the custom-shoe program, customers who pay the $10 to $15 premium can choose from about 20 different shoe models -- typically for basketball and soccer -- to customize with colors and a name ID. 
Beginning next year, Nike plans to offer customized cushioning for certain running shoes as well. "We'd originally targeted just the 14-to-24 year olds with this," Mr. Allen said. By expanding the program to include running shoes, he said, the company is banking that customization has much broader appeal.
Mr. Bass, of Lands' End, already plans to expand the customization system next year to include jeans. And while he must prepare himself for the possibility that consumers could greet this new feature with a chorus of yawns, Mr. Bass said that he was setting up contingency plans in case customers arrived in droves.
The Mexico manufacturing plants that are making standard chinos, for example, will be switched over to customized versions if demand warrants. Mr. Bass said he could also offer slower delivery times for the product. One factor putting a brake on order flow will be the Web-only ordering system for the custom chinos. The orders will not be taken by phone -- which is the medium used by more than 80 percent of Lands' End customers.
"We could do it," Mr. Bass said. But it could get complicated -- particularly if a male customer service representative asked a woman to characterize the proportions of her "seat," to use Lands' End parlance, or disclose her bra size and brand. "It's just a lot easier to start this on the Internet."

HEADLINE: Afghan Exile Turned Reluctant Star 

BYLINE:  By KATRINA ONSTAD 

DATELINE: TORONTO, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
Nelofer Pazira was wearing the same embroidered Afghan dress in which she walked the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival last May. At a strip-mall Starbucks last month near her parents' house in suburban Ottawa, she spoke urgently in accented English, declaring, "I'm a journalist, not an actress."
 In the feature film "Kandahar," she is both. Ms. Pazira, 28, plays an Afghan-Canadian journalist who returns to Afghanistan after the sister she left behind writes that she will commit suicide during the last solar eclipse of the millennium. Ms. Pazira's life inspired the film, and she is its reluctant star. 
 In fact, she left behind a best friend, Dyana, not a sister, and never actually made it back to Afghanistan. "We grew up together," said Ms. Pazira. "Once we carved our initials on the corner of a table at school to make sure no one else sat there."
The two 16-year-olds said good-bye in 1989 when Ms. Pazira and her family left Kabul for Canada. They became pen pals, exchanging hand-copied Persian poetry and, as they grew older, political critiques. While Ms. Pazira finished journalism school at Carleton University in Ottawa, Dyana studied economics and worked in a bank in Kabul. In 1996 the Taliban entered Kabul.
"The first letter I got from her after they invaded said that one day she stepped onto the street and" -- Ms. Pazira makes quotation marks in the air -- " 'a filthy, ugly-looking bearded man pushed me.' Those were her exact words in Farsi. He told her, 'You're not supposed to come out.' She wrote that she thought it was temporary."
Forbidden to work or leave her home, Dyana became seriously depressed, Ms. Pazira said. The journalist quoted from memory the last letter she received from her friend, written in 1998: "I can't go on anymore. My life has no meaning."
The letter propelled Ms. Pazira on her journey. In Iran, clad in a body-shielding burka, American dollars in her pocket, she tried to cross the border into Afghanistan as a member of an Afghan refugee family.
"It's not that I'm fearless," Ms. Pazira said. "I think when you have motivation, and you're driven to do something, you completely forget about the risks."
The refugee family turned back upon learning that the Taliban was torturing their relatives, Ms. Pazira said. Stranded in Tehran, she telephoned Mohsen Makhmalbaf, arguably Iran's best-known director. They had never met, but Ms. Pazira knew that he had made one of the few films about Afghanistan, "The Cyclist" (1988).
"My first question was whether he had any contacts in Afghanistan, and he said, 'Unfortunately not,' " Ms. Pazira recalled. "He had shot 'The Cyclist' in Pakistan. He said I was the first Afghan woman he'd met."
She asked him to film her journey, but he was unable to go. With her visas expiring, and no way into Afghanistan, she returned to Canada. "I felt heartbroken, helpless," she said. A year later, Mr. Makhmalbaf invited Ms. Pazira to Tehran to collaborate on a film.
"I thought: My God, I hope he knows what he's doing. I've never trained in acting. I don't like glamour," she said, holding up the frayed cuff of the dress she wore at Cannes. Still, Ms. Pazira has been traveling the world to promote "Kandahar." She defends her decision to turn a personal, tragic event into a movie that despite her protests presents her as something of a heroine. She said that as a journalist, "my responsibility is to bring people's stories to the world." She added, "This just happens to be my personal story.'
For most of "Kandahar," Ms. Pazira is concealed beneath a burka, the ghostlike garment the Taliban require women to wear. "At first, it was very suffocating," said Ms. Pazira, whose name in the film, Nafas, means "respiration." "But my relationship to the burka changed. Because of the insecurity of the place, I clung to it more and more."
The Afghanistan portrayed in "Kandahar" is not the country of Ms. Pazira's youth. With a doctor father and a teacher mother, she had a childhood in Kabul that was "privileged, filled with debate and philosophy." Still, under the Communist regime of President Najibullah (later executed by the Taliban), she saw her friends and father imprisoned for days and months at a time. 
"I remember the night I made arrangements to see 'Rambo III,' " she said. The 1988 action film made in the United States about Rambo's unofficial foray behind Soviet lines in Afghanistan to rescue an old friend had been banned. "I had to go to three different addresses to get the tape," she continued. "My heart was pounding. Of course, it's a terrible film." 
Ms. Pazira's family escaped bombed-out Kabul after a 10-day trek to Pakistan on foot. In 1990 they moved to New Brunswick, Canada. Ms. Pazira is finishing her master's degree at Concordia University in Montreal but now lives in Ottawa, as she has put her studies on hold. Her free-lance television and radio journalism in Canada has been largely devoted to one line that her character in "Kandahar" addresses to Afghanistan: "One day the world will see your troubles and come to your aid."
The world has turned toward Afghanistan at last, but Ms. Pazira worries that the attention is the wrong kind. "We've already had 20 years of war. Bombing introduces another generation of extremists," she said. "We will come to regret this 10 years later, I think."
In 1999 when she was back in Canada, Ms. Pazira received word that Dyana had not killed herself, and was living in another city in Afghanistan. "I was quite happy," she said. "I thought, She's alive, she's O.K. That was the last I've heard."

HEADLINE: A Suddenly Timely Afghan Journey; 
New Resonance for a Little-Noticed Iranian Film

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
Mohsen Makhmalbaf is a central figure in Iran's current movie wave, a prolific novelist, screenwriter and director whose films frequently earn him the wrath of Iranian censors. Outside festival and art-house circles, however, he is still little known in the West. Even at this year's Cannes film festival, his latest movie, "Kandahar," went largely unnoticed by critics on the prowl for future hits.
 But now, through the accident of politics, "Kandahar," which is also the name of the Afghan city that is home to the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, is stirring enormous interest following its release in France and Italy. The film, which addresses both the plight of Afghan women under the Taliban and the accumulated misery of the Afghan people, is due for release in the United States in January. 
 Clearly, the film's relevance has increased between its completion in February and today. Not many weeks ago, Mr. Makhmalbaf said, a journalist asked him why he had chosen "such an unimportant subject" for his movie. Now, even though "Kandahar" deals directly with neither war nor terrorist violence, it is being snapped up by distributors around the world. After all, the director noted dryly, apart from "Rambo III," it is one of the few feature films ever set in Afghanistan.
"When I was shooting the film, I was wondering how I could say things for people who know nothing about Afghanistan," Mr. Makhmalbaf said in a telephone interview from Tehran. "I told myself: You have to give a lot of information. Forget about making a film. So before Sept. 11, people found the film full of information and perhaps a little complicated and exaggerated. But I only show a few things. If I had shown everything I saw, no one would believe me."
The movie's plot is relatively simple. Nafas, a young Afghan exiled in Canada, is trying to reach Kandahar overland from Iran to rescue her sister, who has threatened to commit suicide during the last solar eclipse of the millennium. Hidden behind a head-to-toe burka, Nafas is successively guided by a refugee family, a boy expelled from Koranic school, an African-American working as a self-taught paramedic, and a man maimed, like Nafas's sister, by a land mine.
If at times "Kandahar" resembles a documentary, it is not only because most of its "actors" are refugees living in camps in northeast Iran close to the Afghan border, where the film was shot. It is also because Nelofer Pazira, 28, who plays Nafas, is herself an Afghan whose family fled Afghanistan in 1989 and is now living in Canada. And she, too, was drawn back to the region in 1999 by a desperate letter from her closest friend who was living under the Taliban regime.
Ms. Pazira, a radio and television journalist in Ottawa, was having difficulty entering Afghanistan alone, so she asked Mr. Makhmalbaf to make a documentary of her planned voyage. Though the director could not accept at the time, a year later he contacted Ms. Pazira and proposed a fictionalized version of her story. Conveniently for the movie, she is bilingual, enabling her to communicate with the refugees in the Afghan version of Farsi and to provide information in English to audiences through the device of speaking her impressions into a tape-recorder.
The film has been well received. But because its theme is essentially grim, several critics have been troubled by the beauty of some images, not least those of multicolored burkas floating across arid landscapes. Writing in The New York Times from Cannes this spring, A. O. Scott noted that both "Kandahar" and Abbas Kiarostami's "ABC Africa" (about Ugandan orphans) "contain moments of sublime visual poetry that at once heighten and complicate their humanitarian messages."
Christophe Ayad, film critic of the left-of-center Paris daily Liberation, also acknowledged "pure moments of grace," like a scene in which dozens of real-life maimed refugees rush on crutches to catch artificial limbs being parachuted by the International Red Cross. "The problem is that the message and the camera go in opposite directions," Mr. Ayad noted. "The burka is an abomination, that's understood, but it does not prevent one from thinking that it is also photogenic."
But for Mr. Makhmalbaf, 44, whose 16 movies to date include "Marriage of the Blessed," "Gabbeh" and "The Silence" as well as "The Cyclist," about a destitute Afghan refugee, his aim is unambiguous. It is, he said, to draw the attention of the world and also of Iran to the hunger and despair of those Afghan refugees (most of them Farsi-speaking Hazaras), who before Sept. 11 lived constantly under the threat of expulsion by the Tehran government.
"The authorities even tried to stop the film, saying that by law the Afghans had to return home," Mr. Makhmalbaf said, noting that the film was eventually shown for four weeks in two Tehran theaters. "I wrote to President Mohammad Khatami and told him these people were dying of hunger. If we push them home, they will die. I had so many problems with the film. I had to change locations. But my focus was humanitarian, not political."
Even before the Taliban seized power in 1996, he said, 95 percent of girls and 80 percent of boys in Afghanistan did not attend school. As refugees, their situation did not improve. "In Pakistan, they could only go to Taliban schools," Mr. Makhmalbaf went on. "In Iran, they could not go to school. Last year, we found money for 100 refugee girls to go to school. This year, we're aiming at 3,000 girls. I'm now making a documentary to show people how they can help."
The director said the terror attacks on New York and Washington followed by the bombing of Afghanistan had only made things worse. "I was shocked and deeply saddened by the events of Sept. 11, and certainly, the Taliban is the most disastrous government in the world," he said. "But bombing does not help Afghan women. We don't need reaction, but action to change the economy of Afghanistan."
Such is Mr. Makhmalbaf's indignation about the misery of Afghanistan that, since well before Sept. 11, his web site (www.makhmalbaf .com) has carried a 32-page economic, political and historical analysis of the country that he wrote after filming "Kandahar" and that is called "The Buddha Was Not Demolished in Afghanistan; He Collapsed Out of Shame." In the essay, though, he also conveys his own feeling of helplessness.
"Even now that I have finished making 'Kandahar,' I have arrived at nowhere in my profession," he writes. "I don't believe that the little flame of knowledge kindled by a report or a film can illuminate the deep ocean of human ignorance."
"Why on earth did I make that film or write this note?" he adds. "I don't know, but as Pascal put it: 'The heart has reasons of which the mind is unware.' "

HEADLINE: Torture Seeps Into Discussion By News Media 

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
In many quarters, the Newsweek columnist Jonathan Alter is considered a liberal. Yet there he was last week, raising this question:
 "In this autumn of anger," he wrote, "even a liberal can find his thoughts turning to . . . torture." He added that he was not necessarily advocating the use of "cattle prods or rubber hoses" on men detained in the investigation into the terrorist attacks. Only, "something to jump-start the stalled investigation of the greatest crime in American history." 
 The column -- which ran under the headline "Time to Think About Torture" -- set off alarm bells at human rights organizations. The sense of alarm was heightened because Mr. Alter is just one of a growing number of voices in the mainstream news media raising, if not necessarily agreeing with, the idea of torturing terrorism suspects or detainees who refuse to talk. 
On Thursday night, on the Fox News Channel, the anchor Shepard Smith introduced a segment asking, "Should law enforcement be allowed to do anything, even terrible things, to make suspects spill the beans? Jon DuPre reports. You decide."
One week earlier, on CNN's "Crossfire," the conservative commentator Tucker Carlson said: "Torture is bad." But he added: "Keep in mind, some things are worse. And under certain circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils. Because some evils are pretty evil."
The legitimacy of torture as an investigative tool is the latest in a progression of disturbing and horrific topics the news media is now presenting to its audience, like the potential of an Ebola attack on an American city or a terrorist nuclear strike, the kind that, as an article in The Economist put it in its latest issue, could cause the disappearance of everything below Gramercy Park in Manhattan.
Some human rights advocates say they do not mind theoretical discussions about torture, as long as disapproval is expressed at the end. But they say that weighing the issue as a real possible course of action could begin the process of legitimizing a barbaric form of interrogation.
Journalists are approaching the subject cautiously. But some said last week they were duty-bound to address it when suspects and detainees who have refused to talk could have information that could save thousands of lives. Plus, they added, torture is already a topic of discussion in bars, on commuter trains, and at dinner tables. And lastly, they said, well, this is war.
The historian Jay Winik, in an opinion article on Oct. 23 in The Wall Street Journal, detailed the reported torture in 1995 of the convicted terrorist plotter Abdul Hakim Murad by Philippine authorities that led to the foiling of a plot to crash nearly a dozen United States commercial airplanes into the Pacific and another into C.I.A. headquarters in Virginia. Mr. Winik went on to write, "One wonders, of course, what would have happened if Murad had been in American custody?" He did not, however, endorse the use of torture but suggested the United States may have to significantly curtail civil liberties, as it had done in past wars.
In Slate, the online magazine, Dahlia Lithwick wrote, "There's no doubt that torturing terrorists and their associates for information works." But the Oct. 19 article, "Tortured Justice," primarily raised a host of moral and legal problems associated with torture.
Mr. Alter said he was surprised that his column did not provoke a significant flood of e-mail messages or letters. And perhaps even more surprising, he said, was that he had been approached by "people who might be described as being on the left whispering, 'I agree with you.' "
The problem with those comments, he said, was that they presumed that by writing about torture, Mr. Alter was advocating it, which he said he was not doing, as evident in his point about torture producing false information. ("I'm in favor of court-sanctioned sodium pentothal," he said in an interview. "I'm against court-sanctioned, physical torture.")
The Fox News Channel was less apologetic about its report on Thursday night, in which advocates for torture said desperate times called for desperate measures and critics said that by abusing suspects the United States would lose its moral standing in pressuring other governments on human rights violations.
"They're sitting around and not talking and may have information that could save American lives here and abroad," Bill Shine, the executive producer of the Fox News Channel, said of current government detainees. "And people are starting to say how can we get information out of them," he added, "while respecting their constitutional rights."
Mr. Shine, however, said he was amazed that it was a subject for a news report at all. "It shows you where we are now," he said.
But where Fox News Channel was willing to run a traditional, network-news style segment on the pros and cons of torture and "suspending writ of habeas corpus," the broadcast news divisions have shied away from doing the same. 
Jim Murphy, the executive producer of "Evening News with Dan Rather" on CBS, said he would address the topic only if a CBS News correspondent found that law enforcement was seriously considering using torture. He said that speculation about torture and discussion of its merits were, for now, best left to talk shows and columnists.
"At this point, for me, it is being covered where it belongs to be covered," he said. Until his network is presented with real evidence that torture is being used or being considered, he added, "It's like the conversation you or I would have at dinner: 'I wonder if we should torture?' "
Of course, even that level of discourse is considerably disturbing to groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, which criticize the use of torture by regimes around the world. And yet, even their leaders said they understood the source of the sentiments.
"It reflects people's fear, and the somewhat unexamined instinct to do whatever it takes to meet the threat," said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. "And when people step back for a moment, they understand there are reasons why you don't want to open the door."
Mr. Roth said he had appeared on CNN and Fox News Channel to discuss those reasons, chief among them that torture often produces false information and that various international laws forbid it.
Mr. Roth and the deputy executive director of Amnesty International USA, Curt Goering, said they believed that if the discussion of torture grew, they would be able to counter it on television or in print. 
Mr. Roth said he was heartened by one thing. "To the government's credit," he said, "it's not the government proposing this. It's various commentators."

HEADLINE: Cotovelo do Xingu Journal; 
A Collector's Item Costs Brazilian Divers Dearly

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: COTOVELO DO XINGU, Brazil 

 BODY:
The tiny fish, among the most exotic and coveted in the world, are hardly larger than a thumb. But they are worth their weight in gold on a clandestine international market. 
 Lured by that prospect of wealth, as many as 400 divers have come to this remote stretch of river in the heart of the Amazon jungle, plunging to ever deeper and more dangerous depths, gasping for air as they surface. Their goal is to capture as many of the fish as possible for collectors' aquariums, but each success makes their prey even harder to catch. 
 The level of activity here is especially high in early fall because the end of the Amazon dry season is fast approaching. It is easier for divers to capture the fish when water levels are so low that shoals are exposed than during the six-month rainy season, which begins in November. 
Jose Luiz Freitas da Silva, 26, is among the divers who have been aggressively taking advantage of those favorable conditions. He lives in a shack on the riverbank here, growing the food that he and his family eat, but depends on the fish -- black and white striped or brightly spotted members of the catfish family -- for most of his income. 
"Every week, the dealer in Altamira sends someone out by boat to collect the fish that I have captured," he said on an early fall day, still wet from a series of dives, as he sorted his catch by the riverbank. "This week I caught a lot of the little zebras, so I expect to make about $120," a bounty by the standards of the Brazilian interior, where the minimum wage is $75 a month. 
The fish are now considered so valuable in this remote jungle area that they are being used as currency. At riverside general stores, for instance, proprietors will trade food, gasoline and medicine for a little zebra, the prevailing exchange rate being $4 a fish.
Brazil has sought to control their sale in order to prevent the fish from being wiped out. Those efforts have only encouraged a network of black-market dealers more than happy to meet a persistent demand in the United States, Europe and Japan, no matter what the law says in Brazil.
"The margin of profit in this business is obscene, as high as that of cocaine," said Horacio Higuchi, a tropical fish expert at the Emilio Goeldi Museum in Belem, the oldest and most respected center of scientific research in the Amazon. "This is a covert, cutthroat trade that attracts the most dishonest kind of people precisely because there is so much money to be made."
While divers here say that they can expect to receive no more than $5 for a particularly beautiful specimen of the most prized species -- the delicate armored catfish, known in Portuguese as the "zebrinha," or "little zebra" -- a single rare albino specimen can fetch as much as $600 from collectors in Japan, Dr. Higuchi said.
In addition to those working this stretch of the Xingu River, the money has drawn an equal number of divers to the Tapajos and Trombetas rivers, two other hotbeds of the trade, said Bruno Kempner, head of a local peasant rights and environmental group. 
The presence of so many divers is depleting fish stocks, and the scarcity is forcing the divers to take greater chances as they descend deeper and into more remote corners.
"Over the past year, I've heard of three cases of divers dying," said Mario Borges de Almeida, a former gold miner who works as a riverboat pilot. "Almost everybody gets hearing damage as a result of their eardrums bursting from the pressure they have to deal with at the depths they are forced to dive in order to find the fish that buyers want."
Because of their poverty and the remoteness of the area, almost none of the divers use scuba tanks, and many do not even have masks. The questionable legality of what they do has also prevented them from forming any kind of union, and that leaves them open to exploitation by the savvier fish dealers who control the trade.
"The art of capturing the fish is painful and extremely arduous, but the divers are the ones who have to pay the highest price," said Antonio Melo, the regional representative of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, a government agency that is in charge of efforts to enforce protected species laws. 
Mr. Melo said that there was little he could do to prevent the illegal traffic. 
He has only five agents to monitor all wildlife in a jungle area that is more than twice the size of New Jersey. In any case, budget considerations and the lack of quick and reliable transportation limit their effectiveness and their ability to reach places where violations might be taking place.
In an effort to blunt the traffic, 10 years ago the Brazilian government compiled a list limiting the legal capture and export of tropical fish to 180 species. "But that list is based on species from the Rio Negro," more than 500 miles west of here, "which are completely different from those we see in this part of the Amazon," Dr. Higuchi said.
Tropical fish dealers, he said, have also learned to get around the restrictions by routinely filing false customs declarations and shipping waybills. 
Hoping to halt the depletion of stocks, the Brazilian fish dealers and government officials are planning to draw up new recommendations to expand the protected species list. But Dr. Higuchi argues that no conservation effort can work without public awareness and support.
"There are hundreds of species that scientists haven't even described yet," he said. "But here in the state of Para, people are not very interested. It's ironic, but if they collect fish at all, they prefer Asian species, like the goldfish."

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES; 
Addiction, Depression, And Now, Job Skills

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
When he was in his prime in the early 1990's, Manny Rodriguez, inspecting the underside of a car at his auto-repair shop, looked just like another hard-working guy, earning a living in a rough part of town.
But the repair shop, underneath the elevated J, M and Z subway line in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, served not just as his place of work, but as his home -- on the nights when he was lucky.
 When he was unlucky, Mr. Rodriguez, now 41, slept on the avenues in Brooklyn named for upstate cities -- Rochester, Utica, Schenectady. 
 "It was very degrading," he said. "It was the rock bottom, the last place a human being should ever go to."
The problem was that despite a well-paying job aligning chassis, Mr. Rodriguez, a single man with two young daughters who lived with their mothers, could never afford rent. He could barely even afford food.
Nearly all his money went to support his cocaine habit, which later took a turn for the worse when he developed an addiction to crack. For a year and a half, he slept on the streets and spent his earnings on gallon jugs of wine and on the two to three packs of cigarettes a day he smoked. But most of it went to crack, which he bought from men on a corner of Linden Boulevard. "That nearly sent me to death," he said.
But Mr. Rodriguez's life changed dramatically one morning in a friend's apartment when he says he felt the hand of Christ helping him. "I said, 'Jesus, please help me, I don't want to die,' " he said. "In that minute, it was like all the addictions stopped. I never felt anxiety again for the drugs."
After that day, he said, he stopped taking drugs. But he began to face another problem. He developed eczema, a skin condition marked by itchy white scales and blisters. He had it on his face, his forearms, his legs and his feet. The grease and grime of the job made his condition worse. "Being a mechanic is so dirty," he said. "I couldn't concentrate because of the rash."
So he quit, and searched for a cleaner job. He found one -- the graveyard shift at a photo development lab on 42nd Street near Grand Central Terminal. But Mr. Rodriguez, who now keeps his auto repair tools in an exalted place in his bedroom, was not satisfied with the work. "God gave me a gift," he said. "When I was young, I learned how to work on cars. I can say that I am an expert in chassis alignment." 
With a painful skin condition and a job he disliked, Mr. Rodriguez became depressed, and his weight swelled to more than 400 pounds. He lived where he lives now, in a room down the hall from a communal kitchen on the top floor of a walk-up in Weeksville, Brooklyn. "My skin was like scales, chunks would fall to the floor," he said. "My room, at the time, expelled an odor of decaying flesh."
One morning at the photo lab, he threw the cardboard picture mat in his hands against the wall in disgust. On the subway ride home that morning, he resolved to kill himself. He was going to throw himself in front of a train. He prayed, asking God whether he was going to do the right thing, and then something happened that he describes as a miracle. "Right then, my beeper went off," he recalled. "It was my daughter."
He called his daughter Tricia, 7, when he got out of the subway station. "Her first words were 'Papi, I love you,' " he said, recalling that he began to cry. "That made me strong. I thought, 'What am I doing? I have a family.' "
He quit his job at the photo lab, and sought medical attention for his depression and his eczema. In April he also sought help in getting a job from the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
The agency enrolled him in a program it runs called Pride 2000, which helps unemployed men and women learn office skills, present a successful image during a job interview, create a resume and find work. 
A case worker, Miriam Ramos, noticing that Mr. Rodriguez did not have presentable clothing, took him shopping for large-size clothes he could wear to a job interview. The agency paid $200 for the clothes with money from the fund.
Mr. Rodriguez uses the computer at the agency's office to draw elaborate architectural renderings of houses and office buildings. "Maybe I have more things inside of me that I have to discover," he said.

HEADLINE: Little Tokyo Journal; 
Charting Revival Through Basketball

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The bathhouses and historic houses are distant memories, swallowed by parking lots and city buildings. The Far East Cafe has yet to disappear, but only because no one else has moved into an empty storefront with its forlorn red neon sign.
 Little Tokyo was once the crown jewel of an archipelago of Japantowns on the West Coast, covering perhaps one square mile and home to 30,000 inhabitants. But since the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II, the district has declined to become just a miniature collection of tourist-dependent restaurants and gift shops. 
 Now, in what may be the area's last hope for revival, community leaders are banking on a popular local pastime that is far more American than Japanese: basketball.
For decades, organized basketball has been wildly popular among Japanese-Americans in Southern California, where perhaps 14,000 adults and children play on hundreds of teams in weekend leagues. But almost all of them do so not in downtown Los Angeles, but in suburbs like Gardena, Torrance or Cerritos.
So this summer, after years of pleas from Japanese-American leaders, the City Council endorsed a $9 million, six-court recreation center to bring an urban sport back to the urban core. Last month, community leaders submitted design and financing plans to the Council, and now await approval to get started.
"We need a place for all generations of people," said Bill Watanabe, executive director of the Little Tokyo Service Center, a nonprofit group that has been a vocal supporter of the gym. "If we miss that, and we miss a whole generation of people who don't connect to Little Tokyo, then we will lose them forever, and Little Tokyo will just become a facade or a shell of what it used to be."
Critics of the gym say the area would be better served by something that is more culturally substantial. Still, supporters say the gym could become an economic and recreational anchor, as well as symbolically contribute to the preservation of all the Japantowns in America.
Once, there were more than 40 Japantowns in American cities, predominantly on the West Coast. But most were decimated first by the internment camps, then by the rapid suburbanization of the Japanese-American population. Today, there are only three historic Japantowns remaining, in Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Jose.
To help preserve them, Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation this fall committing $150,000 to preserve culturally historic neighborhoods. But some community leaders worry that those plans may translate into little tangible gain.
Enter basketball. Even though the Japanese-American leagues began decades ago because of discrimination, they endured because of the tradition, the friendships and, several parents said, the fact that their children are not as tall as their peers.
But gym space is hard to find, particularly in the winter, when schools have first dibs. In Little Tokyo, which these days has only 1,500 residents, most of whom are senior citizens, it is easy to find hearty support for the gym. More people means more business, and more people eating at more restaurants.
The same sentiment prevails in the suburban basketball leagues.
On a recent weekend at some games in Gardena, Scott and Jan Kajiya, from Manhattan Beach, were watching their 7-year-old son, Enzo, play with his Quiksilver team. Mr. Kajiya grew up playing in a Japanese-American league, and now he sometimes runs into people that he played ball with as a teenager.
Because basketball is so family-centered, he believes that a gym in Little Tokyo could serve as a bond.
"Once we became involved, I saw how it was such a great vehicle that is bringing the Japanese-American community together," said Mr. Kajiya, 48. "So I support any gym or any place for people to gather."
Others, though, say they doubt the local government can get it done, or get it done right. They say the gym would be too little, too late.
"I understand what they're trying to do," said George Wada, an aerospace engineer. "But I can't see that that is going to be the savior."
The enthusiasm has been tempered, too, by the lukewarm response from several local institutions. Mr. Watanabe, for example, has occasionally been disappointed with places like the Japanese American National Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art. At one point, he and other gym supporters scolded the museums for suggesting that the area would be better served by a quiet park and not a noisy group of sweaty basketball players.
But since the plans for the gym were unveiled, Mr. Watanabe has heard generally positive responses, and only generic complaints about traffic, noise and security.
"I don't know if it promotes the continuation of Japanese-American culture or Japanese-American values," said Chris Aihara, director of community relations for the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center. "But if we can bring them in for basketball, we may be able to sell them on all the other parts."

HEADLINE: Oil Industry Seeks Federal Help Against Terror 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
It was not a terrorist act, just a drunken hunter with a rifle who shot a hole in the Alaska pipeline last month. Nonetheless, he disrupted the flow of 286,000 gallons of oil for three days and raised doubts about the ability to both protect the 800-mile pipeline from attack and maintain its flow of oil.
 Energy companies are aware of the threat terrorists pose and they are seeking help from the government to make themselves less vulnerable. 
 Bracewell & Patterson, a Washington law firm that represents several energy companies, set out to explore the extent of security that existed for such companies and what needed to be done to improve it. A result is a 42-page overview of the state of energy security in America and how various facilities are vulnerable to terrorist attack. Marc Racicot, the former governor of Montana and a partner in the firm, plans to give the report to Tom Ridge, director of homeland security, on Monday. 
"The more we studied this, the more important in our minds it became to present what is out there," said Rob Housman, a lawyer at the firm and the report's principal author.
The report makes several recommendations to the government. It calls for tax credits and low-cost financing to help the industry improve security. It says the government should eliminate the "regulatory impediments" that it says preclude the industry from building plants that could withstand a terrorist attack, and it calls for the withholding of safety information that the government now requires companies to make available on the Internet.
Like the airline industry, the energy companies also want some liability and insurance protections. And they want to be able to file "security impact statements," which can presumably override the "environmental impact statements" that often result in expensive pollution controls they did not want in the first place.
They also expect protection that only the government can provide, like the National Guard patrolling their airspace, specially trained Guard units protecting them on the ground, the government sharing its intelligence to try to prevent attacks and the Coast Guard helping to protect ports and off-shore rigs.
Already, the government has moved to protect airspace over nuclear power plants.
"Obviously, when we look at targets nationally that are potentially vulnerable, one of the first places you would be looking would be to your nuclear facilities owned by both the Defense Department and the public in general," Mr. Ridge said on Friday.
"There is a universe of potentials that we have to deal with," he added. "Unfortunately, in the business we're in, we have to deal with the 'What if?' "
The new report will give him even more to ponder.
The nation has about 19,000 miles of interstate natural gas pipelines, and 200,000 miles of transmission lines. Terrorist attacks on any of these lines could cause power failures, environmental and economic damage, and threats to human life.
"Depending on the nature of the attack," the report says, "an energy infrastructure attack in an urban area could expose from hundreds to even hundreds of thousands of people to serious harms, ranging from radiation to toxic clouds to massive explosions."
The report notes that the Alaska pipeline has been perceived for years as an especially vulnerable target. It carries 20 percent of the nation's crude oil, and half of the pipeline -- about 400 miles -- lies above ground in unpopulated areas.
A report in 1997 by the President's Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection found pipelines like this one "a huge, attractive and largely unprotected target array for saboteurs." But, the Bracewell & Patterson report notes, "little has been done to address this risk."
The report explores other potential threats, like those posed to oil tankers, oil refineries and power grids from the ground, the air and cyberspace.
Mr. Housman said that "not every inch" of pipeline or transmission line needed protection but that the current level of security was inadequate.
"No private-sector company has the wherewithal to defeat a terrorist threat on the order of a hijacked airplane turned missile or a weapon of mass destruction," the report says. "Moreover, the types of governmental assistance required to combat such threats go far beyond the current levels of support now being provided."
As to concerns that the energy industry could use security to ride roughshod over current regulations, Mr. Housman said that industry had to be careful "not to cry wolf."

HEADLINE: Prospects Dim for Medicare Drug Benefit 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
This was supposed to be the year when a long-sought, long-promised prescription drug benefit was finally delivered to the nation's elderly. Now, crucial lawmakers and health policy experts say, those benefits seem almost certain to be deferred again, like so much else on the domestic policy agenda.
 The question, for some, is whether the chances of adding drug benefits to Medicare will be much better next year, when Congress could be confronting the brutal combination of a recession, intense budgetary constraints and the pressures of an imminent election. 
 "It's probably not going to happen this year, and if it happens next year it may be only in a token fashion," said Robert Greenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group. 
John Rother, policy director for AARP, said he still hoped a substantial drug benefit would be enacted in 2002, but he described this year as a missed opportunity.
" 'Peace and prosperity' was our moment," Mr. Rother said. "First we devoted too much of the surplus to the tax cut. Then unanticipated events took over."
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana and an important player on Medicare policy, was more succinct. "R.I.P.," Mr. Breaux said, when he was asked to characterize prospects for drug benefits this year.
Drug benefits are just part of a health care agenda that seemed doable at a time of extraordinary surpluses in the federal budget, but has gradually slipped out of reach. Even before the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, the budgetary prospects for domestic initiatives were strained by the economic downturn and the Bush administration's $1.35 trillion tax cut. Now, needs created by the attacks -- including the urgency of strengthening resources to fight bioterrorism -- add to the strains.
Lawmakers in both parties had also hoped to do something substantial this year to expand health insurance coverage, but that, too, is now considered unlikely. Even before the economic downturn, the number of uninsured stood at 38.7 million last year. Democrats are pushing for short-term assistance in the economic stimulus package, to help people who lose their jobs maintain their health insurance, but that is well short of the more lasting improvements many had hoped for.
Health analysts and advocates of the changes say the political chances for the broader health care proposals are diminishing just as the needs are growing, both in terms of the cost of health care -- particularly prescription drugs -- and the number of people losing coverage because of the economy.
"Before Sept. 11, senior citizens needed prescription drug coverage under Medicare, and they still do," Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said.
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, who leads the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said, "The agenda has slipped, but it hasn't changed."
Congress, the Clinton administration and now the Bush administration have struggled with the issue of prescription drugs for more than three years, prodded by the knowledge that Americans 65 and older are possibly the most powerful voting bloc. But the issue is complex, touches on some of the deepest philosophical divisions between the parties about the role of government and is expensive to resolve.
Medicare, which covers 40 million elderly and disabled Americans, provides no coverage for prescription drugs outside the hospital. Many of the elderly piece together coverage through their former employers, health maintenance organizations and other sources, but it is often limited and unreliable. A third of the elderly have no coverage, leaving them vulnerable to huge costs.
In the 2000 election, candidates -- including President Bush -- almost uniformly promised to provide that benefit. And Thomas A. Scully, who oversees Medicare, said Friday that the administration remained committed to fulfilling its promise. "Seniors want a drug benefit, and we certainly want to make sure that, especially, needy seniors get one," Mr. Scully said. 
But some advocates of coverage say the true measure of the administration's commitment is the money it allocates for drug benefits in its budget next year. Mr. Scully, when presented with that critique, said, "I have no idea where we're going to be on the budget in January."
He did say that, while pushing for a broader benefit, the administration hopes to move ahead with its idea for a discount drug card for the elderly. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the administration plan. But even the idea of a discount card arouses suspicion among Democrats and advocates of prescription coverage, who fear it will be used to ease the pressure for a real drug benefit -- what Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, describes as "an avoidance technique."
Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a liberal advocacy group, said the tax cut was "the major turning point" for drug coverage this year, though Mr. Bush insisted that Americans could have both. Mr. Graham said the debate over the tax cut would be revisited.
"The proponents of the tax cut were saying that this is a no-sacrifice tax cut," said Mr. Graham, who, like most Senate Democrats, voted against it. "They said we can have it and still do all the other things the president committed to." Now, Mr. Graham added, "We're finding that of all the things promised in the year 2000, the only thing that will be fully delivered is the tax cut."
Recent history suggests that once a political moment passes for health care proposals, a long time can pass before another comes. Universal health insurance seemed all but inevitable after the 1992 election, when President Bill Clinton vowed to give every American a health security card and the only debate on Capitol Hill was how. But since the collapse of that drive in 1994, there has been no serious effort to mount another.
But Representative Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, and Mrs. Johnson, both influential legislators on health, say that the drug issue will not fade away.
Mrs. Johnson declared: "Next year, the chances are 100 percent. We are definitely going to ahead, no question about it. It may have to be a more graduated program that takes into account need. But, frankly, we have to do it."
And Mr. Cardin essentially agreed: "We have missed our moment, but it's not like universal coverage, where you'll have to wait 10 or 20 years to get back to a serious discussion. I think we can get it in the next year or two."
The reason? "Seniors are angry," he said.
Some analysts agree that a prescription drug benefit could happen.
"The reason I'm not prepared to close the window is that it's seniors," said Patricia Neuman, a vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation and a Medicare expert. "They vote, they go to town meetings and it's a real issue for them."

HEADLINE: Patents or Poverty? New Debate Over Lack of AIDS Care in Africa 

BYLINE:  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
A new debate has erupted over the epidemic of AIDS in Africa, about whether it is patents or poverty that is primarily responsible for the widespread lack of treatment. The issue has become a major bone of contention as the World Trade Organization prepares to discuss new rules on patents at its summit mmeting in Qatar this week. 
 Professors of medicine, law and economics, who for the most part consider themselves advocates of the poor, are attacking each other over an issue raised by a study published Oct. 17 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 
 The study addresses a simple question: how many of the 15 recognized antiretroviral drugs for treating AIDS have been patented by their makers in how many of Africa's 53 countries? 
It calculates that only 22 percent of the 795 patents theoretically available across Africa have been awarded, in most cases because the companies that own the patents have not bothered to apply. 
And yet, everyone acknowledges that antiretroviral drugs are still too expensive to be widely obtainable in Africa at prices people can afford. 
To the drug companies, the situation suggests that patents are not responsible for holding up prices. If it is not patents, they say, it must be poverty that stands in the way of treatment. 
The authors of the study are Dr. Amir Attaran, director of international health research at Harvard University's Center for International Development, and Lee Gillespie-White, the director of the International Intellectual Property Institute. In the study, Dr. Attaran draws the conclusion that poverty is the main deterrent to treatment. 
It is that conclusion, more than the data, that has infuriated advocates of cheaper drugs, who say that Dr. Attaran, an immunologist and a lawyer, ignores the three-year fight that has driven the price of antiretroviral cocktails in Africa down to $350 a year from $10,000 a year. 
His critics say he underplays two crucial facts in the drop in prices of patented drugs: that the drugs most aggressively patented are drug cocktails made by the makers of generic drugs in India; and that it is the richer African countries, or those in which many of the Indian companies have offices, that most of the patents have been taken out.
Meanwhile, the study is being used by pharmaceutical companies to support the view that it is not their fault that millions of Africans are dying of AIDS. 
The industry and sympathetic trade officials in the Bush administration are citing the study as they try to beat back efforts by 60 poor nations to get the World Trade Organization's permission to ignore patents during health crises. 
The World Trade Organization is under intense pressure as its Nov. 9 meeting in Doha, Qatar, approaches. A coalition of 60 nations calling itself the "Africa Group" wants new rules affirming that patents may be negated to protect public health, and that countries too poor to set up their own drug factories may import medicine.
The leading drug companies and the United States, Japan and Switzerland oppose those proposals. The United States has instead suggested a moratorium on patent-enforcement suits in Africa's poorest countries.
AIDS activists accuse Dr. Attaran of tailoring and timing his study to serve the drug industry and say his co-author's institution is part of the drug lobby.
Dr. Attaran, calling the tone of the attacks "sickening," said he published with Ms. Gillespie-White because she was doing an identical survey. 
He said that he did not receive any money from drug companies and that his data was only "a narrow case study of one drug category in Africa in 2001." 
Patents, he acknowledged, might have been a barrier two years ago, and still affect prices in some countries, like South Africa and Brazil. 
"If people go beyond my interpretations, what am I supposed to do?" he asked. 
Nowadays, he said, patents in Africa are generally not holding up prices because patent holders are offering cheap or free drugs or are choosing not to sue makers of generic rivals. 
Groups fighting for lower drug prices reply that the big companies routinely choose not to conduct research on tropical diseases, focusing instead on problems like obesity and impotence for which there is a more lucrative market. 
They add that the companies lower their prices only when threatened, as happened in the case of Bayer's Cipro, used to treat anthrax.
Dr. Attaran's boss, Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for International Development at Harvard, supports Dr. Attaran's study, and argues that the tight-fistedness of rich countries and the failure of governments like South Africa's to pursue antiretroviral drugs aggressively are the main reasons affordable AIDS drugs are not widely available in poor nations.
Mr. Sachs said that patent holders can be encouraged to offer discounts and to accept generic competition.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua Awaits Results in Ortega's Appeal for a Comeback 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
Nicaraguans voted today on whether to return the Sandinista leader, Daniel Ortega, to the presidency he lost in 1990 or to elect a Liberal Party stalwart and businessman, Enrique Bolanos. The vote pitted the fears and failures of a Socialist past against the corruption and economic hardship of the present.
 The two candidates were statistically tied in public opinion polls, making the sliver of undecided voters a critical block. Mr. Ortega has maintained that he has moderated his political views and wants a national reconciliation. 
 The Liberals say Mr. Ortega is an old revolutionary making political sweet talk at a time when the impoverished nation cannot risk restoring to power someone who brought the country economic and social ruin.
More than two-thirds of the polling places opened at least an hour late this morning while electoral officials were delayed in setting them up. Election observers said representatives of each party demanded multiple checks of ballots and voter lists before allowing voters to enter.
Results may not be available until early Monday, keeping in suspense a nation that has essentially held its breath until a winner is declared. 
Gabriel Solorzano, the president of a civic group monitoring the elections said some areas in the remote Atlantic coast region might not be able to hand in results for two days. The prospect of not knowing a winner has raised worries of fraud or violence, though there were no reports of either .
Many polling places had to remain open after their 6 p.m. close to accommodate many voters who had yet to cast their ballots.
The Sandinistas have presented themselves as part of a coalition that includes old enemies from the 1980's war, which was heavily supported by the United States.
United States officials have , declared they will respect the winner of a fair election -- but hinted at reservations over Mr. Ortega's past. 
Mr. Ortega's supporters said he appealed to the poor and young voters who accuse the current administration of President Arnoldo Aleman of doing little except enriching himself and his cronies. They also said the end of the civil war promised a new era. 
"That was a war the Sandinistas did not want, and that did not allow them truly to govern," said Miguel Angel Abelarca, an artist. 
Supporters of Mr. Bolanos, however, said it would be a step backward to return a man to power who confiscated properties, drafted young people and cozied up to leaders of nations linked to terrorism -- a theme that dominated the Liberals' campaign after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

HEADLINE: For Shaky Shopping Season, Fresh Ideas and Aged Whiskey 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Bergdorf Goodman is preparing for the holidays by trying to soothe men who might be jittery about spending during a recession. Bergdorf's will be installing a television set in its men's store so that customers can catch up on sports events while they shop, sometimes while sipping 25-year-old whiskey.
 At Bloomingdale's flagship store in Manhattan, something new has been added to the displays of bright green and red Champagne glasses, bonbons, gilded ornaments and menorahs in the holiday department. A Fire Zone section carrying T-shirts, jackets, caps and toy trucks, with proceeds going to fire safety education, has been added, to capitalize on the demand for Fire Department paraphernalia. 
 North of the city, Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Harriman, N.Y., hopes to jump-start the Christmas season with additional markdowns. As a discount mall, Woodbury normally does not have sales, but this year, the management persuaded most of the 220 stores to take part in a 10-day sale, ending Nov. 12. 
Smarting from the economic downturn, a decline in tourism, the city's dour mood and the fear of more terrorism, retailers throughout the New York area are bringing new tactics to the task of selling as they brace for a very tough Christmas season. Some experts are expecting a double-digit decline in sales compared with last year. Nationwide, consumer confidence is at its lowest point in seven years, and in New York, the level is even lower.
"It's a debacle," said Howard L. Davidowitz, the chairman of Davidowitz & Associates, a national retail investment company. "It's truly terrible." 
The consequences are likely to be felt across the region, where the industry employs 904,000 people, or about 10 percent of the labor force, according to Economy.com in West Chester, Pa., and often provides work for people with the lowest skill levels. Retailing in New York accounts for $2.6 billion in sales taxes each year.
Responding to the grim holiday forecast, store executives are trying to lure customers with new ideas. They are also reducing inventory, cutting down on seasonal hiring (or starting the hiring later), coddling their best customers, trying to improve customer service and, in some cases, slashing prices.
For most of the stores, the season is crucial. Retailers generally do about 20 percent of their business over the Christmas holidays, said Daniel Butler, a vice president of the National Retail Federation.
This season, employees who sell on commission -- generally in jewelry, cosmetics, designer clothes, furniture and shoes -- will find themselves under extra pressure to mine their Rolodexes. "This is the time period where professional sales associates have to know the value of their customers and get them into their stores," Mr. Butler said.
If they are very special customers, the store might come to them. Bergdorf's has dispatched vans and trucks loaded with designer clothes -- "from shoes to coats to dresses to furs to just about everything," said Robert D. Burke Jr., a vice president and senior fashion director -- to two to three dozen of its most prized customers. These are people who live in the suburbs and were loath to come into the city after Sept. 11, Mr. Burke said. So where will they wear any newly acquired finery? "We don't ask that question," he said.
At the store itself, Bergdorf's is emphasizing coziness. The store will have its first Christmas tree and the first Santa Claus in the memory of anyone currently working there.
Other stores are stressing patriotism. Macy's, for example, is installing two "United We Stand" shops offering flag-related items and is adding red, white and blue ribbons and golden eagles to the garlands framing its window displays. (The Thanksgiving Day parade, now in its 75th year, will incorporate "some patriotic moments," said Ronnie Taffet, a Macy's spokeswoman, but will otherwise stick to its traditions.)
Macy's and other New York retailers generally count on a heavy influx of tourists to increase holiday sales. In recent years, tourism has accounted for about 18 percent of retail sales. But although hotel occupancy has steadily risen since the week after Sept. 11 and now stands at 75 percent, it is expected to average about 68 percent for November, then dip to 62 percent in December, said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting, a company that tracks the hotel business.
To try to make up for the loss of holiday tourists, Macy's is working with NYC & Company, the city's visitors and convention bureau, to reel in people attending conventions. Woodbury Common is trying to promote itself as "a nice outing" for city residents and is arranging "shop and stay" package deals with nearby bed-and-breakfasts, said Michele Rothstein, a spokeswoman for the outlet mall.
Whatever the ploy, the objective is the same: getting shoppers into the stores. "At the end of the day," Mr. Davidowitz said, "you have to have footsteps. Without footsteps, the retailer commits hara-kiri."
Some retailers are acting more aggressively than others.
Late last month, Bergdorf's took the unusual step of holding a sale for regular customers, with prices on most items reduced by 30 percent. Other sales may follow, said Ronald L. Frasch, the chairman and chief executive. "It's an unusual time," he said, pointing out that Bergdorf's has no suburban branches to cushion a decline in sales. "We will do what we have to do."
At Bloomingdale's, however, the strategy is to "drum up a little excitement" rather than hold sales, said Michael Gould, the chief executive. "We have pushed ahead with newness," Mr. Gould said. "That's what the customer is looking for -- not another sale day." He said that Bloomingdale's would give extra attention to its suburban stores this Christmas.
No special sales are planned at Fortunoff, either, said Louis Fortunoff, the executive vice president. He said the store would be hiring half as many seasonal sales clerks as usual and would postpone some remodeling. As a family business, Mr. Fortunoff said, the company takes a long view. "We're certainly not running any panic-type events," he said.
The challenge for retailers this season, Mr. Gould said, is to get the message out that there is nothing wrong with shopping. "People need psychological permission to act in a self-indulgent way," he said.
Retailing experts say that buying for others will lessen the guilt. One category that is expected to do well this Christmas is children's toys. "You can't feel guilty about buying for your kids," said Arnold H. Aronson, the managing director for retail strategy at Kurt Salmon Associates, a consulting company.
Among the other items likely to turn up on many gift lists are DVD players, cookware and bedding, for people expecting to travel less and spend more time at home. At Fortunoff, sales of crosses, hearts and engagement rings are already increasing, Mr. Fortunoff said.
As shoppers search for cheaper alternatives to the department and specialty stores, mass-market stores like Target and Kmart and chain drugstores are likely to benefit, retail consultants said.
But wherever they shop, customers may find themselves more appreciated than usual. "When they come in, we say, 'Thank you, we're happy to have you,' " said Evan Cole, an owner of ABC Carpet & Home.
The holiday season will test store executives throughout New York in a way that many have not experienced before, Mr. Aronson said.
"Retailers are just going to have to do what they do better, and become acutely aware of customer sensitivities," he said. "Lip service is going to have to turn into real service. That's where the differentiation is going to come."

HEADLINE: Harnessing the Spirit of Sept. 11 

 BODY:
New York's chief judge, Judith Kaye, got a taste of the city's new civic spirit when she told about 100 people who showed up for jury duty one day recently that they would not be needed. Instead of the customary cheering, New Yorkers who not long ago viewed jury duty as a civic form of root canal voiced disappointment at being excused. Indeed, so many New Yorkers have been showing up for jury duty lately that Judge Kaye decided to institute a new system that allows prospective jurors throughout the city to call in the night before to find out if they are needed the next day. 
 Ever since Sept. 11, people in New York have been eager to do something -- anything -- to help, even if it's only giving a donation or listening to the evidence in a civil court case. In coming months, as the state and city are forced to make painful budget cuts responding to the double whammy of a terrorist attack and a deepening national recession, that spirit of service must not be allowed to fizzle. There are plenty of concrete ways for civic-minded New Yorkers to help. Partnership for Parks, for example, a joint initiative of the City Parks Foundation and the Parks Department, is now signing up volunteers for ongoing projects in neighborhood parks throughout the city. The New York Restoration Project, the "conservancy of forgotten places" founded by Bette Midler, could use help sprucing up the neglected parks and community gardens within its purview. 
 Another citywide volunteer group, New York Cares, sends people into city schools to paint walls and stairwells, organize libraries and clean up play yards -- brightening that enhances the learning experience but would otherwise go undone. New York Cares also hooks up volunteers with groups that deliver important social services, operating soup kitchens, for example, or working with children living in homeless shelters, or assisting people living with H.I.V. or AIDS. Helpers are always needed for the annual New York Cares coat drive, which collects tens of thousands of gently used adult and child-size garments each holiday season and distributes them to organizations serving the needy.
The court system itself uses lots of volunteers other than jurors. Its Office of Justice Initiatives relies on volunteers for everything from the one-time cleanup of facilities to the mediation of small disputes. There are churches, synagogues and mosques in every borough in need of reliable help with their community programs. 
Realistically, developing an expanded cadre of dedicated volunteers cannot make up for the likely reductions in the city budget. But intelligently harnessed, the spirit of service can help keep the city livable during the coming rough times, and reduce the pain government cuts inflict on the city's most vulnerable residents.

HEADLINE: Now, Hitting 'Save' Is Not Enough 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
IN the aftermath of Sept. 11, job No. 1 for most information technology managers outside the World Trade Center neighborhood was to make sure their operations were functioning normally. But it did not take long before they began to assess the business lessons of that horrific day. In most cases, their analyses included a re-examination of which data should be stored, how it should be kept and whether plans for retrieving it were adequate.
 "We estimate that 25 to 30 percent of our customers are going to end up changing what they do in some way," said Gary Francis, the general manager of automated tape products for StorageTek, which makes disk and tape storage systems and is in Louisville, Colo. 
 The first wave of changes has involved simply backing up critical data more frequently, said Kevin Coyne, the director of business operations for Sun Microsystems. But many of Sun's customers are also rushing to thoroughly inventory the many types of data they create and reconsider what is critical, he added.
Data management experts say that big companies are not likely to make sweeping changes before next year because comprehensive data policy reviews take weeks to finish. If reviews point to a significant shift -- buying new equipment to duplicate data at distant recovery sites, for example -- efforts to fix these problems can drag on for months.
Therefore, those companies that are already revising their practices tend to be small. The first to do so also include a few larger businesses that had been weighing changes to systems they had installed in the late 1990's to head off disruptions associated with computers mishandling year 2000 dates, according to vendors and consultants.
"Almost everybody has a backup strategy, but they aren't always well implemented," said Adam Couture, an analyst who is based in Lowell, Mass., and works for the Gartner Group, an information technology consulting firm.
Computer consultants say that although the economic slowdown has reduced investments in new data-storage equipment, data-management reviews have risen this year. Despite the scrutiny that data received during the year 2000 overhaul, many practices have become obsolete. This is because databases have grown in size and diversity through the expansion of e-mail, digital forms of entertainment and e-business. Likewise, computer users have more data storage and recovery options. 
A growing number of computer users are handing over their data storage and management needs to companies like I.B.M., Electronic Data Services and Storage Networks. These vendors manage networks of storage equipment at big data centers. Many companies also "mirror" critical data, a process that simultaneously stores new data, as it is generated, on computers in two different locations. That way, business can continue if one computer is knocked out.
At the lower end of the market, companies that back up their computers on tape have a growing number of businesses they can turn to for off-site storage and duplication of their records. Another alternative, sometimes combined with tape storage, is to send crucial files automatically over secure Internet lines to storage service providers.
Automation is a common theme in many new services. Most data storage currently involves transferring data from disks to tapes and manually collecting and storing the tapes. Such jobs often fall to administrative employees rather than information technology specialists, and it is not uncommon for glitches to occur, thus preventing companies from making reliable backups as frequently as their policies require.
The Sept. 11 attacks appear to have stimulated interest in some of the newer services.
"Business is up 50 or 60 percent since Sept. 11," said Bud Stoddard, the founder and chief executive of Amerivault, a Waltham, Mass., start-up that allows computer users to back up files over the Internet. "People are calling us, we're not calling them."
The calls to Amerivault, which focuses on data kept on work stations and servers that deal with small networks of desktop computers, reflect the nature of most of the data that was lost on Sept. 11.
The attacks had little effect on mainframe computer operations for banks and other large businesses. Commercial real estate in the World Trade Center neighborhood is so expensive that most large companies there moved their main computer operations elsewhere long ago.
Companies in the area were also early users of mirroring technology. As a result, the speed with which companies were back in business after the attacks depended largely on how fast workers were relocated, not on the availability of their mainframe computer data.

HEADLINE: To-Do List for Christmas: This Year, the Little Things 

BYLINE:  By BOB TEDESCHI 

 BODY:
IN the 1999 holiday e-tailing season, marketing was in, as merchants like eToys and Amazon engaged in what amounted to an arms race fought with advertising dollars. Last year, the watchword was fulfillment, the industry term for shipping and handling, which so many e-tailers ignored the year before in their quest to simply attract holiday customers.
 This holiday season's common element among e-tailers is -- nothing. 
 The few remaining Internet-only merchants and their traditional retail counterparts say the business of selling on the Web has reached a milestone in that the work cannot be reduced to a few boldfaced bullet points, like "keep the site running," "launch ad campaign with B-list star" and "build several monolithic warehouses."
Rather, Web retailers preparing for the holidays spend their days wrangling with much more subtle and unglamorous details, like optimizing their e-mail marketing campaigns, tweaking their site navigation and adjusting prices to attract the right mix of customers. But the good news for consumers and executives alike is that, as Internet retailers shed their baby teeth, they are getting better at these tasks, and more. 
"This will be the first year where nothing really interesting happens in Internet retail," said Ken Cassar, an analyst with Jupiter Media Metrix, an online consulting company. "The growth of the online channel was really a double-edged sword. On the one hand it was great to have sales jump like they did, but things were so volatile, it required companies to make huge changes all the time to keep up."
Indeed, the projected holiday Internet retail sales for 2001 look unspectacular. Jupiter predicts that holiday sales will be roughly 11 percent higher this year than last, coming in around $11.9 billion. By contrast, 2000 holiday sales were 54 percent higher than those in 1999, which were 120 percent higher than 1998 levels.
With more stable businesses, Internet retail executives say they can focus better on efficiency and service for customers. Consider Amazon. According to David Risher, the senior vice president for marketing and merchandising, Amazon is expected to begin a service this month that will allow customers to track the shipping on 85 percent of the company's merchandise, compared with about 50 percent before.
"It's a subtle thing, but if you increase the trackability of packages, you'll increase the customer's confidence it will arrive on time," Mr. Risher said. "A couple of years ago, it was way too early to worry about this kind of stuff. But now, customer expectations are rising, so we do."
Amazon is also focusing on lower prices in certain categories, Mr. Risher said, aiming to solidify the company's place as the dominant mass-market retailer. In mid-2000, Amazon raised its prices on books and other items. At the time, some analysts attributed the increase to the company's urgent need to attain profitability.
Now, Mr. Risher said, the company is simply experimenting. "If you look back 30 years from now, this will all be lost in the preadolescent noise of figuring out what kind of company we wanted to be," he said. "We came out of it firmly on the side that we should be able to, and can, lower prices in many categories."
For instance, Mr. Risher said, Amazon has "structural economic advantages" over other book retailers, because, among other things, its distributors can ship books directly to consumers and the company does business in such great volume it can shave costs. "So, for items over $20, we can give some margin back to customers and still make money on the sale," he said.
Another early online retailer, Bertelsmann's CDNow, is also at the stage where it can fine-tune its shipping techniques, both for the customer's sake and the company's. Mike Haney, CDNow's senior director for merchandising, says the focus is not tracking items more closely, like Amazon, but coordinating the shipments so they get to the customer more quickly.
In the past, Mr. Haney said, the company kept CD's, videos and merchandise like T-shirts in different warehouses across the country, so when customers ordered an item from each category, they would have to wait until the company had all the merchandise in one place. Then it could be shipped in one package.
Starting the first week of this month, CDNow shifted to a new system, in which its distribution centers hold a more diverse mix of items. In addition, Mr. Haney said the company had contracted with more distributors east of the Mississippi, where a majority of the population is concentrated. One result is that customers who order a mix of merchandise are more likely to get it more quickly.
Against the backdrop of Internet retailers tangling with the intricacies of shipping and pricing, there are many who wonder whether the economic downturn that preceded the terrorist attacks and accelerated after Sept. 11 will dim their holiday hopes.
Among the more optimistic is Neiman Marcus. Karen Katz, the chief executive of Neiman Marcus Direct, which oversees online and catalog sales for the Neiman Marcus Group, says she suspects her Web site will generally not suffer from the downturn in the economy.
Nonetheless, she said that the site, NeimanMarcus.com, would feature relatively less-expensive gifts this season to round out the usual collection of exorbitant gifts, like helicopters and custom-made gingerbread houses.
"Consumers come to the site because they want to be able to give a gift from Neiman Marcus," Ms. Katz said. "So we tailor the site to a broader base during the holidays."
WHILE the lower-priced merchandise, which includes items like $35 liqueur cake samplers and $28 potpourri gift sets, helps attract those with fewer shopping dollars, they serve another important function: those items could attract new shoppers during the holidays who might return during the rest of the year, Ms. Katz said.
The Neiman Marcus site is also taking advantage of some lessons it learned during last year's holiday season regarding the type of customers who do or do not shop on the site, Ms. Katz said. "Last year, we thought, 'Well, there are a lot of men who are interested in the Internet, who are into the technology,' " so the site featured a wide array of men's shirts and fashions.
Unfortunately, many more women than men showed up on the site. "So, we'll be offering a bigger selection of things a woman would buy for a man," Ms. Katz said, including gifts like cashmere dress socks and a set of 1933 replica baseball cards.
Unlike NeimanMarcus.com, which was introduced two years ago, the outdoor goods retailer REI has been selling on the Web since 1996. Given that comparative longevity, said Joan Broughton, REI's vice president for direct sales, REI.com requires only "very subtle changes" for this holiday season.
For example, REI has been changing the site to discourage people from bailing out of a purchase. "We're doing things as simple as making the buttons bigger and breaking the number of questions into bite-size pieces," Ms. Broughton said. "If you ask for a lot of information on one long page, they'll sometimes just turn away."
With only the smaller changes needed, "I guess that means we're in a mature phase now," Ms. Broughton said. "Everything's in place. Now, we're pretty much just battening down the hatches."

HEADLINE: A Safety Net For New York 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Hungry and Jobless" (column, Nov. 1): Bob Herbert correctly underscores that those hardest hit by the economic downturn that New York faces after the World Trade Center tragedy are those who have been falling through the cracks all along: the city's uninsured and low-wage earners, a population likely only to grow larger post-Sept. 11. 
 Vital social services, including low-cost health care, are likely to be slashed as money from the already depleted city and state budgets is reallocated to public safety and rebuilding efforts. 
Coupled with job loss, social service cuts are a virtual double whammy for poor and low-income New York women and their families. We can meet the basic health care needs of all New Yorkers only by preserving direct access to services, including a safety net for the uninsured.
This tragedy has brought out the best in New Yorkers -- our resiliency, pride and compassion. Let us work these characteristics into the fabric of our daily lives and our financial priorities and make them the blueprint for a new New York.

HEADLINE: COLLABORATION; 
Making Better Toys and Jumbo Jets by Sharing the Rough Draft

BYLINE:  By SCOTT KIRSNER 

 BODY:
FOR Mike Barbato, making changes to three-dimensional objects and beaming them to colleagues around the world has become as easy as altering a sentence in a shared word-processing document.
 Mr. Barbato is the director of engineering at Equity Marketing in Los Angeles, which designs many of the promotional toys that are given away by Burger King. Like most companies that make toys, cars, cellphones and other consumer products, Equity used to start a project with a lump of clay, from which designers sculptured a series of models and shipped them to customers, licensers and safety consultants for approvals. Finally, a model would be sent to the company's manufacturing office in Hong Kong, which determined whether the toy could be produced as designed. 
 Now, with the help of two novel tools that allow designers to operate in three dimensions, Equity's employees can work simultaneously on a single design, print out copies for review and "fax" them to the Hong Kong office for immediate advice.
"We've found these tools to be extremely powerful," Mr. Barbato said. "They've reduced our cycle time, from the initial product brief to tooling, by at least two weeks."
The technologies that Equity uses -- FreeForm, a device made by SensAble Technologies, and the ThermoJet printer, made by 3D Systems -- are part of a raft of innovations changing how companies design products, thereby opening the door for greater collaboration, shorter cycle times, higher quality and wider customizing. These innovations are often grouped under the rubric "rapid prototyping."
FreeForm lets designers use their hands to shape and refine objects that exist only on a computer screen but have the same tactile qualities as the clay or plastic foam they are accustomed to working with. The ThermoJet, a solid-object printer about the size of a large copy machine, produces shapes by spraying layers of plastic from a set of nozzles. A similar printer from the Z Corporation can render objects in 64 million colors and produce a model the size of a football in about two hours. Color scanners from companies like Arius 3D can import existing objects into the computer to serve as templates for changes or new designs, and a monitor being developed by Actuality Systems displays three-dimensional objects in a dome of glass.
"The marginal cost of doing different iterations of a product design used to be extremely high, and it took a long time to do each iteration," said Michael Schrage, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab and the author of "Serious Play: How the World's Best Companies Simulate to Innovate."
He said that these tools "completely transform the economics and the social dynamics of model-making."
"It becomes as easy to change a slope on a car's hood as it is to change a typeface in the company newsletter," Mr. Schrage said. He thinks that the ability to make such changes easily can yield significant competitive advantage.
Equity Marketing has already benefited from the innovations, Mr. Barbato said. In the industry, there has been an increase in the number of recalls of promotional toys because of safety concerns, so designers at Equity can now deliver the company's prototypes to safety consultants earlier in the process.
Now, the initial rough sculpture takes five days to make, not three weeks, Mr. Barbato said. Designers who have worked on a character before -- Bart Simpson, for example -- can use last year's toy as a template instead of starting with a lump of clay. And Equity's engineers in Asia can spot problems sooner.
One chief advantage of the new technology is that it allows various departments to work simultaneously, instead of sequentially, on a product. At Gillette, Jill Shurtleff, a senior industrial designer, said that working with digital designs allowed for "concurrent engineering."
"I can be working on the same model as a mechanical engineer," she said. "The purchasing department can be getting quotes on the material costs, and if vendors are within our confidential sphere, they can see it, too." 
At the Ford Motor Company, some departments are sending three-dimensional models of parts to suppliers, as well as traditional requests for price quotations. Ford executives have found that suppliers tend to respond with lower prices when they have a better idea of what they are expected to produce.
Marina Hatsopoulos, the chief executive of the Z Corporation, which makes three-dimensional printers, agreed. Companies "find they get much lower quotes when they send a three-D model along with the request."
In designing Gillette's Venus razor for women, Ms. Shurtleff found she could not get the "very organic, undulating form" she wanted by creating models on a computer screen. So, she made a prototype by hand, scanned the three-dimensional model into the computer and refined it. 
Arius 3D, the maker of a new three-dimensional scanning technology, predicts that its tool, a color scanner, will also help at the end of the design process, when the first samples roll off the assembly line.
"You'll be able to scan the object, e-mail it around the company and get people's feedback as to whether it's acceptable," said Walter Noot, the chief operating officer of Arius. Because the new tools reduce the time and cost of designing products, some companies find they can afford to produce variations on existing designs. "Each of the retailers we supply products to wants their own unique item," said Mike Zerbe, a senior model maker at Graco Children's Products, which makes strollers, cribs and other baby items. 
Some analysts expect the three-dimensional technology to encourage more customizing as it becomes less expensive. A color three-dimensional printer from the Z Corporation sells for $64,000; the FreeForm system from SensAble costs $25,000.
For example, one thing that Nokia, the cellphone maker, is known for is letting customers choose different faceplates for their phones, said B. Joseph Pine, a consultant at Strategic Horizons and a co-author of "Mass Customization." He said that one of his recent recommendations to Nokia was that "they ought to have mass-customized skeletons that, for example, fit the hand of the person who buys them."
One catch, however, is that buyers must be willing to pay a premium for the customized products to justify the investment in the technology, Mr. Pine said. But a big advantage of mass customizing, he said, is that "you have no finished goods inventory sitting around." 
Others think that the technology will be cheap enough to allow consumers to design and customize objects at home, like bookends or picture frames, perhaps by downloading templates from the Internet. They might print the items out on their own three-dimensional printers or at a copy center.
Whether or not that will be possible, people using these technologies at their jobs right now like them. 
"When I started doing product design at Gillette 18 years ago," Ms. Shurtleff said, "I was sitting at a drawing board with a big piece of paper and lots of pencils and erasers. Now, that seems like the dark ages."

HEADLINE: COLLABORATION; 
Machine-Made Links Change the Way Minds Can Work Together

BYLINE:  By KATIE HAFNER 

 BODY:
MODERN science is accustomed to bigness. In five years, the world's most powerful particle accelerator will be in operation at the CERN physics laboratory outside Geneva. The $4 billion accelerator will give physicists the tools they need to search for scientific prizes like the elusive Higgs boson, a particle believed to be the origin of mass and weight in the universe.
 But when the accelerator starts up, scientists will not necessarily need to travel to Switzerland to conduct their experiments. Instead, they will be able to work together remotely, using a federally financed project called the Grid Physics Network, or GriPhyN (pronounced GRIFF-in), a system that can be used in real time by researchers working on experiments that require vast amounts of computational power. 
 At the other end of the spectrum is Freeverse Software, a small company in New York whose dozen or so programmers work from places as geographically dispersed as Romania and Arizona, using e-mail messages as their primary means of collaboration. 
And somewhere in the middle lies an intensive engineering collaboration -- the recent design and manufacture of a wireless headset for a new Chrysler minivan. Instead of placing conference calls and taking business trips, the half-dozen contractors working on the product used the Web as their principal meeting place.
All three are examples of the way in which the intelligence of the Internet can be greater than the sum of its parts. For years, the Internet has served as a tool for communication; when the Web came along in the early 1990's, it added a multimedia component to the Internet, with images, music and text.
Now the world is seeing a new level of connection emerge in the form of an unprecedented amount of computer-based collaboration that not only helps companies do business more efficiently and more economically, but also augments human intelligence. 
This became more apparent in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when, in the face of reduced travel or even physical displacement, many companies were forced to rely on the Web and e-mail as a primary means of doing business.
The new collaboration is not necessarily the result of expensive, flashy technology. The real consequence is social; when computers interact differently, the humans who use them do, too.
"Most technical innovations are extensions of technology," said Michael Schrage, a research associate at the Media Laboratory at M.I.T. "This is an extension of human behavior, of how people actually interact. It's one thing to share a design. It's another to have a technology that lets you create a design together."
The idea is not new. Forty years ago, J. C. R. Licklider, a research director of the Pentagon's Advanced Research Projects Agency, predicted that complicated tasks could be shared by computers and humans, with the computers performing much of the rote work, leaving the higher-level problems of analysis and judgment to humans. And Dr. Licklider predicted a global network that would link its users to a universe of information. Through the years, others have echoed his words.
There have been plenty of false turns along the way. Dr. David Gelernter, a computer scientist at Yale, described efforts in the 1980's to create highly advanced software that would allow researchers to work together. "It turned out that the tools didn't correspond to what people wanted to do," he said. "None of it was simple enough. It was like killing a gnat with a nuclear missile."
Two things have changed since then. One is the ubiquity of simple tools like e-mail, attachments and shared Web pages that allow millions of computer users inside corporations and outside to take on projects together. "Far more gets done that way than with specialized tools," Dr. Gelernter said. "What we need is something far simpler and far more powerful, and these are beginning to emerge."
One reason for these new possibilities is that computers have only now become powerful enough that resource sharing can occur across institutional boundaries.
Take the project at CERN in Geneva. "In the past the way people had to handle these things would be to travel to Geneva and spend a few weeks there analyzing the data, or write papers," said Dr. Ian Foster, a computer scientist at the University of Chicago and co-director of GriPhyN. "And now you have community access to the raw materials -- the data, the computations used to analyze the data and generate new data, are all made available through shared community resources instantaneously."
Not only does remote collaboration change the way research is conducted, Dr. Foster said, but it also changes the way scientists view their roles as discoverers of nature's basic truths. 
"Working in a collaborative fashion like this requires people to adjust in a variety of ways," Dr. Foster said. "It concerns learning to be open and sharing things with your colleagues in the belief that the final benefit you will gain will be greater than if you don't."
Dr. Foster sees a number of ways in which Internet-based collaboration concepts being developed in less commercial settings can be applied to business. "Increasingly, businesses attack problems not by themselves but in various teaming arrangements," he said.
One example of highly dispersed but intensive engineering collaboration was the recent design and manufacture of a wireless headset for a new Chrysler minivan.
Alpine Electronics in Detroit, Chrysler's audio vendor, sent the job to Recoton, a consumer electronics company in Orlando, Fla., which in turn hired Aptec, a product development company in Ormond Beach, Fla., to design and engineer the headset for high-volume production. The headset was then manufactured in South Korea and the headset's circuit board was produced in the Philippines. 
The companies involved in the project, which began in June 2000 and was completed in May 2001, held their meetings in a virtual conference room that allowed them to view, manipulate and annotate three- and two-dimensional models and data. 
The best part of the project, said Tom Morris, the chief information officer at Aptec, was shaving nine months and $250,000 off in the process. The reduction of travel contributed most to the savings of time and expense.
At the same time, Mr. Morris said, remote collaboration requires a different mindset. "You have to behave differently," he said. 
In traditional design projects, he said, "one team gets their hands on things, and then they throw it over a wall to another team. But when they're all brought together concurrently it's a different culture, and that cultural aspect can be something that's really tough to overcome." 
Still, observers like Mr. Schrage see the Chrysler headset project as part of a fundamental shift for the carmaker. "Now it's not about approving specifications," he said. "It's about interacting with ideas" as a group while the specifications are being developed.
Another example, more elementary than GriPhyN and the Chrysler project, is Freeverse Software, which creates computer-based card games for the Macintosh.
Ian Lynch Smith, the president of Freeverse, said that for the seven years he had been running the company, his programmers had been working remotely. This practice, Mr. Smith said, drastically alters the way he interacts with them. Because the everyday banter that comes with working together in one office is missing, he said, it is important to establish a strong rapport, which Mr. Smith tries to do through e-mail messages.
"The relationship you develop makes all the difference," he said, "because you're not getting the facial expressions, you're not having incidential conversations about their dog."
Mr. Smith shuns elaborate Web-based collaboration tools, preferring instead to keep the technology straightforward and simple. "The simpler the tools, the better, which means e-mail is the crux of it," he said. Mr. Smith said that the lack of a physical presence inspired creative solutions. In lieu of regular meetings, or even conference calls, where people discuss tasks at hand, Mr. Smith sends to-do lists to programmers, who in turn send back a "build," or new copy of the program.
To send files that are too big to be easily added to an e-mail message, the company maintains an internal server, giving access only to those programmers and artists working on projects for Freeverse.
THE internal site is also used as a convenient place to put backups of what people are working on, he added. "If the programmer in Nebraska's machine dies, we'll have a backup here in New York," Mr. Smith said.
Two Freeverse programmers work from Bucharest. Mr. Smith said that in the nearly three years he had been working with the Romanians, he had yet to meet them, or even speak with them on the phone. All their communication is conducted through e-mail and instant messaging.
Dragos Alexandru, one of the Romanian programmers who runs his own software company, said he had also used a Webcam for videoconferencing with other clients. 
One particularly innovative but deceptively simple move for Freeverse has been to put up a Web page for bug tracking for the company's most recent product, an animated set of card games called Colin's Classic Cards. The company has 60 people testing the software and reporting bugs to the Web site, which is open to all beta testers.
Freeverse and GriPhyN may be worlds apart in their levels of sophistication and complexity, but they share what is perhaps the most rewarding aspect of a networked world, one that hews closely to Dr. Licklider's original vision: the ability to take part in work that would be inaccessible otherwise. 
Dr. Paul Avery, a physicist at the University of Florida and the project director of GriPhyN, said the fact that the project was Web-based made it more universally accessible. "A big part of this is including people who would normally not be invited to the table to make decisions," he said. Dr. Avery said that this point was brought home to him after an overseas visit last year during which he met scientists from poorer countries. 
He was impressed by the caliber of physicists "who simply can't afford to do some of the things they can do in richer countries," he said. "So, the ability to participate as equal members of a collaboration is a hugely important thing."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ECONOMY; 
Staving Off a Recession When Only Old Scripts Are at Hand in a New Age

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
With daily doses of bad economic news pointing to the first recession in more than a decade, government policy makers face increasing questions about whether they have the resolve and the proper tools to bring about a quick recovery.
 Just as the terrorist attacks required the United States to fight a new kind of war, economists said, the government faces an economic downturn that does not match previous scripts and that so far has not been particularly responsive to the combination of tax cuts and aggressive interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board. 
 Yet while the economy seemed to be crumbling from the delayed effects of a one-two punch -- the bursting of the 1990's bubble followed by the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 -- Washington was dithering.
Even as the latest statistics showed that the economy had contracted over the summer and that unemployment had surged by half a percentage point in October, to 5.4 percent, the two parties in Congress and the Bush administration sank more deeply into an ideological bog over how to respond.
Republicans pushed their plan for another round of tax cuts that would largely benefit companies and upper-income people. Democrats pressed for an approach that would give most help to the unemployed and those with lower incomes, and would rely in large part on increased government spending. 
President Bush repeatedly called on the parties to bridge their differences and act but offered no new proposals of his own and defended his focus on tax cuts.
By the end of the week, they were clearly aware that their inability to get something done left them at risk of being seen as part of the problem rather than part of the solution.
"We're seven weeks after the event," said Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at National City Bank in Cleveland, referring to the attacks, "and they're still debating."
"It is getting late," Mr. DeKaser added.
It is not just Congress and the administration that are under pressure.
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve will meet, and analysts are almost unanimous in predicting that it will cut rates for the 10th time this year. The Fed has already slashed its benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks to 2.5 percent from 6.5 percent this year in an effort to stimulate economic activity by reducing borrowing costs.
Interest rate policy works with long lags, and many analysts said the Fed would ultimately prove as effective as ever, a position also held by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman. But so far the rate cuts have not had as much effect as expected, some economists said.
In any case, they said, lower rates may not be the right remedy for the economy's major problem: overinvestment by businesses in computers, telecommunications equipment, machinery and other capital goods. 
With demand for their goods and services eroding rapidly, companies are unlikely to borrow to finance more capital spending no matter how low interest rates go.
"It's a very different business cycle," said William Dudley, chief domestic economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment firm. "It's an investment boom-bust cycle, and the bust that's followed the boom has created significant imbalances that will take time to be corrected and that are not easily remedied by monetary policy."
Just how different a cycle this is will be determined in part by how far-reaching the aftereffects of the terrorist attacks prove to be. 
Already, policy makers are trying to determine how much effect fear of further attacks and concerns about a drawn-out war will have on consumer and investor confidence. 
They are examining whether the improvement in recent years in productivity, or business efficiency, will be wiped out by the costs of tighter security and less reliable transportation. And they are waiting to gauge the effects of a likely worldwide recession while speculating about the possible effects of further potential economic shocks like a sharp rise in oil prices.
Publicly, administration officials continue to be upbeat, holding out the possibility that the economy could avoid a technical recession by growing in the fourth quarter and suggesting that in any case the recovery is likely to come fairly quickly next year.
"It's too early to tell" if the United States is in its 10th recession since World War II, said R. Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
Mr. Hubbard said the onset of this problem was atypical in that it did not originate in an often repeated pattern in which inflation gets out of hand and the Fed overreacts by pushing interest rates too high. Inflation this time around has been almost dormant.
Yet if the onset of the problem has been different, Mr. Hubbard said, it is nonetheless playing out in a classic pattern, with weakness spreading from manufacturers through the rest of the economy. There is no reason to think the economy will not also recover as it typically does, he said.
"The dynamics of recovery are likely to be fairly similar to what we've seen before," Mr. Hubbard said. "I have no reason to believe policy won't be very effective, both monetary policy and fiscal policy."
The policy choices on the table in Washington are fairly orthodox. 
Republicans say cutting taxes on companies will reduce pressure on employers to slash jobs, create an incentive to buy equipment soon instead of delaying and help restore confidence and wealth by supporting corporate profits and stock prices. Cutting all income tax rates, even for the wealthy, would have much the same effect by encouraging job creation and hard work.
The point of an economic stimulus package, said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican minority leader, is "not to give folks a check for today, but to give them a job for tomorrow."
But Democrats said there was no higher priority in a downturn than helping unemployed people put food on the table or maintain their health insurance. If taxes are to be cut, they said, the main recipients should be Americans with low and moderate incomes.
"We should be helping those who need it the most, not those who need it the least," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader.
To the degree that there is any thinking outside of the political box, it is coming from the ideological wings. Conservative supply-siders want far more sweeping tax cuts than anything getting serious consideration in Congress. Liberals want public-works-style spending packages, everything from child care to highways, with a particular focus on projects that could help improve domestic security.
Politically, tensions continue to run high. In the latest twist, Republicans have started turning on Mr. Bush's point man in negotiating a stimulus package, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. 
Enraged by a public suggestion from Mr. O'Neill that the tax-cut bill the House passed last month was "show business," intended more as a political statement than a serious policy proposal, some conservatives have called for Mr. O'Neill to resign.
Asked last week whether Mr. O'Neill should stay on, Mr. Lott said, "That's the president's decision," and added that Mr. O'Neill "needs to be careful with how he says what he believes."
The Senate Finance Committee had tentatively planned to push through a Democratic stimulus plan this week. Then Republicans said they might file as many as 72 amendments to the bill in an effort to tie it up in the committee. It is still unclear how the logjam will get broken. 
Analysts said public pressure will ultimately motivate the politicians on both sides to stop squabbling and come up with a credible response to the deterioration of the economy.
Kim Wallace, a political analyst at Lehman Brothers, the investment firm, said people have been willing to give Congress and the White House a reasonable amount of time but are now growing impatient.
"That reasonable period has been overextended in the eyes of most people," Mr. Wallace said. "It only feeds into the notion that Washington has outlived its usefulness at this stage in the crisis, and that's a dangerous place for an elected member to be a year out from an election."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ELECTIONS; 
Local Candidates Everywhere Focus on Terrorism

BYLINE:  By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
In Pennsylvania, David Wecht, a candidate for State Supreme Court judge, laments in a television commercial that his baby son's "world changed forever" on Sept. 11.
 In Detroit, Gil Hill, a candidate for mayor, is running a commercial in which a local citizen says, "We live in a different world now -- safety can no longer be assumed." 
 And in Virginia, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York solemnly recalls having lunch with Mark L. Earley, a candidate for governor, just a day before the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Giuliani says that if he could vote in the governor's race there on Tuesday, "I would vote for Mark Earley." 
Seeking to reach voters who have been numbed by terrorism, candidates in more than 25 media markets have produced roughly 50 commercials that directly or indirectly refer to the events of Sept. 11. Rather than highlight local matters like whether to increase highway tolls or what to do about waste treatment, candidates are emphasizing their qualifications to protect the public. They are lacing their advertisements with American flags and the faces of firefighters and police officers.
For Republicans running for governor in New Jersey and Virginia and for mayor of New York, it is not President Bush but Mayor Giuliani, still enjoying adulation for his response to the attacks, who has become the politician of choice to endorse their candidacies. 
In all, candidates in Tuesday's elections have spent more than $10 million on commercials related to terrorism, according to a study by the Campaign Media Analysis Group, a research company in Alexandria, Va.
"After Sept. 11, people hit the reset button on what their campaigns stood for and went to messages on domestic security," said Evan Tracey, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group. "Even at the City Council level, a lot of these candidates felt the best way to connect with voters was to piggyback on current events."
The risk is that voters may question whether the candidates are exploiting the tragedy for their own gain. They might also wonder what relevance terrorism has in contests for City Council in cities far from the attacks, including Baton Rouge, La., Knoxville, Tenn., and Birmingham, Ala.
"If you can link yourself to the flag and respect for firemen and policemen and all these symbols of Sept. 11, it is to your benefit," said Ken Goldstein, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin who is conducting a study of political advertising. "On the other hand, it's pretty close to bad form to explicitly tie yourself to these symbols without people thinking you're taking advantage. Are people going to resent politics being brought into what happened seven weeks ago?"
In Illinois, Corinne Wood, a Democratic candidate for governor next year, was criticized as insensitive by Republicans for broadcasting a commercial that showed images of the flag and of the World Trade Center erupting into a fireball, followed by an image of the Sears Tower in Chicago. Campaign officials said they had decided to use a commercial that did not feature those images. They insisted that the more inflammatory version ran only by mistake several times in Springfield.
In the version that was intended for broadcast, Ms. Wood says, "I won't give in, not to terrorists, not to a struggling economy."
Most other campaigns around the country have stayed clear of videotape of the World Trade Center or the Pentagon.
Shirley Clarke Franklin, a Democrat who is running for mayor of Atlanta, points to endorsements from the police and firefighters unions in a commercial that features the flag interspersed with faces of local fire and police officers. The words "courage," "valor" and "trust" pop up on the screen. Ms. Franklin appears only at the end. "I am honored and humbled to be endorsed by our police and firefighters," she says. "They make us proud."
Ms. Franklin's campaign manager, Kasim Reed, said he had agonized over whether to invoke Sept. 11 even implicitly. "We did give it a first, second and third thought," he said. "Anyone who's running a campaign in this time would agree that it's very challenging to be focused on electoral politics. We decided that rather than use the endorsements in a traditional sense, our ad would be a tribute to the men and women who keep us safe."
But before the Franklin campaign broadcast the advertisement, Mr. Reed said, he sought feedback from more than 50 voters around the city. "We asked them very frank questions, if they felt the ad was appropriate or whether a line of propriety was being crossed," he said.
In his race for the Supreme Court in Pennsylvania, David Wecht was also careful not to go overboard. There are no images of terror in his advertising -- just the candidate holding his baby son in his lap and standing in a marble courtroom.
"On May 19, 2001, Alexander Wecht was born," Mr. Wecht tells viewers. "On Sept. 11, 2001, his world changed forever. The battles to make Alexander's world safe won't only be fought in faraway lands; they'll be fought in courtrooms, like this one in Pittsburgh."
In New Jersey, the campaign of James E. McGreevey, the Democratic candidate for governor, has included a commercial featuring images of police officers and firefighters. "For all of us, the terrorist attacks were incomprehensible," Mr. McGreevey says, adding that "in these tough times, we're also seeing America at her best."
A few candidates have dared to refer to the terrorism as part of attack advertisements. In the New York mayoral race, Michael R. Bloomberg, the Republican, ran an advertisement quoting his opponent, Mark Green, saying, "I actually believe that if, God forbid, I had been the mayor during such a calamity, I would have done as well or better than Rudy Giuliani." The advertisement ends with the word "Really?" filling the screen.
Not all politicians, particularly incumbents, have been timid about invoking the images of terror for constituents.
"The opportunity to get publicity is overwhelming," said Representative Mark Souder, an Indiana Republican. "I have not been up to New York, but many members did live feeds back when they were there. There's an insatiable demand from the public, and unless you're saying off-the-wall things or can't speak well, it gives you a bounce."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE LAWMAKERS; 
Seeking a United Voice on Capitol Hill

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
Representative Nita M. Lowey of Westchester was sounding exasperated the other day as she tried to get a point across at a gathering of her New York colleagues on Capitol Hill. But they simply would not let her get a word in edgewise.
 "Let me finish! Let me finish! Let me finish!" Mrs. Lowey finally exclaimed. 
 Even in Washington, a city of big egos and strong wills, New York's Congressional delegation has long stood out for its bickering and backbiting. But that day on Capitol Hill captured, in many ways, the intense jockeying that has erupted as New York's lawmakers seek to distinguish themselves in the effort to deliver federal aid to New York in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
Normally, such a situation could be shrugged off as more of the same from a bunch of pushy New Yorkers. But these days, much is at stake. Lawmakers agree that New York's case for more federal aid could be undermined unless the delegation's members begin to speak in one voice.
As New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, recently put it: "We're not going to pass anything unless we are all united. That means Democrats and Republicans. That means House and Senate."
The back-and-forth -- kept largely behind the scenes -- has been intense, with New York lawmakers on different, if not competing, tracks. Not only do they seem divided over who is doing the talking for the delegation, they are butting heads over what strategy to use to squeeze money out of Washington.
Perhaps most important, leading New York lawmakers are at odds over whether to take the White House to task publicly for not delivering the entire $20 billion that President Bush promised to give New York in the days following the attack.
The Bush administration has sought to disperse the aid piecemeal, saying that New York would get the money as it was needed. But that has caused a split in the delegation over whether the administration and its Republican allies in Congress can be trusted to keep their word without public pressure.
"There's no question that you have two voices coming out of the delegation," said an aide to one Congressional member from New York. "It's really two different camps."
One includes Mr. Schumer and the state's junior senator, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who have seemed reluctant to antagonize the White House, and have offered words of encouragement for the administration. This side contends that positive reinforcement, not criticism, will do more to move the administration in New York's direction.
This group also argues that it makes no sense to bicker with the White House over money, particularly when New York has so many other things it will need from Washington, like an economic-stimulus package to revive Lower Manhattan.
"You don't want to waste time fighting over the $20 billion when you could move on to other things," explained a Congressional aide from New York. "Why make that an issue?"
But another camp feels that conciliation is the wrong approach. This group is made up of House Democrats from New York who seem skeptical of any promises that Republicans make these days, particularly since conservatives on the Hill seem to be looking for any reason to deny aid to New York.
They say that the White House and Congress should be forced to deliver the money now, before Congress adjourns. Their main concern is that the state's needs will be eclipsed by other pressing matters, like the war in Afghanistan.
Representative Gary L. Ackerman, a Democrat from Queens, recently offered the best summation of the position. "Anybody who knows anything about Washington knows this: that when you get a commitment that you got the money, it doesn't mean that you got the money. You got the money when you get the money. Otherwise, you don't got the money."
The differences between the camps spilled into the open at the Capitol Hill meeting that Mrs. Lowey and other members of New York's delegation attended. Billed by some as a show of unity, it became so unruly -- with lawmakers talking over one another -- that several aides expressed dismay.
"What a disaster," one aide said. "It was ridiculous."
The fray grew so raucous that Mrs. Clinton stepped in.
"Can I just read the law?" she said, somewhat pedantically.
Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton tried to maintain a positive tone, saying that there was no reason to doubt the White House pledge. "I don't think there's an issue of whether we get $20 billion," Mr. Schumer said. Mrs. Clinton chimed in, "Absolutely! Absolutely!"
But that view met with skepticism, during and after the meeting.
"You've got happy talk from the senators," said an aide to a New York City House member. "On the House side, we're much more realistic that if we don't get this money now, it will become a tougher sell later. If we keep being forced to come back for small amounts of money every time we need it, we'll eventually be told no by the Republican leadership."
"We don't have the benefit of working in a Democratic body that tends to be friendly to New York," the aide continued. "That's the bottom line."

HEADLINE: Too Tall? Not at All, Tenants Say; 
Mass Exodus Is Absent at Skyscrapers as Anxiety Drops

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
New Yorkers have long been willing to pay a stiff premium to live and work in tall buildings that provide panoramic views of New York Harbor, Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge or the thicket of Midtown skyscrapers.
 The higher the better. 
 But that spirit has been severely tested over the last seven weeks. Many commercial and residential tenants who prized their lofty perches in the city's skyscrapers before the attack on the 110-story World Trade Center reconsidered their choices after the disaster. 
But now, tenants and real estate brokers said, the anxiety levels have begun to subside.
Business executives say that while some clients are afraid to visit their offices, there has been no mass exodus from skyscrapers like the Empire State Building, which has regained its status as New York's tallest tower. Only 4 of the 880 tenants have left the 102-story tower since Sept. 11, according to the building's manager, Helmsley-Spear, while 4 new tenants signed leases and 8 others renewed. 
Commercial tenants at the 58-story Met Life Building on Park Avenue at 44th Street, where evacuations of the adjacent Grand Central Terminal put many on edge in September, say life is getting back to normal.
And condominium sales in the city's tall towers are picking up.
"At the end of the day, people come to New York for the views," said Stephen M. Ross, chairman of Related Companies. "People are always going to live and work in tall buildings in New York."
Mr. Ross and his partner, Apollo Real Estate Advisors, are developing luxury condominiums in what sales brochures describe as "two 80-story crystalline towers," which are part of the huge AOL Time Warner complex under construction at Columbus Circle. 
Fourteen people signed $60 million worth of contracts after Sept. 11, accounting for nearly half of the 33 condominiums sold since sales began in August, according to Susan de Franca, a senior vice president at Related. The company is awaiting signatures on tentative contracts for another 22 apartments worth a total of $153 million, she said.
Because buyers have to put down 10 percent of the sale price upon signing a contract, Mr. Ross said he saw the sales as a vote of confidence in the future of New York and the cachet of tall buildings.
Louise M. Sunshine, the marketing agent for the condominiums, said: "The view becomes an important part of why people pay these prices. They're not thinking about terrorists. They don't want to live on the second or third floor."
To emphasize that point, the sales office for the project is on the 53rd floor of the nearby Carnegie Hall Tower, whose glass walls offer views of Midtown, Central Park and much of Westchester County. 
The views from the condominiums in the new Columbus Circle towers come with a hefty price tag. The price of the five full-floor penthouses atop each tower start at $25 million and jump by $1 million per floor.
"The height of the building was very attractive, and the view that encompassed not only the park but the city," said a New York doctor who spoke on condition that he not be identified. 
On Sept. 13, he put down a deposit on a condominium above the 60th floor that cost more than $5 million. "My only concern about the attack was, oh gosh, what's going to happen to real estate values?" he said.
Ms. Sunshine said she expected sales to reach $300 million by the end of the year, about $100 million less than she had anticipated last August. The attack on the trade center, she said, has many New Yorkers putting off major decisions. About half the buyers in the last seven weeks have been foreigners, she said. 
Donald J. Trump said the attack had not affected condominium sales at Trump World Tower, the glass skyscraper on First Avenue that looms over the United Nations and the surrounding neighborhood. 
"We've had absolutely no repercussions," Mr. Trump said.
The developer had marketed the building, which rises 861 feet above the street, as the tallest residential tower in the world. But in a sign of the times, the developer has abandoned his characteristic use of superlatives, at least for the moment. "It's not the tallest building," Mr. Trump said. "It's 72 stories tall."
In an inflationary flourish that has become common among developers who charge a premium for views, Mr. Trump used to promote the building as a 90-story tower. At Columbus Circle, the towers will rise a lofty 750 feet above the street, or 53 floors. But by the developers' numbering system, the top floor in each tower will be the 80th.
With residential developers once again extolling the virtues of tall towers, commercial landlords say that normalcy is returning to the market.
But Jonathan Marks, a lawyer whose corner office is on the 79th floor of the Empire State Building, is not so sure the stratospheric views are worth it anymore, not since the attack on the World Trade Center left him wondering whether his landmark building might be the next target.
"People in this building are definitely nervous," Mr. Marks said. "There are two lawyers here who are scared to death to come to work."
Three floors down, Richard Aryeh, president of Lionheart Enterprises, a real estate company, said that two of his six employees had quit after Sept. 11 out of fear.
"It's such a good building," Mr. Aryeh said, "but at the same time there's such an uncomfortable feeling here."
Many commercial tenants in trophy towers had talked about decentralizing their operations immediately after the terrorist attack. Steven Ross, chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, one of the city's largest landlords, was only half kidding when, six days after the attack, he told three dozen of the city's top brokers and developers of a weird "inversion" of the market: space on the second floor is suddenly more valuable than space on the 60th.
John P. Maher, senior vice president at C B Richard Ellis, a broker, said that corporate tenants became more comfortable in the intervening weeks.
"Or course," he added, "if we keep having events like Sept. 11, who knows what's going to happen?"
The events at the trade center did not deter Marsh & McLennan, the insurance company that had eight floors near the top of the World Trade Center, from leasing the top floors in the 45-story office tower at 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street.
Jack Brod, president of the Empire Diamond Corporation and a tenant in the Empire State Building for 70 years, said he had no second thoughts. He said he was in the building in 1945 when a twin-engine B-25 crashed into the 78th and 79th floors of the building, and that did not faze him.
He said some customers had been nervous about coming up to his 76th-floor office. Two weeks ago, a woman drove into Manhattan from Long Island and asked his manager, Gregory Merdemian, to bring two $75,000, 8.5-carat diamond rings down to her Lexus on Fifth Avenue. He did so. She was afraid to go inside. Mr. Brod is not.
"I'm not nervous," he said. "It doesn't bother me a bit."
Nathan Dershowitz says he is still weighing whether to move his small law firm off the 79th floor of the Empire State Building. He said employees had been plagued by anxiety and the inconvenience of new security measures at the building.
"There is a level of anxiety that interferes with the staff's efficiency," he said. "But I very much want to stay."
But there are some tenants downtown who can no longer bear the views, no matter what floor they are on.
Joelle Tutela had loved living in a high-rise at Battery Park City for the last four years. But her apartment window on the 22nd floor of Gateway Tower now offers a bird's-eye view of the smoking ruins of the World Trade Center.
"It was a constant reminder of how devastating the event was," said Ms. Tutela, a high school history teacher. "You can't roam around freely anymore."
So after enduring security checks, acrid air and a lengthier trip to work in New Jersey, Ms. Tutela made what she described as a traumatic decision to move to the 19th floor of a building on First Avenue at 39th Street.

HEADLINE: Half a Commander in Chief 

 BODY:
America seems to be governed by two presidents. The George W. Bush who is commander in chief has been keeping the country united at a time when the war in Afghanistan has run into problems. But the George W. Bush running domestic policy is an entirely different person, less a leader than a narrowly focused politician. If America is to fight terrorism within its own borders and conquer the economic recession, the commander in chief is going to have to take control at home, too.
 Americans trust President Bush's leadership on foreign policy because his direction has been fair and nonpartisan, rising far above the ideology on which he campaigned. He has steered clear of political grandstanding, consulting Democrats as well as Republicans, and ignoring the hawks in his own party who have been demanding a wider war. On the home front, however, Mr. Bush acts as if he still cannot afford to alienate the right-wing leaders of the Republican Party and the big business and energy interests behind them. 
 Initially, Mr. Bush sent the appropriate signals to Congressional leaders to work together and produce legislation to rescue the economy, stiffen laws on terrorism and increase airport security. There was also a good initial response on Capitol Hill, where Democrats and Republicans cooperated to produce a criminal justice bill on terrorism. In the Senate, the two parties crafted a bipartisan approach on beefing up security at airports that included expanding the federal work force to handle the job. Then Mr. Bush abruptly backed an ideological approach pushed by House Republicans who could not stomach the idea of increasing the number of federal employees. The Republican bill squeaked through the House last week, prompting cheers of partisan joy at the White House.
It was sobering to see Mr. Bush throw himself into the lobbying for a victory that is important only to one wing of his own party, while undercutting Republicans who had worked in the Senate to fashion a bipartisan approach. The end result will be to delay, or endanger, the passage of any airport security bill, and to reduce Mr. Bush's credibility with Democrats as an objective mediator.
Even worse is the president's failure of leadership on economic stimulus. While urging Congress to work fast, Mr. Bush has guaranteed a legislative impasse by backing a bill that does nothing to help the immediate economy and gives out all but a fraction of its benefits to corporations, especially in the energy field, and to the wealthiest taxpayers. 
The next issue requiring Mr. Bush's leadership relates to public spending. Of the $40 billion set aside after the terrorist attacks of September, only $7.7 billion is to be spent on homeland defenses, including airports, bioterrorism protections and improved safety. It is becoming increasingly obvious that this money will not be enough. A crash effort has to begin now to secure all transportation links, not simply airports, and to upgrade security of the nation's water supplies, food and nuclear facilities. There also needs to be a serious look at giving Tom Ridge's Office of Homeland Security real budgetary and operational authority over the functions now scattered in dozens of agencies.
When Democrats argue that money for these items should be attached to spending bills going through Congress now, the Bush administration wants to wait until next year, apparently because it feels the nation cannot afford the additional costs. But if that is the case, how can we afford multibillion-dollar tax cuts for corporations and the highest earners in the country? The nation needs its commander in chief to step in, and set priorities that meet the urgent current needs rather than one party's election promises.

HEADLINE: H.I.V. Practices Face Grim Financial Times 

BYLINE:  By DAVID TULLER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Let's say you're a primary care physician with a large number of H.I.V.-infected patients. Until a few years ago, almost all your patients died; now, with new medications, many are doing great, and you know you're making a difference. There's just one small problem: your practice is going bankrupt.
 What do you do? If you're Dr. Jeff Goodgame, you fret about your patients, meet with financial advisers and wrestle with your conscience. Then you close up shop and accept a job as a manager in the research department at a drug company. 
 "I loved the private practice, but I could see the handwriting on the wall," said Dr. Goodgame, who left his Miami practice two years ago and moved to New York to join Pfizer, the maker of Viagra and Prozac. "My accountants were telling me, 'Why are you doing this? Why are you beating yourself to death?' "
Even as new drug combinations have helped H.I.V.-infected people live longer, a growing number of the doctors treating them are struggling to keep their practices afloat. In San Francisco, some physicians with large H.I.V. practices estimate that their annual incomes have dropped to the $70,000 to $90,000 range, from $110,000 to $120,000 five years ago, even though many work more than 60 hours a week. 
And in the past few years, said Dr. Stephen Becker, one of San Francisco's leading AIDS doctors, economics has played a role in persuading about half a dozen of the city's 25 or so private practitioners specializing in H.I.V. to close their offices. "That's a large number of doctors leaving private practice in this fairly small city," he said.
Not surprisingly, Dr. Becker and others blame managed care, particularly health maintenance organizations, for the problem. Many H.M.O.'s pay primary care physicians like Dr. Becker the same flat monthly fee, called a capitation rate, for every patient, healthy or sick, in a practice. When someone with a major illness is referred to a specialist like a cardiologist, the specialist is reimbursed at a much higher rate.
But many H.I.V. patients receive almost all their treatment from their primary care physicians. And that means their doctors receive the same low rates -- sometimes as little as $5 a month -- for an H.I.V. patient who has an appointment every six weeks as for someone with the occasional cold.
As a result, many doctors turn away new H.I.V.-infected patients, or at least those covered by H.M.O.'s. "It's getting harder and harder to refer people to doctors who will accept them," said Tim Teeter, of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation.
Even as managed care has taken hold, the advent of protease inhibitors and other drugs has made H.I.V. treatment more expensive and complicated. Current care requires frequent lab tests and regular monitoring of elaborate drug regimens. Monthly per-patient costs in services and lab work can easily tally several hundred dollars to more than a thousand. In some plans the lab costs come out of the doctor's monthly payments, making it harder for doctors with many H.I.V. patients to earn a living.
"The medical management of these patients has become increasingly complex, so physicians are unable to see as many patients," said Julia Hidalgo, president of Positive Outcomes, a consulting firm in Annapolis, Md., which specializes in the financial aspects of H.I.V. "And if the rates do not increase to address the level of complexity and frequency of visits, clinicians are not going to be able to break even."
Dr. Howard Grossman, a New York primary care physician, says his H.I.V. patients make up about 40 percent of his practice but take up 90 percent of his time. He is trying to avoid what he wryly calls "going over to the dark side" -- joining a pharmaceutical or managed care company. But he has not given himself a raise in 10 years, he said, and he was recently forced to reduce his nurse practitioner's hours to half time.
With so many patients taking dozens of pills a day, Dr. Grossman often spends his evening hours writing and faxing prescriptions. He calls all his patients back to discuss their lab results, which can take 10 or 15 minutes per conversation. "I'd like to see lawyers not get compensated for their phone calls to clients," he said.
One way to address the problem, say some physicians, is for the medical profession to formally recognize a specialty in H.I.V. medicine, which could put pressure on insurers to provide higher reimbursement. Although two groups of AIDS doctors have been working on establishing criteria for defining an H.I.V. expert, gaining official acceptance of a new medical specialty is an extremely cumbersome process, and there is no indication that it will happen any time soon.
Health insurers say that they are not generally aware of the problem and that, in any event, it is up to doctors to negotiate the best rates for themselves with insurance plans. But some industry representatives acknowledge that the system works best when primary care doctors have a wide range of patients, not when they have a disproportionate number of sick ones.
"The system was created knowing that the practices being capitated would have a spectrum of patients," said Bobby Pena, a spokesman for the California Association of Health Plans. "It does make for an interesting dilemma if you have doctors who call themselves primary care but are taking a large percentage of specialty patients. I don't know that anybody has come up with the best answer for that."
