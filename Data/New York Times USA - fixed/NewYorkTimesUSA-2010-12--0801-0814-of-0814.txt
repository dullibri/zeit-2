HEADLINE: Nonprofit Says City Took Revenge for Airing Views

BYLINE: By JOHN UPTON. 
jupton@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Saul Bloom is preparing to pack up roomfuls of overstuffed binders in the offices of the small nonprofit environmental organization that he helped form almost 30 years ago. Arc Ecology, whose headquarters in a faded white storefront are protected by metal bars in the Bayview neighborhood's crime-ridden Third Street commercial district, must move to a more affordable location after losing a key contract with the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency.
The loss in September of the contract -- which never exceeded several hundred thousand dollars a year -- comes after Arc's opposition to key elements of the sprawling Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard redevelopment plan that was passed by the Board of Supervisors in August.
Over the last eight years, Arc has analyzed the health and environmental impacts of the project. It has also taken some strong advocacy positions, opposing the plan's transfer and subsequent development of state-owned parkland and the construction of a bridge over sensitive wetlands. 
Documents obtained by The Bay Citizen raise questions about the assessment process that led to another group's being awarded the environmental information services contract, and which also highlight the influential role that Mayor Gavin Newsom's administration played in rejecting Arc Ecology's bid.
On Dec. 6, Arc Ecology filed a federal lawsuit against the city's redevelopment agency, stating that its advocacy work relating to the shipyard project was separate from its contract, and that its free-speech rights had been violated. The case could help determine the extent to which city officials can require contractors to fall in line with city policies.
''Arc had a First Amendment right to speak on matters of public concern whether they were outside the scope of the contract, as we allege, or even if they were within the scope of the contract because they were brought on to be independent,'' said Geoffrey King, Arc's lawyer.
The city said Arc Ecology's complaints are nothing more than ''sour grapes.''
Arc Ecology's job under a contract it held with different government agencies for almost a decade was to examine the local impact of the proposed shipyard redevelopment on the surrounding Bayview and Hunters Point neighborhoods, which were plunged into poverty when the Naval base closed in the 1970s.
In particular, Arc Ecology was charged with researching and explaining how the housing project of more than 10,000 units would affect traffic, noise, air-quality, affordable housing, educational opportunities and open space in the surrounding communities.
Arc Ecology's approach has fueled debate and controversy over the years about smart growth, pollution cleanup and environmental justice issues related to the 702-acre waterfront redevelopment project.
When the contract came up for renewal this fall, the Redevelopment Commission, whose members are appointed by the mayor, voted 4-0 to take the contract away from Arc Ecology and award it to CirclePoint, a national environmental planning and public relations firm headquartered in downtown San Francisco that had received a slightly better assessment from the five-person panel that evaluated the bids. CirclePoint specializes in managing public affairs for troubled government projects.
But the selection of CirclePoint over Arc Ecology went against the advice of the Redevelopment Agency's executive director and senior staff, who are employed by the state of California. The staff recommended renewing the nonprofit's contract, noting its extensive experience and expressing ''serious concerns'' about CirclePoint's ability to understand and explain pending shipyard land transfers.
The documents obtained by The Bay Citizen show that four of the five panelists appointed by the Redevelopment Agency rated Arc Ecology's proposal more favorably than CirclePoint's. Members of the panel represent local agencies and a citizen advisory committee.
Andrea Bruss, the panelist drawn from Mr. Newsom's economic development office, however, rated CirclePoint as the winner. Ms. Bruss gave Arc Ecology's bid a low enough score to tip the average scores slightly in CirclePoint's favor.
Tony Winnicker, the mayor's spokesman, said the low score given by Ms. Bruss (54 out of 100 compared to between 87 and 89 by the other members of the panel) was based on her opinion. He disputed claims by Mr. Bloom and his lawyers that the process was rigged in retribution for its vocal negative positions against the shipyard project. Ms. Bruss declined to comment.
The loser complained ''about the rules and the process after the fact because it didn't turn out the way they wanted,'' Mr. Winnicker said.
Mr. Bloom said that his group does not ''believe that the shipyard is being developed for the benefit of the community that surrounds it and that was the original purpose of the project.'' Arc Ecology has characterized the shipyard redevelopment plans as non-sustainable suburban development that will further damage and displace the communities that Arc aims to serve.
Rick Swig, the Redevelopment Commission president, complained during a September hearing that Arc Ecology had taken inappropriate advocacy positions in its work.
''As a consultant, I have my feelings and sometimes I don't agree with all my customers,'' Mr. Swig said during the hearing. ''But I don't bite the hand that feeds me. It's not a good policy.''
Mr. Swig said his vote on the contract was based purely on the number of points awarded to each of the competing firms by the panel, which scored CirclePoint over Arc Ecology by 0.2 points.
''Somebody has to lose,'' Mr. Swig said in an interview. ''We work really hard at keeping that playing field flat.''
Mr. Bloom co-founded Arc Ecology in 1983, when he was 30, after growing frustrated with the work of his employer, Greenpeace, which he said ignored race- and class-based environmental justice. Arc's initial agenda was ending the Cold War and stemming nuclear weapons proliferation, and its activities included protests that led to arrests at a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory testing facility near Tracy.
But the group has long since moved into science-based environmental assessment and outreach, with a focus on minority communities.
''As we moved along and the Cold War began to end we began to really ramp up our science end of things,'' said Mr. Bloom, 57, sitting behind a tidy desk in a sparse office decorated with pictures of past protests and Albert Einstein. ''We began to focus on providing technical support to communities.''
With the words ''Community Window on the Shipyard Cleanup'' emblazoned across its building's facade, Mr. Bloom said there is no contradiction between his group's advocacy work and its technical analysis and outreach regarding the shipyard project's environmental impact.
In the group's lawsuit, which seeks the return of its contract and alleges retribution by the Redevelopment Agency, the group said that its advocacy is private speech. CirclePoint's plans to begin work for the Redevelopment Agency are on hold.
As Arc Ecology prepares to move to a smaller office space on Evans Street, Mr. Bloom said the group would continue to be involved in advocacy work. It is planning wetlands for the shipyard under an unrelated contract it holds with San Francisco International Airport, to help the city agency offset some of its impact on San Francisco Bay.
''We're trying to be honest news brokers,'' Mr. Bloom said. ''We just tell the facts.''

HEADLINE: REUTERS BREAKINGVIEWS; America Awaits A Ripple Effect

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN

 BODY:
What does the American economy need to get back on its feet? What would help tremendously is fewer roommates.
As an investment theme, ''household formation'' may sound like jargon. In fact, it is a crucial factor in how the economy will perform in the coming year. The measure basically calculates how many healthy cells there are in the American real estate body. When foreigners move in and buy houses, or the children move out and into apartments, the number of households increases. That, in turn, creates an economic ripple effect.
A small rise in household formation has a beneficial effect on large sectors of the economy, and with it on earnings and the stock market more broadly. Sales of new homes and the materials needed to build or refurbish them increase. Homeowners buy General Electric appliances, plasma TVs from Best Buy and Sherwin-Williams paint. Cable operators like Comcast sign up new customers, and utilities turn on more lights. Allstate writes additional homeowner policies. 
The trouble is, despite robust demographic numbers, the figure has been growing sluggishly of late. The government estimates that fewer than 400,000 households were formed in each of the last two years ending in March. The average should be around 1.4 million annually, based on precrisis behavior.
Indeed, it's a big reason for the continued overcapacity in the housing market. Fewer than 800,000 new housing units were built in 2009, and the number should be roughly the same this year. That's the slowest pace by far in four decades. The glut should largely be history given such a glacial pace of construction. Yet rental and homeowner vacancies remain at elevated levels.
So why is household formation down? Difficult economic times have forced people to save money -- and the biggest cost to cut is habitation. People are more likely to shack up and share apartments, while homeowners add renters to help with the mortgage. The footprints in the data are easily spotted. The percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds living at home is at a three-decade high, according to the Census Bureau. Even divorce rates are down. Arguing, it seems, is cheaper than two mortgages.
Hard times also mean America isn't as attractive a destination for job seekers. The number of legal immigrants fell in 2009. Moreover, illegal immigration appears to have fallen sharply, based on border interdictions.
Some of these changes should unwind over time. Checking accounts fill, mortgages amortize and 30-somethings realize how hard it is to meet mates when living at home. Eventually, people strike out or decide having a tenant isn't worth the trouble.
Moreover, real estate prices have fallen by about a third from their peak in most cities, according to the Case-Shiller index. This makes it easier to afford rent or a down payment. Rental vacancies peaked last fall, and home vacancies in late 2008.
Yet higher rates of employment and more certainty over jobs would be a greater spur as they are strongly linked to household formation. People are reluctant to move out or buy a home if they aren't working, or think mass firings are imminent.
And therein lays the chicken-and-egg problem. Construction is typically one of the first sectors to recover from a recession. The continuing property glut means employment is about two million below its 2006 peak, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since it hasn't revived, America is attracting fewer immigrants and people aren't forming households.
Of course, some social and economic changes can be persistent. Japan has yet to recover from its real estate bust. But if demographics are destiny, then America should have a different one. In Japan, the number of people in their 20s -- the prime years for forming a home -- has fallen sharply and continues to shrink. There's a bulge of Americans in this age group.
So household formation will rise; it just may take a while. When people do feel a bit more comfortable with their debt levels and jobs, it should provide an immediate stimulus to consumption. And the effect will feed on itself. Immigrants will arrive, and more people will move out. For investors, the sooner the number of roommates decreases, the better. ROBERT CYRAN

HEADLINE: Solving the States' Deficit Problems

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Dec. 26 editorial ''The Looming Crisis in the States'' recognizes the breadth of the calamity of accumulating deficits afflicting many states as they struggle to balance their budgets and deal with staggering long-term pension obligations for public employees.
The editorial asserts that many states have cut spending significantly, and suggests that federal stimulus funds continue to be provided and that higher taxes be imposed on those who can afford it. 
Giving states additional tens of billions of dollars in federal money would serve to reward those which have acted with the greatest profligacy, irresponsibility and contempt for their citizens, and it would send the wrong message.
My liberal, big-government state of Pennsylvania is among the greatest offenders, having lived high on the hog when it was possible to do so.
The enactment and expansion of social spending programs have brought us to annual multibillion-dollar deficits, and the provision of spectacular pensions for public employees, public school teachers and state legislators has brought about woefully underfunded public pension funds.
Continuing these policies will not only bring the nation closer to the day of fiscal Armageddon but also make clear that the repugnant bailout era is just beginning.
Oren M. Spiegler Upper St. Clair, Pa., Dec. 26, 2010
To the Editor:
Your editorial's reference to unfunded state and local pension liabilities of $3.5 trillion, as if that amount is a simple matter of undisputed fact, exemplifies the adage that something repeated often enough eventually will be perceived as truthful.
Projecting the value of future pension liabilities is an inexact science, and how these liabilities should be calculated is the subject of spirited debate. The figure cited in your editorial lies at a far end of the spectrum, derived largely by assuming that current interest rates will remain low forever.
This method has been rejected by the Government Accounting Standards Board, the body tasked with determining how such calculations should be made. You owe your readers at least a qualification when citing such figures, which are intended more to alarm and mislead than to enlighten and inform.
Keith Brainard Research Director, National Association of State Retirement Administrators Georgetown, Tex., Dec. 28, 2010
To the Editor:
Your editorial points a finger at New Jersey's governor, Chris Christie, because he is targeting state and municipal union workers for givebacks. While it is clear that taxpayers have an obligation to pay for existing pension obligations, it is equally clear that responsible public officials have an obligation to make sure that future pension commitments are sustainable and fair to all parties concerned.
Retiring at 50, based on the last three years of padded overtime, has to go; taxpayers will rightly reject their responsibilities to future pensioners if something is not done to correct these excesses. Governor Christie seems focused on the rights of taxpayers, and this is how it should be.
James Stanley Naples, Fla., Dec. 26, 2010
To the Editor:
On the very week the census told us that over the past decade there was a mass migration of Americans out of high-tax states and into low-tax ones, you call for an increase in state taxation. The people you want to tax can and do vote with their feet, rendering higher taxation a far from optimal solution.
Nevertheless I will grant you that taxation should not be off the table when dealing with the fiscal crisis that is enveloping most of the states.
But unless the bottomless pit of public employee pension and post-retirement health benefits is dealt with, no amount of higher taxation will be able to solve the problem.
David Shulman Berkeley Heights, N.J., Dec. 26, 2010
To the Editor:
Your editorial wisely counsels tax increases and spending cuts. But what taxes to increase?
After living through the bust of the housing bubble, I would recommend a tax increase on land values at the state and local level. For decades landowners have enjoyed an unearned windfall as land values escalated largely through public investment in roads, utilities, schools and so forth.
To raise some revenue for public purposes and help forestall a new bubble, a large tax increase on land values makes sense.
Alan Magan Clarksville, Md., Dec. 26, 2010
To the Editor:
Re ''States Look for Winning Formulas to Spur Lottery Sales'' (news article, Dec. 24): I find it outrageous that, at a time when states refuse to raise taxes on those who can most afford them, state lottery systems are trying to expand sales.
While states clearly need to increase revenues, lotteries are, in effect, a tax on those families that can least afford it. Study after study has shown that lottery tickets are disproportionately bought by lower-income people, and that the funds raised are treated as general revenue, regardless of the usual promises that they are used to support education.
Apparently it's politically acceptable to tax working and poor families that are desperate for a big win, but not to tax those who have already won big through other lotteries like being born rich or gambling on the stock market.
Brent Kramer Brooklyn, Dec. 25, 2010
The writer is an economist who has published a study on the distribution of lottery purchases in New York City.

HEADLINE: Weak-Kneed Willpower Faces Temptation's Lure

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
WE HAVE MET THE ENEMY
Self-Control in an Age of Excess
By Daniel Akst
303 pages. The Penguin Press. $26.95.
If you want a little insurance to help keep those New Year's resolutions, you might consider turning to StickK.com. Started by two Yale professors and a graduate student in 2008, the Web site provides a binding contract to help you meet a particular goal, whether it is shedding pounds, quitting smoking or finishing Proust. Fail to live up to your end of the deal, and you have to pay a person or charity that you have designated in advance. You can even increase the incentive by choosing an anti-charity, a cause that you would normally oppose. Gun-control advocates, for example, could decide to forfeit their money to the National Rifle Association if they falter, while anti-abortion advocates might choose NARAL Pro-Choice America.
The site is a way of reinforcing a quality most of us seem to have a desperate shortage of these days: self-control. 
The growing epidemic of obesity, the reckless debt that contributed to the financial crisis, the proliferation of so-called addictions to everyday activities from shopping to video games to sex are all evidence of how a technologically advanced capitalist democracy makes temptation easier, cheaper and faster to indulge than most Americans seem equipped to manage sensibly.
Daniel Akst, an author and journalist who has frequently contributed to The New York Times, tries to get a handle on this modern dilemma in ''We Have Met the Enemy: Self-Control in an Age of Excess.'' Mr. Akst's stated goal is to reclaim ''most excessive behaviors from the realm of disease.''
''A lot of the behavior we call addiction is really a love of pleasure that carries the force of habit,'' he notes. The addiction label serves to absolve us of blame and therefore responsibility for our actions. ''If we hold ourselves responsible for our behavior -- none of which is entirely voluntary -- we are more likely to consciously direct our actions rather than succumbing to impulse.''
That worthy aim, however, is frequently lost in a warehouse of anecdotes, quotations, digressions and references that are piled up but not analyzed in much depth.
Mr. Akst starts off by distinguishing between two kinds of desire. ''First-order desires,'' he writes, beset us without any conscious longer-term evaluation, while second-order desires are those we actively choose for ourselves. We may have a first-order desire for an artery-clogging Cinnabon even if we have a second- order desire to stay trim and fit. Enabling your second-order desires to dominate is not about joylessly killing indulgence, Mr. Akst argues, but rather a way to act in concert with ''your highest level of reflection'' -- your best self.
Efforts to match our actions with our best intentions are continually sabotaged by a loosening of social and religious constraints as well as a culture that encourages and prizes individual self-fulfillment. At the same time we are at the mercy of our own biology. Researchers are discovering how genes, hormones and brain structure affect our ability to control impulses. A couple of studies have shown, for instance, that in murderers the brain's command center -- the prefrontal cortex -- is smaller or has less neurological activity than in the average person. How fair is it to penalize someone for something over which he has no control?
As it turns out, the degree of self-control is linked to a wide range of factors including education, income level, age, family structure and intelligence. Mr. Akst's attempt to touch on the whole web of influences on human behavior, however, leads him frequently to veer off the central subject of self-control and flit from one marginally related topic to another. In one sentence he refers to the role mobs play in lynchings and in the very next he is discussing how ovulating women tend to wear more makeup and jewelry at a singles bar.
The result is a laundry basket of a book that includes studies on happiness, a disquisition on the virtues and drawbacks of laissez-faire governance versus the welfare state, and the preference of the rich and powerful for masochism over sadism.
Mr. Akst's prose has its own pitfalls. The book reads as if he wrote it with a collection of quotations in his lap. After a while you feel as if you are stuck sitting next to a shameless name dropper on a long transcontinental flight on which the ''fasten seat belt'' sign stays on. Nor is his analysis helped by a cloyingly informal tone that refers to advocates of reason as ''a bunch of old farts,'' or asks ''just what the heck we mean by'' self-control.
In the end Mr. Akst makes the case for taking responsibility despite the forces that may conspire against free will. At the very least, he points out, we have what the neurophysiologist Benjamin Libet labeled ''free won't,'' the ability to exercise veto power, particularly in response to incentives.
The best way to force people to look beyond short-term rewards is through what Mr. Akst calls ''precommitment.'' Referencing the work of the economists Cass R. Sunstein and Richard H. Thaler, Mr. Akst argues for greater use of voluntary and involuntary incentives and constraints, from being compelled to contribute to Social Security so that we'll be forced to save for retirement to binding ourselves on StickK.com.
Odysseus understood how weak willpower actually is when he asked his crew to bind him to the mast while sailing by the seductive Sirens. What we could all use today is a little more practice tying knots.

HEADLINE: STOCKS & BONDS; Shares Slip Back From 2-Year Highs

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks declined on Thursday despite reports showing a drop in jobless claims, the fastest business expansion in two decades and a gain in pending home sales.
American Express, DuPont and Pfizer had the biggest declines in the Dow Jones industrial average as it slipped from two-year highs. Anadarko Petroleum rallied 6.9 percent after The Daily Mail newspaper reported that BHP Billiton might make a $90-a-share bid for the oil and natural gas producer.
D.R. Horton led gains in home builders after pending sales rose more than expected. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.2 percent, also from a two-year high, to 1,257.88. The index has risen 13 percent this year and 6.6 percent this month, the most for December since 1991. The Dow slipped 15.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 11,569.71.
''We've had a heck of a month for stocks,'' said Walter B. Todd, who helps manage about $900 million at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood, S.C. ''It's no surprise to see investors taking a bit of a pause after a big run-up. However, the positive catalysts are still in place and that bodes well for a very decent 2011. Today's jobless claims figures were a real big positive.''
The S.& P. 500 advanced 23 percent from its July low through Wednesday as companies reported better-than-estimated earnings and as the Federal Reserve pledged to buy up to $600 billion in Treasuries to stimulate the economy. Its rally to a two-year high pushed its valuation to 15.7 times reported profits, the highest since June.
The index's 86 percent increase from a 12-year low on March 9, 2009, is the biggest for a comparable time period since 1955, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.& P.
The Labor Department said first-time filings for unemployment insurance decreased by 34,000 to 388,000 in the week ended Dec. 25, compared with the median forecast of 415,000 in a Bloomberg News survey.
Separately, the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago's gauge of business conditions expanded in December at the fastest rate in two decades. The group's business barometer rose to 68.6, exceeding the most optimistic forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the highest level since July 1988. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.
Emerging-market stocks rallied after a report showed that China's manufacturing was growing, signaling more demand for industrial metals. An index of China's manufacturing was 54.4 this month, compared with 55.3 in November, according to the purchasing managers' index released by HSBC Holdings and Markit Economics. A figure over 50 signals expansion.
Copper climbed to a record in London and New York, and nickel and zinc gained.
''Growth in the rest of the world -- not so much Europe -- has been very good for U.S. companies,'' said Albert Meyer, president of Bastiat Capital in Plano, Tex. ''The recent run-up perhaps anticipated some really good news.''
American Express fell 0.8 percent to $42.51. DuPont, the chemical maker, dropped 0.7 percent to $49.69. Pfizer, the world's biggest drug maker, declined 0.6 percent to $17.49.
Anadarko Petroleum climbed $4.86 to $75.59. BHP Billiton may make a $90-a-share bid for the company, The Daily Mail reported, without saying where it got the information. Ruban Yogarajah, a London-based spokesman for BHP, declined to comment on the report.
D.R. Horton, the home builder, rose 0.8 percent to $12.01. An index of pending home resales compiled by the National Association of retailers rose 3.5 percent in November after a record 10 percent increase in October, a sign sales are recovering following a post-tax credit plunge. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 0.8 percent increase in November.
MBIA, the bond insurer, gained the most in more than two months, rallying 15 percent to $11.87 after a court development raised prospects it might resume guaranteeing city and state debt.
The MSCI World Index of 1,660 companies in 24 developed countries like the United States, Britain and Japan rose as high as 1,283.68 on Thursday. The gauge surpassed its closing level of 1,283.14 on Sept. 12, 2008, the last session before Lehman's collapse caused a 46 percent drop through March 2009.
The ''new economic leadership is reflected by emerging market stocks, which recovered to pre-Lehman levels much faster than have developed stock markets,'' said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. Economic activity in these regions did not slow or contract as deeply and has recovered much faster, he said.

HEADLINE: When 0.45% of Total Voters Can Translate to Victory

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Scott James writes a column for The Bay Citizen.
If the new San Francisco Board of Supervisors sworn in Jan. 8 is anything like its predecessor, there will be a time when an unpopular decision will have citizens asking, ''Who picked these people?''
The answer will be: hardly anyone. 
A record 8 of 11 supervisors on the new board have an interesting distinction: They were not the first choices of a majority of voters, but prevailed in the city's ranked-choice voting system.
They also come to power with some of the lowest votes per candidate in city history.
These outcomes are the result of a confluence of election changes enacted in the past decade that proponents said would encourage candidate diversity and garner higher turnout than the sleepy December runoff elections of the past.
But some of this November's winners received even fewer votes than before the system was changed. This has raised concern about public support for a board facing huge challenges, including a $380 million budget gap and the selection of a new mayor. Now some newly elected supervisors are out courting voters they failed to persuade at the polls.
Several factors -- including ranked-choice voting, which is an instant runoff system; the low turnout of 61 percent; and district elections with many candidates -- mean that, individually, supervisors received the support of a tiny fraction of overall residents compared with 1980 to 1998, when board members ran citywide.
How small? Several supervisors were the first choice of only 2 percent or less of the city's total voters.
Scott Weiner, the newly elected supervisor in District 8 (The Castro/Noe Valley) who received only 42 percent of first-choice votes but still won, is questioning the process, especially in districts with many candidates.
''It doesn't work well when you have 21'' on the ballot, Mr. Weiner said, as was the case in District 10 (The Bayview, Hunters Point), where Malia Cohen prevailed. Ms. Cohen, who by some accounts is the swing vote in selecting a new mayor, received 2,083 first-choice votes, narrowly placing third. But she won after receiving more second- and third-choice votes, although she was not selected at all on 79 percent of ballots cast in the district.
In 1998, before changes in election procedures started, supervisors needed 80,000 to 120,000 first-place votes to prevail. Ms. Cohen won with a hair over 2,000 first-place votes -- 0.45 percent of San Francisco's 466,414 registered voters.
Using the same math, other winners this year did not fare much better: Mark Farrell, 2 percent in District 2 (Pacific Heights, Marina); Jane Kim, 1.4 percent in District 6 (SoMa); and Mr. Weiner, 3.1 percent.
Walking through the Castro on a recent drizzly Saturday, Mr. Weiner talked about the difficulties the city faces. He noted the plethora of empty storefronts -- vacancies that have grown since the closing of election headquarters that had temporarily filled several spaces, with more emptiness ahead as holiday pop-up stores expire.
''Voters want us to focus on the basics of running the city,'' like the economy and public transit, he said.
Since winning in the instant runoff, Mr. Weiner has been meeting with those who preferred his opponents. ''I've been actively engaging those who did not support me,'' he said.
Ms. Cohen, a fourth-generation San Franciscan, has had similar meetings and said she planned to hold office hours in cafes and libraries ''to earn the support of those who did not support me.''
''Running for office is like dating,'' she said, ''and now we're married.''
Mr. Farrell in District 2 said that the election had raised questions about ranked-choice voting, but that ''the ones who ultimately prevailed are the ones who put out the most effort.'' Additional campaigning was crucial to obtain those key second-choice votes, he noted.
So does vote size really matter?
Bill Ambrunn, a former chief of staff for Supervisor Susan Leal who worked on several citywide campaigns in the 1990s, said that when supervisors received more than 100,000 votes, there was ''a certain gravitas to that.''
Today's comparatively small constituencies, Mr. Ambrunn said, could undermine the board. ''I don't see how this is going to help,'' he added.
Steven Hill, one of the main advocates of the election changes, said ''the system has worked pretty darn well,'' resulting in more minority officeholders and less reliance on the old political machine.
As for the low numbers that elected the victors, Mr. Hill said some past runoffs had such poor turnout that they also produced low-vote victories.
''There are pros and cons to every system,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Death of Jazz Club Underscores a Changing Scene

BYLINE: By REYHAN HARMANCI. 
rharmanci@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
As another holiday season under a stagnating economy draws to a close, it is hardly surprising that San Francisco would lose that rarely profitable of ventures, a jazz room.
But Coda, a bar, restaurant and club in the Mission District, did not seem like it was going under. In just a year and a half, it had established itself as one of the most interesting jazz-based schedules in the Bay Area. Acts like the Jazz Mafia tapped into a vibrant younger music scene, and salsa Sunday bookings and Latin jazz nights sold out. Stevie Wonder dropped by for a set; Liz Phair covered Velvet Underground songs.
Two weeks ago Bruce Hanson, the club's owner, shocked staff members and promoters with the news that Coda would close after a New Year's Eve blowout featuring Rayband and 8 Legged Monster. 
Mr. Hanson blamed poor economic timing, not the business model or the musical genre. ''Maybe if we opened today, we'd make it,'' he said.
Though Anna's Jazz Island in Berkeley and Pearl's in San Francisco both folded in recent years, jazz-booking cafes, cabarets and smaller barrooms persist.
And Yoshi's Jazz Club and Japanese Restaurant, with locations in San Francisco and Oakland, still attracts stars like Roy Hargrove, slated for January. Its schedule, though, is increasingly filled with less jazzy headliners like the Ohio Players and Public Enemy.
The booking strategy, said Jason Olaine, Yoshi's San Francisco Jazz Club artistic director who used to work in the Oakland location, ''is about survival.''
Yoshi's in San Francisco has also benefited from substantial public support -- the city gave it about $7 million in loans to open in the Fillmore District.
Coda's death brings home the lack of local booking possibilities for jazz musicians. ''I can only speak about my experience,'' said Marcus Shelby, a nationally known bass player and band leader who moved to the Bay Area around 15 years ago. ''But I used to have regular gigs -- two, three, four, five nights. I'm not playing nowhere in San Francisco these days.''
But others point to a vibrant local jazz scene populated by small places like Red Poppy Art House and Jazzschool in Berkeley that foster experimentation across genres like world music, hip hop and chamber music. Mr. Shelby, speaking from Japan, said he saw great music all the time -- just not in the smoky supper clubs of yore.
His income, like many jazz musicians', increasingly comes from commissions, grants and teaching.
''Schools now give young players a place to play and learn, rehearsal spaces, instruments, things that clubs used to provide,'' said David Ake, music professor at University of Nevada, Reno, and author of ''Jazz Matters.''
Mr. Ake cautioned that the movement toward jazz's being seen as ''America's classical music,'' came with costs -- less lively venues, more formal presentation -- as well as benefits.
The shift in financing and performance space is both profound and invisible.
''It's always been a hustle,'' said Sarah Wilson, a trumpeter and vocalist who recently played at Yoshi's for a record release. ''When I lived in New York, I remember when the Knitting Factory stopped booking jazz, and Tonic closed down.''
But Ms. Wilson said that a weekend workshop on grant-writing and business philosophy she attended changed her life. With four tracks on her last album financed by commissions, she said, she made more money over the past year than in all other years combined.
''Musicians need to be industrious,'' said Charith Premawardhana, founder of Classical Revolution, a group devoted to finding traditional and not-so-traditional locations for classical music, who has also played with Jazz Mafia.
''They have to create opportunities to perform, for themselves and their friends, '' Mr. Premawardhana said, noting that the group will be performing in January at a Haight nightclub, Milk, that just started hosting live music.
But there is a rung missing in the jazz ecosystem when small and medium-size clubs like Coda go out of business. ''San Francisco is too underground,'' said Adam Theis, Jazz Mafia's founder. ''If it's only the super hip who dig it out, it's hard for the scene to support itself.''
Mr. Shelby said, ''The musicians are already leaving,'' and added that political leadership needed to help live music clubs like Coda.
As Coda prepares for its final show, the future does bring hope. Preservation Hall, the famed New Orleans club and band, has announced plans to open on Valencia Street in 2011.
And SF Jazz, a nonprofit that programs 100 or so events a year, including the SF Jazz Festival, is slated to open its $60 million permanent home in the fall of 2012. It is no coincidence that the location is in Hayes Valley, spitting distance from other major music spots like the opera and the symphony.
In a nod to both jazz history and the current night-life options, though, Randall Kline, founder of SF Jazz, said there would be a street-level space, holding around 90 people in addition to a larger concert hall. ''It'll feel more like a club,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Gas Field Confirmed Off Coast Of Israel

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Exploratory drilling off Israel's northern coast this week has confirmed the existence of a major natural gas field -- one of the world's largest offshore gas finds of the past decade -- leading the country's infrastructure minister to call it ''the most important energy news since the founding of the state.''
Houston-based Noble Energy, which is working with several Israeli partner companies, said that the field, named Leviathan, whose existence was suspected months ago, has at least 16 trillion cubic feet of gas at a likely market value of tens of billions of dollars and should turn Israel into an energy exporter. 
''If it acts correctly, levelheadedly and responsibly, Israel can enjoy not only the benefit of using the gas, but it can also turn into a gas supplier in the Mediterranean region,'' the infrastructure minister, Uzi Landau, said in a statement. ''The large reserves of natural gas will enable Israel's citizens to enjoy the benefit of clean and inexpensive electricity, as well as the expected profits for the state.''
The find means that Israel, with a long history of dependence on foreign energy, and hostility and boycotts from many of the biggest energy powers, could find itself in a much more advantageous position in the coming decade.
But the find has been accompanied by a heated debate over how much in taxes and royalties Israel will charge. A state-appointed committee headed by an economist at Hebrew University, Eytan Sheshinski, is planning to recommend substantially increased profit taxes, opposed by the companies and some on the political right.
Gideon Tadmor, the chief executive of Delek Energy and Avner Oil Exploration, partners in this venture with Noble, said the taxes could make the project prohibitively expensive. ''The gas may stay in the ground because we will not succeed in obtaining from banks around the world the tens of billions of shekels for developing the reservoir,'' he said in an interview.
He said that this new find could impel neighboring countries, including Cyprus, Lebanon and Syria, to explore and possibly develop their potential gas fields, and warned that Israel needed to move quickly to be the first to export its gas. Delek estimates that if it moves aggressively, it could begin producing gas from Leviathan in five to six years.
This year, the United States Geological Surveyestimated that more than 120 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas reserves, equivalent to 20 billion barrels of oil, lay beneath the waters of the Eastern Mediterranean. That would put it in the same league as the Alaskan North Slope (about 22 billion barrels) but far short of Saudi Arabia, which has proven reserves of 262 billion barrels.
In reaction to the Israeli announcement, Lebanese politicians said they would move more quickly in exploring their country's gas potential.
Professor Sheshinski said that Israel had among the very lowest energy tax rates anywhere and that it was time to update that.
''We have proposed a profit tax to be imposed after the firms earn an adequate return on their investment,'' Professor Sheshinski said in an interview. ''We have checked with the banks and we will be well within world averages. Anyone who knows the numbers can be assured of a proper return.''
Professor Sheshinski said that his report, due out on Monday, had already been endorsed by the governor of the Bank of Israel, Stanley Fischer; the International Monetary Fund; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which Israel recently joined. He said that the profit tax rate recommended by his committee would be 55 to 60 percent and that the O.E.C.D. average was 62 percent.
The committee's recommendations require government and parliamentary approval.
Sever Plocker, an economic columnist for the newspaper Yediot Aharonot, said in a commentary on Thursday that it was far from clear that the new discovery could be developed profitably. Gas prices could fall, the techniques needed to extract the gas were likely to be complicated and expensive to develop, and exporting natural gas required enormous investment for pipelines or the means of transforming the gas into liquid to be moved on tankers, he said.
''Creative thinking is our great natural resource, not gas,'' he wrote. ''It is our obligation to guard it with utmost care.''

HEADLINE: The Virtue of Earmarks, and the Fear of Alternatives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Earmarks Ban May Loom, but Lawmakers Find Ways to Finance Pet Projects'' (news article, Dec. 28): 
People who oppose earmarks are generally the same people who complain about big government and Washington bureaucrats. Why shouldn't citizens talk with their representatives and senators and mutually decide on financing for their projects? Are all of these projects really worse than the projects selected by Washington bureaucrats?
Earmarks are an example of local control and local decision-making. They usually produce private-sector jobs and help stimulate the economy. Rather than rant about earmarks, lawmakers should raise taxes to make money available for a reasonable level of earmarks and distribute the money across all Congressional districts.
Michael Paluszek Plainsboro, N.J., Dec. 28, 2010
To the Editor:
The idea that lawmakers will find new and less transparent ways to finance pet projects by lobbying and even threatening federal agency officials with negative decisions affecting their budgets if they don't select their local projects for funding is scary.
Nonprofit organizations go through elaborate and exacting competitive processes to obtain federal grants to improve conditions in their communities. They rely on the fair and objective selection processes of those agencies.
If lawmakers choose cynically to give up their direct power to obtain earmarks and replace it with an invisible influence that politically distorts internal agency processes, it will be very damaging to the American people's trust in our government.

HEADLINE: For Attorney General, New Congress Means New Headaches

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When the Obama administration wakes up next month to a divided capital, no cabinet member will be facing a more miserable prospect of oversight hearings and subpoenas than Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr.
Mr. Holder is a particularly juicy target because he presides over issues that have served as recurrent fodder for political controversy -- including using the criminal justice system for terrorism cases, and federal enforcement of civil rights and immigration laws.
More than most administration officials, he has served as a proxy for Republican attacks on what they see as President Obama's left-leaning agenda. At least two possible 2012 Republican presidential hopefuls have already called for Mr. Holder's resignation.
''It's likely to be a difficult year,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a political science professor at the University of Texas, Austin, who said Mr. Holder's coming fights are likely to ''attract press attention in a way that steps on other messages the Obama administration would like to have front and center.'' 
Sitting in a conference room adjacent to his office this month, Mr. Holder pointed out that he had been deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration, when both chambers of Congress were under Republican control and were conducting aggressive oversight of the Justice Department.
''You've got to understand that I cut my teeth in the leadership of this department dealing with the situation we're about to encounter,'' he said.
He defended himself in advance on some hot-button issues, and he seemed to hint at some steps in the realm of counterterrorism policies that might hearten his conservative critics in Congress but could draw criticism on the left. He also laid out what amounts to an agenda for the coming year, from continuing to restore the ''traditional mission'' of the department -- law enforcement work put on the back burner after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 -- to national security matters, including a fresh push to overhaul an important surveillance law.
As Mr. Holder takes up such work, the incoming House chairmen most likely to play leading roles in Justice Department oversight are Representatives Lamar Smith of Texas, the new head of the Judiciary Committee, and Darrell Issa of California, who will lead the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Both declined to be interviewed, but Mr. Smith said in a statement, ''I am committed to fair and reasonable oversight of the Justice Department and to ensuring openness and transparency of our federal law enforcement agencies.''
Mr. Holder said that he did not know Mr. Issa well, but that he had known Mr. Smith for years. The two recently had lunch, and Mr. Holder said he believed they could work together.
Like much of Washington, the two chairmen are likely to start off focusing on economic issues. But it seems inevitable they will turn to Mr. Holder, a frequent target of their criticism over the past two years.
Last March, for example, they released a joint letter criticizing the Justice Department for not doing more to investigate the community activist group Acorn, and for an early 2009 decision to downsize a voter-intimidation lawsuit against the New Black Panther Party, a black-nationalist fringe group they portrayed as an Obama administration ally.
''We've already seen this administration dismiss one case against a political ally -- the New Black Panther Party -- for no apparent reason,'' Mr. Issa and Mr. Smith wrote. ''We remain concerned that politicization at the Justice Department once again may result in the administration's political friends getting a free pass.''
Asked about the prospect of oversight hearings and subpoenas involving the New Black Panther case, Mr. Holder said, ''there is no 'there' there.''
''The notion that this made-up controversy leads to a belief that this Justice Department is not color-blind in enforcement of civil rights laws is simply not supported by the facts,'' he said. ''All I have on my side with regard to that is the facts and the law.''
Another high-profile issue confronting Mr. Holder in the new year is how to deal with mounting pressure to prosecute the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, over his role in a major disclosure of classified government documents. Prosecutors have been examining whether Mr. Assange could be charged as a conspirator to the leak, or for publishing the materials.
Mr. Holder pushed back against the suggestion that indicting Mr. Assange would open the door to prosecuting traditional news organizations that take steps to ferret out and disclose information the government says should be a secret -- including The New York Times, which published some of the WikiLeaks documents and often writes about classified matters.
''Do you think that what you do is consistent with what you understand Assange and WikiLeaks did?'' Mr. Holder asked a reporter. ''Would I have liked not to see the stuff appear? Yes. But did The Times act in a responsible way? I would say yes. I am not certain I would say that about those people who were responsible for the initial leaks and the wholesale dumping of materials.''
(While WikiLeaks was criticized for publishing a cache of Afghanistan war documents without redacting some details about informers, it has since been more cautious. Of a cache of more than 250,000 State Department cables, it has so far published fewer than 2,000, many of which were selected and redacted by a consortium of newspapers, including The Times.)
Meanwhile, Mr. Holder seems to be adjusting the Justice Department's legislative agenda in light of the new Congress.
He said he agreed with the director of the F.B.I., Robert S. Mueller III, that there is a need to make sure that Internet-based communications providers -- like those providing encrypted e-mail and chat services -- design their systems so that they can be wiretapped, just like phone companies.
Obama administration officials have been developing a draft bill to impose that mandate, although the administration has not yet signed off on it. The plan has drawn criticism from advocates of Internet freedom, who argue that it would impede technological innovation and that any tools developed to eavesdrop on suspected criminals and terrorists could also be exploited by hackers or repressive regimes seeking to identify political dissidents.
But, significantly, Mr. Holder appeared guarded when asked about a proposal he aired last spring, dismaying civil liberties groups: expanding the time interrogators can question terrorism suspects before they must read them Miranda warnings or present them to a judge for an initial hearing.
Asked about reviving the proposal, Mr. Holder spoke vaguely about continuing conversations with lawmakers. But he also disclosed that the department had sent ''guidance'' to agents emphasizing that under existing law, they can question terrorism suspects about immediate threats to public safety before reading them Miranda warnings.
Still, no issue has fed more Republican attacks on Mr. Holder than his support for sometimes using the criminal justice system to handle terrorism cases -- especially his November 2009 decision to prosecute Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-professed mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, in federal court rather than a military commission.
The White House soon pulled back that decision amid concern about the cost and disruption of providing security for the trial in Manhattan, leaving Mr. Holder exposed. The issue of where to hold a trial has remained in limbo ever since.
This month, over Mr. Holder's objections, the still-Democratic-controlled Congress passed a bill that forbids the military to spend its money to transfer detainees from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the United States, even for trials. In the interview, he declined to engage with a question about whether Congress was doing him a backhanded favor by making the civilian trial option harder.
Indeed, last month, two potential Republican presidential candidates, Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota and former Speaker Newt Gingrich, declared that Mr. Holder should resign over the outcome of the first, and possibly only, trial in regular court of a former Guantanamo detainee.
A jury convicted the detainee, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, on just one charge for his role in the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa, while acquitting him on 284. Mr. Pawlenty and Mr. Gingrich accused Mr. Holder of endangering national security by prosecuting him in civilian court.
But, noting that Mr. Ghailani will soon be sentenced to from 20 years to life in prison, Mr. Holder said he wondered ''a year from now, when people look back and Ghailani is in jail, will that have the same resonance that people try to give it now.''
Indeed, he said, as a former American history major, he has to think about his job over the long run.
''You've got to just develop as thick a skin as you can, understand that some people will disagree with you on a principled basis but other people will disagree with you for purely political and partisan reasons,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As Decision Nears, San Francisco and Newport Angle for 2013 America's Cup

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The competition to host the next America's Cup, in 2013, will go down to the wire, with San Francisco and Newport, R.I., the leading candidates to win the event. An announcement is expected Friday.
As the holder of the Cup, the BMW Oracle Racing team, led by Larry Ellison, can choose the site of the next race. San Francisco has had an inside track because Ellison and his team are based there. It would also generate publicity for Ellison's company, Oracle, a major employer in the area.
But in recent weeks, race organizers have visited Newport, which has increased its efforts to host the Cup, or at least some of the races leading up to it. Officials in Newport, which has hosted the race a dozen times, say their facilities in and near Fort Adams State Park have to be upgraded, not built from scratch. 
Despite Newport's experience with the race, economic development officials in Rhode Island are still trying to determine how much it would cost to host the 34th America's Cup. Newport most recently hosted the event in 1983.
A city in Italy and a fourth, undisclosed site, which is believed to be outside the United States, have also submitted bids to host the event, which was last held in Valencia, Spain, in February. But given that BMW Oracle is the first American-led team to win the race in 18 years, Ellison is thought to prefer defending the Cup at home, not in Europe.
Regardless of the location, the organizers of the America's Cup want a site that is good for sailing but also one that is capable of generating enough revenue to recoup the hundreds of millions of dollars that must be spent to host the competition.
''These decisions about location used to be made for sailing reasons, not for commercial reasons,'' said John Rousmaniere, who has written about the history of the America's Cup. ''The tail is wagging the dog now.''
With its majestic setting, easy access and concentration of large companies, San Francisco is more likely to attract fans, sponsors and television networks than the other bidders. But because of its budget problems, the city has been unwilling to pay an upfront fee to win the bid.
Instead, city lawmakers -- after much debate and a number of false starts -- agreed to turn over part of San Francisco's waterfront to the organizers, who would repair piers and build boathouses and other facilities, and could develop the property after the Cup is finished.
Stephen Barclay, the lead negotiator for the BMW Oracle team, said his group must evaluate whether it can make its money back, given the extra expense of building in San Francisco, where earthquake standards and environmental regulations can drive up costs.
''The city has been strong about saying their side is in the black,'' Barclay said. ''We want to stand a good chance to be in the black, too.''
Sports business experts are skeptical of the city's predictions that the event would generate about $1.4 billion in economic benefits during its two-year run in San Francisco. Interest in the Cup has waned in recent years because teams have diluted their national identities by hiring crew members from other countries.
BMW said last week that it would not renew its sponsorship of the Oracle racing team at the end of the year. The Alinghi owner, Ernesto Bertarelli, who lost the Cup in February, said he would not continue his acrimonious rivalry with Ellison in 2013.
Until Ellison won the Cup in February, an American-owned team had not captured the Cup in nearly 20 years. ESPN did not broadcast the last two Cups after years of steadily declining television ratings. ESPN has not committed to broadcasting the event in 2013 or any races leading up to the final challenge.
The unpredictable weather, which can lead to postponements, and a packed schedule of other events complicate plans to broadcast the Cup, said John Wildhack, executive vice president for programming acquisitions and strategy at ESPN.
''You're at the mercy of the elements, with too much or too little wind, so you can get into significant conflicts,'' he said.
While more American viewers would be more likely to watch the live broadcast of the Cup if it was in San Francisco or Newport, Wildhack said that ESPN3.com, which streams events on the Internet, might be the best outlet for covering the race.
These hurdles aside, San Francisco remains the favorite to host the race, particularly among racers, who like the windy conditions there.
''Among sailors, they'd be disappointed if it wasn't in San Francisco,'' said Rousmaniere, the sailing historian.

HEADLINE: Streak Is Snapped at 90 As Stanford Solves UConn

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
PALO ALTO, Calif. -- The Connecticut Huskies had been undefeated during the Obama administration, untouched by the great recession, undeterred by the fiercest obstruction from any opponent in women's college basketball.
No more.
Just as top-ranked UConn had feared, ninth-ranked Stanford was too big, too deep and too thorough inside and out on Thursday, defeating the Huskies by 71-59 at sold-out Maples Pavilion and ending Division I college basketball's longest winning streak at 90 games.
UConn, which won by an average of 33 points during its streak and won all but two games by double figures, did not lead for a single second, falling to its first defeat since it lost to Stanford by 82-73 in the N.C.A.A. semifinals on April 6, 2008. 
Just as Notre Dame bookended the U.C.L.A. men's 88-game winning streak set from 1971 to 1974, so has Stanford bracketed the Huskies' streak.
Jeanette Pohlen, Stanford's senior point guard and leader, collected 31 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists. She hit five 3-pointers and kept her team from second-half swoons that twice led the Cardinal (9-2) to lose to UConn (12-1) last season, including in the N.C.A.A. championship game.
Meanwhile Maya Moore, the two-time national player of the year for UConn, seemed handcuffed by the tall and athletic Stanford front line. Moore did not score until the game was nearly 17 minutes old.
She shot 5 for 15 overall and scored 14 unthreatening points -- far below her average of 24.8. Moore also missed a chance for a late rescue, clanking the front end of a one-and-one with 1 minute 37 seconds remaining after the Huskies had drawn within 63-57 on the insistent play of guard Kelly Faris (19 points).
Moore's innocuous performance seemed to leave the young but usually relentless Huskies untethered and uncertain for long stretches. They shot a miserable 20 for 61 (32.8 percent), and were outrebounded by 43-36.
''I think disappointment is the right word, but not disappointment that we lost,'' UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. ''There's a sense of disappointment that we didn't play well. There's been other times we didn't play well; it's just that we haven't faced anybody as good as Stanford was tonight.''
Stanford's imposing and athletic Ogwumike sisters, 6-2 Nnemkadi and 6-3 Chiney, hounded Moore early. The 6-4 Kayla Pedersen (11 rebounds, 8 points) and 6-3 reserve Joslyn Tinkle also muscled her out of her comfort zone. Moore missed her first five shots badly -- one did not even hit the rim. In the first half, she knocked Nnemkadi Ogwumike (12 points, 6 rebounds) to the floor in apparent frustration.
''They were able to switch every screen; it doesn't matter who guards who,'' Auriemma said. ''The thing we've been able to do is make the game more open so that we could take advantage being smaller and a little quicker. We couldn't do that today.''
Pohlen scored 10 quick points on a pair of three-pointers and two eviscerating drives to the basket. A furious 11-0 run put the Cardinal ahead, 17-4, six and one half minutes into the game.
A second run by Stanford, fueled by the vaulting moves of the Ogwumikes, put the Cardinal ahead, 32-19, on a pair of free throws by Pohlen. UConn appeared overmatched, out of magic.
''They're so big, we can't match up with them,'' Auriemma said. ''They took advantage of that and just pounded the offensive boards and pounded it inside. And Pohlen was spectacular.''
She was fueled by a crowd of 7,329 at Maples Pavilion, where the Cardinal have won 52 in a row. It is a loud and inspiring place for the home team but claustrophobic for visitors, the stands pressing close to the court, everything seeming tight and lacking in space -- to move, to think clearly under pressure.
''She put this team on her back and told us we're not losing today,'' Pedersen said of Pohlen.
Of course, UConn still had the nation's top player in Moore. She had strong-armed Stanford twice last season with explosive second halves, the second time coming in the national championship game. On Thursday, though, she never found any sustained rhythm or dominance.
''I thought we showed moments of fight, where we came together,'' Moore said. ''Then we would do something to hurt ourselves. We'd make a mistake and they'd get a layup and momentum would shift back to them.''
At halftime, Stanford clung to a 34-30 lead. Twice it had lost such leads against UConn. This time it remained steadfast. Pohlen air-mailed another 3-pointer and stole the ball. She freed herself with an elbow and drove to the basket. Then she passed to Nnemkadi Ogwumike for a turnaround jumper and rained home yet another shot from three-point range. Stanford moved ahead, 47-38, with 12:58 remaining.
UConn would not succumb. Moore landed a 3-pointer to give the Huskies hope at 48-44. But Pohlen responded with a 3-pointer, and Stanford's lead swelled to 53-44. A fast-break layup by Nnemkadi Ogwumike restored the lead to double figures at 55-44.
UConn had one last charge left, closing within 61-55 on a pair of 3-pointers from Kelly Faris. But Moore missed a 3-point attempt from atop the key and Chiney Ogwumike leaked out for a layup to make it 63-55.
Victory and their record winning streak were soon out of reach for the Huskies.

HEADLINE: A New Ambassador to Syria, but Little Hope of Change

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Robert S. Ford, a career diplomat with deep experience in the Middle East, presents his credentials as ambassador to Syria, he will be the first person to hold the job since 2005, and the public face of the Obama administration's belief in engagement over isolation.
Yet few hold out much hope that Mr. Ford's arrival in Damascus will change much. With Syrian-American relations still mired in mutual recriminations, his appointment seems to have more modest goals: among them, a better window on Syria at a time of rising tensions across the border, in Lebanon. 
Mr. Ford was first nominated for the post in February, but Senate Republicans blocked his confirmation to protest Syrian policies in Lebanon, including continuing military support for Hezbollah, the militant Shiite group.
With the Senate now adjourned, Mr. Obama used his recess appointment powers on Wednesday to fill the Syrian ambassador's job and five other posts. Those appointments included naming Francis J. Ricciardone Jr. the new ambassador to Turkey. His nomination was also held up in the Senate for months, over concerns that Turkey has grown increasingly hostile to Israel and closer to Iran.
Winning Senate approval of the nominations would have grown only more difficult with a shrunken Democratic majority in the wake of November's elections. Mr. Ford was ambassador to Algeria from 2006 to 2008. He has also worked as political counselor and deputy chief of mission in Baghdad, and held a number of other Middle East positions.
Mr. Ricciardone has also had a long State Department career, including a term as ambassador to Egypt. Most recently, he served as charge d'affaires and deputy ambassador at the American Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan.
Mr. Ford's first priorities are likely to include the situation in Lebanon, where a United Nations-backed international tribunal is expected to indict members of Hezbollah in the 2005 killing of a former prime minister, Rafik Hariri. Hezbollah and its allies -- including high-ranking Syrian officials -- have warned that an indictment could set off civil conflict. They have pressed Mr. Hariri's son, Saad Hariri, who is now prime minister, to distance himself from the tribunal, to no avail. The impasse has paralyzed the Lebanese government, which is always hobbled by political and sectarian struggles.
The appointment of Mr. Ford may provide the United States with more diplomatic leverage and a better view on the conflict over the tribunal, analysts said.
''It's certainly valuable to have someone in place in Syria if and when the tribunal issue is going to blow up,'' said Paul Salem, the director of the Carnegie Endowment's Middle East Center, in Beirut.
But Mr. Ford's appointment does not herald any meaningful change in Syrian-American relations, which have been locked in mutual suspicion and hostility for more than five years. The United States withdrew its ambassador in 2005 after Mr. Hariri was killed in a car bombing in Beirut along with 22 others. Syria was widely accused of having orchestrated the killing, though it has vehemently denied involvement. The Bush administration imposed economic sanctions on Syria, as part of a broader effort to isolate the government of President Bashar al-Assad.
Mr. Obama proposed to renew official contacts with Syria and Iran, saying the Bush administration's policy of isolation had simply limited American diplomatic options without winning any concessions.
So far, however, the engagement has been limited. American diplomats have visited Damascus, but have reiterated the same priorities as the Bush administration: protesting Syria's military support to Hezbollah and Hamas, and its strong ties with Iran. Mr. Ford made it clear in his confirmation hearings that those priorities would not change.
Mr. Assad, who had hoped to persuade the Americans to separate the Israel-related issues from broader security concerns -- like fighting jihadist groups -- had voiced disappointment with the Obama position.
''The appointment of Ford means Obama has shown some good will, and the Syrians will have to show some good will in return,'' said Joshua M. Landis, a Syria expert and professor at the University of Oklahoma. ''It will ease communication, but it will not change the policy. From the Syrian point of view, Israel still dominates the relationship with the U.S.''
