New League Plans Partnership for Clubs and Players

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Learning a lesson from Major League Baseball, the United Baseball League, which will be unveiled today, plans to begin with a "true partnership" between clubs and players. The league, according to its confidential proposal, will offer players 35 percent of a team's pretax profits and a 10 percent equity share in all teams collectively.
Founders of the league, which would be the first new major baseball league in 80 years, will announce its creation at a news conference in Manhattan today. The proposal, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, lists the co-founders as Bob Mrazek, a former five-term Congressman from Long Island; John Bryant, a Congressman from Dallas; Richard Moss, a player agent, and Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College. 
 Under their current timetable, the founders plan to begin play in 1996 with eight teams in the United States, one in Canada and one in Mexico playing a 154-game schedule. They hope to expand to the Far East in the third season, with two teams in Japan, one in South Korea and one in Taiwan.
The locations of the initial 10 teams have not apparently been decided, but will come from a list of about 20 possible sites, including Long Island and northern New Jersey.
"The owners," the proposal says, "will enter into equity and profit-sharing arrangements with the host cities." The league will offer each city a 15 percent pretax profit and equity share in the team in return for the construction of a "fan friendly" stadium or the use of an existing "first-rate facility."
Cities, in lieu of rent, also would receive 50 percent of luxury-suite revenue and a third of parking revenue.
Under the profit-sharing plan for the players, the league would allocate 35 percent of a team's pretax profits to players, based proportionately on their salaries. The initial payrolls, covering base salaries only, are expected to be around $14 million per team. A player with a $1 million salary would also receive a fourteenth of the share of profits.
Under the equity part of the plan, players would participate in a collective 10 percent share.
"The players," the proposal says, "will realize their return from this equity share whenever a U.B.L. team is sold for a capital gain or whenever an expansion team is created."
As another element of the partnership the league wants to create, players would serve on the league's executive council.
In another marked departure from Major League Baseball, each team's financial books would be open for cities and players to see.
The proposal says the league will make "an unprecedented effort to attract minority investors and provide them full participation in every aspect of the league's activities."
Sites will be selected and owners approved by a management company that, the proposal says, will exist for six years. Besides the four founders, the proposal says the management company includes Curt Flood, the former major league player; Tom McMillen, the former National Basketball Association player; Alan Altschuler, president of Seaport Capital Inc., a merchant bank; William Gray, chairman of the United Negro College Fund; Robert Keefe, chairman of Keefe Company, a public affairs and lobbying firm, and Eric Vinson, vice president of the United States Trust Company.
The league will encourage owners to provide a limited public stock offering to fans in each city. Further, it will "suggest a commitment be made" that at least 15 percent of the seats at each stadium be sold for $5 or less.
With an increasing number of major league players available as free agents, the United League projects that at least half of the players on its teams in the first season will come from Major League Baseball.
If the players' strike persists, the proposal says, "we anticipate that the U.B.L. will be able to hire many more major leaguers."
Each roster would consist of 45 players, 25 on the playing team and the other 20 on the development squad. Those 20 players would travel with the team and play the home team's development squad in afternoon games. Players would be eligible for free agency after three years.
The last league to challenge Major League Baseball was the Federal League, which lasted for the 1914 and 1915 seasons before folding.

Nicotine Problems
Q. Leaving aside the matter of tobacco addiction, does nicotine have any harmful effects itself? 
 A.It can be harmful, depending on the size of the dose. In fact, concentrated nicotine derivatives are used as insecticides. Nicotine also stimulates pleasure centers in the human brain, but there are unpleasant symptoms when its use is abruptly stopped.
A description of how nicotine acts on the body appears in the "Physicians' Desk Reference" (Medical Economics Data), in its discussion of the Parke-Davis Products drug Nicotrol, a nicotine patch. Nicotine mimics the effects of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. It binds selectively to receptors in the autonomic nervous system, which controls things like heart rate and blood pressure. It also binds to receptors in the adrenal medulla, at junctions of nerve and muscle and in the brain and leads to the release of other chemicals that can affect the central nervous system and cause pleasurable effects, either stimulating or relaxing.
Nontoxic doses of nicotine can cause constriction of the peripheral blood vessels, accelerated heartbeat and elevated blood pressure. Because of effects like these, the "Desk Reference" advises, "The risks of nicotine replacement in patients with certain cardiovascular and peripheral vascular diseases should be weighed carefully against the benefits of including nicotine replacement in a smoking cessation program for them." It is to be used with caution in patients with other diseases, like ulcers, and in pregnancy.
The A.M.A. Encyclopedia of Medicine (Random House) says that in someone unused to smoking, even a small dose of nicotine can alter the heart rate and cause nausea and vomiting. A tolerance develops with continued use, however.
Withdrawal symptoms can include craving, nervousness, restlessness, irritability, anxiety, drowsiness, sleep disturbances, impaired concentration, increased appetite, weight gain and a variety of aches, pains and twinges, the "Desk Reference" says.
Toxic levels of nicotine cause nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, profuse sweating, flushing, dizziness, hearing and vision disturbances, confusion, weakness, palpitations, altered respiration, abnormally low blood pressure and occasionally death. However, the doses usually administered in smoking or chewing tobacco are not high enough to produce such symptoms.

HEADLINE: Israelis and Arabs Talking Business

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CASABLANCA, Morocco, Oct. 31

 BODY:
Two thousand business executives from 60 countries and scores of senior American, Israeli and Arab officials began a two-day conference here today to explore ways of cementing peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors through regional economic projects.
Half the Israeli Cabinet, led by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and several dozen businessmen armed with nearly 150 proposals for joint ventures with Arabs, arrived for the gathering, underlining Israel's keen interest in exploring the economic horizons of the Arab world. 
 In a strong push to strengthen the new economic tissue binding Israel to the region, Secretary of State Warren Christopher proposed the establishment of a multibillion-dollar regional bank that would finance small and medium-size business ventures in Israel and Arab countries. He spoke at the opening of the conference, called the Middle East-North Africa Economic Summit.
Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi businessman, suggested the establishment of a development fund to boost the nascent economy in areas of Palestinian self-rule.
But as the first day of meetings and debates ended, it was clear that the virtual absence of economic contacts between Israeli and Arab business people in the past half-century is an obstacle that will take several more such gatherings to remedy.
"We don't expect to sign deals," Dan Gillerman, chairman of the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce of Tel Aviv, said in an interview here. "That would be naive, but the main message of this conference is that doing business with Israel is now legitimate."
"This is a totally new experience for us to meet our counterparts in the Arab world," Mr. Gillerman said. "We realize that with some of them it may take time, but it is a chance to make the contact, to prepare feasibility studies for what is possible."
Israel's Minister of Economy and Planning, Shimon Shetreet, said that the conference, which was jointly sponsored by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum and the New York-based Council of Foreign Relations, was "a beginning, a good one as the strategic environment for peace is positive in the region."
Arab officials and businessmen appeared less sanguine than Israelis, suggesting that real economic ties cannot precede the removal of lingering shadows of the Middle East conflict that are still keeping Syria, Lebanon and to some extent the Palestinians, from fully normalizing ties with Israel.
Syria and Lebanon refused to participate in the conference, as did the Sudan and Iran, which have inveighed against it as an attempt by Israel and the United States to dominate Arab economies.
Some Arab experts said that regional development, when it comes, will have to be paid for by outside powers, since the emirates of the gulf region and Saudi Arabia have long depleted their reserves of cash and investments, in part because of the costs of the Persian Gulf war, and have been unable to replenish them because oil prices have plunged in the last decade.
Some noted that international sanctions and other forms of containment against Iraq, Iran and Libya, as well as the civil war in Algeria, deprived the Middle East region of four of its wealthiest oil economies.
"With Iran and Iraq out of commission and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait suffering from growing debt, it is difficult to see economic cooperation benefits being reaped immediately or even in the medium term," said Mohammed Abdul Jabbar, an expert with the Washington-based Petroleum Finance Company.
Foreign, economic and planning ministers from Arab countries were also present at the gathering, along with numerous representatives of the World Bank and other international funds. The heavy presence of these officials highlighted not only world interest in Middle East economies but also the problems that the World Bank and other international donors have had in fulfilling previous pledges of financial help like the ones extended to the Palestine Liberation Organization in the past year.
P.L.O. officials said they had received less than $100 million from pledges of $2.4 billion that were to be disbursed over five years.
Part of the blame in the slow movement of funds lies with the P.L.O., World Bank officials said, because it has failed to create a system of accountability for the aid funds waiting to be disbursed. But World Bank officials and other business executives here agreed that international financial institutions have proven in the last decade to be big on promises of financial aid but slow in delivery.
Amr Moussa, Egypt's Foreign Minister, said the conference and other events that will follow may not bring instant economic prosperity but they will lay the groundwork for a period when peace takes root with all Arab countries. "Economic well-being is for everybody in the region without exceptions," Mr. Moussa told a news conference here today.

HEADLINE: Haiti's Capital Throbs With New Life

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Oct 31

 BODY:
Haiti's capital is bustling again. At night, with people no longer fearful they will be kidnapped and killed by the gunmen the army used as enforcers, restaurants are full. People are flocking to bars and music clubs to dance to their favorite songs in the syncopated Haitian compas style.
And on streets that were eerily vacant once darkness fell even two months ago, families take late-night walks to buy ice cream at parlors that have been able to reopen because they now have a regular supply of electricity. 
 On every corner, it seems, stores have reopened and informal markets have spilled out into the streets, attracting huge numbers of customers and gapers from dawn until dusk. With the lifting of the American-led embargo that crippled the Haitian economy and with cargo arriving again, Haitians are rushing to buy and sell goods not seen here in more than a year, from perfume to automobile parts.
In neighborhood after neighborhood, both rich and poor, Port-au-Prince, the capital, is once again coming fully to life. While the new feeling of well-being has not yet reached many areas of the countryside, Port-au-Prince's 1.5 million residents are realizing that the worst of their ordeal is over and resuming business routines and simple pleasures with an intensity that suggests they are trying to make up for lost time.
"I never could have imagined that normal life for Haitians could be like this," said a diplomat who arrived here little more than a year ago, at the height of the military repression and just before the start of the most severe international economic sanctions. "Only now that I see Haitians relaxed and breathing easy do I realize the full extent of what this country has been through."
Even the President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has joined in, finally emerging from the National Palace, where he was sequestered for all but a few hours of the first two weeks of his return from exile. Accompanied by an intimidating American military escort, he left the official presidential quarters late Friday to spend a long weekend at his private residence in a middle-class neighborhood near the airport.
Beyond the reduction in fear, much of the resurgence can be traced to a single factor: a dramatic shift in the supply and cost of gasoline. For the last year, gasoline was available only on the black market at prices that surged to $15 a gallon or more because of the economic sanctions applied against Haiti's military Government by the United Nations. But for the last week, gasoline has been selling at the pump for a much more congenial $2 a gallon.
"I took my car out of storage this week and drove it for the first time in almost six months," Serge Etienne, a 42-year-old bank employee, said happily as he filled the tank of a battered Honda Civic at a reopened gas station. "Gasoline was getting so costly toward the end, and thus the bus fares so high, that often I could only afford to walk to work."
As a result of the cheaper gasoline, however, the streets are clogged with more cars than ever before, local residents say. Formidable traffic jams are now common around schools at starting and closing time and on main arteries full of axle-breaking potholes that the former corrupt military dictatorship neglected to repair. Even worse, the return of automobile traffic has cast a hazy blanket of smog over the capital and fouled the air.
To control the congestion, which often threatens to bring all movement on the streets to a halt, international police monitors from Bangladesh, in green uniforms and yellow hats, have been directing traffic at major intersections. The remnants of the Haitian police force, which was more skilled at terrorizing the population than at normal police duties, often stand by observing. The Haitian officers have tried to apply the lessons they are learning, but they are held in such contempt that drivers often simply ignore them.
Guy Malary International Airport, renamed earlier this month in honor of President Aristide's assassinated Justice Minister, has become another center of commotion. Large crowds gather outside the terminal every afternoon during the hours the United States military has set aside for commercial traffic. The planes arriving from New York, Miami, Montreal, Paris and the Caribbean are full of jubilant Haitians returning from exile with oversized gifts and tearful embraces for the relatives they had been forced to leave behind.
"Oh, it is like a dream come true to finally be back home again," Hubert Maillot said as he disembarked last week and craned his neck looking for his brother and mother, who were to meet him. "There were times when I wondered if it would ever happen."
American Airlines and other carriers that have resumed regular flights to Haiti report that their planes are carrying full cargo loads as businesses rush to replenish supplies of goods and raw materials that were exhausted during the embargo. Much of the freight belongs to "Madame Sarahs," the generic name given here to the generally portly and gaudily dressed women who dominate small-scale commerce in market towns around the country.
The upsurge in activity on the streets contrasts sharply with the silence emanating from President Aristide, who remains under heavy security and out of reach of ordinary Haitians. During his first eight months in office before his exile, the President thrived on contact with his supporters. But until he departed late Friday for his home in the suburb of Tabarre, he had left the palace grounds for only one public event in the two weeks since his return and has only occasionally been seen or heard on television or radio.
Instead, friends and former opponents alike have been going to the palace to meet with him behind closed doors. Last week he met with leaders of political parties to discuss, among other things, how to revise the timetable to allow adequate preparation for parliamentary elections that were originally scheduled for next month, and he has telephoned prominent business leaders who supported the coup that overthrew him.
"I smile because I want to go to the countryside," President Aristide said Saturday at an informal news conference at his home when he was asked why he had remained cloistered in the palace. "I stay here because I have a lot to do, but at the same time I try to make it easier for those who are trying to provide security."
Associates of the President said that much of his time in recent days has been devoted to putting together his Cabinet. Last week, he nominated Smark Michel, a 57-year-old businessman, as Prime Minister. But 13 other Cabinet posts, along with several Supreme Court seats, must also be filled, and the process has not been easy.
The left wing of the Lavalas movement, the broad coalition that brought Father Aristide to power in the December 1990 election, was disappointed that he did not choose his Foreign Minister, Claudette Werleigh, for the top job, so it is looking for some measure of satisfaction in the other appointments.
But President Aristide is also said to be feeling pressure from the United States and the business community, still deeply suspicious of his populist instincts. They are urging him to look beyond his immediate circle of associates to fill some of the more sensitive slots, especially those having to do with trade and the economy.
Under that pressure, President Aristide clearly relished the chance to take a look at his simply but elegantly furnished home, which had to be redecorated after he returned because Haitian soldiers and policemen had ripped out air-conditioning and plumbing, smashed windows and fouled the floor while he was in exile.
The President said he was "happy to be back at my house, but happier to forget about what they did."

HEADLINE: Woman Wins $5 Million For Tailhook

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Oct. 31

 BODY:
A former Navy lieutenant who said she was sexually assaulted by other officers at an aviators convention three years ago was awarded $5 million in punitive damages today from the hotel where the gathering took place.
A Federal jury ordered the Las Vegas Hilton and its parent company, Hilton Hotels Corporation, to pay the damages, which will be added to $1.7 million in compensatory damages, to Paula A. Coughlin, whose suit said the hotel failed to provide adequate security during the September 1991 Tailhook Association convention. 
 "I think justice was served," Ms. Coughlin said, speaking with reporters for the first time since the trial began on Sept. 12.
Ms. Coughlin settled with the Tailhook Association for an undisclosed amount of money before the trial here started.
More than 80 women said they were sexually assaulted by drunken aviators at the convention.
The four-man, four-woman jury awarded the compensatory damages on Friday. This afternoon, it began deliberating the punitive damages. It made its decision less than an hour after hearing testimony about the company's assets and then arguments from both sides.
Ms. Coughlin testified earlier that she was trapped in the hotel's third-floor hallway on the Saturday night of the convention by a group of men who shoved their hands inside her clothes and tried to pull off her undergarments.
Ms. Coughlin's lawyer, Dennis Schoville, had urged jurors to issue a multimillion-dollar award "to get the shareholders' attention," saying that would discourage future assaults and possibly cause some executives to leave the company.
"They're still equating the damage done to Paula Coughlin and her life to a broken lamp," Mr. Schoville said of the Hilton legal team.
A lawyer for Hilton, Eugene Wait, said today that the Hilton corporation had already been punished enough by negative publicity.
Mr. Wait tried to discourage the jury from giving Ms. Coughlin punitive damages by arguing that such an award would injure fellow Americans and the jurors' community.
"Americans and others have invested their money in this company," he said. "These are the people that you'll affect."
Financial statements introduced in court showed the net worth of Hilton Hotels at $1.089 billion, and the Las Vegas Hilton at $274 million.
Though Ms. Coughlin and her lawyers expressed satisfaction with the decision, the former helicopter pilot, who has been unemployed since leaving the Navy in June, said she did not know what she would do now.
"I'm hoping to slip into obscurity," she said. "I want to paint my house. I just want to go home."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE REPUBLICANS;
It's the Economy Again, as Democrats Attack the 'Contract With America'

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
In their advertisements and campaign speeches, many Democrats assert that the Republicans' "Contract With America" would entail massive cuts in Government programs ranging from Social Security and Medicare to student loans and border security.
Republicans counter that their promises of tax breaks would be paid for by specific, itemized, relatively painless spending cuts. And they maintain that a memorandum written this month by Alice M. Rivlin, the budget director, shows how the Clinton Administration is contemplating large tax increases and deep reductions in Social Security. 
 Much of this, featured in the final television advertising blitz by both parties, is pre-election hyperventilation. But the Republican contract and the Rivlin memorandum do illustrate a fundamental difference between Republicans and Democrats on fiscal policy.
Most Republican candidates this year continue to hold to Ronald Reagan's politically appealing maxim that taxes can be lowered and the Federal budget balanced without Americans making sacrifices.
Democrats this year are more apt to make the painful admission that the new Government spending they favor -- what President Clinton calls investment and Republicans call social spending -- would require ordinary citizens to pay higher taxes or give up Government benefits they now enjoy.
For most of this year, questions about spending, taxes, deficits and debt were hardly part of the campaign debate. Then last month, more than 300 Republican candidates for the House of Representatives gathered on the steps of the Capitol and signed what they called a "Contract With America."
The contract, written by House Republican leaders after close consultation with pollsters about what the American public favors, involves 10 measures that the Republicans promise to bring to a vote in the first 100 days of the next Congress if they win control of the House.
Most of these bills would provide for tax cuts: a $500 per child tax credit; tax credits for adoption expenses and the care of elderly dependents; a lower capital gains tax; tax breaks for investment by businesses; more tax advantages for individual retirement accounts; a repeal of the 1993 bill that raised the proportion of Social Security benefits subject to taxation; an increase in the size of gifts and estates not subject to taxation, and several other tax breaks that would primarily benefit middle- and upper-income taxpayers.
The Republican staff of the House Budget Committee has calculated that the tax cuts would total nearly $220 billion over the next five years. That would be partly offset by about $70 billion in spending reductions over the five-year period.
Most of the reduced spending -- $40 billion -- would result from lower welfare payments. The Republicans would knock beneficiaries off welfare after two years. They would deny welfare and housing benefits to unmarried mothers younger than 18 and allow states to raise that age to 21. They would also deny benefits to noncitizens residing in the United States for less than five years.
The remaining items listed by the Republicans as spending reductions are actually proposals that, while lowering spending in the next five years, would substantially increase spending in later years. One such proposal would give businesses that make long-term investments in plants and equipment less generous depreciation rules immediately, but much more favorable rules later. Another proposal would encourage taxpayers to put income on which they would pay taxes now into I.R.A.'s with the understanding that the interest and dividends on the account would not be taxable when the money was withdrawn at retirement.
The budget law requires that all tax cuts be completely offset by tax increases or spending reductions. Republicans say they plan to comply. While the offsetting measures are not listed in the contract, Republican leaders say the party will support spending reductions listed in a budget plan submitted last year by Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the top Republican on the Budget Committee.
The House rejected the Kasich plan last year and approved President Clinton's budget on party-line votes.
The Kasich plan outlined $176 billion in specific spending cuts over five years. More than $50 billion would come from cuts in Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, and Medicaid, the health program for the poor.
This highlights another difference between the two parties. Members of both agree that the health programs can be cut. But most Democrats want to spend the money saved to help pay for expanding health insurance. Republicans want to use it to reduce the deficit.
The next biggest saving in the Kasich plan, nearly $20 billion over five years, would result from turning over the air traffic control system to private operators.
But even if the spending cuts described in the Kasich budget would more than offset the specific tax cuts in the Republican contract, it does not get the Republicans over their biggest fiscal hurdle. The first item in the contract calls for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget by 2002.
As matters now stand, about $700 billion in spending cuts or tax increases would be required to balance the budget by 2002. If balancing the budget were accomplished by spending cuts alone, some estimates show, Government programs might have to shrink by an average of 10 percent or more.
The idea of the Republican contract was conceived by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who is in line to be Republican leader in the next Congress. It may have been a political misstep.
Few Republicans are using the contract to buttress their campaigns. But the Democratic National Committee began running television advertisements in many states today asserting that the contract would require a cut in Social Security benefits of almost $2,000 a year. George Stephanopoulos, one of President Clinton's top political advisers, said this was the average amount that would have to be taken from each retiree if all Federal programs except the military were cut by the same percentage in order to reach a balanced budget.
Republicans say they have no intention of cutting Social Security or of reducing programs across the board by an equal percentage. But they do not say what they would cut to balance the budget.
In fact, there is no way to do that without enacting measures that would be enormously unappealing politically -- so unpopular, in fact, that they could cost the politicians who support them their jobs. Almost certainly, they would include steep new taxes and sharp cuts in benefits for affluent retirees.
This is where Ms. Rivlin comes in. Her memorandum, an internal document that is dated Oct. 3 and was somehow obtained by Republicans a couple of weeks ago, is a straightforward accounting of the choices faced by the Clinton Administration, the kind of options paper that a budget official would be derelict not to write. The problem is that it leaked out just before an important election, and the choices it outlines are not attractive politically.
She did not talk about balancing the budget, which has never been a Clinton priority. But she wrote that if the Clinton Administration intended to fulfill its goals of increasing spending in areas like technology and job-training, of providing universal health insurance, of reducing the deficit, and perhaps even of allowing a tax cut for middle-class working families, then money must be found elsewhere.
"There are only three possibilities," her memorandum asserted, "all of them tough." The possibilities are to raise taxes, cut spending for specific Government programs or reduce entitlements.
She then offered pages of alternatives for the President to consider, one of which was a gradual reduction in Social Security benefits.
Republicans pounced on this option and forced President Clinton to declare that he had no intention of cutting Social Security.
All this shouting will doubtless fade away after Election Day, but the underlying issue will not.
The Federal deficit, which is now falling because of the flourishing economy and the budget legislation enacted last year, will begin to rise again by the turn of the century. Mostly that is because of the rapidly rising cost of health programs. Whenever the next recession occurs, the problem will become even worse.
Something must be done. What may be decided in the election on Nov. 8 is on whose terms these decisions will be made, Democrats or Republicans.

THE DEMOCRATS
 An excerpt from a memorandum dated Oct. 3 and written by Alice M. Rivlin, President Clinton's budget director:
All of us know what we would do to improve the long-run health of the economy and the average American's prospects if we had the resources. Although our priorities may differ somewhat, all of us want to:
 
Increase public investment -- in technology, infrastructure, communities and the skills of the present and future labor force -- to raise productivity and raise living standards;
 
Reduce the deficit to release saving for private investment and reduce longterm interest rates;
 
Provide universal health security and reduce the rate of growth of health care costs;
 
Insure retirement security and the future solvency of the social security system;
 
Cut taxes especially for middle class working families.
 
The big problem is that we cannot do ANY of these things without freeing resources that are now devoted to other things.
 
Where will the resources come from?
 
The experience of ther last two years has reinforced what we already knew about the difficulties of finding resources for new initiatives. There are only three possibilities -- all of them tough:
 
Discretionary spending cuts
With enormous effort, this year and last, we shifted significant discretionary spending from on-going programs into our highest priority investments. But Congressional resistance is strong -- witness our limited success in cutting highway demos and LIHEAP -- and there is unlikely to be much more room here. Moreover, a more conservative Congress could lower the caps further and force cuts that would likely fall mostly on our investments.
 
Tax increases
The anti-government mood probably precludes any general-purpose tax increase. However, revenue increases may be possible to fund specific initiatives, especially if the tax has a logical connection to use use -- as in a tobacco tax or a tax on high-cost health plans tied to health care reform. It might also be possible to gain support for a revenue-neurtral restructuring of taxes -- such as reducing tax breaks for high-income people to fund a middle-class tax cut.
 
Entitlement spending cuts
Since entitlement spending, unlike discretionary, is still growing and projected to grow more rapidly, everyone looking for budget savings points to entitlements. But the specifics are daunting. A package of benefit reductions for veterans, farmers, government retirees, etc. would meet heavy public and Congressional resistance. COLA cuts are indiscriminate, hitting the most as well as the least vunlerable. Conconrd-Coalition-type schemes to recapture big savings if they only effect the truly well-off, and may erode support for these programs among upper-income groups. Moreover, 90% of savings would come from Social Security and Medicare, and would probably be labeled by opponents as tax increases.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE ISSUES;
Facing Social Problems: Proposals by Cuomo and Pataki Often Are Vague

SERIES: Governing New York -- A periodic report on issues facing the next administration.

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
In a gubernatorial campaign heavy with talk about crime and taxes, debate about the social problems that cost New Yorkers billions of dollars each year has been light.
Events like the recent visit of President Clinton focused attention momentarily on the issue. Campaigning for his fellow Democrat, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Clinton said he would allow New York to begin experimental welfare programs and would press for improving Medicaid payments to the state. But the welfare waiver would involve only 21,000 of the more than one million New Yorkers receiving welfare grants, and the Medicaid help would require Congressional approval that would be difficult to win. 
 State Senator George E. Pataki, the Republican candidate for governor, issued a welfare agenda earlier in the campaign that he said would be a "dramatic" effort to "break the cycle of dependency." But even one Republican Party official said the four-page document was "filled with platitudes and very little detail."
Both developments reflect the campaign pattern, in which the candidates are offering vague, middle-of-the road proposals that fail to show voters in detail how each would deal with the mounting social problems straining the state's resources.
Strategists in both parties acknowledge that Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Pataki have ideological differences over the causes and how to solve the entrenched social problems that financially and emotionally tax the people of New York, among them a rising welfare caseload that now stands at 1.6 million, the seemingly intractable homeless population, staggering Medicaid costs and deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill.
What the candidates share is a fear driving each to play down those contrasts and avoid the issues: neither wants to be called an extremist.
"Social programs, poverty, those are really lightning rods to voters, especially during difficult economic times when everyone feels like they need some relief," said one elected Democratic state official, who insisted on anonymity. "And Mario doesn't want to be called 'hopelessly liberal' any more than Pataki wants to be called 'radically conservative.' So they both head for the tall, safe middle grass where they can basically hide."
As he campaigns, Mr. Pataki says that "the best welfare is a job." He proposes penalizing welfare parents whose children are regularly delinquent from school. He calls for increasing the number of welfare recipients who must work to keep their benefits. He supports a tax credit for low-income families.
What the Republican nominee does not call for, as he once did, are more severe measures to hustle people off welfare, like restricting how long they can get benefits. In fact, judging from Mr. Pataki's performance on the stump, he could well be reading from the position papers, proposals and policies of Mr. Cuomo.
In campaign appearances, Mr. Pataki has extolled a program that Westchester County has run for the last five years requiring able-bodied childless people receiving welfare to work on public projects, like cleaning graffiti, raking leaves and painting community swimming pools.
The program, which Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has said he intends to emulate in New York City, also combines aggressive eligibility screenings of applicants and has been credited by Westchester officials with holding the growth there of caseloads for Home Relief, the state benefits program for single people, to less than one percent.
Mr. Cuomo's aides are quick to note that the Westchester model so embraced by Mr. Pataki was begun during the Cuomo administration. They stress that both the Governor and the State Social Services Commissioner, Michael J. Dowling, have been urging local officials to push more Home Relief recipients into jobs, training or public works programs like the one in Westchester.
"Given the careful positioning during this campaign, the differences between them are in the nuances," said Gordon L. Berlin, senior vice president of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a nonprofit organization. "If you listen carefully, Pataki is saying that dependency is the No. 1 problem. He is not saying a word about poor people. Just push the numbers no matter what it does to people's lives. Cuomo in his heart would rather end poverty -- he just can't afford it. Neither of them can afford to do what they want. So they stay vague."
 
Medicaid and Care
 While both candidates have been saying little on social issues, Mr. Cuomo has a rich record of oratory and policy to mine. But he has been shifting emphasis -- though not position -- on these issues, satisfying a more centrist appeal.
Mr. Cuomo once extolled the fact that the state gave Medicaid recipients flexibility to choose their own doctors and made many services available to them -- a range beyond the Federal demands.
He is now proposing to trim Medicaid services to encourage recipients to join cost-saving managed-care programs, which would require a Federal waiver. Although the Governor's initiative is aimed at cutting the vast Medicaid budget to provide insurance for more low-income people, the Governor clearly understands that it is politically wisest now to seem prudent rather than lavish with benefits for the poor.
Mr. Pataki joins Mr. Cuomo in this position, saying that he too supports putting Medicaid recipients into managed care and scaling back the services covered under Medicaid.
But the candidates' lack of detail in discussing social policy is frustrating for, among others, advocates for the mentally ill, who want to see the state commit more of the money saved from closing psychiatric hospitals to community-based programs and homes, and for child-health-care workers, who want to expand medical coverage for the children of the working poor.
"Not to have these as important issues in the campaign is a disservice to the people of this state," said Gary Billings, executive director of the State Communities Aid Association, a citizens' advocacy group. "Large numbers of kids can't get the basic health care they need.
"The Governor was successful in putting a little bit of money each year to fund school-based clinics through a combination of funding streams, but he never found a permanent authorization for the program. He had a bill in this year, but it was never enacted and there wasn't any evidence he pushed very hard for it. And then there's Pataki, who just simply ignores the issue."
 
Homelessness
 People who work in social services said they worry that an amorphous debate on social policy will undermine their efforts to maintain financing for and focus on critical programs. For instance, advocates for the underprivileged have long been urging Albany to raise the shelter allowance, the rental grant for a welfare family, which has been the same since 1988, a level widely considered to be so low that it aggravates an already seething problem with homelessness.
For a family of three, the typical size of a welfare family in New York, the shelter allowance is $286 a month. The vacancy rate for apartments that cost less than $400 a month in New York City is less than 1 percent. Housing a homeless family in temporary shelters, however, costs about $3,200 a month.
When pressed in an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Cuomo acknowledged that the allowance was inadequate, but he said he never pressured the Legislature to raise it "because I thought I wouldn't get it." Mr. Pataki has not addressed the issue.
"This is a very critical issue that needs to be dealt with, but the current climate makes it difficult for any politician to touch," said Barbara B. Blum, president of the Foundation for Child Development, an advocacy group, who also is a former State Social Services Commissioner.
 
Local Control
 Local government officials say one of the worst problems they face in delivering social services efficiently and effectively is that they are required to carry out and partially subsidize policies and regulations issued by the state with little input on those policies.
When they fail to meet the state's regulations, they are fined, while the state is not held accountable for the policies it mandates.
"Most states have moved to a state centralized system -- we're a real dinosaur," said Russell Sykes, deputy director of the State Communities Aid Association and chairman of the New York State Welfare Reform Task Force.
The biggest state-imposed burden that local governments face in providing social services is paying a part of Aid to Families With Dependent Children -- the main welfare benefit program that covers mostly families headed by single mothers -- and, more significantly, contributing to Medicaid costs.
Most states do not require localities to share financing for those programs, which states split 50-50 with the Federal Government. Of the ones that do, New York demands the biggest local contribution, an even split of the state's portion. In endorsing Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Giuliani said he could not understand Mr. Pataki's position on the split while he knew Mr. Cuomo was committed to working for greater fairness.
Mr. Cuomo has tried and failed to persuade the Legislature to support a complete state takeover of those costs. Mr. Pataki said he also supports a state takeover. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Pataki said the money saved by treating Medicaid recipients in managed-care programs would enable the state to afford taking over a larger part of the Medicaid costs now borne by local governments.
"This overshadows all other mandates," said Beth St. Dennis, legislative director of the New York State Association of Counties. "The counties have no control over what they spend on these programs and too little control over how they administer them. These one-size-fits-all solutions don't work. Whoever becomes governor is going to have to change the basic way these programs are conceived and funded."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Resumes Its Fall As Bonds and Stocks Falter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most other leading currencies yesterday as the American bond market sagged.
Stocks, bonds and the dollar rallied in the United States on Friday after the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product grew at a robust annual rate of 3.4 percent in the third quarter, without showing signs of an acceleration in inflation. But few investors expect inflation to remain under control as long as the economy is growing at such a rapid pace, and bonds and stocks fell yesterday, dragging down the dollar. 
 Currency traders have been tracking the performances of bonds and stocks to gauge foreign demand for American assets and the dollars needed to buy them.
The dollar rose on Friday "more on panic and blind buying than on thoughtful positioning," said Jerry Egan, managing director of currency trading at the MTB Banking Corporation. "When people got an eye on bonds falling" yesterday, they sold dollars, he said.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5037 German marks, from 1.5102 marks on Friday. The dollar slipped to 96.93 yen, from 97.27 yen on Friday.
The dollar has fallen 13 percent against both the mark and the yen so far this year.
"People are still expecting a lower dollar," said Richard Vullo, foreign exchange manager at the Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank in New York.
The dollar remains near a two-year low of 1.4860 marks, which was touched in trading in Europe on Tuesday, and a post-World War II low of 96.42 yen, set in intraday trading in New York on Tuesday.
The dollar rose on Friday, said David Wilson, vice president of currency sales at Credit Lyonnais in New York, only because traders who were short dollars tried to lock in a profit on their positions, he said. To short dollars, a trader sells them for another currency, hoping to buy them back at a lower rate later.
"I don't see any reason to make people buy dollars," Mr. Wilson said.
The dollar fell against most other currencies in New York trading. The British pound rose to $1.6355, from $1.6240 on Friday. The dollar slipped to 1.2565 Swiss francs from 1.2595 francs and fell to 5.1495 French francs from 5.1665 francs. The dollar also slid to 1,537.50 Italian lire, from 1,541.50 lire on Friday. The Canadian dollar fell to 73.92 United States cents from 74.03 cents.

Gold Drops to 2-Month Low As Inflation Worries Ease

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Gold plunged yesterday to its lowest price in two months on signs that inflation remained subdued.
 On other markets, gasoline and soybeans fell, pushing the Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 commodities down 1.18 point, to 233.30.
Gold is traditionally a hedge against inflation because it and other precious metals have tended to hold their value better than other investments. Gold had risen above $400 in recent weeks on fears that inflation was accelerating. 
 But those inflation concerns eased somewhat after the Commerce Department's report last week on gross domestic product showed no significant pickup in inflation. And the Commerce Department said yesterday that consumer spending rose two-tenths of 1 percent in September, another indication that growth may be moderating.
"Gold has effectively broken down," David Hewitt, a trader with Chase Manhattan Bank, said. On the Commodity Exchange of New York, gold for December delivery fell for the seventh consecutive day, losing $3.80 to close at $384.90 an ounce, its lowest price since Aug. 23. The December silver contract dropped 10.5 cents, to $5.262 an ounce.
Gold's plunge could end soon, traders said, as demand from commercial users, like jewelry makers, increases with the decline in price. Jewelers typically buy most of their gold in the months leading up to Christmas, their busiest season.
Gasoline prices fell yesterday as demand declined for gasoline that would not meet new Federal regulations.
Refineries must begin selling a reformulated grade of gasoline to dealers in December to comply with new clean-air regulations. While conventional gasoline can be sold at the pump until the end of December, starting today, supplies delivered through futures contracts must be of the new grade. The contract for November delivery expired yesterday.
November gasoline slipped 1.48 cents, to 57.08 cents a gallon, on the Mercantile Exchange in New York. December crude oil fell 4 cents, to $18.19 a barrel.
Soybeans and soybean oil fell as warm, dry weather in the Midwest over the weekend allowed farmers to wrap up harvesting this year's record-breaking crop.
On the Chicago Board of Trade, November soybeans fell 4.5 cents, to $5.4225 a bushel, while December soybean oil fell 0.89 cent, to 25.66 cents a pound.

HEADLINE: Incomes Had Sharp Gain In September

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31

 BODY:
Americans were taking home more pay and saving more, too, in September, as the strongest gain in incomes since April easily outpaced consumer spending.
Analysts said the figures released by the Commerce Department today were in line with an economy that continues to expand at a steady, moderate rate. 
 The department said incomes climbed six-tenths of a percent in September -- the eighth consecutive increase -- while spending rose two-tenths of a percent, the weakest showing since it dropped three-tenths of a percent in April.
"The income numbers look quite solid," said Lynn Reaser, an economist for the First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "Consumers took somewhat of a breather in September."
She said higher interest rates, expected to slow the economy, were also helping replenish bank accounts with many Americans getting a larger yield.
Analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates for the sixth time this year at a Nov. 15 meeting of its policy-making panel.
The income data were a little stronger than many analysts had expected, and the spending was a little lower. The report appeared to have little effect on financial markets.
The new data meant that Americans' savings rate -- savings as a percentage of disposable income -- was up to 4.1 percent in September from 3.7 percent in August.
"Consumer spending is not the mover of the economy now -- it's the follower," said Laurence Meyer, who heads a St. Louis forecasting firm. He said that auto sales, after a particularly strong August, leveled off in September and helped hold down overall spending.
Accounting for two-thirds of the nation's gross domestic product, spending was up for the fifth consecutive month and has risen seven of the last eight months.
The Commerce Department also said that disposable income -- income after taxes -- climbed six-tenths of a percent in September.
The overall income advance matched the gain of six-tenths of a percent in April. Income last fell in January, when it slipped six-tenths of a percent. During August, personal income increased four-tenths of a percent and spending jumped eight-tenths of a percent. The spending figure was revised downward from an earlier estimate of nine-tenths of a percent.

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Issues Decline in Profit Taking

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks fell yesterday as investors took profits from last week's advance and awaited today's economic report from the National Association of Purchasing Management.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed 22.54 points lower at 3,908.12, giving back nearly half of a 55-point surge Friday on a Government report showing strong third-quarter gross domestic product with mild inflation. 
 In the broader market, declining issues led advances, 1,160 to 1,047, with 302.8 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Analysts said the inflation-wary stock market was uneasy after the Chicago Purchasing Management Association said yesterday that its October business index rose to 64.3 from 63.3, a sign of continued economic strength.
The prices-paid component of the index rose to 72.5 from 72.1, showing "significant" price pressures building across the Midwest.
Analysts said the regional numbers could signal what to expect from the report by the National Association of Purchasing Management today.
In the inflation-sensitive bond market, the benchmark 30-year bond ended the day off 6/32 point. Its yield rose to 7.97 percent from 7.95 percent at Friday's close.
On the stock market, investors' uneasiness over interest rates kept stocks in check throughout the day, analysts said. Most of the Dow's drop came in the last half-hour of business, when computer-guided traders turned sellers, they said.
"Up until that last half-hour or so, the market, in spite of the fact it was down a little bit, looked pretty solid," said George Pirrone, senior trader at Dreyfus & Company.
With the bulk of third-quarter earnings reports already posted, investors now have little to distract them from their fixation on interest rates, analysts said.
On Friday, the Government will report October's employment rate, a key factor in calculating inflationary wage and price pressures.
"The market is just taking a breather," said Guy Truicko, equity portfolio manager at Unity Management. "They're going to look at the data this week and decide what to do."
Among individual stocks, the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation ended up 1/8, to 6 7/8, after saying it plans to offer a 19 percent stake in the Nabisco Holdings Corporation in an initial public offering.
RJR also said it was dropping plans to buy a 20 percent stake in Borden Inc. Borden fell 1/4, to 13 1/2.
Philip Morris Companies sank 2 7/8, to 61 1/8, on news of a decision by a Florida judge on Friday to certify a class-action lawsuit against major tobacco manufacturers.
The General Motors Corporation fell 7/8, to 39 1/2, on speculation that the auto maker would cut up to 60,000 vehicles from its fourth-quarter production plans, analysts said.

Mexican Drops Plan to Buy Most Westin Hotels

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 31

 BODY:
An ambitious young Mexican entrepreneur has abandoned his plan to purchase most of the Westin hotel chain for $708 million.
The entrepreneur, Bernardo Dominguez Cereceres, said today that he and his group of investors were pulling out of the deal because of rising interest rates, volatility of high-yield bond markets and Westin's inability to achieve the rates of return they had projected when the purchase was announced in February. 
 Officials at Westin's headquarters in Seattle were not immediately available for comment, but financial analysts believe that the company will try to find a new buyer for the hotels that were to have been sold to Mr. Dominguez.
In a statement, Mr. Dominguez, 33, said the group had raised $260 million of the equity portion of the purchase and was close to securing the rest through debt and other equity arrangements. He identified his partners as the Zullig Financial Group of Switzerland and four Mexican investors, whom he did not name.
His decision to pull out did not come as a surprise here. Mexican analysts believe that financial institutions were unwilling to lend Mr. Dominguez the money needed to complete the transaction because he had severely overextended himself on the deal.
Mr. Dominguez's seven-year-old company, DSC Ingenieria Inmobiliaria, is primarily involved in residential construction in Mexico. It also runs the small Qualton hotel chain, a travel agency and a few hardware stores.
When he announced on Feb. 14 that he would buy 74 Westin hotels in the United States, Mexico, South America and Europe for $708 million, Mr. Dominguez was portrayed as a brash new kind of Mexican businessman. His purchase of an international hotel chain, a month and a half after the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect, was seen as an indication that Mexican businesses would not be content simply to be acquired by others.
But financial analysts here said Mr. Dominguez may have acted too aggressively and had not built up sufficient confidence among Mexican and United States financial institutions to get the money he needed to buy Westin. The skepticism about his ability to close the deal was strengthened by a widespread belief that he was overpaying for Westin in offering the owner, Aoki of Japan, its full asking price, or close to it, while most bids were hundreds of millions of dollars lower.
In an interview at the time, Mr. Dominguez said he considered the Westin hotels a long-term investment that would greatly appreciate with time.
Analysts now say that his high purchase price may have made it impossible for the hotels to produce the kind of returns that would have made his investment profitable, especially as interest rates in the United States kept rising.
Aoki bought the entire hotel chain for $1.53 billion in 1988 but had trouble carrying the debt. Its deal with Mr. Dominguez did not include 14 Westin hotels in Asia and 6 in Canada.
The purchase was supposed to have been completed by June. Mr. Dominguez's lawyers could not say whether he would have to pay a penalty or to surrender his deposit for failing to complete the deal.

Green Point Savings Settles Depositor Suits

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The Green Point Savings Bank of Flushing, Queens, said yesterday that it had settled a series of lawsuits by depositors challenging the bank's conversion to public stock ownership.
Under the settlement, the bank will send depositors a coupon for $500 off the closing costs of a mortgage and offer them the right to invest in a five-and-a-half-year certificate of deposit with an interest rate that is 65/100 of a percentage point higher than the bank is providing on its five-year account. 
 Green Point will also pay the lawyers for the depositors fees of as much as $3.9 million and a further $150,000 in expenses. Terms of the settlement and lawyers' fees must be approved in Federal Court in Brooklyn at a hearing on Dec. 12.
"This is the close of the final chapter of the conversion," said Rich Humphrey, a senior vice president of Green Point. The bank says it has done nothing wrong but is settling the suit to avoid litigation.
Mr. Humphrey said the bank was completing a strategic plan to determine how to use the $800 million in capital it raised in the public offering. Most likely, it will acquire other banks or related financial companies, he said.
Green Point was a mutual savings bank -- meaning that it was not owned by shareholders but was responsible to depositors -- and was the largest such institution in the country. Its plan to convert to public ownership through a stock offering last fall was challenged because many members of the bank's management and board would have received millions of dollars in compensation.
In addition, the Republic New York Corporation made a hostile takeover offer for Green Point, in which it offered to pay extra interest to depositors.
Several lawsuits were filed last November challenging the management compensation and arguing that the Republic bid would have been better for depositors. The New York State Banking Department in January ultimately approved the offering, but canceled the management and director compensation plan.
The lawsuits lingered in the courts until the settlement yesterday.
The settlement is available to those with deposits at Green Point on Feb. 28, 1993, which was the deadline for participating in the public offering.

HEADLINE: Beating the Clock

 BODY:
Daylight is a gift of nature, but humans have successively taken it on themselves to measure, subdivide, standardize and even politicize nature's schedule. Once the motive was to help ancient Egyptian farmers predict the annual Nile flood. In modern times it is to synchronize everything from train schedules and prime-time television to working hours and private appointments.
Standardization has disconnected our clocks and our lives from strict local solar time as a sundial might measure it. It has also increasingly put governments in charge of the clock. That, along with increasing urbanization, made possible the 20th century's great leap forward in artificial time measurement -- daylight savings time. 
 The idea goes back at least to Benjamin Franklin. The purpose, then as now, was to economize on fuel for artificially lighting homes, businesses and public places in the evening. The opportunity comes from the early morning daylight "wasted" in summer, since most urban dwellers rise considerably later than the summer sun.
Of course, no daylight is actually saved or even shifted from morning to evening. The only things that actually spring ahead and fall back are the numbers on our clocks.
By World War I, fuel rationing and increased urbanization made Franklin's originally facetious proposal seem to some governments a practical necessity. Germany was the first country to officially establish daylight savings time, in 1915. Britain followed a year later. The U.S. Congress created both standard time zones and daylight savings time at a single stroke in March 1918.
Farmers and rural dwellers prefer living by the sun, and they got Congress to repeal the daylight savings provisions soon after the war. That left states and localities free to decide for themselves until Congress again stepped in and enacted year-round daylight time during World War II. With peace, local option returned. But since 1966, Congress has repeatedly tried to nudge the nation toward uniform timekeeping. Everywhere but Hawaii, Arizona and half of Indiana, clocks were turned back an hour on Sunday morning.
Some Americans have felt the change mainly through this week's dramatically earlier sunsets. Others are glad they no longer have to get up while it is still dark outside. But for most, Sunday morning offered the chance to savor that rarest of modern treats, one precise and precious hour liberated from the tyrannical thrall of man-made time.

HEADLINE: WARY OF EXPENSE, ARABS BLOCK PLAN FOR MIDEAST BANK

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CASABLANCA, Morocco, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries refused today to support a Clinton Administration proposal for a multibillion-dollar development bank for the Middle East, saying that their own economic problems make it difficult for them to put up the necessary money.
In a rebuff to the United States, the Arab countries said at an economic conference that while they support peace with Israel, they should not be expected to provide the financing for the bank because of their problems with mounting debts and low oil prices. 
 The Arab objections to the development bank came at the end of an unprecedented conference that brought hundreds of Israeli and Arab business and government officials together for two days of meetings and deal-making.
The idea for the development bank was strongly supported by Israel and advanced by Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the hope that it would be included as part of a communique at the end of the conference. The State Department spokesman, Michael McCurry, said tonight that he was "confident there will be a bank" eventually.
He said that a group of economic experts were studying the proposal to structure the bank in a way that would be acceptable to various parties. American officials said that they agreed with many objections raised by the Saudis but were confident they could be resolved.
The United States has recently presented Saudi Arabia with several requests for financial commitments, including requests to purchase American aircraft and arms, while the Saudis have been having difficulty meeting current payments on commitments already extended. The Saudis have been running budget deficits averaging $10 billion a year in recent years; the budget called for $42.6 billion in spending in 1994.
In a tour of the region last week, President Clinton met with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to reassure him of United States commitments to defend the Kingdom. But Arab officials here said that no discussion of the bank project took place.
The economic conference concluded today with an initial agreement to establish regional chambers of commerce and offices of tourism staffed by Israelis and Arabs as part of a broad five-page "Casablanca Declaration" outlining plans to cement peace talks between Arabs and Israelis with foreign participation in capital and expertise.
But the disagreement over the development bank highlighted the obstacles facing the conference's stated objective, which is to construct a network of private-sector projects and investments binding Israel's economy to that of the Arab world surrounding it.
Lack of money emerged as a separate hindrance to hopes for speeding the negotiations between Syria and Israel.
"We have an abundance of lending and financial aid institutions operating under capacity in the region," said Soleiman Soleim, Saudi Arabia's Commerce Minister, who argued that creating one more financial aid institution is a waste of time and effort that would be better used to activate dormant money that is under Arab control.
Other Arab delegates, speaking privately, said their countries support peace talks with Israel but argued that oil prices have been dropping or hovering at record low numbers for more than a decade. They said that the huge bank deposits they accumulated in the 1970's have been depleted by the cost of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980's and the Persian Gulf war in the 1990's.
Another strong United States plea to abolish totally the Arab boycott of Israeli businesses also met with considerable Arab resistance. The central Arab argument was that the political problems among Israel, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians needed to be resolved before the boycott could be further lifted.
Arab businessmen said that the initial contacts made here were a success and are bound to be pursued. But Arab politicians attending the conference and influencing its outcome also said political considerations take precedence at the moment.
"We cannot succeed by putting the cart before the horse," said Arab League Secretary General, Esmat Abdelmeguid. "A durable peace must be based on a just solution of land for peace and on the successful end of all Arab-Israeli talks." Mr. Abdelmeguid's comments, delivered to an audience of business investors and Israeli officials, reflected a general mood among Arab delegates.
Still the enthusiasm demonstrated by the hundreds of businessmen who flocked to the conference -- sponsored by the New York-based Council of Foreign Relations and the Geneva-based World Economic Forum -- suggested that the experience was widely seen an initial success.
"We are witnessing the birth of a new Middle East," said Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who sat next to Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, at the closing session of the conference this afternoon.
Of the Arabs, Morocco, Egypt and Jordan were the most eager to expand commercial ties with Israel.
"We have long spoken on the Middle East in conflict," said Amr Moussa, the Foreign Minister of Egypt. "Now, here, we are speaking about peace. I'm not saying we are dreaming but the view is clear ahead of hope in the future."
Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan called the conference "a civilized economic achievement," while King Hassan of Morocco said the peace negotiations with Israel were now irreversible.
Israel's business delegation arrived here with 140 ideas for joint projects, while a delegation of 100 Egyptian businessmen proposed some 50 business ventures in areas of agriculture, construction, tourism and manufacturing. There were many business card exchanges and long discussions over lunches and dinners.
"I think it is time for real cooperation to concentrate on the private sector in this region, on small projects to get people employed and get the economies rolling," said Omar Mohanna, an Egyptian investment banker.
Mr. Arafat succeeded in lobbying for an acceleration of financial aid meant to support the self rule of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho. He won support from the conference to oppose further closures of the borders of these areas by the Israeli Army, which barred Palestinians from entering Israel after recent attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians.
"It is important that the borders of the Palestinian territories be kept open for labor, tourism and trade to allow the Palestinian Authority, in partnership with its neighbors, the opportunity to build a viable economy in peace," one clause of the Casablanca Declaration read.

HEADLINE: Newsday Publisher Departs; Management Dispute Cited

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
The Times Mirror Company said yesterday that the publisher of Newsday had resigned "as a result of differences in business philosophy" with the company's senior management.
The move was surprising because it was evident that the publisher, Robert M. Johnson, 49, had not planned to leave the Long Island and New York City newspaper, and there had been no public signs of differences over business approach. 
 Some senior executives of the newspaper appeared to be shaken by the departure of Mr. Johnson, who had been publisher of Newsday since 1986, and uncertain what it meant.
Executives of Times Mirror and of Newsday said Mr. Johnson, who was also president of the newspaper, had negotiated a confidentiality agreement that barred both sides from discussing the reasons for his departure. Telephone calls to Mr. Johnson at his Newsday office were not returned.
Some newspaper executives and analysts suggested that the departure of Mr. Johnson represented a long overdue effort by Times Mirror to stanch multimillion-dollar losses at the newspaper's New York City edition and respond to sharp circulation losses that have affected Newsday for two years.
Times Mirror named Raymond A. Jansen, 55, publisher and chief executive of the company's Hartford Courant, as the new publisher, president and chief executive of Newsday, effective immediately.
The company also said that Mr. Johnson's deputy publisher, Steven L. Isenberg, 54, had been promoted to publisher of New York Newsday, and would report to Mr. Jansen.
Times Mirror executives said Mr. Isenberg's appointment, giving New York Newsday its own publisher, was intended as a signal that the company remained committed to the separate New York City edition, which it began in 1985.
For years, analysts have said that Times Mirror was counting on the death of either The Daily News or The New York Post in its planning for Newsday. The analysts have expressed skepticism about whether Times Mirror would continue to support New York Newsday as it became clear that the two other New York tabloids were resisting extinction.
The skepticism grew particularly intense last year when word leaked out that Mr. Johnson told his staff that New York Newsday had been losing $8 million to $14 million annually for years. Mr. Johnson's remarks drew particular attention because they came as Times Mirror was feeling increasing financial pressure from sharp advertising declines at many of its newspapers, especially its flagship paper, The Los Angeles Times.
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Jansen said his appointment did not signal any retreat by Times Mirror in New York City. "There will be two newspapers," he said, referring to the New York City and Long Island editions of Newsday. "There should be no misperception out there that I'm arriving on the scene to alter that."
But Mr. Jansen did not dispel the suggestion that his tenure might involve an effort to cut the financial losses in New York. In response to a question, he would not confirm that there had been losses. But he said, "Quite frankly, I'm not used to operating anything at a loss."
The change in publishers at Newsday came on the heels of unusually bad circulation reports for the entire newspaper industry this week. The paper's combined daily circulation for the six-month period that ended Sept. 30 dropped by 54,334, or 7.3 percent, to 693,556, compared with the period a year earlier.
Newsday's total daily circulation drop was the biggest, in terms of percentage, among the country's largest 25 newspapers. The New York Times, for example, reported a weekday circulation drop of 2.3 percent, while The Daily News slipped 1.1 percent.
Newsday's total Sunday circulation also shrank by 5.5 percent.
New York Newsday's circulation figures showed particularly sharp drops. The weekday circulation declined by 13 percent, to 230,150, and the Sunday circulation plunged by 14 percent, to 213,650.
In an interview last month, Mr. Johnson acknowledged that the circulation drops were a problem for the paper. But he noted that Newsday's advertising revenue, which fell along with the revenue of many other newspapers during the recession, have been rebounding lately.
Mr. Johnson said the circulation drops were tied in part to increases in newsstand and home delivery prices, as well as labor problems that disrupted distribution both in New York City and on Long Island.
Until yesterday, there had been no public indication that Times Mirror's top management in Los Angeles was deeply concerned about Mr. Johnson's handling of Newsday's problems. He was an ally of David Laventhol, a powerful Times Mirror executive, who was widely seen as the architect of Newsday's expensive gamble that it could build a valuable paper in New York City.
But health reasons forced Mr. Laventhol, once Newsday's publisher and most recently Times Mirror's president, to step down to lighter duties in December. Since then, there has been wide speculation in the newspaper industry about whether the next generation of Times Mirror leaders would be similarly committed to Newsday.
Mr. Johnson, a former labor lawyer with a tough manner, made some enemies. Yesterday, according to staff members who were present, the editor of New York Newsday, Donald Forst, said at a meeting that relations had become "scratchy" between Mr. Johnson and Times Mirror executives in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: MONEY;
Contractors For Albany Contribute To Both Parties

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL 

 BODY:
Election Day is approaching, and engineering consultants for the New York State Department of Transportation are already picking sides.
Steinman, Boynton, Gronquist & Birdsall, a firm with $84 million in state contracts, including major design and inspection work on East River bridges, is so far sticking with the incumbent, Mario M. Cuomo, and has made $16,000 in contributions to the Democratic State Committee. 
 Parsons, Brinkerhoff, Quade & Douglas, which has $63 million in state contracts, including design work on the Meadowbrook Parkway, is hedging: $1,000 for State Senator George E. Pataki, $1,000 to Mr. Cuomo, and just to make sure, $21,000 for the Democratic State Committee and $8,250 to the Republican State Committee.
These contributions, especially those to the incumbent Governor, are part of a pattern of political involvement by government contractors that has been a fixture for decades in New York State -- as well as other state capitals nationwide -- despite occasional investigations, good-government reports and legislative proposals.
Four out of every five firms with engineering contracts from two state agencies, the transportation department and the New York State Thruway Authority, in the last four years have contributed to the candidates for governor, many to both candidates. The contracts have been worth $1.8 billion.
Those contributions, like contributions over all, have been getting larger. The size of the average campaign contribution to Governor Cuomo, for example, has risen steadily, from $1,228 in 1982 to $2,002 so far this election.
A computer study by The New York Times shows that hundreds of lawyers, architects, engineers and construction companies with state contracts are making contributions of at least $500 to Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Pataki, as well as their state party committees: a total of $2 million in contributions during the last four years.
Mr. Cuomo has received contributions of at least $500 from 15 law firms, 35 architects, 70 engineering consultants, 31 construction companies, 17 companies that lease properties to the state and nearly all of the dozens of unions that receive state occupational health and safety grants from the state. In all, Mr. Cuomo and the State Democratic Committee have received $1.47 million from contractors since 1990.
And with the race a close one, Mr. Pataki and the State Republican Committee have received about as many contributions from contract holders as Mr. Cuomo. But they are smaller and far fewer of them are from engineers and architects. His campaign has contributions from 10 law firms, 16 consulting engineers and 9 architects with state contracts.
He has also received contributions from 52 companies with state construction contracts, which are usually put out for competitive bidding. Mr. Pataki and the State Republican Committee have received more than $563,000 since 1990.
"Why are the construction guys giving to Pataki?" asked Meyer S. Frucher, a longtime adviser to the Governor. "Because hope springs eternal. Why are the engineers and architects giving to Cuomo? Because he kept the industry alive while rebuilding the state during a depression in the construction industry. They are grateful."
But Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's deputy campaign manager, disputed that analysis. She said that Mr. Pataki has pledged to reduce the number of state consultants, including perhaps some architects and engineers. The contractors are supporting Mr. Pataki, she said, because he will revitalize the economy. "A revitalized economy will create jobs," she said.
The computer study reviewed 12 years of campaign filings by Mr. Cuomo and contributions to Mr. Pataki since 1990, along with most of the filings by the Democratic and Republican State Committees since 1982. It matched the campaign contributors to a state tape of contract records. The study did not attempt to match the names of partners and employees with their firms, and thus may understate the number of contractors who made contributions.
The study found more than 930 contractors who were also listed on campaign records since 1982, including 760 contractors who have held at least one contract during the last four years. These contractors made 3,800 separate contributions totaling about $6.9 million since 1982. They had contracts worth more than $7 billion, or $1,021 in contracts for each dollar in campaign contributions.
"It is the same old story: we have a campaign finance system that is out of control," said Travis B. Plunkett, the associate legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group. "Contractors with something to protect are going to give to those in power and those with a potential to get power."
During the late 1980's, after a political corruption scandal roiled New York City, a state ethics commission investigated the fund-raising practices of state office holders and found that the system "gives too much influence to wealthy favor seekers and too much advantage and temptation to incumbents."
In a report titled "The Midas Touch," the commission, headed by John D. Feerick, now dean of the Fordham University Law School, criticized the fund-raising of Mr. Cuomo and called for a ban on contributions from anyone doing business with the state, as well as for public campaign financing. Mr. Cuomo, who at the time had amassed a large surplus in campaign funds, supported the legislation and for a time, voluntarily abided by strict limits on spending.
But Mr. Cuomo later dropped the self-imposed restraints and Joel R. Benenson, his director of communications, last week defended the contributions from contractors. "If you say these people are beholden to the state for business, you are drawing an unwarranted conclusion," Mr. Benenson said. "These people happen to do business occasionally with the state. They have political interests and give money to a variety of candidates, including Democrats and Republicans."
Few state contractors were willing to discuss their contributions. Clough, Harbour & Associates, an Albany engineering firm, has given $45,000 in campaign contributions since 1989 and received $74 million in state contracts. Mr. Cuomo received $6,500; Mr. Pataki, $1,150. The rest went to the state committees, $2 to the Democratic committee for every $1 to the Republicans.
Ray Kinley, marketing director for the firm, said it supported both parties because "we have partners who have various feelings on both sides of the political scene." He said the partners viewed the contributions as "part of their community involvement."
At the State Department of Transportation, the chief spokesman, John Iaccio, a former scheduler for Mr. Cuomo, was on leave from his $62,500-a-year job to work on the campaign.
The deputy press spokesman, David Murray, said any campaign contribution "never enters into our consideration" when a contract is awarded. All contracts, he said, are screened by a committee that is not told the contractors' names.
Hodgson, Russ, Andrews, Woods & Goodyear, a large Buffalo law firm, has three state contracts worth $157,000 and has made $29,150 in contributions, most of it to the Republican State Committee. Mr. Cuomo and the Democratic State Committee received $1,000 each.
John C. Courtin, who chairs the firm's political and charitable contributions committee, said the contributions did not constitute an endorsement of any political candidates. "What motivates us more than anything else is who asks," he said. "If a client of long standing asks, we tend to say yes. If the Felix G. Rohatyn of Buffalo asks us to make a political contribution and he is a client, you say yes."
Unions, especially public employee unions, are among Governor Cuomo's strongest supporters. They give contributions to incumbent Republicans, too, and many also receive state contracts.
The United Federation of Teachers, along with its affiliates, has been one of the biggest campaign contributors in the state for years, and has given Mr. Cuomo and the Democratic State Committee more than $500,000 since 1992. The union is also among the largest beneficiaries of contracts from a state occupational safety program. Teachers' groups have received eight separate grants under the program since 1988, worth more than $900,000. They are used in part to train union leaders on asbestos issues.
Sandra Feldman, president of the union, said that there was "absolutely no connection whatever" between the grants and the union's contributions to candidates.
Ms. Feldman said that she favored government-financed campaigns. "But as long as businesses and rich individuals can make huge contributions," she added, "I don't see why unions shouldn't be able to."
Mr. Pataki opposes public financing of campaigns, but Ms. Mucha, his deputy campaign manager, said he would come out with a plan later, though she could not provide any details. Mr. Cuomo supports public financing of campaigns, but has no intention of turning away contributions from contractors.
"The preferred system is public financing of campaigns with strict contribution limits," said Mr. Benenson, the Governor's director of communications. "But the Governor is not, nor should any public official who supports campaign finance reform, going to disadvantage himself when the Republicans continue to block reforms. They have raised contributions from fat cats."
 
 
CAMPAIGN DIGEST: On the Trail
 Developments yesterday in campaigns in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
 
NEW YORK
 Governor: State Senator George E. Pataki dropped his insistence on a one-on-one debate and challenged Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to appear at a forum that would include B. Thomas Golisano, the independent fusion candidate. But Mr. Cuomo rebuffed his Republican rival, citing his longstanding position that he would attend only if all six gubernatorial candidates were invited.
Meanwhile, President Clinton, in the state two weeks ago for Mr. Cuomo, will make yet another appearance, this time at the State University at Albany on Thursday.
 
CONNECTICUT
Governor: A day after a state panel ordered them to do so, the Middlebury police refused to release a report on a domestic dispute between John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate for governor, and his former wife. It seemed unlikely the report would be made public before the election.
 
NEW JERSEY
United States Senate: Senator Frank R. Lautenberg pushed for voter turnout in cities as he criticized his Republican challenger for not repudiating Bob Grant, the WABC radio talk show host. Chuck Haytaian, continuing to press for his flat tax plan, said his rival was skirting the issues.

HEADLINE: Data Raise New Fears Of Inflation

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Fears of inflation and robust economic growth were rekindled in financial markets yesterday by two fresh economic reports, which sent stock and bond prices sharply lower.
Analysts said the new economic data increased the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would move soon to raise short-term interest rates -- perhaps as early as Friday -- and could move them higher than previously expected over the next six months. 
 An October survey of purchasing managers at more than 300 industrial companies showed that production had reached its highest level since December 1987. And the Government reported that construction spending posted its biggest gain in six months during September.
By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen 44.75 points, to 3,863.37. [Page D8.] Long-term bond prices plunged while long-term interest rates, which move in the opposite direction, surged back above 8 percent, to 8.06 percent. [Page D17.]
As recently as Friday, stock and bond traders seemed comfortable with the idea that the economy could grow at a relatively strong clip without a surge in inflation.
That sanguine view seemed to develop after the Commerce Department reported on Friday that the economy grew at a 3.4 percent clip in the third quarter while inflation remained in check. The report sent stock prices higher and the yield on the 30-year bond back below 8 percent.
The reverse in course yesterday seems to reflect how nervous investors are about inflation and how unsure they are about the economic outlook. That uncertainty makes it easy for the market to shift its course sharply from day to day as it digests new economic data.
As the first report on economic conditions during the month just ended, the purchasing managers survey is closely watched by private analysts and policy makers. Yesterday's report shows a manufacturing sector that not only was strong during October, but, the analysts say, shows no signs of slowing down.
"The strength of the manufacturing numbers greatly reinforces the probability the Fed will increase short-term rates by half a percentage point in November," said Paul D. Mastroddi, a managing director at J. P. Morgan & Company. "And it raises the possibility the pace of interest rate hikes may be accelerated over the next three months to six months."
Because of the economy's continued strength, analysts have been predicting for weeks that the Fed would raise its short-term interest rate target again in November, most likely after its policy-making Open Market Committee meets on Nov. 15. Since February the Fed has raised its target for the overnight Federal funds rate five times, or by 1.75 percentage points, to 4.75 percent currently.
Yesterday some analysts contended that the timing of another move could be moved up to Friday, when October's employment report from the Labor Department is released, if the report is strong.
"The case for a tightening was very clear before these numbers today," said Joseph D. Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "And if we get a strong employment number, that will be further evidence."
In its report yesterday, the National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly index of economic activity rose sharply, to 59.7 percent, from 58.2 percent in September, as production reached its highest level since December 1987.
A reading of more than 50 percent indicates a manufacturing expansion, while a reading of less than 50 percent indicates a contraction. The index has now been above the 50 percent level for 14 consecutive months.
The report on construction spending from the Commerce Department showed a larger-than-expected 1.6 percent increase in September, reversing course from an unchanged showing in August. The construction strength was widespread, ranging from housing to commercial real estate and public projects, the Government report showed.
To bond traders, who focus on signs of rising inflation, a big increase in the purchasing survey's price component, which in October rose to its highest level since July 1988, was especially worrisome.
All of the prices covered in the survey are commodities, and previous reports show they have been rising all year.
But analysts noted that prices companies paid for their raw materials increased at a faster rate than in previous months. Even though those price increases have not yet shown up in broader inflation measures, like the Producer Price Index, the analysts said that inflation pressures were building.
"Under the surface, we see pockets of inflation bubbling," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc.
However, many of these signs have been visible for months, and yet inflation has not accelerated appreciably even as the economy has continued to expand.
While puzzled by the development, most economists continue to expect the strength of the cyclical upswing will inevitably lift inflation.
But others are not so sure, and said yesterday's price report from the purchasing managers sent a false signal.
"Either I am missing something, or this index is vastly overstating what is going on," said Steven S. Roach, co-director of global economics at Morgan Stanley & Company.
In Mr. Roach's view, the report is consistent with "upstream pricing pressures" that he said had been in place for nearly two years.
"These pressures are being overwhelmed by the dramatic compression in labor costs," he said, "which account for about 70 percent of total production expenses."
Indeed, Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the purchasing group's business survey committee and procurement manager at the Oryx Energy Corporation, said that even though 19 of 20 industries reported paying higher prices in October, "our members are saying they are having a hard time passing through the price increases" to consumers.
But the comment was lost on bond traders. "If the price component starts to decline, people would start feeling better," Mr. Fine of Chase Securities said.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: CAMPAIGN DIGEST;
On the Trail

 BODY:
Developments yesterday in campaigns across the country.
VIRGINIA -- A computer check of state and Federal election commission reports by the Rainbow Coalition has found that more than 40 contributors to previous political campaigns of David Duke in Louisiana have donated a combined $38,000 -- more than twice what they gave Mr. Duke -- to Oliver L. North, the Republican trying to unseat Senator Charles S. Robb, a Democrat. A North campaign spokesman, Mark Merritt, said the money from Duke supporters was unsolicited and came as something of a surprise. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, president of the Rainbow Coalition, said the crossover suggested "an ideological kinship" between Mr. Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, and Mr. North. Mr. North called Mr. Jackson's assertion "fear mongering."
MARYLAND -- Eighty-two percent of black voters in Maryland back the Democratic candidate for governor, Parris Glendening, preferring him 9 to 1 over his Republican opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, The Washington Post reported. The newspaper said only 9 percent of black voters polled in a random telephone survey of 808 registered voters Oct. 8-11 backed Ms. Sauerbrey, whom white voters supported 46 percent to 44 percent for Mr. Glendening. Mr. Glendening courted black leaders, winning the early endorsement of Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore by promising expanded state aid and a renewed effort to stimulate economic development in the city. Blacks make up one quarter of Maryland's population. 
 NEBRASKA -- The Republican candidate for governor, Gene Spence, asserts that he has been abandoned by members of his own party because they do not think he is tough enough in opposing abortion. Mr. Spence, who trailed Gov. Ben Nelson by 44 points in a poll published over the weekend by The Omaha World Herald, said, "I'm all the Republican Party has, and they better get used to it."
GEORGIA -- Gov. Zell Miller is being attacked in television advertisements by his Republican challenger, Guy Millner, for trying to remove the Confederate battle flag's design from the state flag. Although Mr. Millner himself has called the flag debate divisive, the announcer in his new advertisements says of Governor Miller, "He thinks we won't remember his broken promises -- how he increased our hunting and fishing fees and even attacked our flag." Mr. Miller tried to remove the Confederate symbol in 1993 but met a strong backlash from whites and failed to win legislative approval.
RHODE ISLAND -- Seeking a House seat, Patrick Kennedy is running well ahead of his Republican challenger, Dr. Kevin Vigilante, according to a new poll. The survey of 369 likely voters gave Mr. Kennedy, a three-term State Representative from Providence, 52 percent to 37 percent for Dr. Vigilante of Pawtucket. Eleven percent are undecided.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: MAYOR;
Out of State, Giuliani Shows Party Loyalty

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Nov. 1

 BODY:
A week after his dramatic stretch across party lines to support Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani bolstered his Republican credentials today by campaigning for the party's candidates in predominantly Italian neighborhoods of Boston and Rhode Island. But everywhere he went, it was his endorsement of Mr. Cuomo that lingered on people's minds.
At Joe Tecce's Ristorante in Boston, a longtime political haunt, the elderly Joe Tecce himself watched Mr. Giuliani enter to stump for Ralph C. Martin 2d, the Suffolk County District Attorney. "Best job you ever did to endorse Cuomo," said Mr. Tecce, who went on to mangle the Mayor's name as Giuliano, as he predicted he would be New York's governor some day. 
 Moments later, Mr. Martin, standing next to Mr. Giuliani, became momentarily nonplused when a television reporter asked him, "Does this embrace make you the Mario Cuomo of Suffolk County politics?"
"Maybe in the reverse sense," answered Mr. Martin, a Republican who was appointed to his post by the Republican Governor of Massachusetts, William F. Weld, and is facing a Democratic challenge.
Even Mr. Giuliani's signature issue of law and order could not distract his listeners from politics. At a forum on crime sponsored by The Boston Herald, Mr. Giuliani spoke at length about his law-enforcement strategies. But most questioners sought to pin him down on where he stood within the Republican Party.
Ever more passionate about his decision to oppose State Senator George E. Pataki, Mr. Giuliani denounced excessive partisanship. "Even if the candidate of your party has the right philosophy but is an incompetent, let's say," Mr. Giuliani said, quickly adding that he was not speaking of anyone in particular, "it would be a mistake even to move your philosophy to elect someone who is an incompetent." He said it would cause a backlash against the party and its cause.
Further setting himself apart from conservative Republicans, Mr. Giuliani condemned Proposition 187 in California, a ballot initiative that would require the state's schools, hospitals and other institutions to deny services to illegal immigrants. And he spoke out against the "Contract with America," which was conceived by Representative Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, and put 300 Republican candidates for the House of Representatives on record supporting both tax cuts and a balanced budget.
"I think it's a mistake to do something like that," Mr. Giuliani said. "I think it's a mistake to try to get a certain number of members of Congress to have to adhere to very rigid principles that they don't actually agree with. It's attempting to try to much more rigidly define Republicans and it sounded like the economic projections don't work."
While he was campaigning in Boston and across Rhode Island, Mr. Giuliani came under attack by Republicans home in New York.
A day after a Federal appeals court reversed the mail-fraud conviction of Armand P. D'Amato, the brother of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Armand D'Amato said he had been the subject of "a baseless prosecution comparable to the ones Rudy Guiliani brought against innocent people on Wall Street" as United States Attorney.
Reading a statement in front of the Federal courthouse in Manhattan, Mr. D'Amato said, "It is no coincidence that right after Rudy Giuliani became Mario Cuomo's campaign manager, commercials started to appear attacking me."
In between fund-raisers for Lincoln C. Almond, the Republican candidate for governor of Rhode Island, Mr. Giuliani said he would not respond to Mr. D'Amato.
But Mr. Giuliani, who has been trying to persuade fellow Republicans to distance themselves from Mr. Pataki, called for a "realignment" of the New York State Republican Party after Election Day and said that he would have a role to play. "I don't by any means intend to play the only role," he said. "I don't think any one person should control a political party. I think that's part of the mistake that was made here," he said, in a reference to Senator D'Amato, his political rival.
Governor Weld of Massachusetts, who like Mr. Almond served in the Justice Department with Mr. Giuliani, called himself both a Pataki backer and a Giuliani backer. "By and large Rudy has superb taste in politics and even Jove can nod," he said, a reference to Greek mythology suggesting that even the mightiest can make mistakes.
 
 
In Their Own Words
GOV. MARIO M. CUOMO
 After arriving late at an appearance at New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center because his helicopter encountered bad weather on a flight from Albany:
"I'm glad I'm here at all. We were traveling around for over an hour. We did not know where we were going. We were lost in a fog. I did not know how it would come out. It was a lot like the beginning of my campaign. "
 STATE SENATOR GEORGE E. PATAKI
 On being asked about poll numbers that show he is trailing Mr. Cuomo:
"When Rudy Giuliani endorsed Mario Cuomo, a large number of people moved into the undecided category and now they're are saying, 'I want to take another look at Pataki.' We're very optimistic at the enthusiasm of the crowds, and that the majority of the people won't support Mario Cuomo. "

HEADLINE: Short of Cash, N.A.A.C.P. Stops Paying Its Employees

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1

 BODY:
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, its reserves of cash depleted, has stopped paying most of its professional staff, board members of the nation's preeminent civil rights organization said today.
The furlough took effect on Monday, and although officials of the group said they hoped it would last no more than a week or two, it showed the depth of the financial crisis gripping the organization after accusations of financial abuses by some of its leaders. 
 The N.A.A.C.P., with a national staff of about 100 people and an annual budget of about $15 million, is facing a growing deficit that already exceeds $3.5 million, officials said. Major contributors and individual members, their confidence shaken by the group's widely publicized turmoil, have been reluctant to donate money to make up the gap.
The group's local affiliates are principally volunteer organizations that raise their own money and operate under independent budgets. They are not directly affected by the national group's financial troubles.
Officials at the organization's headquarters in Baltimore did not answer their telephones today, but at offices around the country members of the staff were continuing to work without pay.
"Basically, we are volunteering our time," said Rob Robinson, a staff member in the New York office. "While we are having financial difficulties, we recognize the job we do is important."
The only staff members who continue to be paid are those whose work is financed through special, restricted grants made for specific purposes, board members said.
Several board members voiced dismay at the furlough, saying that staff members were informed of it by telephone over the weekend and that little information was available even to board members.
The board members said that the group's executive committee decided on the furlough over the weekend, after auditors from the accounting firm Price Waterhouse recommended it.
The accounting firm, which is not the group's regular independent auditor, was brought in on an emergency basis to review the group's finances, the board members said.
They also said that the Ford Foundation, a major donor to the association, had agreed to resume financing for the organization's operations once Price Waterhouse's recommendations are put into effect.
Spokesmen for the Ford Foundation and Price Waterhouse declined to disclose any details of the arrangements, which board members said were intended to allow the N.A.A.C.P. to resume normal operations, begin paying off its accumulating bills, and most critically of all, increase its fund-raising activities.
But the board members conceded that raising money will be difficult.
In August, the N.A.A.C.P.'s board dismissed the organization's executive director, Benjamin F. Chavis Jr., after directors learned that he had approved the spending of hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle a threatened sexual harassment suit.
More recently, the syndicated columnist Carl Rowan renewed the criticisms of the group's leaders, asserting that William F. Gibson, the board chairman, may have misused his expense account, a charge that Mr. Gibson has denied.
Joe Madison, an N.A.A.C.P. board member in Washington who spent 10 years as a political organizer on the group's staff, said that the furloughs might hurt the group's efforts to get voters to the polls next week, but he said that he expected most of the staff to keep working.
More important, he said, is the group's efforts to restore its reputation, especially because the end of the year is the time when, for tax reasons, many individual contributors decide how much money to give to charities.
"What the N.A.A.C.P. needs to do is to restore a sense of confidence in its leadership," he said.
Mr. Gibson, the board chairman, has called for special audits of the spending of all top officials, but Mr. Madison said that in his opinion Mr. Gibson should resign. Mr. Gibson could not be reached for comment.
Hazel Dukes, another board member, said that staff members were bitter about their treatment and that she had apologized to those with whom she works in New York.
Another board member, who insisted on anonymity, said that senior staff members had a "heated meeting" with Earl Shinhoster, the interim leader, on Monday, complaining about the emergency measures.
Only a few days ago, Mr. Shinhoster and Mr. Gibson kicked off a nationwide appeal for support with a half-hour radio broadcast from the Pittsburgh headquarters of the American Urban Radio Networks, whose 250 stations are focused on African-American audiences.
The group's radio campaign, announced two weeks ago, takes as its theme: "Imagine an America without an N.A.A.C.P."
Attracting new members is critical to the group's success, since nearly three-fourths of the national group's annual budget comes from memberships and individual donations.
But it is the local branches, youth councils and college chapters, that actually sign up the members and funnel the money to the national headquarters. The national group focuses on politics, legal cases, and other activities that require a professional staff.

HEADLINE: Stock Offer Is Postponed At Flushing

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The Flushing Savings Bank said yesterday that it had indefinitely postponed its initial stock offering because of an investigation by the Federal Government into apparent voting irregularities by depositors and what the bank called "uncertain market conditions."
Flushing is a mutual savings bank, meaning that it is not owned by shareholders. Several other recent attempts by mutual banks to convert to public ownership have foundered. 
 Last week, for example, the Carver Federal Savings Bank in New York issued stock at $10 a share, only to see the price fall to $7.75 on the first day of trading.
During the last several years, many mutual savings banks have converted to public ownership, offering stock that jumped as much as 40 percent immediately after it was issued. This year regulators have forced savings banks to raise their issue prices to avoid such quick jumps.
Regulators have also forced the banks to cut back on the compensation given to their managers and directors. At the same time, because of higher interest rates, investors have soured on the prospects for the savings bank industry.
As a result, a handful of mutual banks have canceled planned offerings; Flushing is the biggest to do so.
"They got caught between the Government pushing prices up and up, while the market is saying thrifts are already overvalued," said Christopher Quackenbush, a principal with Sandler O'Neill, a New York investment bank.
Flushing, in its original offering plan begun last year, hoped to raise $63 million, but the Government forced the bank to raise the amount to $74 million. The bank held a second meeting of depositors in September to approve that higher amount.
The bank was required to complete its issue by Oct. 31, or ask for a third vote by depositors.
In a statement, the bank said, "Certain issues have been raised with respect to alleged irregularities in connection with proxies voted" at the depositors meeting. It said the Office of Thrift Supervision, a Federal agency, was reviewing the matter and the bank had hired an independent expert to conduct an investigation.
"Faced by the absence of a final resolution of the O.T.S. review and uncertain market conditions, the board has determined that it is in the best interest of the bank and the subscribers in the conversion not to proceed," the bank said in the statement.
Officials of Flushing did not return telephone calls seeking comment. A spokeswoman for Advest Securities, the investment banker for Flushing, declined to comment. A spokesman for the Office of Thrift Supervision declined to comment on any investigation.
Flushing, based in Flushing, Queens, has seven branches and total assets of $598 million.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: IN THEIR OWN WORDS;
Excerpts From Candidates' Speeches in the Gingrich-Jones Race in Georgia

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 1

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from speeches by Representative Newt Gingrich, the House minority leader, who is seeking re-election in Georgia, and his Democratic challenger, Ben Jones, a former Representative. They provide examples of the messages each candidate is delivering in his standard campaign speech. Mr. Gingrich spoke on Oct. 24 to a Kiwanis Club in Duluth, Ga., and Mr. Jones spoke on Oct. 25 at Kennesaw State College in Cobb County, Ga. The speeches were recorded for C-Span and transcribed by The New York Times.
 
NEWT GINGRICH
 Now, let me be quite direct about this. We have, I think, a crisis of the system at two levels. One level is that we can't afford the current structure of Government unless we were to massively raise taxes and crush the private sector. The other problem you have is the current structure of Government doesn't work. So, you are paying too much for a system that's destructive. The problem in Washington -- and those of you who might have seen Tim Russert go at me on "Meet the Press" will appreciate where we're at -- the problem in Washington is that they start with an assumption: this Government can't be changed. Therefore, how do we get more out of the American people? And they either get more out of the American people by not sending them back their own money -- cutting entitlements, cutting Social Security -- or we get more out of them by raising taxes. 
 I start from a totally different perspective. And I want to share with you very candidly and get your reaction to it. Because this is at the heart of where I need your advice and I need your counsel. Because getting this country back on the right track is a heck of a lot bigger job than one member of Congress, or one President, or even an entire party. This is a job that is going to require all 260 million Americans to take some serious responsibility for their future. . . .
We have to recognize that American exceptionalism is real, that American civilization is the most unique civilization in history, that we bring more people of more ethnic backgrounds together to pursue happiness with greater opportunity than any civilization in the history of the world. And we just don't say that anymore. Let me be candid. Haitians have more to learn from America than Americans have to learn from Haitians. The same is true of Bosnia. As far as I'm concerned, this counterculture notion, this politically correct notion that, "Oh, gee, we shouldn't make any value judgments," that's silly. The Declaration of Independence is a value judgment. It says we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Well, if you think of that, it's the most radical statement of humanness in history. It says each of you is endowed by God. Not by the state, not by Government, not by the liberals, not by bureaucracy, not by lawyers; by God. And therefore, by the way, when you rape somebody, you're raping somebody who's been endowed by God. If you kill somebody, you're killing somebody who's been endowed by God. That's why this whole sense of safety is at the center of the American experience. But so is a sense of work. If you're not working, you are wasting something which has been endowed. So we've got to go back, I think, and have the moral courage to say: "Yeah, we're going to teach people to be American. We're going to teach people the values of work. We're going to teach people the systems that work. And we're going to renew the 300-year commitment to human opportunity."
Lastly, we have to recognize that the political class has failed. As George Will says brilliantly in a column yesterday, the objective fact is the political class across this country, from city council to county commission to state government to the Federal Government, has failed to be responsive to people the way it needs to be, and that we are going to have to literally go and look at, from the ground up, how to make it more open. You see it beginning to happen. City councils that are on local cable access is a good step. We're going to insist that the rules be changed such that if you file a bill or a conference report in Washington in print, you also have to file the conference report electronically so that at that second, anybody in the country who wants to can get a copy of it. And you begin to change the whole dynamics so insiders no longer have any special advantage.
 
BEN JONES
 My politics are pretty independent. It's easy, I think, in the political discourse just to divide everything up and say: "Oh, he's a Democrat. Tax and spend. Big social welfare programs. Da, da, da, da, da." Or: "I'm a Republican. Vote for me. I'll cut your taxes. Da, da, da, da, da." Well, it doesn't work that way and never has. It's true, I think, that the Democratic leadership is to the left of center. And I think that the Republican leadership, clearly, is to the right of center. But most Americans and most folks in both parties who consider themselves to be Democrats or Republicans are in the mainstream. Folks who just have to work for a living, pay taxes, raise kids, get them through school, take care of your health care bills and worry about crime in your neighborhood. And what we're looking for are solutions.
So I vote, myself, as pretty much of a mainstream legislator, independent. We put an emphasis on constituent service, and nobody did constituent services any better than we did when I represented the old Fourth District. And by that I mean helping people in their dealings with the Government. That's really the first job of a Congressional office. If you've got a problem with Social Security, the Veterans Administration, Environmental Protection Agency or the Highway Department, or the Food and Drug Administration, call your Congressman. That's what you're paying your tax money for.
I said when we went into our office that this isn't really a business, this is public sector, but I want it run like a business. And let us understand that taxpayers are not only our customers, they are also our employers. We work for them. And we tried not to forget that. And we had an extremely successful office in that way, responsive to the people. And we did the outreach things. We had export-import seminars. We had wetlands symposiums. We had small-business forums. We had Medicare seminars for senior citizens all over the district. We had symposiums for people who were looking for ways to fund their higher education, ways that they could get that support. So we were very pro active that way.
I had the best environmental record of any Georgia Congressman. I had the best record on real estate and home building of any Georgia Congressman. I think I had as good a record on civil rights and human rights as any Georgia Congressman. I'm pro-choice. If those things make me a liberal, I accept.
On the other hand, I support a balanced budget amendment, a pretty conservative position. My feeling is that had we had a balanced budget amendment in 1980, we wouldn't be $4.5 trillion in debt. We need that kind of fiscal discipline and restraint. I support a lower capital gains rate. I think that's good. That's good for savings, and that's good for investment, and that's good for the economy.
I supported the Persian Gulf war. And I think that was the right choice. It was not popular among a lot of my friends who are Democrats, but I thought that was the right choice at the time, and I was pretty hawkish about it, in fact.
I support capital punishment in a lot of cases, not just in some cases. I do believe it is a deterrent. And I think that with the situation that we have now in this country with crime and drugs, we have to be tough. And that's as tough as you can get. There were other things like that that made me not easily characterized politically, certainly not as some knee-jerk liberal.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR;
Cut-and-Spend Democrat Lags in Connecticut

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 1

 BODY:
William E. Curry Jr., the State Comptroller who is running for governor of Connecticut as a "New Democrat," is the only one among the four candidates talking about creating ambitious new programs. "This is not about changing governors, but about changing government," he often says.
That message, however, has not been an easy sell for Mr. Curry, who has never risen above 28 percent in the polls in a state where 38 percent of registered voters are Democrats. 
 On a recent campaign bus tour of college campuses, he stopped at Capital Community Technical College and described his plan for a new trust fund that he said would guarantee college loans while costing taxpayers barely a penny.
The 80 students and professors listening clapped politely, but not passionately. Michelle Cassells, 19, a sophomore who lives in Hartford, was plainly not moved.
"That's all stuff we've heard before," she said. "Right now, it's just a matter of choosing the one who lies the least."
Like President Clinton, Mr. Curry is offering himself as a different sort of Democrat, a compassionate technocrat who will reshape government and expand services as he trims spending and cuts taxes. And Mr. Curry appears to be having the same trouble the President has in convincing voters that government can take on new challenges.
Still, while many Democrats are running away from the President, Mr. Curry has embraced him, inviting him here and welcoming him warmly when he arrived on Oct. 15. "It will help to be identified with him," Mr. Curry said recently.
But his Republican adversary, John G. Rowland, also said Mr. Clinton should visit more often. "We'd like President Clinton to stay until Nov. 8," he said, noting that he was eager to capitalize on voter disaffection with the President.
Mr. Rowland has broadcast an advertisement showing the two Democrats together, with a voice-over that says: "Connecticut can't afford another double-talking Bill."
While the election is more than a referendum on President Clinton, Mr. Curry's fate turns on the appeal of the same message of change that Mr. Clinton has used.
A cerebral candidate known for his verbosity, Mr. Curry speaks grandly about a "fundamental restructuring of the bureaucracy," "community empowerment" and altering "the basic distribution of power, opportunity and access."
The backbone of his campaign is a strong grass-roots field organization of unions and consumer, environmental and women's groups.
What Mr. Curry offers is this: a 25 percent cut in property taxes that involves establishing a dedicated account for use by towns and cities; state-guaranteed student loans administered by banks; using state-sponsored insurance buying pools to lower health-care costs, and fighting crime through tougher enforcement and more education and drug-treatment programs.
Mr. Curry's three opponents see very little new in this and dismiss him as just another tax-and-spend liberal. Critics question his pledge to reduce property taxes without raising other taxes. Even leading Democrats are skeptical that he can cut $1 billion from a state budget of roughly $9 billion.
Still, Mr. Curry attracted enough support to pull off a surprising primary victory over a party-endorsed candidate. And while Mr. Rowland has always led in the polls, Mr. Curry has narrowed the gap in the last two months to single digits from as many as 28 points.
If Mr. Curry defeats the better-financed, better-known Republican, it will be a major political upset. But for William Edward Curry Jr., such underdog struggles have been his mainstay.
Born in Hartford on Dec. 17, 1951, he was the son of a prominent Democratic Party activist who was the campaign manager for the first black elected to the State Legislature.
After graduating from Georgetown University and the University of Connecticut Law School, Mr. Curry won a primary in 1978 against a party-endorsed candidate for state senator and then defeated a veteran Republican incumbent.
In four years in the State Senate, he established a reputation as an abrasive media hound who fought for liberal causes and good-government measures. He proposed tighter environmental regulations, pushed a measure to force businesses to give six months' notice before closing plants and passed legislation requiring regular reviews of government programs to reduce bureaucracy.
Mr. Curry left the Legislature in 1982 to run for Congress. After he lost, he worked for two years as executive director of the nuclear weapons freeze movement's political action committee.
Returning to politics in 1990, he unseated the four-term Democratic State Comptroller, Ed Caldwell.
Now, Mr. Curry is in a four-way race for governor with Mr. Rowland; Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, who succeeds Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. as the nominee of A Connecticut Party, and Tom Scott of the Independence Party.
For the last two months, Mr. Curry has struggled with Mr. Rowland over how he will be defined to voters. The Republican has portrayed him as a liberal, while Mr. Curry has cultivated an image of being a hands-on manager.
Mr. Rowland, whose $3.3 million war chest is more than a third larger than Mr. Curry's, has saturated television with ads that trumpet Mr. Curry's votes as a State Senator for 17 tax increases and against the death penalty. At campaign appearances, Mr. Rowland has pointed to Mr. Curry's strong labor support, suggesting that he would be beholden to them if elected.
Mr. Curry has countered that the tax votes were long ago in a very different economy, and has said that he changed his position on the death penalty in the early 1980's.
And at a recent talk to the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, the state's largest business group, Mr. Curry contended that his support from labor did not make him an enemy of business.
"I know how important my relationship is with this community," he said. "This is a relationship I will nurture."
Harry Kenworthy, a vice president of a manufacturing company, said he liked what he heard but still felt uneasy. "Folks generally perceive Bill as a very liberal guy," he said.
In an interview in September, Mr. Curry expressed annoyance at the liberal tag. He said that he had had substantial differences with liberal groups over the last four years, particularly on his support of a market-based health-care overhaul.
As Comptroller, Mr. Curry is generally credited with transforming a backwater office into a high-profile operation. He established an investigative unit that exposed a multimillion-dollar state furniture contract that was about to go to a high bidder. He also helped improve the state's computer billing operations.
Still, his record is not entirely unblemished.
Mr. Curry stunned many liberal legislators in 1991 by opposing Governor Weicker's plan to introduce an income tax to rid the state of a $1 billion deficit. Mr. Curry said he supported the principle, but not that particular version. He later issued budget analyses showing that it would not resolve the deficit, a projection that proved wrong.
Some legislators accused Mr. Curry of grandstanding, though he insisted it was a matter of wanting an income tax that would weigh less on working people. His actions so angered legislators that they voted to strip him of his power to issue official budget analyses.
While Mr. Curry now opposes repealing the tax -- a stark contrast with the positions of Mr. Rowland and Mr. Scott -- he has avoided focusing on this in the campaign. Instead, he has tried to shift the debate to the property tax, which many say is a heavier burden on the poor and middle class.
Mr. Curry has said that by the end of his first term as governor he will send about $1 billion back to the towns and cities in property tax relief, without any cuts in state services. But critics say they don't see how it can be done.
And despite Mr. Curry's pledge of fiscal conservatism, he has conceded that some programs would need more spending. To add beds for drug treatment would cost money, he said in an interview in September. A campaign leaflet promises to increase financing for state schools.
And Mr. Curry has said he would have honored the arbitrated agreements with state employees unions that Governor Weicker opposed, costing about $100 million.
While Mr. Curry has said that such money would come from savings elsewhere, his message of doing more with less has not yet caught fire. John F. Droney Jr., a former state Democratic Party chairman, blamed Mr. Curry's lack of money to advertise and predicted it would change this week with a media blitz.
But this problem may also be the same that the President is facing -- a deep distrust in the electorate about new government initiatives.
This morning on a talk-radio show, Mr. Curry fielded calls about his property tax proposal.
One caller complained that funneling state money to a dedicated account for local government would be prone to waste.
"It's the same old bureaucracy," she said.
Mr. Curry explained that local officials would monitor the fund and that the municipalities could get the money only if they reduced their property-tax rates.
"For senior citizens, for poor people, for working people, dollar for dollar, it's the property tax that hits them hardest," he said.
Another caller weighed in. "It sounds like rhetoric to me," he said.
Mr. Curry said last week that his message was reaching people, though he noted that complex ideas weremaking them a tough sell.
He said he has put out detailed proposals on crime and economic development, and they were barely noticed.
"Between the two of them, for all the months of work that went into them, literally, it might have gotten me a percent more recognition," he said.

HEADLINE: Class Notes

BYLINE: By Peter Applebome 

 BODY:
Very little is more in tune with popular fashion these days than the notion that private companies can provide public services -- from picking up garbage to educating children -- at higher quality and lower cost than public institutions.
Take the Edison Project, the high-profile, high-risk attempt of the media entrepreneur Christopher Whittle to revamp the nation's schools. But if Edison's struggle to survive the collapse or sale of the rest of Mr. Whittle's empire tells anything, it is that the prevailing "government bad, private enterprise good" formulation driving the nation's send-them-a-message politics can speak more to slogans than to solutions. 
 The appeal of private management in education rests on the notion that American schools are failing and that something radical is needed to save them.
"What's interesting to me is to hear people saying that we need to give more money and time to the people who are running things now," said Michael Moe, a financial analyst with Lehman Brothers, who follows trends in for-profit education. "The one thing I know for sure is that's not the answer. Just going back to basic principles of what works: basic capitalism works, competition works, accountability works, leveraging through technology works. And that seems to be a lot of what Edison is doing."
But many education experts, even many sympathetic to corporate involvement in education, think private management of school districts is better in theory than in reality.
One obstacle is the way the American corporate life style clashes headlong with the culture of public education. In fact, from his estate in the Hamptons to his corporate jets to his lavish corporate retreats to his largely empty corporate complex in Knoxville, Tenn., Mr. Whittle is a reminder that the perks like free parking and health insurance deemed proof of an imperial Congress are laughably picayune when compared with life at the upper echelons of corporate America.
Denis P. Doyle, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, thinks that taxpayers will balk at seeing education dollars go to Wall Street investors and six- and seven-figure corporate salaries.
"I think it's an absolutely futile quest," said Mr. Doyle, who is an enthusiastic supporter of many private-sector educational initiatives but is skeptical about for-profit concerns' running districts and schools. "The American public has no taste for making a profit on our kids."
Second, Mr. Doyle, among others, is skeptical that private enterprise can produce innovations and efficiencies that are superior to those being produced by nonprofit organizations, many of which are scrambling to come up with their own school reform models. Edison, after all, has spent $40 million since 1991 without opening a single school.
Mr. Doyle notes that for-profit concerns must not only pay taxes on earnings and property but also generate returns that will please their investors. As a result, he estimates, they are burdened with expenses that can exceed those of nonprofits by 30 percent to 50 percent.
"Venture capitalists are going to want a 15-to-20-percent rate of return," he said. "There's no way you can take that kind of profit out and compete with a not-for-profit provider."
A third question is just how much profit can be made to begin with. Almost everyone agrees that districts can be run more efficiently, and corporations are already playing a role in such efforts in areas from tutoring to school security to trash pickup to computer programs. But whether for-profit management can turn substantial profits -- when even the best private schools struggle to keep their budgets balanced -- is a very open question.
"Any good private-sector manager can do a better job of building maintenance, logistical things like buses and purchasing than the public schools in most places do," said Henry Levin, a Stanford University economist who founded Stanford's Accelerated Schools program, which works with troubled students in 700 schools. "But that's a small portion of the overall budget. I don't see anyone that's shown yet how you make a profit on public schools."
To their credit, Edison and Education Alternatives Inc., the for-profit concern recently hired to manage the Hartford public schools, are not saying that for-profit management alone is the answer. Instead, they say that at a time when radical approaches are needed, the management skills, the accountability and the access to capital that businesses can provide are an important avenue for producing innovation and change.
And many educators believe that only by coming up with radically different management models, like for-profit management, can education undergo dramatic change.
"Right now we have no incentives for schools to do a good job," said Eric Hanushek, an economist at the University of Rochester. "I don't know for sure that for-profit firms like Edison will succeed. But I think the bottom line is that 10 years from now we will have a variety of different ways of providing educational services, and I don't think there's any reason to think that a profit-making firm is incompatible with providing them."
It may turn out that Edison will be able to put a computer in every child's home, lengthen the school day and the school year, pay teachers more than they are paid now, provide "the best education in the world" for the same money public schools spend now and turn a profit that will thrill Wall Street. But most smart investors are well aware that politicians are not the only ones who have been accused of promising first and figuring out how to deliver later.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Continuing To Retreat

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices continued falling in the credit markets yesterday, as investors reacted to economic reports that showed rapid growth, portending future inflation.
Although analysts say that the probability that the Federal Reserve will move to raise short-term rates again before the Nov. 15 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee is fading, traders are still worried about how aggressive the central bank will be in raising rates to fight inflation this year. 
 The most troubling issue is that the Fed has already raised interest rates five times this year, and the effect so far has not been telling, some traders say. It leaves investors wondering if last Friday's rally was only a brief vacation from the bearish trend that re-emerged yesterday.
Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist at CS First Boston, said it was a tough day with a lot of volatility, and now, "We're back to where we were last week before the third-quarter G.D.P. on Friday and close to our recent high yields."
The long bond was back above an 8 percent yield even before the National Association of Purchasing Management released its report on business activity. It was expected to stay little changed in October from its 58.2 percent reading in September, but rose to 59.7, its highest level since December 1987, pushing bond prices down and yields up. The 30-year bond was off 29/32 , to 9323/32 , for a yield of 8.06 percent, up from 7.97 percent on Monday and the highest since last Wednesday, when it was also 8.06 percent.
Mr. Alexy said yesterday's market might be systematic of what the market goes through until mid-December. Prices fell early on "the dollar's weakness in overseas markets," he said. Then the purchasing managers' report pushed them further down.
Traders note that data on the manufacturing sector have regularly exceeded expectations in recent months, so they expected it would be tough to find buyers with yesterday's numbers. According to James Hale, MMS International fixed-income analyst, "Not only did the price index jump to 79.9 percent, but supplier delivery time also hit a six-year high at 64.7 percent -- a likely sign of inflationary bottlenecks developing." He said while employment did edge down, it was overshadowed by strength elsewhere in the data. "The report was unambiguously bearish for bonds," he said.
Today the Fed will give the market a glimpse of how it views the economy going into the F.O.M.C. meeting when it releases its so-called beige book report. Also due today is the Treasury's announcement of the size of the quarterly refunding, followed tomorrow by the key employment data.
"All of this will add up to a lot of pushing and shoving in the market," Mr. Alexy said, "giving investors no compelling reason to get involved.
In another exhibition of economic strength the Commerce Department said United States construction spending rose a larger-than-expected 1.6 percent in September, the biggest gain in six months.
The strength in the construction data was widespread, encompassing housing, commercial real estate and public projects. Analysts said the 1.6 percent increase was the biggest since March, when it was up 2.1 percent. "It is also the latest Government report to suggest the economy is growing by more than 3 percent -- a rate that some suggest could cause inflation to accelerate," Mr. Hale said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
New contenders for greatness in the world of solid-waste disposal.

BYLINE: By John Holusha 

 BODY:
THE two titans of trash have been displaced.
Although the expanding economy means more trash and more business for those companies that collect, haul, dispose of and, increasingly, recycle it, analysts are now favoring the second tier of solid-waste companies. 
 These include regional concerns that may have an opportunity for faster growth because their basic operations are still relatively small. Among the companies in this group are Sanifill Inc., USA Waste Services, United Waste Systems and Philip Environmental.
The two top-tier companies, WMX Technologies, formerly Waste Management, and Browning-Ferris Industries, have built nationwide businesses with annual sales in the billions of dollars. Both are in the midst of good years, with WMX's third-quarter earnings up 17 percent and Browning-Ferris's fourth quarter, which also ended in September, up 55 percent.
But investors seem to have noticed that both are trading near their 52-week highs, suggesting that further upward movement in their stock prices may be hard to achieve.
As an alternative, Hugh F. Holman of Alex. Brown & Sons has put a strong buy on Sanifill, a Houston-based company that at the beginning of the year had operations in 17 states.
"They are established in major markets across the country," Mr. Holman said, "and that is a big advantage. You have to pay up to enter a market and establish a landfill, but then you are in a position to make small, 'tuck-in' acquisitions to fill out the market."
Mr. Holman forecasts that Sanifill's earnings will increase sharply -- from 87 cents a share last year to $1.12 this year and $1.35 next year, which should produce a share price of $24 to $27, based on common price-earnings multiples. Recently, the stock has been trading at $22 to $23 a share. Yesterday it closed at $22.50, down 25 cents.
Much of that earnings growth is expected to come from acquisitions, as the solid-waste market evolves from one that was highly fragmented to one increasingly dominated by big, integrated companies.
In years past, many trash haulers were small trucking operations that served a few towns or parts of towns and emptied their loads at the county dump for a modest fee. But in many places, the county dump has been closed because it was unlined, allowing rainwater to penetrate the trash and leach unwanted chemicals into ground water.
The trend today is toward large, regional landfills equipped with multiple liners to prevent leaks and fluid-collection systems to treat the water before it is released. The companies that own them are in a position to offer a municipality a full range of services including collection, recycling and secure disposal that a small trucking company would find hard to match.
As a result, many smaller companies are selling to the most powerful integrated operator in the area.
United Waste Systems offers such services and is the pick of Paul R. Knight of NatWest Securities. He said the company was following a Wal-Mart strategy of focusing on suburban and rural areas where it could lock up the business, and leaving the highly competitive areas to others.
This gives the company flexibility in pricing. "Price escalators built into United Waste's local contracts," Mr. Knight wrote, "have raised prices 6 percent to 9 percent versus last year, and volumes have grown in excess of 35 percent" in Michigan, the company's largest market.
He has established a price target of $30 within 12 months. Recently, the shares have been trading at about $24 a share, closing yesterday at $23.875, down 37.5 cents.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Heating Oil Prices Surge With Crucial Season Near

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Heating oil prices jumped yesterday as traders looked ahead to a seasonal rise in fuel consumption. Other energy markets followed suit.
But for commodities as a whole, the strong gains in energy and also in copper futures were partly offset by steep losses in hogs and lumber. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities rose just 0.23 point, to 233.53. 
 On the Mercantile Exchange in New York, home heating oil for December delivery soared 1.32 cents, to 50.72 cents a gallon, the highest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since Aug. 4.
December crude oil rose 49 cents, to $18.68 a barrel, a 12-week high; December unleaded gasoline climbed 0.94 cent, to 59.80 cents a gallon, and December natural gas fell 1.4 cents, to $1.936 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Monday's expiration of the November heating oil contract shifted the market's focus to December deliveries and the cold months ahead, said Tom Curtis, director of energy research for Pegasus Econometric Group in New York.
Current United States supplies of petroleum distillates, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, are ample, he said. Over the last 13 weeks, growth in supplies outpaced growth in demand by nearly two percentage points. "But because now we're into the December contract, I think the perception of where we're going has changed," he said.
Crude prices were also supported by resurgent refinery demand on the Gulf Coast as pipelines damaged or shut down by floods in the Houston area in late October began to return to full capacity.
Consumption of crude oil in the United States typically rises in November as refiners restart units that were closed in October for seasonal maintenance, said John Saucer, an energy analysts with Smith Barney Inc.
Copper futures surged to a four-year high amid heavy buying from both dealers and speculators.
November copper rose 2.9 cents, to $1.268 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange of New York, the highest settlement for near-term deliveries since Oct. 26, 1990.
Hogs for December delivery plunged 1.17 cents, to 34.10 cents a pound, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as large supplies reasserted pressure on the market.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Lower as It Follows Stocks and Bonds Again

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar followed American stocks and bonds lower yesterday, as it did on Monday. Yesterday's drop came after a report showing brisk manufacturing activity fueled new worries about inflation.
The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen and the German mark when both stocks and bonds were driven lower by the monthly report of the National Association of Purchasing Management. 
 While manufacturing activity climbed, as expected, the markets were surprised by the gain in the price component of the report, which hit its highest level in six years. Investors, fearing inflation might erode the value of dollar-based assets, sold American stocks and bonds heavily.
"The fate of the dollar has rested very heavily on the fate of the Dow," said Richard Block, a dealer at Nationsbanc-CRT in Chicago. "The price component of the National Association of Purchasing Management index was higher yet again, and that continues to fuel inflation concerns."
In New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell as low as 96.49 yen after the report was released, just above a post-World-War-II low of 96.42 yen set in intraday trading on Oct. 25. The dollar was last quoted at 96.65 yen, down from 96.93 yen on Monday. The dollar fell as low as 1.4943 marks, before settling at 1.4956 marks, down from 1.5037 marks on Monday.
The dollar was also weakened against the yen after United States and Japanese officials said they had failed to reach an agreement on opening Japan's glass sector by an Oct. 31 deadline. Worries that the White House might advocate a weaker dollar to increase United States exports arose again.
 "The belief is that if trade tensions get worse the dollar is going to go lower," said David Durst, vice president at Bear, Stearns & Company. "That is why people were selling the dollar."
The dollar bounced off its lows, however, after Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, signaled greater optimism in the trade talks between America and Japan.
The dollar was weaker against most other leading currencies, falling to 1.2475 Swiss francs, from 1.2595 francs on Monday, and slipping to 5.1260 French francs from 5.1665 francs. But the dollar gained against the British pound, which eased to $1.6335, from $1.6355 on Monday.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
The Talks Are Quiet, But Skates Are Sharp

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
No new talks were held or scheduled yesterday in the National Hockey League as the owner-ordered shutdown began its second month. But several kettles continued to boil on the hot stove of an increasingly fragmented business.
In Toronto, the players' association announced rosters for a union-sponsored tournament, to be held next week, and prepared for a major membership meeting to be held there today. Participants in the union games will include Glenn Healy of the Rangers; Ray Ferraro and Benoit Hogue of the Islanders, and Stephane Richer and Claude Lemieux of the Devils. 
 In New York, the league headquarters delayed its expected announcement that more games will be canceled. So far, only 4 games of each team's 84-game regular season have been scrapped, although it is likely that at least 10 more will have to be killed.
The possibiilty of the season being slashed to 50 games was raised yesterday during a conference call among league general managers, according to The Canadian Press. There was no indication that such a step would be taken.
Also in the New York area, Mark Messier has resumed skating with a few of his Ranger teammates and said he may travel to Europe in December with Wayne Gretzky and a team of barnstorming stars.
In Russia, officials are preparing a Kremlin reception tomorrow for N.H.L. stars who once represented the former Soviet Union. Those players' tour of 5 games in 10 days will begin Friday night.
And in Anaheim, Calif., the league was excoriated for canceling medical insurance without telling the players. The words were predictable amid such a bitter labor confrontation. The only surprise was that they came from a high-ranking member of management.
The union-sponsored tournament will be held Nov. 10, 11 and 12 in Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario. Teams representing the United States, Ontario, Quebec and Western Canada will play with four skaters, instead of the usual five, and will play three 20-minute games per night against the other three tournament rivals. Players will also participate in a shootout contest.
The league offered no explanation for its decision not to announce the cancellation of games. As of last night, the Rangers had missed 15 games, the Devils 12 and the Islanders 10. The last official N.H.L. game was held last June 14, at Madison Square Garden, when the Rangers' captain, Messier, skated around the ice with the Stanley Cup. Messier, who spent time in Los Angeles recently with Gretzky, skated on Monday for the first time since then.
"I didn't forget how," he said. "I went for a little twirl." Gretzky spoke with him last week about joining a group that will play club teams in places such as Finland, Italy and Germany.
"I talked with Wayne a little about it," said Messier, who added that he is more interested in getting the N.H.L. season going with a new collective bargaining agreement. "But if this lockout continues, there will be lots of things that will take place."
One of them is this week, in Russia, where a tour of stars is being sponsored by Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif., a computer company that does business in Russia.
An impressive group of players is scheduled to participate. Those players include Detroit's Sergei Fedorov, the most valuable player in the N.H.L. last season, who will be reunited with his former linemates, Pavel Bure of Vancouver and Alexander Mogilny of Buffalo.
Also featured are Darius Kasparaitis and Vladimir Malakhov of the Islanders; Aleksei Kovalev, Sergei Nemchinov and Aleksandr Karpovtsev of the Rangers and Aleksandr Semak and Valery Zelepukin of the Devils.
The tour will open with a game against Spartak on Nov. 4 and will conclude against Red Army, also known as Russian Penguins, on Nov. 14. At a Kremlin reception, the players, who left the former Soviet Union without permission, will be given Russian passports.
Edward Zander, an executive representing the corporate sponsors, said the players aren't being paid for the tour and that all proceeds will go to amateur hockey in Russia. However, an agent for one of the players, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said players have been guaranteed at least $10,000 each by someone involved in the tour.
Back in the United States, there are recriminations in some quarters over the league's decision to stop paying its players insurance premiums on Oct. 15. The league didn't tell the players, and Tom Kurvers, the former Islander now with Anaheim, learned of the situation only last week when he and his pregnant wife ended up in a hospital after a car accident.
Although the insurance will remain in effect if the players choose to make the payments, the league's tactics were questioned by Tony Tavares, president of the Mighty Ducks.
"It was not one of the league's shining moments," Tavares said. "I think it was mishandled and I let my feelings be known. It would have been nice if he had been told in advance that his coverage had been eliminated.
"We, as a league, should have found a better way."
Arthur Pincus, the league spokesman, said, "The N.H.L. will have no comment on statements by Tony Tavares." Pincus added that any N.H.L. player who wants insurance still has it. The cancellation of the league's insurance payments, he said, "is an economic decision that is common labor practice."

HEADLINE: Playwright's Tough Subject Draws Funny Offers

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
In "The Waiting Room," three women from different centuries are waiting to see the doctor: an 18th-century Chinese wife whose feet have been bound and deformed, a Victorian lady who has been too tightly corseted emotionally as well as physically and a contemporary American woman whose breast implants have led to cancer. Each has been abused in the name of beauty, or at least beauty as fantasized by a male-dominated society. Lisa Loomer's new play deals with everything from medical malpractice to misogyny, while crosscutting through time and space.
Wendy Wasserstein, who saw the play in its workshop last year at the Williamstown Theater Festival, described it as "dark but colorful." "It's not a polite humor and it has a political force," she said. "It's a play with an issue but it does not deal with it as an issue play." 
 "The Waiting Room," which was a success in its recent production at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, opened recently at Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I. On her way from her home in California to Providence to consult with her director, David Schweizer, the playwright stopped for a short visit in her native Manhattan in order to talk to producers about a Broadway or Off Broadway production.
At breakfast before her meetings, Ms. Loomer revealed her own wry sense of humor. She said that at first she had set her play in purgatory, which, from her point of view, "is a short leap to a modern doctor's waiting room."
She continued, "The title addresses the literal waiting room and the state in which we all wait for things to change -- and certainly for things to change vis-a-vis cancer." One specific impetus for the work was her own mother's illness from breast cancer; she died before the play was finished.
Ms. Loomer said that since the play, she had become "the woman writer of the moment" in California. "Because we're talking about Hollywood," she added, "I mean the moment. Since I'm here now, that's probably not true any more."
On the strength of "The Waiting Room," she has been surrounded by offers to write sitcoms ("for comics who do jokes about a gynecologist's office"), screenplays and magazine articles about health and beauty. Drawing on her own partly Hispanic family background, she would like to write a Latino sitcom, and has already made two attempts, "Gloria," about a Puerto Rican talk-show host, and "East L.A.," which took place in an unemployment office. One offer she did accept was from Columbia Pictures to write the movie version of Susanna Kaysen's best-selling memoir, "Girl, Interrupted" about her two years in a mental institution.
For Ms. Loomer, who is in her 30's, it has been a logical rise from actress and standup comic to playwright and screenwriter. After studying theater at Brandeis University and the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, she acted Off Broadway and worked with a political comedy group at the West Bank Cafe. While studying acting with Wynn Handman at the American Place Theater, she grew tired of performing other people's monologues and began writing her own, signing them with invented names like Jane da Vinci. After emerging from her pseudonyms, she performed her original pieces in the American Humorist Series at the American Place.
To further her double career, she moved to Los Angeles (newly wed, she and her husband, a composer, live in Sherman Oaks). Her first play, "Birds," was done at the South Coast Repertory Theater. In the author's words, the play deals with "borders between family members and between countries; it's about a Mexican-American family that goes back to Mexico." Ms. Loomer's family now lives in Mexico.
In the style of magic realism, dead people often speak in her plays. "Don't they speak to everyone?" she asked. "That's not naturalism, but it's perfectly natural." In her work, she explores multiculturism from different, nonlinear angles. "If I were a painter," she said, "I might be a cubist."
It was while investigating women's health issues at the Women's Artists Group in Los Angeles that she began "The Waiting Room." That room was soon populated with visions from her fervid imagination, including Hygeia, the Greek goddess of health. She also found factual sources in her research into conventional and nonconventional treatments of cancer. June Kyoko Lu, an actress in the women's group, introduced her to the subject of footbinding, and went on to play the Chinese character, Forgiveness From Heaven, in both productions.
Ms. Loomer freely acknowledges Caryl Churchill as an influence. The fact that in "Top Girls" the English playwright merged characters from various historical periods gave her "permission to do something crazy like this," Ms. Loomer said. In California, "The Waiting Room" provoked discussion and even arguments among theatergoers. "I think that people bring their own lives to the theater," she said. "What rings true for them they embrace. What doesn't ring true or disturbs them, they don't see, tune out or become uncomfortable with."
After one performance, she overheard a theatergoer tell a friend that she had had a difficult time with the play because someone close to her had just died "and cancer is not funny."
Ms. Loomer responds: "This play clearly comes out of my own experience. I don't think cancer is funny at all. I think people are funny, and sometimes even people with cancer are funny. It's the collision of needs that produces humor." When her mother read her plays, she would say, "Do you think people would really find this funny?," but then would end up laughing with her daughter. It was, said Ms. Loomer, "laughter of shock and at the same time a recognition of truth."
Last year, "The Waiting Room" was named as a runner-up for the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize, which goes annually to a play written by a woman in the English-speaking world. At the awards ceremony in London early this year, Ms. Loomer read three monologues from her play. Afterward, Diana Rigg complimented her on her writing and suggested she also consider a second career as an actress.
Might she perform one of the roles in her play? "At this point, acting is a luxury for me," she said. "With all due immodesty, there are people who can do the parts as well or better than I can. But there are things I have to write that no one could write for me."

New Baseball League Offers Profit Sharing for Cities and Players

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Offering partnerships in the form of an innovative profit-sharing and equity plan for cities and players alike, its founders launched the United Baseball League yesterday, intent on succeeding where virtually every other new rival sports league has failed.
"We think we're going to succeed because of a confluence of factors," Bob Mrazek, a former five-time Congressman from Long Island, said yesterday. He cited "cities that yearn to have major league caliber baseball, investors who want to participate in a new structure and design for owning a team and enough major league players who are going to choose to play in an entrepreneurial and nonconfrontational atmosphere in this new league." 
 Speaking candidly at a news conference at the Parker Meridien Hotel in midtown Manhattan, Mrazek added: "If we have made a serious miscalculation with respect to those components, then we're going to have a serious problem. But we like to think those factors are unique in the history of baseball right now and that's why we believe we're going to succeed."
Major League Baseball hasn't had competition since the Federal League lasted for two seasons 80 years ago. The World Hockey Association, the American Basketball League and the American Basketball Association failed as rivals to the National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association. The All America Football Conference, the World Football League and the United States Football League fell before the might of the National Football League.
Only the American Football League succeeded, and then only by forcing a complete merger with the N.F.L.
The United Baseball League will take its turn in an environment that has grown hostile because of the nearly three-month-old players' strike against Major League Baseball. But it is that hostility the new venture will rely on in its quest to stock itself with as many major leaguers as possible and operate a 10-team league beginning in 1996.
"People are looking for alternatives to the traditional baseball that has produced the kind of disaster it did this year," said Richard Moss, the player agent, who with Mrazek and two other men have created the league. "I think a lot of people view the fact that there wasn't a World Series this year as a violation of public trust. They think there's something better."
Major League Baseball said little in reaction to the announcement of its potential rival. "We'll just wait and see what happens with it," Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, said in a statement, then declined to add to it by telephone.
"We're not here to prod the old establishment and it's not our intention to replace it," Moss said. "We're here to coexist with it. We will compete just as Ford competes with General Motors. By starting fresh and not being bound to antiquated practices, we will be able to have a much healthier atmosphere."
The United League will try to make baseball better by offering cities that agree to build or adapt existing stadiums -- perhaps the hardest sell -- a 15 percent share of pretax profits and a 15 percent equity share, as well as by offering players a 35 percent share of pretax profits and 10 percent equity.
The United League will try to make baseball better by offering fans cheaper tickets and by involving members of minority groups in significant numbers and significant positions.
"Minorities in the United Baseball League will be able to step from the batter's box to the owner's box," said Eric Vinson, vice president of the United States Trust Company and one of several black members of the league's management company.
The former major league outfielder Curt Flood, also a member of the management company, said: "We need an alternative league. America deserves an alternative league. I wish there was one when I played." A minute later, he added: "I need an alternative league. Baseball's owners have shut me out for 25 years."
The league's organizers did not cite specific cities for their teams because none has been placed, but they appear to hope to have teams in Nassau or Suffolk County on Long Island, San Bernardino, Calif., Washington, Orlando or Jacksonville, Fla., Vancouver, British Columbia, and Mexico City or Monterrey, Mexico.
"The seat of our national government should deserve a baseball team," said Tom McMillen, a former N.B.A. player and Congressman from Maryland, who is a member of the league's management company.
The organizers emphasized that the league is not a strike league. Mrazek said he began working on the project more than a year ago with John Bryant, a Texas Congressman. They brought Andrew Zimbalist, an economist, into it last December and much more recently added Moss, who five years ago worked on the creation of a new league.
Player agents naturally would like a competing league because competition could only benefit their clients. But some agents who were asked yesterday talked about the animosity that has emerged from the labor dispute.
Jim Bronner talked of the "acrimony that's going to exist the rest of this winter and with some carry-over effects" and added, "Unless there's a significant difference in salaries, I think they would prefer to play in the other league."
Tom Reich said: "There are players who will make decisions for the new league, if it lives, for reasons in addition to economic. I don't think anybody connected to this sport will ever forget what has happened before and during the baseball crash of '94, nor should they ever forget. There's a tremendous residue of bitterness from this, greater than collusion."

A Home for Saltimbanco
The marathon lease negotiations have been concluded, and work is now starting on Saltimbanco, the long-awaited restaurant of Mario, Marco and Mauro Maccioni, whose father, Sirio, owns Le Cirque. The restaurant, which will open next year, will be in Fisher Park, a mid block oasis behind 1345 Avenue of the Americas, near 54th Street. 
 It is intended to be a casual Italian restaurant featuring Tuscan specialties. These dishes will be the province of Egidiana Maccioni, an excellent cook who is Sirio Maccioni's wife and the mother of Saltimbanco's owners. A full-time chef will also be hired. As for when Saltimbanco will open, the elder Mr. Maccioni said the designer, Adam Tihany, promised May. "But I think September," Mr. Maccioni said.
 
Poiret Closes
 Poiret, a French bistro that opened in 1987 at 474 Columbus Avenue (near 83d Street), has closed. Michael Weinstein, the president of Ark Restaurants, which owned Poiret, said business had dropped off since 1991. In the bistro's place, the company has installed a wholesale bakery that has yet to be named.
"It made no economic sense for us to keep buying bread and pastries for our restaurants," Mr. Weinstein said. The bakery begins selling retail next month, with tables sharing the space with a French oven.
Did the timing of the Poiret closing have anything to do with Ark's purchase of Lutece? "Not at all," Mr. Weinstein said. "We've had those ovens on order for four months. And as a matter of fact, now that we have Andre Soltner and Eberhard Mueller in our organization, it's a shame we haven't kept Poiret going so they can help us."
 
Return of Gaslight Club
 Today, after a 12-year absence, the Gaslight Club is reopening. It is taking over some of the space occupied by La Mere Poularde, the grandiose and troubled French restaurant at 109 East 56th Street. Jerry Hurych Jr., the president of the new Gaslight Club, belonged to the old one and decided to revive it, he said, because former members "yearned for a return to those great years of exquisite food, elegant service."
La Mere Poularde, now in Chapter 11, will continue as a restaurant in its main dining room and will cater the food for the club. The Gaslight Club will be open to the public for lunch Monday through Friday, and for dinner Monday through Saturday, with a continental menu.
 
Open for Thanksgiving
 This year a number of restaurants that have been closed for Thanksgiving in the past will be open.
"If you are going to own a restaurant called Home, I guess you have to be open for the holiday," said David Page, the owner and chef at Home, 20 Cornelia Street (near Bleecker Street); (212) 243-9579. The restaurant will be serving dinner from noon to 10 P.M. The four-course dinner featuring various birds is $35, or $50 including wine. Tax and gratuities are extra.
The Gotham Bar and Grill, 12 East 12th Street, (212) 620-4020, will be serving a four-course, prix fixe dinner, $58 ($30 for children 12 and under) plus tax, beverages and 18 percent service charge, from 2 P.M. to 9 P.M. Matthew's, 1030 Third Avenue (61st Street), (212) 838-4343, will serve a $40 three-course dinner from noon to 8 P.M. The price does not include beverages, tax or gratuities.
A copious Italian Thanksgiving dinner is planned at Fresco, 34 East 52d Street; (212) 935-3434. The four-course dinner, which begins with the restaurant's excellent pizza, is $45 ($25 for children under 12), beverages, tax and tips additional. It will be served from 1 to 8 P.M.
Thanksgiving dinner is a tradition at Gage & Tollner, 372 Fulton Street, in downtown Brooklyn, but this year Edna Lewis, the former executive chef, who is now 78, will return to cook for the holiday season. Her Southern-style Thanksgiving dinners, $29.95 for adults and $15.95 for children under 12, will be served from noon to 9 P.M. For reservations: (718) 875-5181.

HEADLINE: America Can't Afford More Huddled Masses

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Indecent Proposition in California" (editorial, Oct. 25) would have had a shred of credibility if you had any record in recognizing the negative impact immigration is having on cities and states.
In an era of sharp cutbacks in government services, and when entitlement programs soak up ever greater portions of government budgets, the net burden of high levels of immigration can no longer be supported. The sentiments of Emma Lazarus's anthem -- to send us your huddled masses -- are simply no longer economically possible or desirable.
American incomes have been stagnant for the last 20 years. The taxpaying population is in revolt and any new taxes to support transfer payments and new social programs are not politically feasible. The impact of population growth on cities and states is demonstrable.
California estimates that the net cost of illegal immigration to the state's taxpayers is more than $3.5 billion. In New York City, the school population has grown by more than 20 percent in the last three years, a phenomenon that is almost entirely immigration-driven.
While immigrants do contribute to the economy, their net impact is negative, especially if they cannot enter the more skilled professions. As welfare reform becomes more urgent, the competition and friction between illegal immigrants and citizens who must integrate into the work force at lower skill levels will become more intense.
The country can no longer support the present legal immigration of 700,000 people annually, let alone illegal immigration levels that push total annual immigration into the millions. Quality of life and environmental and economic realities dictate that even our current population of 260 million consumes too much of the earth's limited resources.
A halt to illegal immigration and a reduction of legal immigration are urgently needed. If both can be accomplished, the natural birth rate of the United States will eventually reverse our population to more sustainable levels.
You place misty-eyed ideology before hard reality in attacking California's Proposition 187. Some of its provisions may be unconstitutional, but its real import is that it is placing the question of out-of-control immigration policy squarely in the center of public discourse where it belongs.

HEADLINE: America Can't Afford More Huddled Masses;
Unworkable Proposal

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"Indecent Proposition in California" (editorial, Oct. 25) cites many good reasons for opposing the drive to bar illegal aliens from public services. But your critique, focused like most others on policy issues, ignores the basic point that this whole discriminatory proposal is unrealistic, and should be rejected as unworkable. 
 It would not work because the administrators of hospitals, schools and other social service agencies lack the means to identify specifically who is "illegal" among all their clients.
Most of the suspected illegals can present legitimate-residence "documents" of some kind, which they have borrowed from friends or bought from counterfeiters. The social administrators have to accept these at face value -- just like the business employers who are hiring illegal workers nominally proscribed under the 1986 immigration law.
To be sure, if we had a system of formal and secure identification cards -- including signature, photograph, fingerprints, Social Security number and holographs as a kind of enlarged Social Security card -- the illegals could be sorted out, and indeed quickly deported whenever they surfaced.
Furthermore, few would try to cross the border, or overstay a visa, in the face of such a control.
But the American public at present seems too worried about some supposed "invasion of privacy," and about the $2 billion to $3 billion cost of ID cards, to adopt such a system that would really regulate immigration in a comprehensive way.

HEADLINE: Cheap and Chic in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By RUTH REICHL 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
RIOTS, fires, earthquakes, recession. This city has been pretty badly battered in the last couple of years. Faced with the end of the halcyon 1980's, local restaurateurs went around moaning, lamenting the big-money days and wondering if the good times would ever come back. But as catastrophe followed catastrophe something remarkable happened here: The most successful restaurateurs stopped looking backward and started facing reality. If people were reluctant to spend money, they would simply charge less. And do it with style.
This change of attitude has created a virtual restaurant revolution. Many of the old favorites march on, but some have closed to be replaced by new and less expensive places. 
 The Bistro Garden, a venerable Beverly Hills institution, shut its elegant doors and was reincarnated as a fast-food souffle joint a couple of miles down the road in the Century City Marketplace. One of the city's most famous chefs, Michel Richard, turned part of his upscale Citrus into an earthy, affordable bistro. When you reserve a table, you have to specify in which part of the restaurant you want to be seated. And two other chefs, Wolfgang Puck and Celestino Drago, are busy opening inexpensive spinoffs of their big-deal restaurants.
But the most interesting new restaurants in Los Angeles are those that have closed only to reopen in new incarnations. They look the same. They taste the same. But the names are new, the menus are new and, most important, the prices are new. To a person accustomed to paying New York City prices, in fact, the numbers printed on these menus look like mistakes.
The new food in Los Angeles is more than merely a bargain; it also has a new spirit. In the face of the recession, food has become fun. It has silly names like "Tra La La" and "Whatcha Whatcha Want." It has outrageous combinations like scallop, apple and spinach salad with bacon vinaigrette. And it has colors that vibrate off the plate. When a dish of bright green spinach risotto framed by intense red beet risotto arrives at the table, you know you're in Los Angeles.
Here is a look at some of the restaurants that are setting the new Los Angeles style. Each has opened in the last year.
 
 
The Best Bargain

"Pasta for $6.50? How does he do it?" people ask as they wander into this big, elegant room, sink into the comfortable chairs and look at the thick cloths and beautiful dishes that cover the tables at Alto Palato. "He" is Mauro Vincenti, owner of the fabulously expensive Rex, which occupies a landmark Art Deco building downtown, and former owner of Pazzia, which once occupied this space.
It's a good question. Who else could offer a $6.50 plate of pasta like his spaghetti alla sorrentina? It is a bowl of beautifully chewy strands of al dente spaghetti topped with a bright green zucchini sauce. The flavors are understated and delicious with the true taste of Italy. All the food here has it, from pappardelle al ragu ($8) to a remarkable veal stew in red wine with grilled polenta ($12). There is even a grilled rib of beef for two with roasted potatoes and grilled tomatoes at $11.50 a person. The thin-crusted pizzas are superb and inventive, the gelato is a dream and nowhere in Los Angeles can you get a better cup of espresso. Even the service is special.
How does he do it?
 
ALTO PALATO, 755 North La Cienega Boulevard; (310) 657-9271; entrees, $11.50 to $17.
 
 
The Most Fun
 Fred Eric is the bad boy of Los Angeles chefs. He trained with Joachim Splichal (Patina, Pinot, the long-lamented Max au Triangle), but then went on to create some of the city's silliest food at Flaming Colossus, a club, and the Olive, a record-industry hangout known for its attitude, noise and outrageous food. Having his own restaurant, Vida, has not slowed Mr. Eric down one bit. Just reading the menu is an indication that you are in for a wild ride.
Here is where you will find "Tra La La," which turns out to be a sort of salad of crisp artichoke hearts filled with goat cheese with a basil salsa. "Whatcha Whatcha Want" has been lamentably retired from the fall menu; it was a simple plate of capellini in a chunky tomato and grilled vegetable stew. But the puns roll on: "Ty Cobb" is "crispy duck on a warm spinach salad with the traditional toppings of Cobb salad made in Thailand" and it is terrific.
So is the "Okra Winfrey Creole gumbo." Smokey the fish is, despite its name, a rather complicated smoked bass in various sauces. What's "New Yorkshire"? Steak, potatoes and Yorkshire pudding, of course.
There's an impressive and inexpensive wine list and a big buzz in the room. Vida has become a hangout for Hollywood's youngest and hippest producers, who appreciate the puns, the experimental architecture and the affordable food. This may be Los Angeles's unstuffiest restaurant. Not bad for a place in the staid Los Feliz district.
 
VIDA, 1930 Hillhurst Avenue; (213) 660-4446; entrees, $12 to $17.
 
 
Cheap Chic
 In the early 80's Michael Roberts helped define Los Angeles style, continually moving the border of what was possible a little farther toward the edge. As chef and owner of Trumps he was fearless, putting caviar onto fried plantains and turning tostadas into dessert.
Now, he has gone into partnership with Kevin Costner and moved to Pasadena. Their sprawling Twin Palms has the air of a slightly decaying Southern country club, all peeling white paint verandas and lazy ceiling fans. It is as gorgeous as a spread in an architecture magazine: you want to get your suitcase and move right in. It certainly doesn't look like a place that sells $3.50 appetizers and cassoulet for $9.75.
Mr. Roberts does not seem to have lost his sense of humor -- he is the architect of that scallop, apple and spinach salad with bacon vinaigrette. But most of the food on the huge menu is more familiar. There are pizzas and burgers and sandwiches and stews. The prices are reasonable: the rotisserie chicken with roasted garlic, wilted escarole and gratin potatoes is a hefty plate for $9.50.
To begin there are terrific crisp artichokes served with deep-fried caper berries and olives and sprinkled with cheese. But the best appetizer is a rich brandade of salt cod and mashed potatoes, topped with crisp slices of toast, generous enough to make a meal and so delicious it is easy to see why the $3.75 plate is so popular. "I sell more salt cod than anybody on the West Coast," Mr. Roberts says. "These days people in Los Angeles have a real sense of adventure."
 
TWIN PALMS, 101 West Green Street, Pasadena; (818) 577-2567; entrees, $7.25 to $15.50.
 
 
A Healthy Bargain
 Are you ready for fat-free food? Los Angeles is. People have been lining up to eat at Gratis since the day the restaurant and takeout store opened in the Brentwood section of the city. There is usually a wait to pick up food, and customers are given silent beepers that vibrate when their order is ready.
The menu is completely vegetarian; some of the food is actually edible. The soft tacos with black beans, chili and cilantro-lime dressing are an awesome amount of food that is good enough to elevate eating beyond mere guiltlessness. But the pizza was gummy and the veggie cheese burger was one of the worst things I have ever tried to swallow. As for potato salad, there is probably a way to make a fat-free version, but Gratis has yet to discover it.
The most famous dish at Gratis, I am told, is the triple-layered chocolate cake. (The restaurant swears it, too, is fat-free.) And you know what? It's pretty good. Good enough to warrant picking up one of those beepers.
 
GRATIS, 11658 San Vicente Boulevard; (310) 571-2345; entrees, $4.50 to $7.95.
 
 
Most Colorful
 If you can't get reservations at Spago or Chinois on Main, don't despair: Wolfgang Puck Cafe doesn't take reservations. You may have to wait, but you won't have to suffer the humiliation of reserving a table and then cooling your heels while celebrities waltz right in. Here it is strictly first come, first served.
Open just a few weeks, the cafe that America's most famous chef named for himself is a rainbow of tiles, ceramics, paints and patterns layered in dizzying, dazzling profusion. It is a room in which it is almost impossible to feel depressed.
The food, fast versions of hits from Puck's other restaurants, has no trouble competing with the setting; it is the most colorful food I have ever seen.
A bright orange bowl of butternut squash soup is swirled with a puree of red peppers. Salmon is a slab of pink on a bed of grilled vegetables so gorgeous it practically begs you to eat it. Linguine with scallops and spicy Chinese black-bean sauce has multicolored peppers sprinkled through the dish. Even meatloaf, which comes wrapped in bacon and perched on an enormous pile of mashed potatoes, is framed by bright, tiny tomatoes.
The most expensive item on the menu is the smoked salmon pizza ($14.50), with cream cheese, chives and slices of smoked fish. This "Jewish Pizza" is what Mr. Puck sends out to his special customers at Spago, where it has never been on the menu and is usually crowned with caviar.
 
WOLFGANG PUCK CAFE, 1323 Montana Avenue, Santa Monica; (310) 393-0290; entrees, $9.50 to $12.50.
 
 
Italy, in Technicolor
 "Why cook?" asks the takeout menu at Il Pastaio in Beverly Hills. At these prices it is not a bad question.
Celestino Drago runs the hugely successful Drago in Santa Monica. But his newest restaurant serves only salads, antipasti, pastas and risotto, and no dish on the menu costs more than $12; few exceed $10.
In the window of the simple room a woman stands making pasta. She works quickly, deftly folding a mixture of lobster and zucchini into mezzelune and stuffing tortelloni with a pumpkin mush. She turns out green and white tagliolini for the Sicilian pesto, which is made with nuts and tomatoes. Ribbons of black and white pasta run through her fingers; after they are dried they will be tossed with tiny, sweet clams and bright green leaves of arugula.
This is also the home of the world's most colorful risotto. The green is so green, the red so red, it is hard to believe that these colors exist in nature. "I can never resist this spinach and pea risotto," said a woman at the next table, scooping up a forkful of bright green. Who can blame her?
 
IL PASTAIO, 400 North Cannon, Drive, Beverly Hills; (310) 205-5440; entrees, $7.50 to $12.
 
 
Most Exciting
 John Sedlar practically invented nouvelle Southwest cuisine when he opened the restaurant St. Estephe, and blended his New Mexican roots with his classic French training. He expanded the repertory with his next restaurant, Bikini, allowing his cooking to resonate with Italian, Asian and South American influences. Alas, the restaurant was too expensive and too experimental, and after it was damaged by the earthquake, Mr. Sedlar shut it down.
He has just reopened the sleek, modern room as Abiquiu. The food, which is much more affordable, is rooted in New Mexico but still takes fliers into foreign territory. His chile relleno Bangkok, for instance, is filled with Thai shrimp and topped with a spicy peanut sauce.
But the best dishes are the ones that simply refine Southwestern cuisine. Nobody makes a better tamale than Mr. Sedlar, whose Santo Pasqual is filled with chicken and topped with a clear, sharp pumpkin-seed and chile sauce. His tuna zozobra is rubbed with sharp spices and served on bright green-chile mashed potatoes. On the simpler side, trout is served with bacon, eggs and skillet hashed browns.
There are lots of gorgeous desserts, including an exotic banana split. But the best is the Zuni corn souffle with passion-fruit cream. A treat at $6.
 
ABIQUIU, 1413 Fifth Street, Santa Monica; (310) 395-8611; entrees, $12 to $18.
 
 
La La Land
 Eclipse is like a joke about Los Angeles come to life. In the front of the crowded room three bodyguards circle nervously, talking into their watches and fiddling with their earpieces. The owner, Bernard Erpicum, trimmed down and more nervous-looking since his days as the all-powerful maitre d'hotel at Spago, confides that they are guarding the oil and real estate mogul Marvin Davis.
And there he is, solid as a tank, sitting at the front table. It is clearly the best seat in the house. As soon as the Davis party departs, Steve Martin et al. take their place.
With a Spago-trained chef, a Spago-trained owner and a site that was once the industry hangout Morton's (which has moved to larger quarters across the street), Eclipse came into the game with quite an edge. At the moment it is incredibly hot; people wait endlessly for one of the tables in the crowded dining room or on the (less desirable) patio.
The house specialty is whole fish baked in the wood-burning oven. The menu even offers surf and turf. The chef, Serge Falesitch, is not breaking any new ground here, but it is clear that few people come for the food. The question is this: With entrees priced from $17 to $29.50, will Eclipse survive in the lean new Los Angeles world of restaurants?
 
ECLIPSE, 8800 Melrose Avenue; West Hollywood; (310) 724-5959.

HEADLINE: Five Years Later: Eastern Europe, Post-Communism -- A special report.;
East Europe Still Choking on Air of the Past

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
One place to measure the disheveled state of Eastern Europe's environment these days is a great electronic scoreboard in Usti nad Labem, a Czech town on a bend of the Elbe River.
New sensors are sniffing the bad breath coming off the local factories and on the scoreboard, the people of Usti can track the gases they inhale as if following an important sports event. 
 "We still get about 20 types of harmful substances," said Zdenek Cerny, a former army officer in charge of the monitors. "Suddenly half the town may get pains in the joints. Or skin problems. When these chemicals interact, it creates a kind of nerve gas."
Usti's air and its color-coded scoreboard showing the ups and downs of nine different gases is even bringing it fame. Air quality specialists from Japan, the United States and Western Europe have flocked here like tourists visiting a chamber of horrors.
"When they have just 10 percent of what we get," Mr. Cerny said, "they think they have a disaster."
The scene is repeated across Eastern Europe as new Western computers probe the haze over Budapest in Hungary or the dust and soot over Cracow in Poland and Sofia in Bulgaria. The onset of capitalism has not cleaned the region's foul air, soil or water. But its instruments are now measuring it.
The stark message of the sensors is that almost five years after the collapse of Communism, the region's environment continues to decay. Chemical works, smelters, coal mines and power plants are still infusing air and water with waste far surpassing international standards and causing severe health problems. Toxic dumps go on poisoning ground water and cities keep on spewing their raw sewage into rivers.
What's more, capitalism is bringing its own problems -- more traffic pollution, less public transportation, more plastic foam, more clashes between environmentalists and the peddlers of consumerism.
There have been some gains. Factory emissions have dropped, perversely the result of a sputtering economy in which many plants have closed or slowed production. But the enormous task of installing filters, scrubbers and treatment plants has barely begun. And energy still comes largely from highly polluting brown coal.
"Achievements?" a discouraged World Bank consultant wondered aloud. "They are few, rather fragile and very dispersed."
The main reason for this slow pace is that regional leaders insist that given the urgency of economic recovery, the environment must wait. This policy decision underscores a fundamental question facing Eastern Europe as it continues its transformation. Should anti-pollution devices, fines and taxes be further postponed in order to protect factories and jobs? Or will this bring more health and clean-up costs in the future, not only to restore the havoc of the past but also the new damage still being caused today?
"The modern notion that development and environmental protection should go together has not reached here," said Lutchezar Toshev, the head of Bulgaria's environmental group Ecoglasnost.
In theory Communism, with its strict central planning, had more power than free-wheeling capitalism to avoid or prevent damaging nature. Yet with its squandering of raw materials and energy, the economic artifice made in Moscow produced exceptional levels of pollution that maimed many of its citizens.
In the end, it was this poisoning that provided a rare platform for challenging the state when other forms of protest were not tolerated. The environmental devastation became a powerful catalyst as citizens' groups formed throughout the East, spurring broader protests before the fall of Communism. Almost inevitably, in 1989 the new leaders had to commit themselves to an urgent clean-up. And the West, looking on aghast as scientists and film crews swarmed over the badlands of Eastern Europe, praised itself for doing better and promised to help.
But progress fell far short of goals, and many questioned why much of the almost $1 billion offered by the West for environmental improvement was not disbursed.
Blame is passed around. Western experts say that environment ministers have no clout, that their staffs are inept or keep changing, and that lobbyists are inexperienced or easily discouraged.
Many Easterners say that the West dallies, is overly demanding and spends too much on experts dwelling in expensive hotels, instead of giving aid.
"Look at Kozlodui," said Radost Patera at the Bulgarian energy ministry, speaking of a nuclear plant deemed among the world's most dangerous. "Kozlodui gets more foreign visitors than our famous Rila monastery."
 
 
Regulation
Lax Rules Attract Western Plants
 A popular argument in the West is that the transition to more modern, cleaner and more efficient technology will inevitably cut pollution. Results so far have been mixed. Several nations have copied the strict environmental regulations of the West, but the main problem is enforcement.
"Inspectors are not well-trained and not motivated," said Erica Bassin, a Canadian legal researcher. "And fines are low. There is little incentive to comply."
In Hungary, for instance, eight giant Western corporations are already producing chemicals, plastics, detergents and cars, using the nation as a hub for exports to the east. Hungarians say there is no mystery about what draws these companies. A senior manager at a Hungarian chemical company called Borsodken, which has formed joint ventures with several foreign partners, said, "Foreigners come here because of cheap labor, because of lower environmental demands and the lower health and safety standards in the workplace."
Dorog in northern Hungary looks like a typical small industrial town: old stone houses and vegetable gardens coexist with dreary high-rises. But Dorog has no typical mayor in Anna David, a determined, 60-year-old pediatrician. Noting that Dorog's children had three times more asthma and bronchitis than the national rate, she blamed the local factories, and in 1988 she founded an environmental group.
In 1990, when Dorog held its first free elections since 1945, it elected her. With a private American grant, she hired a municipal environmental inspector. "You have to watch them all the time, the Hungarians and the foreigners," she says, complaining that the Richter-Gideon chemical plant, which has been acquired by Elf Aquitaine of France, so far is still not treating its waste water.
She worries more about Dorog's toxic-waste incinerator, the only one in Hungary. Built in 1985, the incinerator was bought in 1990 by SARP, a subsidiary of France's Compagnie Generale des Eaux.
"That French company thought it could do what it wanted," she says. "We fought for a year because of their pollution. We almost closed it down."
One recent day at the incinerator, on the edge of town, where the air stings like tear gas, an official conceded that the plant's carbon monoxide emissions were 50 percent higher than the norms. "We are trying to improve," he said. "We will have to change the oven."
Dr. David wants the entire incinerator to move because the prevailing winds blow its dioxin emissions right over the town.
An official of French company said: "We're in the line of fire. They should be looking at the sulfur and the carbon monoxide coming from the local coking plant or from the chimney on every house."
 
 
The Water
Famed Rivers Become Sewers
 A fitting place to gauge what happens on land is in the water, and the main barometer is the Danube, the continent's grandest waterway, fed by myriad tributaries. The river is also the main transmission belt for waste, running the gantlet of discharge from eight countries as it sweeps through Central and Eastern Europe on its way to the Black Sea.
Istvan Ijjas heads a regional study group and has been taking the Danube's pulse for several decades. Asked about changes in the past five years, he said Czech, Slovak and Hungarian tributaries were carrying smaller amounts of dangerous heavy metals because factories have slowed down or closed.
"The drop is only small," he said. "We still have all the toxic heavy metals in the Danube." The run-off from fertilizer has diminished since its price was no longer subsidized, he said, but the load of detergents heavy with phosphates is growing.
More troubling, he went on, was the Danube's rising level of bacteria and viruses. He blamed cities that have expanded sewage collection without building treatment plants. From Bratislava to the Black Sea, towns use the river as an open sewer, in the process contaminating ground water. Budapest alone, beneath its seven magnificent bridges, expels the raw waste of two million people, treating only 25 percent. In Western Europe, waste water treatment is mandated by governments.
On the northern plains, rivers like the Oder and Neisse still move heavy with waste. German engineers said that the Elbe has improved since many old East German industries were closed. But the Vistula, Poland's main artery and principal dumping ground, is still deteriorating. Polish specialists said that because of the flushing of Silesian coal mines, the Vistula is now saltier than the Baltic Sea, into which it empties. The latest survey by the World Health Organization concluded that the water drunk in much of Eastern Europe is unfit for consumption.
It also noted that the poor air and water quality contributed to the region's high rates of lung diseases like emphysema, asthma and tuberculosis, as well as hepatitis, lead contamination and low birth weight and birth defects.
 
 
Acid Rain
Where Pollution Killed the Forests
 On the high plateaus where the German, Czech and Polish borders meet and tree stumps look as if they have been ravaged by fire, foresters have been planting new and hardy seedlings. Yet few young firs are surviving. In the valleys below, a phalanx of power plants and industries driven by brown coal are still spewing sulfur and soot, as they have done for more than three decades. This region, dubbed the Black Triangle, is one of the world's biggest makers of acid rain.
These were once dense woods, but even the Soviet Army had to move its tanks and find new camouflage as the foul air killed the tree cover.
In Berlin, Michael Roder, a Government environment official, recently recalled some curious Soviet-think. Instead of dealing with the pollution, he said, planners asked East German biologists to breed trees that were smoke resistant.
"They experimented for 20 years," he said. "In the end, the sulfur always killed the trees."
Along a 350-mile stretch, foresters are now trying to restore 300,000 acres of lost trees and prevent the rest from dying. They say these mountain forests are needed to retain water and snow, which now plunge down the hillsides, causing erosion and flooding in the spring and water shortages in the summer.
Along the Erzgebirge, the mountain range that divides Germany and the Czech Republic, Czech workers are spreading calcium to balance the soil. Specialists say it has become so acid that even the aluminum trapped in the clay is released, further poisoning plant roots and groundwater.
In Poland, Andrzej Szujecki, a former forestry professor and now deputy minister of environment, says he favors natural cleansing and regeneration. "But this will take decades," he said.
While forest death so far had been worst in the southwest, he was now troubled that for the first time, trees were dying farther east, in the Beskid Mountains.
In July, when the European Commission released its report on forest damage in 35 European countries, Czech and Polish trees headed the list, with over 50 percent of conifers and deciduous trees having lost more than one-fourth of their needles or leaves.
The airborne sulfur not only kills the conifers, which normally live for a century. Doctors say the sulfur attaches to tiny soot particles that penetrate human lungs where it mixes with water to form a potent acid, damaging the tissues.
According to the International Energy Agency in Paris, recent industrial decline has reduced energy demand by about 20 to 25 percent in the region and thus diminished the dust and fumes coming off the power plants. But specialists say the noxious load in the region is still enormous.
The answer to many of the region's troubles, many agree, is to replace its filthy energy sources, but policies differ. In Germany, instructions have been clear: by 1996, the remaining coal-fired power plants in the industrial basin of former East Germany must either have devices to minimize sulfur emissions or close.
In Poland the road is far longer. American aid has helped build a sulfur treatment plant near Cracow and Dutch utility companies have donated one at Belchatow. But once operating, these scrubbers will clean only a small portion of the coal that accounts for more than half the country's fuel.
The Czechs, despite enormous and continuing controversy, aim to finish a Soviet-designed nuclear power plant at Temelin. Vladislav Bizek, deputy minister of the environment, said that in four years the country could obtain 40 percent of its energy from nuclear power instead of today's 20 percent. Today, 75 percent still comes from polluting coal and brown coal.
Physicians and planners also worry about the coal pollution people generate in their homes. In winter, when a sour fog makes East European cities look like they belong in an old black-and-white movie, much soot comes from thousands of domestic heaters, stoves and boilers. While environment ministries everywhere signaled the need for a large-scale switch to natural gas, only a few towns have started.
In any energy discussion, Western advisers hoist the banner of energy saving. Many reckon that simple measures could save between 10 to 25 percent. But achieving this is proving tough.
The European Union is financing a center in Budapest to promote energy saving. It sends manuals to industry and practical hints to customers along with the meter readers. Its television spots, wrapped in rock music, say "You pay twice" -- for energy and for repairing the environment.
Ian Brown, the Briton who heads the center, says changing people's habits is difficult because of a deeply rooted sense of entitlement.
"Energy has always been extremely cheap and people see it as a social good," he said. "People have no notion that they are part of the problem, that they can do something. They think everything is up to the Government." In reality, governments may be as much a part of the problem.
 
 
The Mindset
For Some, More Is Still Better
 How the missionaries of Western ways can run into obstacles is illustrated by the black eye that bankers recently suffered in Bulgaria. A team of specialists from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development spent almost a year on a plan to cut sulfurous brown coal fumes. Bulgaria, studies showed, could easily cut about 12 percent of its energy consumption by reducing waste in industry and power plants. The London-based bank, which uses Western government funds for projects in the former Eastern bloc, was ready to act.
In July, a team from the bank, armed with the energy savings plan and a loan, called on Nikita Shervashidze, the Minister of Energy in Sofia. But the minister, indignant, said he would never sign such a plan, a team member recounted. He said Bulgaria needed more energy, not less. He wanted new transmission lines and a new power plant. The bank, in consternation, sent more envoys. In the end the team had to leave, a year's work lost.
"That's the old-style thinking," the team member said, furious.
At the minister's office, an assistant explained: "Mr. Shervashidze wants to sell more electricity so the utilities can make money. He wants to keep the coal mines open. We have 32,000 miners and the unions are very strong."
 
 
The Options
Is East Europe Losing a Chance?
 The assumption among the Western bankers and business executives who are helping to shape the region's economic transformation is that the former East bloc should mimic the West. Most powers-that-be in the region agree, judging by their eagerness to seek membership in of the European Union.
But many environmentalists -- scientists and economists among them -- question the race to simply catch up with the West and copy everything it has to offer. Already they worry that their culture and traditions are being swept aside by the new ideology of consumerism.
"We have a lot of discussions about whether it is possible to avoid the Western model of overconsumption, whether we can avoid its excesses," said Vladislav Bizek, the Czech deputy minister of the environment. "We should at least get our consumers into good habits before they pick up the bad ones."
Some Eastern Europeans even believe in a "third way" between Communism and capitalism. Specifically, they argue that the transition in Eastern Europe provides an opportunity to do things differently. For example, they say that Governments should now decide to build more railroads and fewer roads and license only products that can be recycled, contain the least chemicals or are otherwise the least environmentally harmful.
They argue that the governments must act quickly because it is now that people are eager to buy new cars, photocopiers, washing machines and refrigerators. Once factories are churning them out to meet expanding demand, it will be far more difficult to impose new ecological standards.
So far, however, this debate is at best theoretical. "The market is winning," said Zsuzsa Foltanyi, a Hungarian biochemist and coordinator of The Energy Club, a collective of environment groups. "There seems no room for laws that can shape the behavior of the producer or the consumer. Anything goes."
In Prague, which brims with tourists, environmentalists complained of the garbage, the fancy new packaging, cans, plastics, foils and plastic foam that have produced a new kind of waste that may take a lifetime to decompose. The old Communist recycling systems for bottles, metals and paper have collapsed almost everywhere.
Andras Lukacs, a geophysicist who heads the Clean Air lobby in Budapest is among those deploring the arrival of the West's car culture. In Hungary and Poland, freedom has brought 50 percent more cars, fulfilling longtime dreams of their owners but also clogging up the narrow streets, blowing leaded exhaust and thickening the haze.
Mr. Lukacs said that in the cities, auto emissions, including lead and nitrogen oxides, are so bad that they are offsetting improvements gained by the drop in industrial pollution. Use of unleaded gas is not mandatory and despite pressure from environmentalists, even new cars are not required to have catalytic converters.
The rush for the automobile is already eroding the vast network of trains, trams and buses, one of Communism's positive legacies. "It's one of our biggest frustrations," said Mr. Lukacs. "In every city the number of cars is growing and public transport is being reduced." In Budapest trams and buses carried 1.9 million passengers in 1989 but fewer than 1.5 million in 1993. In east Berlin, a tram ticket today costs 14 times what it did under Communism. Berlin had 300,000 cars in 1989. Today it has more than half a million.
Green parties complain that as the East bloc turns its new leaf, Western donors and Eastern decision makers alike ignore well-known ways to recover like introducing renewable solar or wind energy or using less abrasive chemicals in agriculture.
Hartwig Berger, spokesman of the Green Party in Berlin, was among the pessimists. "There was a chance for fundamental change in the East, a chance for a new beginning," he said, "but so far it has been squandered."
 
Five Years Later
 Further reporting on Eastern Europe after communism will examine the lessons learned from the outbreak of ethnic violence that engulfed the Balkans. Previous articles explored the successes and pitfalls of introducing jcapitalism to countries long accustomed to state-run economies, and the challenge of forging a united Germany after years of enforced political and economic servitude in the east.

HEADLINE: Shades of the Go-Go 80's: Takeovers in a Comeback

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The deals are not as big, the fees are not as fat and the personalities are not as flamboyant. Still, corporate takeovers are back.
With two months to go until the end of the year, 1994 is on track to be the second-biggest year for mergers and acquisitions in history. As of Oct. 31, deals valued at $284.4 billion were announced, according to the Securities Data Company, a Wall Street research firm. That is just shy of the $292.9 billion announced in all of 1989. The record is $335.8 billion in 1988. 
 Having spent the early 1990's increasing profits by cutting costs, corporations are now looking to increase their revenues. And expansion by acquisition appears to many to be the easiest way to do it.
"People are saying: To grow my business I need to consolidate, I need more clout, I need to invest in a different region, I need a certain technology or I need a certain program skill," said Mike Overlock, who headed the mergers and acquisitions department of Goldman, Sachs & Company in the 1980's and is currently co-head of the firm's investment banking department. "And they are prepared to invest in that."
The Quaker Oats Company was the latest to jump on the merger bandwagon, announcing yesterday that it was acquiring the Snapple Beverage Corporation of East Meadow, L.I., for $1.7 billion, a deal that would form the third-largest United States soft-drink concern. [Page D1.]
The acquisition is one of several takeovers in the food industry this year, including the purchase of Borden Inc. by the investment firm Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Company. But other industries have been even more active. The telecommunications, health care and pharmaceuticals industries have been the most active, while the consolidation of the military and aerospace industries has grabbed some of the biggest headlines.
In addition, the hostile takeover, which seemed to have disappeared along with the junk bond pioneer Michael R. Milken, has also returned. Nearly 8 percent of the takeovers this year have been either hostile or unsolicited, compared with 1 percent to 3 percent in the early 1990's.
But unlike the merger activity of a decade ago, which was dominated by rapacious and in many cases previously unknown raiders puffed up by Mr. Milken's high-risk financing, the current spree is dominated by large corporations seeking strategic alliances.
"What you see today are sophisticated companies paying a premium to acquire other companies, but having a rationale," Mr. Overlock said.
The rationale may be for a company to position itself to exploit the advent of a new technology, as when U S West Inc. and Airtouch Communications Inc. merged their cellular phone businesses. Or it could be an effort to gain economies of scale as the landscape shifts in industries like health care, pharmaceuticals and military contracting. The Northrop Corporation did this when it bought the Grumman Corporation.
Many of the buyers, including Sandoz A.G., Roche Holdings and SmithKline Beecham P.L.C., are foreign companies taking advantage of the weak dollar to make their expansions in the United States more affordable.
Whether the activity will lead to heavy job losses and layoffs varies with each deal. In a case where a company is expanding its empire, the need for layoffs may be minimal. But when two industry giants merge, many of the advantages of the deal come from eliminating the overlaps between the two companies.
For example, since completing their merger earlier this year, Grumman and Northrop have announced that the combined company will shed more than 9,000 jobs. The combination of Paine Webber Group Inc. and Kidder, Peabody & Company will result in the elimination of perhaps more than 2,000 jobs.
"Given that companies in the last several years have been downsizing without making acquisitions, it's very hard to know" about the extent of job losses, said Steven N. Kaplan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. "I wouldn't necessarily point to acquisitions as an evil in terms of jobs, given what companies have been doing on their own."
Many companies have become so acquisitive that they have initiated takeovers, even when their targets were unwilling. Earlier this year, the General Electric Company began a hostile offer for the Kemper Corporation, which turned out to be unsuccessful when the Conseco Corporation made a higher bid. (Yesterday, Conseco scaled back its $3.25 billion offer and asked Kemper to accept $2.96 billion -- about the same as the G.E. offer.) In August the American Home Products Corporation began a successful unsolicited bid for the American Cyanamid Company.
"You have a lot of Fortune 100 to 500 companies, who even in the 80's weren't inclined to think about taking unilateral action, now thinking that tactically this is a pretty good time," said J. Tomilson Hill, one of the biggest participants in takeovers in the 1980's who is now a general partner at the Blackstone Group, which specializes in defending against hostile takeovers.
One reason is that the will to fight off a hostile bidder with exotic anti-takeover defenses has declined. Because stock prices are relatively high, many chief executives believe that their companies are reasonably valued and any premiums over their companies' current stock prices appear attractive.
In addition, many of the hostile deals begun this year have involved companies that were already engaged in merger or takeover negotiations. That was the case when Northrop successfully outbid the Martin Marietta Corporation for Grumman, and with the Union Pacific Corporation's current attempt to outbid Burlington Northern Inc. for the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation.
When a company is already a takeover target, initiating a hostile takeover seems less ruthless than the predatory offers made during the 1980's, when as much as 25 percent of all deals were hostile.
"What was amazing about the 80's was the depth and breadth of the hostile pressure," Professor Kaplan of the University of Chicago said. "There is no comparison this time."
One reason is the lack of inexpensive financing. What fueled the efforts of corporate raiders like Victor Posner and Robert Campeau were junk bonds and bank loans.
Now, the junk bond market will not support such deals. Banks are increasingly willing to finance takeovers, fueling the increase in hostile deals, which require cash offers, but they are more careful to loan money to established enterprises.
"Bank financing is probably more readily available than it has been in the last three or four years," said David C. Wittig, the co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers.
Unfortunately for Salomon, which led the securities industry in takeover work during the first nine months of this year, the fees earned from mergers and acquisitions are about half what they were in the boom years of the 1980's. Some analysts believe that is because Wall Street firms bid down prices in order to get work when takeover activity was slow during the early 1990's.
But Mr. Wittig said investment banks earned fat fees in the 1980's because they were often offering services that commanded lucrative compensation, like floating junk bonds and providing bridge loans.
"The advisory portion of the fees are basically unchanged over the last five years," he said.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE OVERVIEW;
VOTERS DISGUSTED WITH POLITICIANS AS ELECTION NEARS

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
Heading into Tuesday's election, voters are profoundly alienated from their elected representatives and from the political process and confess to a deepening powerlessness and pessimism over the future of the nation, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
Disgust with Congress is near the recorded high, and more than 60 percent of those polled were unable to name an elected official they admired. 
 The public has not appeared so disconsolate since 1979, when the nation was gripped by economic stagnation and Americans were taken hostage in Iran. Now people say they are frustrated and cynical and feel that life has veered out of control.
"I don't feel the people of this country have any control over what's going on, even if we voted-in the person we wanted," said Debra Flesher, a 35-year-old mother of four in Greenfield, Ind.
"The country is so big and there are so many issues and everyone has a different point of view," she added. "It's hard to have a safe neighborhood anymore. Even the media doesn't have control because bad is what sells. Like the Simpson case -- that's what people want to see."
Mrs. Flesher was one of the respondents who agreed to a follow-up interview after taking part in the nationwide telephone poll of 1,429 adults, taken Oct. 29 through Nov. 1. The poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Asked about "the way things are going in the United States," 43 percent said they expect things to be worse five years from now. And most people fear that the next generation will be worse off than they are.
In the poll, crime emerged as a stark symbol of fear and powerlessness. Twenty-three percent of those surveyed identified crime as "the most important problem facing this country today." Economic concerns ranked second, with 18 percent calling them the nation's most pressing problem. Health care, which ranked second in September, has plunged to fifth place, tied with drugs.
Other sources of anxiety that emerged include a fear by a quarter of Americans that some close relative will lose his job in the next year, and a concern by 4 of 10 about their safety, saying there is an area within a mile of their homes where they would be afraid to walk at night.
Most voters hold fickle if not contradictory notions about Congress. But their overall regard for the institution continues to plummet, with the number who disapprove up 10 percentage points since September.
Three-fourths of the people surveyed disapproved of the job Congress is doing, just about the same level as disapproved in July 1992, when disgust with Congress peaked at news of the House bank scandal. Only 20 percent said they approved of the job Congress was doing.
Voters still gave their own representatives a break, compared with the rest of Congress, but anger at their elected officials is mounting.
The last two months of campaigning have clearly soured the electorate; the number of those who disapprove of their own representatives has doubled to 33 percent since September. At no time since The Times and CBS News started asking this question in 1977 have voters registered greater complaints about their own representatives.
Fifty-six percent approve of their elected officials, but only about a third think their own representatives deserve re-election. When asked about Congress as a whole, only 12 percent think most members of Congress deserve re-election, while 82 percent want Congress to start from scratch with all new people. Yet more than half said that even if all new people were elected, the Government would not work any better.
Joseph Hivko, 74, a retired printer in Chicago, holds some of these seemingly contrary views. His representative is Dan Rostenkowski, the former chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, who was indicted last summer on several charges of corruption. Mr. Hivko said he thought that the entire Congress should be replaced with "young blood," but he wants to keep Mr. Rostenkowski.
"He's doing a lot for Chicago, a lot of breaks through the Government," Mr. Hivko said.
Three-fourths of respondents could not name their own representatives in Congress. And by a margin of 2 to 1, they could not name one public official they admired.
"I can't think of anybody who has gone into office and is doing what they had committed to doing," said Pat Butler, 36, a sales representative in Fayetteville, Ga. "They find out once they get in that they can't do that much.
"Most of the politicians are in office too long and they are very close with the lobbyists and special-interest groups, and they get away from the people," she added, volunteering, like many of those interviewed, that she strongly supports term limits.
Two-thirds of all Americans said they felt as if they did not have much of a say in what the Government did. This is the highest level of helplessness measured since The Times and CBS News began asking this question in 1990. Nearly three-quarters said most members of Congress did not understand their needs.
"They're not the same type of day-to-day people as you or me," said Tim Fithian, 25, a night warehouse worker in Hayward, Calif. "They're in a completely different world. They aren't someone you would want to socialize with."
In a year when many politicians, including President Clinton, have blamed their political woes on the press, most of those surveyed said they had at least some confidence in the news they get, whether from television, radio or newspapers. But most people said they thought the media "gets in the way" of solving the country's problems and makes things appear worse than they are.
By a margin of nearly 3 to 1, those surveyed said they usually get most of their news from television and about half said they tune into political talk shows on television or radio sometimes or frequently. But the poll showed no relationship between voters' sources of news and their level of cynicism, pessimism or alienation from the political process.
Instead, two-thirds of those surveyed said that if Americans were unhappy with their elected officials, they "have themselves to blame."
By a margin of 5 percentage points, registered voters said they expected to vote more Republican than Democratic this year. This is statistically insignificant, given the poll's margin of sampling error and because such a general question cannot accurately predict results of local races. But there are other indications that Republicans may hold some advantages going into Tuesday's balloting.
Fifty-four percent of all Americans view the Republican Party favorably, while only 44 percent view the Democrats favorably. In another measure of voter alienation, those surveyed were equally divided between those who said the Democrats favored the rich and those who said the Democrats favored the middle class or the poor.
By a 2-to-1 margin, people believe that Government should be less involved in solving national problems, which is generally the Republican approach. But 57 percent think the country needs a new political party.
In bad news for the Republicans, 71 percent of voters have never heard of their much-promoted "Contract With America," the party's main blueprint for what it wants to accomplish in the next session of Congress, should it take control.
The poll contains mixed news for President Clinton, whose approval rating among all Americans stands at 43 percent, with 48 percent disapproving.
His recent foreign policy ventures have earned him higher praise than he has heard in some time.
"I'm glad he didn't hesitate on Iraq," said Tom Travers, 50, who served in the Air Force and was a documents-control worker in Aurora, Colo., until his recent layoff. "And on Haiti, he did the right thing. If people in these countries want democracy, we should help them accomplish that."
Yet the public remains largely "uneasy" over Mr. Clinton's "ability to deal wisely with a difficult international crisis," and voters still do not give him credit for improving the economy, with 56 percent disapproving of his handling of the economy while nearly that same number think the economy is performing well.
More people think, wrongly, that his budget actually raised the deficit than think he reduced the deficit. In the fiscal year that ended in September 1992, the deficit was at a high of $290.4 billion. In the fiscal year that ended in September 1994, the deficit had fallen to $203.4 billion. Mr. Clinton took office in January 1993.
Asked how she felt about the deficit, Shirley Ranolls, 54, of Stark, La., said she was vastly more concerned about "how to raise these kids right and keep them out of trouble.
"The whole world is getting worse and worse," she added. "My son has a good job, but it's hard for him to make it. The more he makes, the more it takes. He can't seem to get ahead."
 
 
How the Poll Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Saturday through Tuesday with 1,429 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii. Of these, 1,156 said they were registered to vote.
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for blacks, it is plus or minus eight percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE PRESIDENT;
Clinton Stumps for Candidates But Watches Where He Goes

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Nov. 2

 BODY:
To hear his advisers tell it, this is Bill Clinton's mission as he begins his final cross-country charge of the fall campaign: define the choices, rally the faithful, fill the coffers and help those Democrats who want to be helped.
But these are his instructions: never, never, never stray south of the Mason-Dixon line. 
 With six days to go before the election, Mr. Clinton is spending his evenings in halls like the Rhode Island Convention Center here on behalf of candidates like Myrth York, the Democrat who hopes to be the state's next governor. By week's end, he will have carried his exhortations to New York, Iowa, Minnesota, California, Michigan, Delaware and Washington.
But in Tennessee, Oklahoma, Florida and Texas, where the Democrats are facing some of their toughest Senate and statehouse races, Mr. Clinton will nowhere be seen. Even as the White House maintained today that his resurgent popularity had given the party new momentum, his itinerary reflected a view that there remained much of the country where Democrats were better off if the man from Arkansas stayed at arm's length.
"We go where we're invited," a senior White House official said today with a shrug. With voter antipathy toward Mr. Clinton still running fierce across the South, that has left his autumn march confined to fewer than a dozen states across the Northeast, Midwest and the West Coast where candidates believe that the President can make a positive difference.
Missing from the ranks of candidates that Mr. Clinton will try to help in the coming days are some of his party's leading figures, including Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas, Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, and Representatives Jim Cooper of Tennessee and Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma, both of whom are seeking to maintain the party's hold on open Senate seats. Instead, Mr. Clinton will spend the final days before the election in the frequent company of statehouse candidates like Ms. York and Bonnie Campbell of Iowa, and Senate hopefuls like Helen Wynia of Minnesota and Ron Sims of Washington, who all are running behind in the polls and are hardly household names.
For the White House, the calculation has been frustrating but simple. Rather than risk alienating voters elsewhere, Mr. Clinton is limiting his stops to states like this one, where he can mobilize Democratic loyalists.
As in every other state he is scheduled to visit, a majority of Rhode Island's voters cast their ballots for Mr. Clinton in the 1992 Presidential campaign. And at a stop this afternoon near here in Pawtucket, Mr. Clinton found the kind of unrestrained support he sought as several hundred senior citizens at a Portuguese Social Club took in his warnings that Republican campaign promises would leave that party no choice but to cut back on Social Security benefits.
"We're moving forward," the President declared to loud applause. "You be thinking on Tuesday: 'I'm in control. I have a remote control on America's movie. I'm going to go into a polling place and I'm going to push forward. Maybe I'll even push fast-forward. But I certainly won't push reverse.' "
As Mr. Clinton repeated that message here in radio and television interviews via satellite with stations in Iowa, Connecticut and Massachusetts, his advisers portrayed his choice of venue as almost incidental. "The President's role in the final week is to travel around the country and help define the choice between Republicans and Democrats," said Joan Baggett, the White House political director.
At the same time, the White House issued a three-page fact sheet in an effort to substantiate its assertions that Mr. Clinton's trips had begun to have an effect on the Democratic fight to maintain control of the House and the Senate. Titled "A Week in Politics Is an Eternity," the document pointed to recent gains by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and other candidates for whom Mr. Clinton has campaigned, and it said that recent good economic news and the President's trip to the Middle East would underscore what should matter most to voters: "The nation is at peace, and the economy is growing."
With some recent national polls showing a surge in Mr. Clinton's approval ratings, one senior White House official said today: "I think the danger that voter anger at the President could cause the defeat of a local candidate is gone."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
U.S. Spree Bolsters The Dollar

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration went on a billion-dollar global buying spree today to prop up the value of the dollar. It succeeded, at least for now, in reviving the currency after it had fallen to a new post-World War II low against the Japanese yen.
But other nations did not appear to join in the effort, and there were signs late in the day that the markets were questioning a declaration by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen that the "movements in the dollar are inconsistent" with the strength of the American economy. 
 At the end of the day in New York, the dollar was quoted at 97.63 yen, up from the postwar low of 96.12 yen in early trading and 96.65 yen on Tuesday. The purchases also drove the dollar as high as 1.5217 German marks from 1.4956 marks on Tuesday. The dollar was last quoted at 1.5138 marks.
But traders said they thought the weakness of the dollar would continue unless there were even stronger indications that the Federal Reserve was about to raise short-term interest rates again, making the dollar more attractive to overseas investors.
The effort to shore up the currency, directed by the Treasury, came at a politically crucial time for the Administration, both at home and abroad.
The weakness of the dollar -- and the underlying message that the markets fear the Fed has not moved quickly enough to choke off the threat of inflation -- could undermine President Clinton's effort to convince voters that he should be given credit for deft management of the economy. Midterm Congressional elections are next Tuesday.
The effort also comes just before meetings with two groups of countries that are among America's largest trading partners. This month, President Clinton plans to meet with Asian leaders in Jakarta, Indonesia. A second meeting is to follow in December with Latin American leaders in Miami.
Some market analysts viewed today's move as exquisite timing, a step that took traders by surprise and succeeded in sending the dollar bouncing back strongly. But others saw it as a doomed effort to stop a flood with a hastily constructed dam made of sticks. These analysts predicted that the billion or so dollars purchased today with reserves of foreign currency held by the Fed -- the exact amount cannot be precisely gauged for weeks -- will be washed away in the $1 trillion generally traded each day in the world's currency markets.
Indeed, that is what happened after the three previous big interventions by the Fed this year. While most rescues have succeeded for a time, currency traders who bet in the past against the Fed and other central banks have usually won.
Mr. Bentsen repeated a theme today that he has sounded several times in recent weeks: Classic economic theory calls for a strong economy to be reflected in a strong dollar, and, in time, the speculators betting against the dollar will lose.
"I believe that recent movements in the dollar are inconsistent with the fundamentals of a strong investment-led recovery in the United States and the greatly enhanced ability of U.S. firms to compete around the world," Mr. Bentsen said this morning. His statement came just as the dollar buying spree began in what traders estimated as bursts of $50 million or more. The Treasury, following its usual practice, did not publicly confirm that it had ordered an intervention.
"This Administration is committed to sound economic policies that expand the economy's capacity and sustain recovery with low inflation," Mr. Bentsen added. "Continuation of recent foreign-exchange trends would be counterproductive for the United States and the world economy. A stronger dollar will reduce inflation pressures, improve American living standards and promote investment."
Administration officials acknowledge that a one-day intervention may not have much lasting effect. But it can have significant shock value, they say, and sometimes prompt a market turnaround, as it did in the summer of 1993.
So far this year, officials point out, the dollar has fallen only about 4 percent against the yen, well within its normal annual fluctuation in value. But it is a fluctuation at a historic low, and that fact alone tints the political import of a decline, no matter how small.
Government officials refrained from explaining why they chose today to intervene. As usual, traders were eager to offer their own theories concerning the continuing decline of the dollar: some blamed the Fed, some blamed the snail's pace of trade talks with Japan, and some simply blamed speculators.
The most widespread explanation concerned the Fed and inflation.
"The markets are losing confidence in the Fed's inflation-fighting ability," said Michael Strauss, the chief economist of Yamaichi International (America), a currency trader. "The numbers have been strong, showing the economy is accelerating into the fourth quarter. And there is a loss of confidence that the Fed, maybe for political reasons, has not sent rates up fast enough. They are behind the curve."
Those fears were fueled somewhat on Tuesday, when an index of monthly business activity compiled by the National Association of Purchasing Management rose significantly, adding to fears of imminent inflation.
But another explanation focused on the inching trade talks with Japan over entry to the flat-glass market, one of the Japan's most protected industries. By itself, the market is economically insignificant in a $60 billion annual trade gap. Still, the failure to reach an agreement by a deadline earlier this week was seen by some traders as a sign that there would be no major progress on the Administration's trade agenda.
That would leave the Administration with only one option for making a big change in the trade imbalance: A stronger yen, which would make Japanese products more expensive, and thereby less competitive, in the United States.
The more immediate question, however, is whether the Treasury's move will be enough to scare off speculators who have been placing the dollar under continued attack. That may depend on whether other central banks, including Germany's Bundesbank, join the effort in coming days, or whether they sit on the sidelines to pressure the Fed to raise interest rates further.

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Many Arab Lands Back Aid Bank

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration insisted today that its hopes of establishing a multibillion-dollar development bank for the Middle East were not dead and that many Arab countries were open to contributing to it.
Although Administration officials acknowledged that several Arab countries had not committed money to the bank, they said these countries had given a green light to the idea at a conference in Casablanca by setting up a study group on how to structure and finance the bank. 
 Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said the Administration was confident that Arab countries and Israel would eventually join the United States in financing the bank, which would lend money for dams, highways and other projects to develop the Middle East, help the emerging Palestinian authority and foster cooperation between Arabs and Israel.
Administration officials said Oman and Qatar said they would contribute to the bank; Kuwait said it was prepared to, and other nations said they wanted more time to decide. Some Middle East experts said that was a polite way of saying no.
Administration officials said they were particularly unhappy today with an article in The New York Times reporting that Arab nations had blocked plans to create the bank. It stated that Saudi and other Arab officials had said that they would not support the bank because of economic problems, including low oil prices.
At the conference, Suleiman Suleim, Saudi Arabia's Commerce Minister, and Morocco's Agriculture Minister, Abdelaziz Meziane Belfkih, suggested that the new bank was unnecessary because the region already had several development banks and underutilized funds.
But Mr. McCurry said that many Arab leaders supported a new bank during their speeches.
"It was a very important achievement that countries at the conference declared that they saw the creation of a bank as an important element of a strategy for economic cooperation in the region," he said, "and it was enormously important that the governments at the conference signed onto that."
State Department officials said the proposal for the six-month study was made by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and was not an effort by Arab nations to postpone forming the bank.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: MEXICO;
Government Joins Attack On Ballot Idea

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Putting aside years of cautious silence on American domestic politics, Mexico's Government and governing party are pushing angrily into California's debate over whether to cut off social services to illegal immigrants.
In a series of increasingly bitter complaints, the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has criticized proponents of an initiative regarding illegal aliens that is on the state's Nov. 8 ballot. 
 Mexican officials have contacted Hispanic-American groups working against Proposition 187, as the ballot measure is called, offering arguments and thoughts on strategy. They have prepared an advertising campaign to remind Californians of Mexicans' contributions to the state. Should the initiative pass, Mexican officials say they will hire lawyers to help fight it in American courts.
"Local political interests in California tend to blame Mexican workers for that society's problems," Mr. Salinas said to loud applause in his annual state of the union address on Tuesday. "Mexico affirms rejection of this xenophobic campaign, and will continue to act in defense of the labor and human rights of our migrant workers."
The proposition would strip illegal immigrants of their right to most government services, including education and non-emergency health care. It is supported by Gov. Pete Wilson of California and many other Republicans in the state, but opposed by the Clinton Administration and Democratic candidates in the races for governor and senator. Though support for the measure has slipped, opinion polls still show that it will pass.
Despite an early pledge of more direct support to the forces arrayed against the measure, the involvement of Mexican officials has remained largely rhetorical and concentrated on their side of the border.
But to many Mexicans, the campaign shows the Salinas Government to be standing up to politicians in the United States who have pushed for crackdowns on illegal aliens. That helps to offset an image of submission for which the Mexican Government was widely criticized in negotiations that culminated last year in approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The Mexican assault on the California proposition is also in keeping with the Salinas Government's expanding efforts to win political support among Mexican migrants to the United States. If Mexican officials have not been as active in California as they initially suggested, it might be because some Mexican-American leaders have warned that a higher profile could be counterproductive.
Yet to accusations of opportunism from their own political opposition, Mexican officials answer that their stand against Proposition 187 is an inevitable response to the changes taking place in Mexican-American relations.
For decades, they note, Mexican politicians were scrupulous in avoiding any hint of partisanship in American politics. But as Mexico and the United States become more integrated, they say, the political rules observed by the two countries are evolving, too.
"This is part of the new reality of this relationship," said the Deputy Foreign Minister in charge of Mexican relations with the United States, Andres Rozental, who first assailed the measure in a speech in Los Angeles more than two months ago.
"We were more forthcoming about U.S. interest in our electoral process in August," Mr. Rozental said in an interview, referring to the presence of hundreds of American observers for Mexico's presidential vote. "And in this reverse issue, it is not a matter of academic interest. This would affect the tremendous interests of hundreds of thousands of Mexicans in California."
Officials say the rising protest against the measure in Mexico also portends a conflict over the immigration question that is likely to deepen as other aspects of the relationship between the two countries improve. "Immigration is going to be the No. 1 issue between the United States and Mexico for the next few years," Mr. Rozental said.
Mexico has long argued that neither better fences nor more patrol agents along the border will stop undocumented migrants so long as there is the lure of jobs across the border.
The two Governments agreed to ignore the issue in negotiations for the trade agreement out of fear that it might jeopardize American Congressional approval of the accord. Since last year, however, Mexican officials have pressed harder for an American policy that would emphasize trying to manage the flow of migrant workers rather than trying to use force to block the entry of undocumented immigrants.
Like other opponents of Proposition 187, the Salinas Government predicts that the measure will have little effect on those migrants, arguing that they seek better-paying jobs rather than better quality in health care, education and other benefits that are also largely free in Mexico.
Mexican officials insist that if approved, the initiative would increase racial discrimination against all people of Mexican descent in California. They say that would be the inevitable consequence of the measure's requirement that teachers, social workers and others report any immigrants whom they suspect might be in the country illegally.
Already, they contend, anti-immigrant sentiments stirred by the election debate are leading to abuses against Mexicans by both the United States Border Patrol and ordinary Californians. The Salinas Government has responded with a flurry of diplomatic protests and the deployment of more than a dozen new officers to Mexico's nine consulates in the state. The Tijuana City Council voted recently to declare Governor Wilson persona non grata.
But so far, there is little sign that rising anger over the ballot measure among Mexicans seriously threatens the expanding economic ties between the two countries.

HEADLINE: Strike Prevents Delivery of San Francisco Daily Newspapers

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Employees of this city's two major daily newspapers, longtime rivals that have limped along under a joint operating agreement since 1965, went on strike Tuesday night as 2,600 reporters, editors, drivers, press operators and paper handlers walked off the job. They had been working without a contract for the past year.
The work stoppage at The Chronicle and The Examiner, the first at the newspapers since a 52-day walkout in 1968, began a day after the original Halloween strike deadline set by eight unions had been extended for a flurry of last-minute negotiations. But the talks failed, and while hundreds of thousands of papers for Wednesday were printed, few if any reached readers' hands. 
 "The racks are empty and the doorsteps are bare, and we think we can keep it that way," said Doug Cuthbertson, the head of the Conference of Newspaper Unions.
Throughout the day, pickets marched outside the Gothic-style offices that the newspapers share on Mission Street, while brawny security guards imported from Michigan by the newspapers' management videotaped their every move.
"On strike! Shut it down!" the pickets yelled. Supervisory personnel entering the building were taunted with shouts of "Scabs, go home!" and "Get a real job!"
There was scattered violence at several printing plants. James Hale, chief executive officer of the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which handles advertising and distribution of the papers under the joint operating agreement, said five trucks had been destroyed and three people had been hospitalized, one whose skull had been cracked by a lead pipe.
At least two members of the teamsters' union were arrested outside The Chronicle's printing plant in Union City for trespassing and vandalism. The police, wearing riot gear and carrying batons, flanked protesters at the main printing plant in San Francisco.
The strike comes a week before elections for major state and Federal offices and on several volatile referendums, and on the eve of the crucial Christmas shopping season. The two sides are no longer talking, and no further negotiations have been scheduled. Mayor Frank Jordan called the strike "a loss to the city and to all the individuals involved."
Wages are the major issue, with the unions demanding a 3.5 percent annual raise and management offering a 2.46 percent annual raise over four years. Also in dispute is management's effort to cut the jobs of what it says are more than 150 redundant teamster drivers over several years, and to replace the young boys and girls who deliver the papers by foot and bicycle with adults in cars.
"We run one of the most overstaffed delivery systems in the country," said Richard Jordan, a management negotiator, who is not related to the Mayor. "Allowing it to stay that way will inevitably lead to the closure of the newspapers."
An official from teamsters' Local 921, Adele DeCampli-Cirkelis, countered that management's real objective was to replace union employees with "part-timers who get sub-standard wages and no benefits."
Both parties have been getting ready for a strike for some time. Newspaper executives learned the art of printing newspapers, installed chain-link fences with barbed wire tops around loading docks, and imported lawyers from the Nashville firm of King & Ballow, which represented the owners of The New York Daily News and The Chicago Tribune in previous newspaper disputes.
On the other side, the unions printed cards for Chronicle and Examiner readers wishing to cancel their subscriptions.
The newspaper agency has vowed to put out both papers throughout the strike -- a task that, with technological improvements, is far easier than it once was. But striking reporters belittled the product in advance. "You might have an Examiner that looks like an Examiner, but it's really a shell of a paper," said Steven Chin, an Examiner reporter and spokesman for the Conference of Newspaper Unions.
The unions have already produced the first issue of a newspaper they have called The San Francisco Free Press. It came complete with a column by Herb Caen, The Chronicle's nearly indestructible columnist. "For better or for worse, strikes and San Francisco go together," Mr. Caen wrote in what was one of the least chipper of the thousands of columns he has written since 1939.
In the background of the strike were two venerable San Francisco traditions: the strength of labor unions and the economic weakness of the newspapers, which were less aggressive than many other major metropolitan papers to follow readers to the suburbs.
At a rally outside the papers' editorial offices on Monday night, speaker after fiery speaker referred to San Francisco as a "strong union town," invoking storied local labor names like Tom Mooney, Harry Bridges and Michael Casey to rally the troops. But even Mr. Caen conceded things had changed. "This was the best union town in the country," he wrote. "Now unionism is in decline and all the major sideshows have become a thing of the past."
The dispute could presage a restructuring or eventual merger of The Chronicle and The Examiner. Most scenarios have the Chronicle, more popular and owned by the local Thieriot family, being swallowed up by the Hearst Corporation, the far wealthier owner of the more economically anemic Examiner.
Since the companies are private and their books are closed, no one knows just how much the two newspapers make, though it appears to be far less than most newspapers make under similar joint operating agreements. The two share all revenues equally, meaning that the morning Chronicle, with a paid circulation of 526,824, effectively subsidizes the afternoon Examiner, whose circulation is a mere 120,549, according to figures by the Audit Bureau of Circulation.
"The evolution would seem to be toward one newspaper," said John S. Reidy, a newspaper analyst at Smith Barney in New York, who called the strike "sort of like a death wish" for the unions.
"It would be most prudent not to think about striking when there's clear evidence of stress for the owners in the present economic circumstances," Mr. Reidy said. "It just doesn't seem like a market that's suited to a morning and evening paper."
He said that was true even under a joint operating agreement, or J.O.A.
John Morton, a newspaper analyst with Lynch, Ryan & Jones in Washington, agreed. "All the J.O.A. has done is allow them to keep a dying newspaper in business," he said. "There will not be an Examiner in 2005, but long before then there will be some kind of rationalization of the situation."
Outside a distribution plant in the China Basin section of San Francisco, a Chronicle sports writer, Tom FitzGerald, was not thinking such dire thoughts. "I always wanted to know what it would be like to be a Major League baseball player," he said. "But I hope we settle before the baseball players do."

HEADLINE: Ireland and Britain Praise Clinton's Ulster Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
Ireland and Britain today praised the Clinton Administration's decision to increase economic aid to Northern Ireland as a step toward advancing peace there.
The White House announced late Tuesday that the President had decided to raise aid to Northern Ireland to $30 million a year over the next two fiscal years, up from the $20 million a year that was planned. 
 In addition, the Administration said the President would be the host of a conference next April in Philadelphia that would seek to increase American trade with Northern Ireland as well as the adjoining counties in the Republic of Ireland. The conference will bring together business executives and Government officials from the United States, Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Ireland's Prime Minister, Albert Reynolds, told Irish radio today, "The new package will certainly be welcomed in the places that have been devastated by the violence over the past 25 years."
In Belfast, a spokesman for the British Government said the President's "generous package" was "very welcome."
In announcing the aid package, White House officials said the stepped-up aid and trade should help reduce high unemployment in Northern Ireland, one of the factors that fueled the searing tensions between Catholics and Protestants.
The White House said, "The United States wants to do its part to insure that peace brings to Ireland new opportunities for job growth and economic prosperity."
As part of its aid efforts, the Administration said Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown would travel to Belfast in November to attend a conference organized by Britain. Mr. Brown's role will be to identify opportunities for increased business.
With its announcement, the White House sought to show not only that it was thoroughly engaged in pushing Irish peace talks forward, but also that it had worked quietly to get the warring sides to lay down their arms. Both the Irish Republican Army and Protestant paramilitary groups have declared cease-fires.
Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, voiced confidence today "that the potential for further U.S. investment is probably greater now than at any time in recent history."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: BROADCASTER;
Election Jitters in Limbaughland

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
These are busy days for Rush Limbaugh, tending the far-flung precincts of talk radio as the nation lurches toward the midterm elections, or, as Mr. Limbaugh calls them, "Operation Restore Democracy."
Around the country, there are defecting Republicans to scold, like Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, whose endorsement of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo came just as Mr. Cuomo "was on a train ride to Palookaville." In Massachusetts, there is the sudden, distressing comeback -- "How can that be?" -- of Senator Edward M. Kennedy in his race against the Republican, Mitt Romney. Not surprisingly, there are pre-election jitters and questions among the troops, from Jerry in San Diego to Mary Alice in Troy, N.Y. 
 Mr. Limbaugh tries to buck them up and calm them down in these last days before what he predicts will be "one of the most massive moves to the right" in a long time. "I told you that in the last two weeks you'd see the dominant media culture do what they can to rescue not just Clinton, but Democrats as well," Mr. Limbaugh says. "This is not the time to be depressed. This is the time to remember the weapon that you have, and that is the vote."
This is a big moment in the world of talk radio, which has its impresarios in virtually every city, from Bob Grant in New York to Mike Siegel in Seattle, and which has become for many Americans an echo chamber for their discontent. And if Larry King's CNN program functioned as a nominating process for Ross Perot, Rush Limbaugh may be a kind of national precinct captain for the Republican insurgency of 1994.
If there ever was a campaign season tailor-made for the medium, this is it: angry, anti-Washington, anti-incumbent, with some of the most renowned liberals -- and favorite targets on conservative talk radio shows -- fighting for their lives.
Andrew Kohut, director of the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press, describes the talk radio audience as "the hood ornament of the national mood" -- more conservative, more anti-government than most voters, but very much reflecting the tone of the times.
The genre, of course, has legions of critics, who variously accuse it of coarsening the public debate, stoking the mistrust of the Clinton Administration and feeding a vehemently anti-Congress mood. But like it or not, some analysts say, talk radio may be fulfilling some of the functions of traditional political institutions -- parties, unions or civic groups -- for its audience, particularly in the heat of a campaign. It is playing the role, in other words, of a mediating institution that gives people a sense of connection in politics when other institutions do not.
"They tune into a community of similar attitudes and discontent," Mr. Kohut said, "and they reinforce one another's views about how bad things are in Washington." Or, as one woman began her conversation with Mr. Limbaugh last week, "Rush, I AM ANGRY!"
It may not have the human texture, the connective tissue of relationships that existed in the old party organizations, but then neither does much of modern culture. "That's the poignant fact of politics in our age, that people feel like they do have a relationship with Rush Limbaugh," said Harry Boyte, a senior fellow at the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota who is a scholar of democracy and citizenship.
That much is clear on the electronic hustings, in the final days of the 1994 campaign: Patrice, in Massachusetts, begins her call, "Next to my husband, Rush, you're my best friend," before going on to ventilate her disappointment in the Kennedy-Romney race. Jeanette, in Spokane, Wash., who would like to vote for the Republican, George Nethercutt, in his race against the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, but hates Mr. Nethercutt's support for fetal tissue research, asks plaintively, "Rush, aren't there times in your life when you have to stand with principle over party loyalty?"
Mr. Limbaugh replies, instructs, ventilates. He struggles to explain the conservative rifts over Proposition 187, the California ballot initiative that would bar illegal immigrants from most government services. And, like any other good political chieftain, he looks ahead to the days of power, warning his listeners of the need to hold "feet to the fire" in the new Congress.
No less than David Broder, veteran political columnist for The Washington Post, speculated this week on how Mr. Limbaugh will cope in the next few years as Republicans move from Clinton-bashing to an agenda for governing.
Mr. Limbaugh, who declined a New York Times request for an interview, both revels in his political role on the air and, from time to time, backs away from it. "I don't have any power in the Republican Party at all, don't want any," he said last week after a long discussion of divisions within the party as it heads toward 1996. "But I have just been suggesting as a commentator and an analyst and a public figure and a concerned citizen that you guys had better come up with a list of things you believe in, your principles, your vision for America, and stick to it."
The party certainly takes Mr. Limbaugh and his conferees seriously. The talk radio constituency tends to be attentive to politics and very likely to vote: the most recent Times Mirror poll found that 64 percent of those who regularly listen to talk radio said they had thought about the coming elections; just 35 percent of the nonlisteners had.
Mr. Limbaugh's producer says the show is carried by 659 radio stations with an audience of 20 million a week. The latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll found that 50 percent of Americans say they tune in at least occasionally to political call-in programs on radio and television.
Republican strategists also credit Mr. Limbaugh and other conservative talk show hosts with maintaining a barrage of criticism of President Clinton, particularly on the Whitewater affair, and balancing what they contend is a liberal bias in much of the mainstream press.
In general, Republicans in Congress and in the campaign committees conduct "mass faxing" operations to radio talk show hosts around the country, with talking points and updates on floor action on Capitol Hill (although Kit Carson, Mr. Limbaugh's producer, dismisses the idea that the Limbaugh show can be shaped by faxes.)
The Democratic National Committee also sends out talking points to "friendly" talk show hosts, but Democratic officials, like many analysts, see that medium as heavily conservative. "There's not a whole lot of persuasion going on, not a whole lot of conversion," said Jim Whitney, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. "There may be some mobilizations, but there aren't a whole lot of folks listening to talk radio who haven't figured out whether they're going to vote Democratic or Republican."
Michael Harrison, editor of Talkers Magazine, a trade publication for talk radio, agrees that "talk radio hosts really reflect and amplify more than they influence." It is less a political force in and of itself, he adds, than simply the forum where political discussion occurs.
Mr. Limbaugh begins each show with a countdown: the number of days since the Clinton economic plan went into effect (known in Limbaughland as the Raw Deal); the number of days left of the Clinton Administration (known as "the hostage crisis") and the number of days until the midterm elections.
The edge to much of talk radio dismays many people in politics, in both parties. "The basic problem is the total breakdown of anything that resembles civility, and the fact that the battle is fought not for people's minds but for their emotions," said Senator John C. Danforth, a Missouri Republican who is retiring.
Moreover, much of the work of politics and parties is building consensus around common goals among people who may have very little else in common. "The problem today is that sounding off on talk shows has none of that quality of public work," said Mr. Boyte, the University of Minnesota scholar. "You get to vent. You get to whine, basically. When civic life or mediating institutions are replaced by electronic communications, people don't get any of the gritty flavor of life, or making a contribution."
Still, much of the electorate is well beyond the point of seeing any nobility in politics. In the age of anti-politics, the people who thrive -- Ross Perot, Rush Limbaugh and other "outsiders" -- may be those who do not talk like politicians, with all their qualifications, their hard choices, their need to compromise.
Politicians rarely get "megadittos."

HEADLINE: Justices Appear to Favor Employees on a Job-Discrimination Issue

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
In an unusually lopsided Supreme Court argument today, the Justices signaled their strong disapproval of permitting employers to escape liability for discrimination by coming up with belated evidence that a former employee filing a discrimination suit deserved dismissal for other reasons.
Several courts have recently ruled that employers who find such evidence have a complete defense to that employee's complaint of discriminatory treatment under Federal civil rights law. Evidence in these cases typically includes a previously undiscovered infraction of work rules or an exaggeration on a long-ago employment application that would have justified dismissal had the employer known of it. 
 The validity of this defense, known as the after-acquired evidence doctrine, has become one of the most hotly debated areas of discrimination law.
But the Court made the question look easy today. The argument was not so much a debate between lawyers as a series of declarations by Justices across the Court's ideological spectrum that the doctrine undermines the basic premise of Federal civil rights law.
"This is a statute that says, 'Thou shalt not discriminate,' and you are turning that around," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said to R. Eddie Wayland, the lawyer for a Nashville publishing company that dismissed a 62-year-old secretary on the basis of an asserted staff reduction while at the same time hiring a 26-year-old.
After the secretary, Christine McKennon, filed a lawsuit under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the employer discovered that she had taken home some confidential documents some months earlier in violation of company policy. On that basis, two lower Federal courts, accepting the employer's assertion that it would have fired Ms. McKennon had it known of the infraction, awarded judgment to the company.
Mr. Wayland's argument that an employee who could have been dismissed for a legitimate reason suffers no "tangible economic injury" by being dismissed for a discriminatory one was challenged by Justice Antonin Scalia.
Justice Scalia countered by offering himself as an example of a "thoroughly incompetent employee" whose employer learned of his incompetence only after firing him because of his age. "Why is that not an injury?" he asked, adding: "The more incompetent I've been, the less likely I am to get a later job, and the more I've been injured."
At another point, Justice Scalia commented that "it would be rather risky to bring such a suit" if any employee filing a discrimination complaint was subject to an extensive examination of his competence and conduct.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor told Mr. Wayland, "I don't see how your rule implements the goal of the statute at all." The relevant inquiry, Justice O'Connor said, was what the employer knew and did on the date the discriminatory action occurred.
Mr. Wayland replied, "It is also a goal of the statute not to reward bad employees."
Mr. Wayland said employees who engage in misconduct had "no one to blame but themselves" when the misconduct causes them to forfeit an otherwise meritorious discrimination case.
The lawyer arguing the appeal for the employee in this case, Michael E. Terry, told the Court that if later evidence showed an employee to have merited dismissal for legitimate reasons, the correct approach was not to erase the employer's liability but to limit the worker's remedy.
Such an employee might forfeit the right to reinstatement and continued pay, Mr. Terry said, but not to back pay. He said that an employer who had been injured by an employee's misconduct could sue for civil damages or seek criminal prosecution.
There was considerable discussion among the Justices about how the back-pay eligibility should be calculated in such cases. But it was not clear whether the Court would address that issue in its eventual decision.
The Clinton Administration appeared on behalf of the employee, Ms. McKennon. Irving L. Gornstein, an assistant solicitor general, told the Justices that the critical issue in a discrimination case "is what actually motivated the employer at the time of the adverse action." Evidence acquired later does not change the "historical fact" of a violation of the civil rights laws, he said.
The Administration's brief said that as use of the after-acquired evidence doctrine had spread, "employers now routinely embark upon extensive, post-discharge investigations" intended to uncover "some theoretically valid" justification for a discriminatory discharge.
The Equal Employment Advisory Council, an employers group, took strong exception in its brief to the Administration's assertion, saying that it unfairly characterized the situation. The Chamber of Commerce of the United States filed a brief saying that 30 percent of all job applicants "materially misrepresent their credentials and qualifications" and that the after-acquired evidence doctrine gives employers a useful tool to combat the problem.
While this case, McKennon v. Nashville Banner, No. 93-1543, was brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Court's decision will also apply to the basic Federal employment-discrimination law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, on which the age discrimination act was modeled. Title VII bars discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion and national origin.
Ms. McKennon's appeal came from the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, one of several courts to have adopted the after-acquired evidence doctrine as a complete bar to employer liability. Other Federal courts view later-acquired evidence as relevant only to the remedy.
The Supreme Court has been watching developments in this area for some time. Last year, it agreed to hear an appeal brought by a woman whose victory in a sex-discrimination case had been overturned because she had failed to reveal on her employment application a conviction for drunken driving. But the case was settled before the Supreme Court could decide it.

HEADLINE: Fed Report Said to Point To Rate Rise

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2

 BODY:
With unemployment falling most places and every region of the American economy growing, manufacturers are beginning to raise prices, the Federal Reserve said in a report released today. Private economists interpreted the report, prepared with contributions from each of the 12 regional Fed banks, as another sign that the central bank is likely to raise interest rates again soon.
Today's report on the health of regional economies, known as the beige book, pointed to accelerating economic growth in the regions surrounding Minneapolis, Chicago, Dallas and Philadelphia, and steady growth almost everywhere else in the country. The only conspicuous exception to the Fed's overall optimism lay in New York State and the Connecticut and New Jersey suburbs of New York City. The region's economy continued to recover in October but the pace of that growth slowed, the Fed said. 
 The Fed, in its September report, had said that economic developments in its New York district "were by and large more favorable in recent weeks." But in today's report, the central bank warned that sales had fallen short of retailers' expectations in the region and growth in housing sales had faltered.
"District economic growth slowed somewhat in recent weeks," the report said. The Fed attributed the slowdown to higher interest rates and to planned or actual job cutbacks by the financial industry, the New York City government and big companies like I.B.M.
Further interest rate increase could hurt the region more. The Federal Reserve cannot hold down interest rates in only one region to accommodate slow growth there. Because financial markets are national, everyone would borrow in that region and the competition for loans would drive rates back up to the national average.
The overall report today was very upbeat about the health of the national economy, suggesting that the Fed will soon raise short-term interest rates in an effort to prevent the economy from growing too quickly, which feeds inflation.
"There's nothing in there to discourage the Fed from wanting to slow things down, and a lot to encourage the Fed to do so," said Paul L. Kasriel, a vice president and monetary economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
Federal Reserve officials have been worried that rapid economic growth could lead to shortages of materials and skilled workers, pushing up prices and inflation. As a result, they have already raised short-term interest rates five times this year. The central bank's top policy makers are scheduled to meet again on Nov. 15 to decide whether another increase is needed, and it is possible they could act earlier.
So far this year, the Fed has pushed up its target for the Federal funds rate -- the borrowing cost banks charge each other for overnight loans -- to 4.75 percent from 3 percent. The Fed has also raised the discount rate, which it charges banks for overnight loans, to 4 percent from 3 percent.
The Fed released its report today several hours after the Commerce Department said that the index of leading economic indicators was unchanged in September after rising five-tenths of 1 percent in August. Separately, new orders for manufactured goods, which had climbed 4.7 percent in August, fell two-tenths of 1 percent in September.
Critics of the Federal Reserve's rate increases cited the two reports from the Commerce Department as evidence that the economy was slowing and that inflation was unlikely to be a threat in the foreseeable future.
"On the whole, the leading indicators demonstrate that the economy is not overheating, but is slowing down to a sustainable rate of expansion," said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
But financial analysts called both figures unsurprising. They argued that increases in the leading indicators and in factory orders were so large in August that a leveling-off in September was to be expected.
Sung W. Sohn, the chief economist at the Norwest Corporation, a bank holding company in Minneapolis, noted that new orders for transportation equipment and other durable goods rose during September. Only a small drop in orders for nondurable goods like oil and tobacco held down the overall figure for new orders.
Orders for durable goods are a better indicator of the overall economy's health and are likely to alarm the Fed more than the overall figure may reassure it, Mr. Sohn said.
By contrast, Mr. Jasinowski noted that prices for raw materials and new orders for consumer goods -- two of the 11 indicators of the leading index -- fell in September.
Also slipping in September were the money supply in 1987 dollars and manufacturers' unfilled orders for durable goods. Six indicators rose in September: building permits, an index of consumer expectations, average weekly initial claims for state unemployment insurance, stock prices, delays in business deliveries and new equipment orders.
One indicator was unchanged: the average workweek for manufacturing workers, at 42 hours.

HEADLINE: Bank Plan Would Rescue Co-ops Hurt by Recession

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
Throwing a financial lifeline to scores of cooperative apartment buildings in New York City, a consortium of banks has put up $100 million to help rescue co-ops that were hit hard when the real estate market collapsed in the late 1980's, and to help new buyers obtain mortgages.
Officials estimated that the program could involve 6,000 to 7,000 apartments in 150 to 200 buildings. Many are in middle-income buildings in Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn that were brought to the brink of collapse after their sponsors went bankrupt when apartment sales fell far short of expectations. 
 In many of the buildings, most of the apartments are still rent-stabilized units with tenants who pay less than the market rate and by law cannot be evicted.
Much of the money in the program will be used to refinance mortgages on buildings whose fragile finances and low ownership levels have kept them from getting new mortgages and have all but frozen apartment sales. The refinanced mortgages will mean lower interest rates and thus, lower maintenance payments for apartment owners.
The fund will also finance loans for repairs and in some cases make mortgage loans for buyers of individual units. The State of New York Mortgage Agency, also known as SONYMA, will insure the mortgages, providing a cushion for banks in case of default.
"The program will do more than rescue" the co-ops, said Michael D. Lappin, president of the Community Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit consortium of 53 banks that is a source of community redevelopment lending. "It will also help open up one of the the best sources of home ownership opportunities for working-income families in New York," he added.
Borough President Claire Shulman of Queens, who was among the first elected officials to sound the alarm about the mounting defaults in co-op buildings, praised the new program. "This will be good for Queens and a lot of other neighborhoods," Mrs. Shulman said. "It will help stabilize neighborhoods."
Over the last several years, Mrs. Shulman put pressure on banks to renegotiate loans on several large co-op complexes in Queens, so that the buildings would not go into default and the apartment owners would not lose their investments.
The trouble for many co-ops started when the real estate market began unraveling in the late 1980's. In many cases, when building owners had decided to convert the complexes to co-ops, the owners had taken out additional mortgages on the buildings to turn an easy profit.
The unsold apartments had been put up as collateral, and the sponsors expected that the profits from the sale of apartments would cover the mortgage payments, property taxes and operating costs.
But when the market collapsed and apartment sales stopped, some sponsors began to fall behind and many went into personal bankruptcy. In 1991, at the height of the crisis, the State Attorney General Office, estimated that sponsors were in default in at least 400 buildings -- more than 10 percent of the co-op buildings in New York City.
In most cases the banks took over the unsold apartments, sold them at auctions and worked out new payment schedules for the buildings.
At the same time, most banks tightened their lending policies, virtually eliminating new loans for any buildings that had less than 80 percent of their apartments owned by resident shareholders. That move put a freeze on apartment sales, and kept co-ops from refinancing their mortgages or getting loans for capital improvements.
Though the program will aid hundreds of buildings, eligibility requirements will keep some of the most vulnerable co-ops out. Mr. Lappin said that to qualify, a co-op would need to have sold 40 percent of its apartments. Although their exact numbers are not known, hundreds of other co-op buildings still have ownership levels of 25 percent or less.
Mary Ann Rothman, executive director of the Council of New York Cooperatives, called the program significant despite its limitations.
"The program will not cover every co-op that needs help," said Ms. Rothman. "The focus is on buildings that can be helped more easily and quickly. But hopefully it will help restore an atmosphere where lending to co-ops is seen as a good investment again."
The banks are making this mortgage money available after considerable political pressure from people like Mrs. Shulman. One advantage to the banks is that that these loans will help them satisfy the Federal Government's mandate that banks make more loans in moderate- and low-income neighborhoods.
One of the first buildings to be assisted with the new program will be a 111-unit building on Nagle Avenue in the Inwood section of Manhattan that was converted to a co-op more than 10 years ago. It is legally a cooperative, but more than half the residents are still tenants.
For more than three years the co-op's board of directors has been searching for a bank to refinance its mortgage and provide a loan for a new roof. An additional blemish in the view of lenders is that the co-op's sponsor has defaulted on the unsold apartments there.
"We're stuck," said Rita Henley-Jensen, president of the co-op. "We couldn't get any bank to lend us money because there are not enough owners in the building. But apartments can't be sold because no one can get mortgages. We don't even qualify for a loan so the roof can be repaired."
Through the program the co-op on Nagle Street will refinance its existing mortgage, bringing its debt down from $1.8 million to $1.2 million. The building will also get a $200,000 loan for a new roof and other improvements. When the work has been completed the co-op members hope to start selling apartments again.
"This is a nice building," said Ms. Henley-Jensen. "It is buildings like ours where most families can afford to buy apartments."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Follow Dollar In Decline

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities slid yesterday, as they have every day this week, following the dollar's plunge to a post-World War II low against the Japanese yen and the Federal Reserve's latest "beige book" report suggesting that inflation could accelerate.
A weakening dollar causes dollar-denominated investments like Treasury securities to become less attractive to foreign investors, and as a consequence the yield on the long bond was pushed very close to a three-year high. 
 But the market managed to recoup some of its losses, as the Fed intervened in the currency markets to buy dollars to shore up the currency's price. The price of the 30-year bond was down 11/32 , to 9312/32 , for a yield of 8.09 percent, up from 8.06 percent on Tuesday. Shorter-maturity bills were nearly unchanged.
Don Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, said the market was caught in a vortex, waiting for the Nov. 15 meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee. He described the way the market waffled along yesterday, with a new round of statistics, noting that most of the volatility came from market speculators and large traders. Most of the retail trade remained on the sidelines, he said.
"We think the market right now has major, major support at a price to yield 8.10 percent, and we saw it bounce off that level twice today," Mr. Hays said. "The fundamentals are all saying the Fed will raise interest rates, but there are a few signs that they may not have to move more than once this year."
For instance, he said, yesterday's leading economic indicators index was flat, along with a downward revision of last month's data. "These are leading indicators, not lagging, and they suggest that there is some economic weakening on the horizon," he said.
"When you look at the price component, you can see the new orders for consumer goods actually down," Mr. Hays said. "That's a big item."
Some market participants believe the Fed, which considers the economy to be very healthy, is likely to use the beige book report to set interest rate policy at its meeting on Nov. 15. The report suggested that inflation could accelerate because more manufacturers were raising the prices of raw and semi-finished goods as the economy grew.
The supply of bonds is also likely to play a role in yield movement for the near term. Yesterday the Treasury announced that its quarterly refunding next week would include $29 billion in new 3-year and 10-year notes. With $12 billion of 37-day cash management bills and $27.2 billion of the regular weekly supply of bills, the total swells to $68.2 billion in new securities for sale.
In when-issued trading ahead of next week's auction, the 3-year note was being offered at a price to yield 7.33 percent, and the 10-year note was being offered at a price to yield 7.95 percent.
The Commerce Department's report on manufacturers' orders yesterday showed a modest decline of two-tenths of 1 percent in factory orders in September, in sharp contrast to the surge of 4.7 percent in August. But analysts said the overall trend remained strong, so yesterday's report should not detract from the healthy economic picture.
Elsewhere, the corporate bond market expects to see the pricing of a large credit-backed offering today. John H. Nash, an analyst with MCM/ Corporate Watch, a new-issues research firm, said Banc One would be pricing about $2 billion of credit card-backed securities through Bear, Stearns & Company.
"It will be the second-largest credit card-backed issue ever," Mr. Nash said, "eclipsed only by Citicorp's Choice Credit Card Master Trust back in December 1992, which sold $2.18 billion of credit card-backed securities."
He said he expected the deal to be done, despite rising interest rates, noting that there were few quality issues and there was little corporate supply.

Why isn't a better economy helping Clinton's popularity?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
AS President, George Bush took the rap for the recession. Why isn't President Clinton benefiting at the polls from the economic recovery?
Maybe he is. William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University, believes that Mr. Clinton is, in fact, getting his share of the credit, but the cheers have been lost in the roar of general disapproval about other issues. Factoring out the benefits he should be enjoying because of the good economic news, Mr. Nordhaus says, "Clinton is the most unpopular president since Truman." 
 Others think that the state of the economy -- like the risk of being mugged in a big city -- is largely in the eye of the beholder. "Symbols are salient," argues Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. And few, presumably, are as salient as the mass layoffs by industrial titans that are now standard fare on the evening news.
Still others argue that the psychological benefits of the economic expansion have been undermined by a sense that the workplace is becoming harsher and less forgiving. "Growing average wages were a sort of safety net," says Frank Levy, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. That safety net, Mr. Levy notes, no longer exists.
The Nordhaus explanation, based on the long-established statistical relationship between Presidential approval ratings and a variety of economic indicators, has the charm of simplicity. Since Herbert Hoover, the popularity of all Presidents has been influenced by the state of the economy, Mr. Nordhaus argues. President Clinton is no exception. What is different about this President is that he is widely disliked for other reasons. Or, to put it another way, if unemployment and inflation were higher, he would be even more unpopular.
That explanation does not please President Clinton's fans -- or, for that matter, economists who suspect that people's sense of the health of the economy is only loosely linked to the numbers. "Even in a nasty recession," notes Richard Thaler of Cornell University, "90 percent of the work force has jobs."
In fact, polls show that many Americans don't even believe the recession is over. The real question, then, is what makes the majority feel optimistic or pessimistic about their own prospects when current news has little direct bearing on their incomes.
Ms. Tyson finds all this frustrating. Worries about job security, she contends, do not mesh with the reality. "Job tenure rates haven't noticeably changed," she points out.
The American economy has been creating and destroying jobs at a ferocious rate in the last few years. But, then, it has always created and destroyed jobs at a ferocious rate. What has changed is the visibility of the job shuffle.
By this reasoning, the truth shall make us anxious: Satisfaction with the economy will vary with the media's interest in corporate restructuring and the industry-specific threat from international trade. President Clinton may thus have shot himself in the foot by focusing so much attention on the pace of economic change and the vulnerability of some American businesses to foreign competition -- without being able to influence either very much.
Mr. Levy doesn't think it is necessary to slip this far into pop psychology to explain the discontent. Rising wages have long been the norm across careers as well as generations, he notes. Thus, not only could workers expect to earn substantially more than their parents, they could expect to earn substantially more as they grew older. But all that changed with the stagnation of the last two decades: The inflation-adjusted earnings of the average male who was 30 in 1972 grew just 11 percent by 1992.
That alone, Mr. Levy says, is not enough of an explanation. He notes, however, that workers have been hit by a double whammy in recent years: stagnating wages are now accompanied by wider variations in individual incomes from year to year.
Indeed, Peter Gottschalk of Boston College and Robert Moffitt of Brown University found that fully half of the rise in income inequality across the 1980's can be traced to "transient inequality" -- the rise and fall of individuals' earnings as they changed jobs or rode the roller coaster of overtime, shortened hours and incentive pay. Those numbers suggest that people's gut reactions have been accurate: Risk in the job market is rising without much gain in earnings as compensation.
The President's party usually loses seats in the midterm election, Ms. Tyson notes, because "Administrations can't really deliver up to expectations in two years." But, if the economy remains on track, Presidential popularity typically rebounds, she goes on, both because Presidents have more time to make a difference and because more realistic expectations take over.
The likelihood of a political rebound may be modest consolation for President Clinton, whose name is mud in spite of a booming, inflation-tame economy. But it may be his only consolation in this season of political discontent.

ON THE SCREEN Mr. Cuomo sits at a desk in what appears to be his executive office, talking to the camera in shirt sleeves, his hands clasped in front of him.
 
SCRIPT -- Cuomo: Some of the toughest times in recent history -- two recessions, AIDS, crack, violence -- have taught me what we need for the future and that's a high-tech economy, continued building of our infrastructure, a jobs-first approach to welfare, tough but smart law enforcement, fairness and hope for our children and the rest of us. Now the recession is behind us and we're moving forward with all of it. I'm asking for one more term to finish the job. Please vote for me on November 8.
 
ACCURACY -- It is true that the Governor has had to contend with the ravages of drug use, violence from guns, the AIDS epidemic and two national recessions. But the first recession did not hit New York State especially hard and had largely sputtered out by the time Mr. Cuomo took office in January 1983. The second national recession, however, was devastating for New York. While Mr. Cuomo is correct in saying it is now over, he fails to point out that it lasted longer here than in most of the country.
 
SCORECARD -- In its direct and simple appeal for votes, the ad, which was written by the Governor, seems an acknowledgement that he expects the race to go down to the wire. By focusing on his character, experience and vision of hope and high-technology, it attempts to elevate him above the campaign's unremittingly nasty tone. But the ad also underscores what Republicans consider his two greatest weaknesses: that he has served many years and that many bad things happened during those years. JAMES DAO

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE AD CAMPAIGNS;
Race for Governor: Pataki Says Tax Cuts Are Possible

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:

CANDIDATE -- George E. Pataki
 
PRODUCER -- Russo, Marsh & Associates, Alexandria, Va., and Sacramento, Calif. 

VISUAL -- This 30-second advertisement features excerpts of a Pataki stump speech, delivered in Long Island under blue skies. In a gray suit, standing next to his wife, Libby, and several Long Island politicians, Mr. Pataki gestures firmly with his arms and hands as he critiques Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's fiscal policies. As he delivers his final lines, the ad shows the crowd cheering its approval.
 
SCRIPT -- Mr. Pataki: "We have suffered under the highest tax burden any people in America pay. We have suffered under the highest job losses any state in America has faced. The time for suffering is over. The time for change is here. We represent that change. We are going to cut taxes and cut spending. Mario Cuomo said, 'You can't cut taxes like that. You can't cut spending like that.' Let me tell you something, Mario. You're right. You can't. But I will. And that's why we're going to win this race."
 
ACCURACY -- As he has throughout the campaign, Mr. Pataki misstates the state's rankings in tax burden and job losses, although the real figures should provide little comfort to Mr. Cuomo. Census Bureau statistics show that the state's tax burden, measured as a percentage of personal income, ranks 22d among states, while the combined burden of state and local taxes ranks second, behind only Alaska. One state, California, lost more jobs than New York during the recession, and Connecticut lost a greater proportion of its jobs.
 
SCORECARD -- Mr. Pataki has delivered this speech to virtually every audience in the last few months, and now he is broadcasting it for mass consumption. Because polls show that few New Yorkers have any sense of who Mr. Pataki is, the candidate appears in person in this ad, and the crowd reaction demonstrates enthusiasm for his candidacy.
But the ad does little to defend Mr. Pataki's proposal for $5.6 billion in tax cuts against the Governor's charge that such deep cuts are irresponsible and will simply pass the tax burden to local governments. Instead, it dismisses Mr. Cuomo's recalcitrance as simply a lack of will. And Mr. Pataki does so by referring to the Governor by his first name, a decision that some voters may consider disrespectful. KEVIN SACK

HEADLINE: Mr. Ames Exposed More Than Spies

 BODY:
It is now clear beyond doubt that Aldrich Ames turned the old cold-war game of spy versus spy into a total rout -- in the Soviets' favor. According to a Senate Intelligence Committee report, Mr. Ames managed to betray most U.S. and allied espionage operations in the Soviet Union from 1985 on.
His treachery resulted in the exposure and rolling up of over 100 spy operations, the "loss of virtually all of C.I.A.'s intelligence assets targeted at the Soviet Union," the deaths of at least a dozen prized Soviet agents and the exposure of other Soviet agents who were then forced to feed false information back to Western intelligence. 
 That the C.I.A. allowed a boozy bumbler like Aldrich Ames to gain extensive access to its espionage networks and to elude detection despite his brazenly sloppy practices is and will forever remain a monument to bureaucratic incompetence. In the committee's words: "gross negligence."
It would only deepen the tragedy if larger questions got lost in the uproar over Mr. Ames. There is, for example, the question of accountability. C.I.A. Director James Woolsey has merely reprimanded the officials responsible for the Ames debacle. There were more serious penalties available to him and he should have imposed them. The Director seemed oblivious to the message his tender treatment of his department's bunglers sent to future generations of C.I.A. managers.
The committee calls Mr. Woolsey's response "seriously inadequate." Those words apply equally to the quality of the agency's intelligence during the final stages of the cold war. It grievously underestimated the Soviet Union's economic problems during the 1980's and failed completely to anticipate its collapse, raising the question of what real value the country had been getting from all those spies in the years before Mr. Ames exposed them.
There are more recent instances of spying gone awry. In Haiti, the leader of the Fraph, a notorious gang of anti-Aristide thugs, was a spy on the C.I.A. payroll. The Fraph handed the Clinton Administration its most embarrassing setback when it created a disturbance that prevented U.S. troops from disembarking at Port-au-Prince. The C.I.A. man in the Fraph reportedly had informed the agency of the plan. What happened to that information?
The agency recently increased its investment in spying. One has to wonder, in view of the sorry historical record, whether this is an intelligent use of the taxpayers' money, and whether there are not more effective ways to gather intelligence in the post-cold-war world.
If people ask the right questions, some good might still come of the disastrous treachery of a senior operative who, in the Intelligence Committee's words, "caused more damage to the national security of the United States than any [other] spy in the history of the C.I.A." A thorough Congressional evaluation of the past performance and future mission of the entire intelligence establishment would be a good place to begin.

Liberals' Last Stand

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When a desperate President of the United States demeans his office by trying to frighten elderly voters with a rehashed old lie -- that the heartless Republicans must be secretly planning to slash Social Security benefits -- you know that the liberal philosophy is on the brink of electoral disaster.
When in deep trouble, perpetrate myths. Here are a few that are flying around the coming rejection of the leftist "Clinton Congress." 
 Myth #1. Anti-incumbent fever is sweeping the land and there just happen to be more Democratic incumbents.
On a summer's night many decades ago, at the triumphal Carnegie Hall debut of the violin prodigy Yehudi Menuhin, the violinist Mischa Elman said to the pianist Arthur Rubinstein: "Hot in here, isn't it?" To which Rubinstein replied, "Not for pianists."
It's not hot for Republican incumbents. Of G.O.P. senators up for re-election, I anticipate no defeats; of Democratic senatorial incumbents, at least seven are likely to be ousted by the votes of the divinely discontented. It ain't the incumbency, it's the tax-and-spend mindset that will be rejected at the polls.
Myth #2. Voters have turned irrational, refusing to tax themselves for what they want, "demanding the bacon and complaining about the pork."
That's the old Jimmy Carter, blame-the-public "malaise" bit. The truth is that a growing number of voters think government at all levels is spending their money unwisely and are upset about being taxed to the gills to redistribute income. Unstupidly, they believe the only way to cut the rate of spending increases is to cut the rate of taxation; rationally, they have decided that fear of deficits is the only discipline that works on legislators.
Myth #3. Clinton Democrats are not getting credit for reducing the budget deficit, as skinflints have long been demanding.
Two-fifths of the claimed drop in the 1995 budget deficit comes from the sale this year of S.&L. assets that the Government was forced to buy in past years. As projections for the sale of these assets goes up, the deficit comes down -- having nothing to do with Clinton economic policy. The irony is that the President whose Whitewater dealing was the sort that helped put an S.&L. under is now claiming credit for the sale of S.&L. assets our deposit insurance ran up red ink buying.
Myth #4. Republicans are criticizing each other already, and the coming majority is doomed to disarray.
When Republican mayors wander off the reservation to support state Democrats, that's budgetary payoff time; when wives and widows of past officeholders snipe at present candidates, that's a one-day filler; but when party figures disagree publicly on matters of policy, that's a sign of party vigor and strength.
Contrast the open Republican debate about aid to illegal immigrants with the Democrats' lockstep march toward a phony illusion of toughness on crime and welfare. Watch the few non-attack ads run by liberal candidates: see them climb into sheriff's cars to point with pride at new prisons, declaim against child molesters and welfare as we know it, tacitly acknowledging that costly compassion has gone out of style. Democrats are suddenly together -- pretending to be conservatives.
Myth #5. A Democratic "surge" in the final week will trim their expected losses to such an extent that the '94 results will be spinmeistered into a kind of Clinton victory.
Surge, shmurge -- races almost always get closer at the end, and there is a three-point polling bias for Democrats in midterms because of low turnout. But here's a curiosity of campaigning: If six Senate races are squeakers, the likelihood is that they won't average out and split three and three, but will go mostly one way or the other -- in my estimation, to the right.
If the surge notion takes hold, however, that's good. Not only will it energize the horde of overtaxed and underestimated Forgotten People to descend on the polls, the myth will make smug the Democratic precinct captains and chip off the bloc votes.
Then confident liberal candidates will make the apocryphal mistake of Gen. George Custer, who squinted up at a ridge at Little Big Horn and supposedly said: "Those look like friendly Indians."

HEADLINE: U.S. Embargo of Cuba Violates U.N.'s Wishes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The United States has asserted itself as the key player in the United Nations, utilizing it as a bulwark in creating multinational forces. The United States has prided itself on the cohesiveness of these coalitions. I do not want to debate its role in any of these actions; I merely seek to point out the hypocrisy of continuing an embargo against Cuba when the General Assembly last week voted 101 to 2, with 48 abstentions, to condemn the embargo. 
 The question is: Does America respect the wishes of the nations of the world as represented in the United Nations General Assembly, or not?
How can the United States continue to vote against allies like Spain, France and even its North American Free Trade Agreement trading partners, Canada and Mexico? The Clinton Administration must come to the realization that this continued embargo is more trouble than it is worth. A recent Associated Press article detailed how Mexico is investing in Cuba at a tremendous pace while the Caribbean countries continue to increase their trade with Cuba. Canada recently renewed foreign aid to Cuba. At the same time Cuba continues to open up its economy, with more and more private initiative in food and consumer goods.
If the United States can maintain most-favored-nation trade status with China, end the embargo against Vietnam and begin negotiations with North Korea, how can it not lift the embargo and normalize relations with Cuba?
The best place for the Clinton Administration to start is to restore family visits and remittances. Cuba should also be invited to the Summit of the Americas in Miami as a sign of good faith. In addition, the United States should give the green light to the Organization of American States, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to bring Cuba into these organizations.

HEADLINE: U.S. Embargo of Cuba Violates U.N.'s Wishes;
Preserve Health Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Following up on "Health Care, Cuba's Pride, Falls on Hard Times" (front page, Oct. 30) and the United Nations vote overwhelmingly in favor of lifting the United States embargo against Cuba, I urge our Government to rethink its Cuba policy. 
 After fighting a war with Iraq we did not forbid the sale of food and medicines to that country. Yet with the passage of the Cuban Democracy Act we tightened the United States embargo against Cuba to include the sale of food and medicines. All reports emanating from Cuba have indicated such a rapid decline in living standards that, as we recently witnessed, many Cubans were willing to flee the island in very rickety homemade vessels under extremely adverse conditions.
Having spent 16 years researching and writing about the Cuban health care system and its biotechnology capacity, I am distressed by the near-collapse of what was once the premier health care system in the third world and one that rivaled those of many developed countries.
Rather than embargo the sale of food and medicine, we should be helping the Cubans preserve what they can of this extraordinary health infrastructure. Moreover, the United States pharmaceutical industry would like to get a toehold in Cuba to avail itself of Cuba's capacity in biotechnology and biomedical research and development.
For humanitarian as well as economic reasons, the United States should rethink its Cuba policy and, at a minimum, lift the embargo, particularly on the sale of food and medicines.

Saudi Arabia, Its Purse Thinner, Learns How to Say 'No' to U.S.

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO with ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3

 BODY:
Defense Secretary William J. Perry was pitching hard, but Prince Sultan was unreceptive.
After a late-night banquet of roasted meats and exotic fruit juices at the Saudi Defense Minister's palace in Jidda last month, the talk turned to money. 
 The Americans asked the Saudis to pay a substantial part of the $500 million bill for the recent American troop buildup in the Persian Gulf and to base dozens of American tanks and planes permanently in the desert kingdom to save time and money in the event of another Iraqi threat.
But Prince Sultan argued that Saudi Arabia was hard up for cash, in part because it was buying billions of dollars of American military equipment. And in a rare breach of Saudi politesse, he suggested that the United States had taken advantage of Saudi Arabia's vulnerability during the last Persian Gulf crisis by overbilling Riyadh for its share of the cost.
Mr. Perry and his team have since concluded that the Saudis will be slow to open up their wallets and that the American proposal to store an armored brigade's worth of equipment is dead. The Pentagon has opened negotiations with the United Arab Emirates to keep the equipment there instead.
"The Saudis have a very nice way of doing things," said Joseph S. Nye Jr., Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs and a participant in the meeting. "They say, 'We'll consider it.' It is not their style to say no. But when you listen to the answers you don't hear yes. They gave a very gracious answer that I thought was no and others thought was no."
That attitude reflects the strains in a complicated and sometimes contradictory relationship with an oil-rich kingdom that has been made cash poor by the 1991 war against Iraq, lower oil prices, a decade of budget deficits and arguably the most generous welfare state in the world.
For decades Saudi Arabia has been Washington's most dependable oil supplier and its most important ally in the Gulf -- secretly financing the contra rebels in Nicaragua for the Reagan Administration, playing host to half a million American troops to help the Bush Administration fight the war against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and working behind the scenes with the Clinton Administration to move the gulf Arab states closer to Israel.
The relationship, reconstructed in interviews with Administration and Saudi officials, lawmakers and independent experts, is so important that President Clinton regularly chats with King Fahd on the phone and American Cabinet officials line up to visit him.
That trend was capped at a sprawling Saudi military base last Friday by the first face-to-face meeting between Mr. Clinton and the King. The King was gratified that a man young enough to be his son asked for advice on the Middle East peace effort, and told aides afterwards that unlike President Bush, whom he admired but found rather distant, "I can feel the warmth of the personality of this President."
Yet the Saudis wield so much power over Washington that they can snub President Clinton by rejecting his choice of Ambassador and force the Pentagon to scratch plans for ambitious military exercises merely by expressing reservations.
And the clash between the Administration's goals -- preaching fiscal restraint and economic reform while at the same time pitching billions of dollars in sales -- has sent mixed signals to the Saudi kingdom.
 
The Consumer
Buy Now, Pay Later
 
 
It is hard to overestimate the importance of Saudi Arabia to the United States military.
The kingdom has become the largest single customer for American military contractors, now that the Pentagon isn't buying much. With $30 billion in orders since 1990, it has almost single-handedly kept alive the M1-A2 tank lines of General Dynamics in Ohio and the F-15 fighter plane lines of McDonnell-Douglas in Missouri.
But the Administration got a surprise warning last December when the Saudis approached Washington with a blunt and embarrassing message: Riyadh was so short of cash that it could not meet its payments and asked Washington to help reschedule its debt.
Tortuous negotiations over the next three months at the Saudi Embassy in Washington and at the palaces in Riyadh and Jidda produced only temporary relief: an agreement with five of the largest American military contractors to stretch out $9.2 billion due over five years instead of two.
As part of the arrangement, the Administration came up with a plan to stop American suppliers from selling the Saudis more military equipment. It has refused to approve any new Saudi purchases, and about 15 deals proposed by American companies have been turned down.
With much higher military bills coming due next year, the Pentagon last week dispatched a high-level team to Saudi Arabia to open a new round of lengthy negotiations.
Lieut. Gen. Thomas Rhame, the head of the Defense Security Assistance Agency, the arm of the Pentagon that oversees weapons sales, told Saudi budget planners: commit to a payment schedule or face further delays or possible cancellation of the orders for planes, tanks and Patriot missile batteries rolling off American assembly lines.
"This building has acted very responsibly in seeing itself as the protector of the Saudi alliance over the long term, rather than as an arms merchant in the short term," Mr. Nye said.
While the Pentagon acts as an important middleman in brokering arms sales to the kingdom, senior generals see the permanent basing of enough American military equipment to support a brigade as even more crucial to the alliance.
But just as the Saudis have consistently refused to sign a cooperative military agreement with the United States, they have resisted attempts to store American armor and military equipment on their soil.
Under pressure from conservative Islamic groups who opposed the American presence, King Fahd turned down a request from the Bush Administration to build a permanent American base in the kingdom after the Persian Gulf war.
Even the recent Iraqi movement of troops to the Kuwaiti border failed to sway the Saudis. This time around, the decision to say no was based as much on the price tag attached to the plan as on the political sensitivity.
The Saudis were even reluctant to hold joint military exercises with the United States, in part because they cost so much. In early October, Lieut. Gen. Richard I. Neal, the deputy commander of the United States Central Command, shelved plans to hold major air and land exercises in the kingdom and moved them to Kuwait instead. And Pentagon planners have found themselves questioning every maneuver in Saudi Arabia for fear that they will not be reimbursed.
 
The Merchant
 
 
The President As Pitchman
 
 
As Pentagon officials urge Saudis to stay a sound financial course, they chafe at the Administration's other campaign, the promotion of American business in the kingdom.
Almost from the day he became President, Mr. Clinton has played the role of salesman. Warren Christopher's first trip as Secretary of State included a stop in Saudi Arabia where he asked King Fahd to buy American commercial jets. Two phone calls from Mr. Clinton to the King and two cabinet-level visits later, the King promised to buy $6 billion in planes from the Boeing Company and the McDonnell-Douglas Corporation.
Similarly, it was Mr. Clinton's lobbying via Mr. Christopher and others that persuaded the King to give AT&T a $4.1 billion deal to double the Saudi telecommunications capacity by 2000.
It is mega-deals like these that have convinced Commerce Secretary Ron Brown that the doomsayers on the Saudi economy are wrong. "There has been unnecessary alarmism" by "some unsophisticated people," said Mr. Brown, who has made two trips to Saudi Arabia to help clinch the deals.
"We have full confidence in their economy and their ability to meet their obligations." But eight months after Mr. Clinton announced the jetliner agreement at an unusual White House ceremony, the Saudis and the plane manufacturers are deadlocked over how to finance the deal.
Even Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen does not seem to agree wholeheartedly with Mr. Brown's boosterism. When Mr. Bentsen visited the kingdom last month, he came armed with position papers stating that the Saudi budget deficit was too high and that the Saudis did not understand the depth of their economic problem.
Although he praised the King for his 19 percent budget cut last year and his pledge to cut the same amount next year, he urged him to eliminate the cradle-to-grave welfare system that spares his subjects income taxes but gives them interest-free home loans, free electricity, free health care, college educations and discounts on air fares and telephone service.
"I made the King understand that he wasn't alone, that we had some tough choices in our budget, but had done so successfully and it was having a remarkably good effect on our economy," Mr. Bentsen said in an interview.
But Mr. Bentsen's subsequent public statements about what he had told the King in private infuriated King Fahd, who made no secret of his displeasure. "The Saudis were embarrassed," said one White House official. "They get uncomfortable that these issues are raised at all."
 
The Deal
 
 
The Customer Is Always Right
 
 
That concern over Saudi sensitivities has inhibited the Clinton Administration at times from making many demands of its closest ally in the Persian Gulf.
Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia backed secessionists in southern Yemen in their civil war against the Yemen Government in the north, while the Clinton Administration took a more neutral position. Even the Saudis' secret transfer of armored personnel carriers and financing of the rebels' purchase of sophisticated MIG-29 aircraft from Bulgaria prompted no protest from the Administration.
But after the south lost, the Saudis suddenly felt surrounded by enemies -- Yemen in the south, Iraq in the north and Iran in the east. At the Saudis' request, Thomas M. McLarty, then the White House chief of staff, was dispatched on a mission to the kingdom.
"I assured him the basic premise of the relationship is that a threat to the security of the region is a threat to U.S. interests," Mr. McLarty said.
To help maintain the relationship, Mr. Clinton last February quietly withdrew the nomination of Edward W. Gnehm as Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Mr. Gnehm, an Arabic-speaking career foreign service officer, had been outspoken on human rights and democracy issues as Ambassador to Kuwait during the gulf war; the Saudis wanted someone close to the President.
The Saudis easily approved Mr. Clinton's next choice, Ray Mabus, the former Mississippi Governor who had no Middle East experience but who knew Mr. Clinton well.
"I'm not a professional diplomat, but I do think the fact that I can pick up the phone and call the White House can be very valuable," Mr. Mabus said in a telephone interview from Riyadh.
The Ambassador's relationship with the Saudi royal family has become so close that the King received him recently in his robe and slippers in his private quarters. "You're a member of the family now," a State Department official quoted the King as telling the Ambassador.
It is this kind of intimacy that contributes to the Administration's inclination to allow the Saudis to call the shots.
Although Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, has defined the stated goal of American policy around the world as enlarging democracies and markets, democratizing the Saudi Kingdom has never been high on Washington's agenda.
From the Administration's viewpoint, opposition to the royal family springs not from democrats but from reactionaries who favor more rather than fewer restrictions.
The issue is so sensitive that Administration officials apologized to the Saudis in late September after a State Department spokesman told reporters that the Administration "does have serious concerns about human rights" because of recent arrests in the Kingdom.
Mr. Christopher has praised the kingdom for working behind the scenes to move the Middle East peace effort forward, and has credited the Foreign Minister, Prince Saud, for urging Saudi Arabia and its five Arab gulf partners in late September to partly lift the economic embargo against Israel.
"The Saudis are a very steady friend," Mr. Christopher said in an interview. "They have a very conservative country which is very supportive of the United States, whether it is the peace process or the congruity of our position towards Iraq and Iraq. In every respect I regard the relationship as excellent."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
MCA's Impatience With Wary Parent

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT with ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
The top two executives of MCA Inc. arrived in Japan with a bold proposal to invest in an American television broadcast network. They left feeling, to use the words of one of them, as if they had been "treated as children" by their corporate parent, the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company. And the bad feelings persist nearly two months later.
MCA's 81-year-old chairman and chief executive, Lew R. Wasserman, and 59-year-old president and chief operating officer, Sidney J. Sheinberg, had made the 14-hour flight to Osaka on Sept. 17 for the meeting. They were appalled by the welcome they received the next morning. Matsushita's president, Yoichi Morishita, appeared two hours late -- and only after lower-level Matsushita executives had made clear that they would not consider the proposal. 
 "I don't see any smiling faces," Mr. Morishita reportedly said upon arriving. "I see you have been told."
Mr. Sheinberg, tired and exasperated, retorted, "Mr. Morishita, you are going to go down in history as the man who lost billions of dollars for your company." Several people familiar with the details confirmed this account of the meeting.
The sharp exchange, and Matsushita's rejection earlier this year of an MCA plan to build a Universal Studios theme park in Japan, each involved basic disagreements about business strategy. MCA argued that both plans were crucial for it to keep pace with entertainment conglomerates like the Walt Disney Company and Time Warner Inc.
But deeper emotional issues were involved as well: Both the outspoken Mr. Sheinberg and the patrician Mr. Wasserman were insulted by the way their foreign bosses said no.
"It is very distressing," Mr. Sheinberg said in an interview last week. "I did not feel that we had been treated as adults. I felt that we had been treated as children. Our people were totally demoralized. Matsushita doesn't understand that as the head of a company I have to keep the troops motivated."
All of this can be read as a cautionary tale about the corporate and cultural differences inherent in global mergers. In other respects, the issues are specific to these two companies and the people who run them.
After Osaka, Mr. Sheinberg and Mr. Wasserman insisted on a meeting in San Francisco, threatening to quit unless they were given greater autonomy. The meeting on Oct. 18 was an occasion to voice sentiments that might normally indicate two sides can no longer cooperate. Still, it may be that neither parent nor child has any alternative but to keep their dysfunctional family together.
Matsushita, which makes consumer electronics equipment, desperately wants the films, TV shows and music that its American subsidiary pumps out. Losing MCA's management would destabilize the company that Matsushita acquired in 1990 for $6.1 billion. And selling MCA, as Matsushita is said by people close to the company to be weighing, would be a painful defeat for its long-term agenda and a blow to its pride.
For their part, Mr. Wasserman and Mr. Sheinberg preside over a glamorous empire featuring Universal Pictures, Universal Studios theme parks in Hollywood and Orlando, Fla., and music labels that include Geffen Records and MCA. The two men's combined years at the company -- Mr. Wasserman has run MCA Inc. since 1946, Mr. Sheinberg has been president since 1973 -- give them stature and influence in Hollywood that would be impossible to duplicate elsewhere.
"Right now, our positions are rather apart, but we are convinced that our policies based on Matsushita tradition are right," Tsuzo Murase, who heads the Matsushita committee that oversees MCA, said last week in a telephone interview from Osaka, the most extensive public explanation the company has given on the matter. "We have exchanged our opinions, but we cannot find the compromising point."
Though the Matsushita executives who engineered the acquisition are no longer in power, the company's management remains firm about wanting Mr. Wasserman and Mr. Sheinberg to run MCA. But the Americans are confused by MCA's owners. "Why did they want us to stay, if they were not going to listen to us?" Mr. Sheinberg asked.
Mr. Wasserman, a tough but courtly executive who is one of the country's longest-reigning corporate chairmen, is said to be as angry as Mr. Sheinberg, though far more guarded. He declined to be interviewed for this article.
There were seeds of trouble in the 1990 deal, which was arranged by Michael Ovitz, the head of the Creative Artists Agency. Mr. Ovitz analyzed the entertainment industry for Matsushita and identified MCA as the best acquisition target, but Mr. Sheinberg and Mr. Wasserman did not meet with Matsushita's then-president, Akio Tanii, and Masahiko Hirata, the executive vice president overseeing the deal, until fairly late in the negotiations.
At the time, as now, Matsushita's management exemplified a traditional Japanese approach of making decisions slowly and carefully, after coming to a management consensus. MCA is typical of the fast-paced American approach, where top executives often make quick decisions and act upon them immediately.
Certainly the Texas-born Mr. Sheinberg, a lawyer by training, has a decisive, if blunt, style that even admiring associates say can sometimes border on abusiveness. That manner may have lost him some credibility with his Japanese superiors, one executive who has worked with Japanese companies said.
But for all his bluster, Mr. Sheinberg has also shown a capacity to build long-term business relationships. Aside from his association with Mr. Wasserman, there is his role as mentor and friend to the film maker Steven Spielberg and the entertainment entrepreneur David Geffen. It was Mr. Sheinberg who made the $550 million deal for Geffen Records in 1989 in just four days.
The following year, Mr. Sheinberg played a crucial role in completing the sale to Matsushita. Seeing the consolidation in the entertainment industry, Mr. Sheinberg was eager to merge with a wealthy corporation that could finance MCA's growth.
Thus, it came as a shock in 1991, when Matsushita quashed MCA's first move under the new owners: a proposed $600 million acquisition of Virgin Records. After that, Mr. Sheinberg minded the store for two years, without seeking other deals.
At the same time, events occurred that did not favor the MCA-Matsushita relationship. The father of the merger, Mr. Tanii, left his post in 1993 in the wake of a corporate scandal. Meanwhile, Japan's "bubble economy" was bursting.
For several years, MCA's management prepared volumes of material and held a series of meetings with Matsushita, leaving Mr. Sheinberg hopeful that MCA would make an equity investment of about $50 million for 20 percent of a Japanese theme-park venture that other companies would be invited to join.
"There are not that many things that are as special to MCA as its theme parks," Mr. Sheinberg said. "It was as if we were bringing our favored child to Mom and Dad's family house."
At a meeting in Osaka in June, however, Matsushita's new management spurned the child. Instead, for reasons Mr. Sheinberg said were not fully explained, Matsushita ruled that MCA should merely present itself to Japanese investors as the manager of the proposed theme park, rather than an owner.
Mr. Sheinberg grudgingly acquiesced, but he is bitter, believing Matsushita strung him along. He believes it was a relatively small investment for potentially high returns in a business in which MCA has had stunning success.
Mr. Murase, the Matushita executive who directly oversees MCA, said: "Matsushita's main business is electronics and the project is a sideline for us. If the bubble economy had not collapsed, maybe the situation would have been better. In all of Japan, everybody is suffering from diminished asset value. It is not the situation to be aggressively spending money."
Indeed, what comes through in comments from Matsushita's management is an exasperation with MCA's desire for deals the parent company feels are unnecessary.
The network proposal is such a case. Mr. Sheinberg and Mr. Wasserman had requested a special meeting with the 58-year-old president, Mr. Morishita, to discuss MCA's interest in buying 25 percent of a American television network. (Foreign companies cannot own more than 25 percent of a United States broadcaster.) The plan was a project of Mr. Wasserman, who developed it with Rand V. Araskog, the chairman of the ITT Corporation, which seeks to enter the broadcasting business.
And so, when Mr. Morishita arrived late to the meeting only to say "I see you've been told," the Americans were outraged at what they perceived as imperious treatment.
Matsushita officials, who say they regret that their guests were offended, offer a different interpretation. Mr. Morishita arrived late, Mr. Murase said, because he had been attending a special board meeting convened that morning to consider this "sudden proposal." The board meeting ran longer than expected.
Mr. Murase said the board rejected MCA's plan because it was uncertain about the future of the television networks in an era of shifting entertainment technologies. It also wondered if there would be enough profit in network-TV production, since Universal's own TV business is far from MCA's strongest division.
Matsushita also feared a backlash. "When Sony bought Columbia Pictures, the American media all said Sony bought American culture," Mr. Murase noted. "We do not want to take actions that would cause extra controversy."
To Mr. Sheinberg, "it was not just what they did, but the style," he said. "The meeting was not called to hear our presentation, but to tell us all the reasons for turning the deal down," he added.
Mr. Sheinberg said that Mr. Morishita apologized at the Osaka meeting and again in San Francisco, when Mr. Sheinberg and Mr. Wasserman threatened to quit.
No one involved is willing to predict what will happen, just as no one on the outside can imagine Mr. Sheinberg and Mr. Wasserman leaving jobs so intertwined with their professional and personal identities.
As for their bosses in Osaka, "we really hope we can recover the past good relationship," Mr. Murase said. "We are thinking about how to recover the mutual trust."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: COMPTROLLER;
Candidates Lament Tone, But Attack Just the Same

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WOODBURY, L.I., Nov. 3

 BODY:
They lamented the bitter tone of the campaign and insisted that they wanted to talk more about issues, but the two candidates for New York State comptroller fired off a steady stream of personal attacks tonight in the last of six televised debates.
H. Carl McCall, the Democratic incumbent who three days ago appeared with supporters accusing the Republican, Herbert London, of engaging in racial attacks, was silent on that issue tonight. But he opted instead to rip into his opponent for what he portrayed as Mr. London's stand against abortion rights and gun control. 
 For his part, Mr. London defended his tactics of recent weeks, which have drawn fire from both Republicans and Democrats, and said he was only trying to defend himself in a fight Mr. McCall started.
"I have been criticized for trying to answer the blatant lies that have appeared in Mr. McCall's ads," he said as the half-hour debate began here at News 12 Long Island, a local television station. "When I have done so, I have been charged with race baiting. Now you have to understand who precipitated the issues."
After the debate, Mr. London did say he regretted the use of the words "Kill the Jews," which appeared in one television ad for his campaign that was never broadcast but was released to news organizations. McCall supporters have accused Mr. London, who is Jewish, of trying to suggest that Mr. McCall, who is black, is anti-Semitic.
Mr. McCall, who was appointed comptroller by the Legislature last spring, focused his message in the debate on the newspapers that have endorsed him in recent days, and continued to charge that the comptroller's job was not the first choice of Mr. London, who had run for the Republican nomination for Governor.
"It is true," Mr. McCall said. "For many years, Mr. London, Professor London has been pursuing this idea of being governor. He said he did not want to be comptroller."
But Mr. London said that after losing the nomination for governor, he decided he wanted to be comptroller to influence the state's fiscal policies, especially to reduce taxes. Questioning his rival's credibility, Mr. London continued to charge that Mr. McCall has politicized the office, that he lacks independence and that the state's investments have suffered under his tenure.
"The role of comptroller is a role of independence," he said. "It does have something to do with fiscal integrity. It does have something to do with telling the truth. Mr. McCall fails in the last category."
On several more substantive issues, there was little controversy. Both men agreed that the state should take over escalating Medicaid costs. Both men expressed reservations about Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposed takeover of the Long Island Lighting Company, with Mr. McCall saying he was concerned how it would affect state debt and Mr. London saying the real solution to high utility rates is competition among power producers.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: WEST VIRGINIA;
The Race That Invective Forgot

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARDING HILL, W.Va., Oct. 28

 BODY:
Without a calendar, one could hardly guess that an election was in the offing.
On this brilliant autumn afternoon in the russet foothills of the Appalachians, Senator Robert C. Byrd was doing what he does best: waxing poetic about the glories of his state while he inaugurated something else in his name, the Robert C. Byrd Highway. 
 In a campaign season marked elsewhere by high-decibel invective against power and privilege, the Senate race here is tranquility itself, with Mr. Byrd, ever courtly and meticulous in his three-piece suits, floating effortlessly toward his seventh term.
Since he became chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee in 1989, Mr. Byrd has surpassed his goal of becoming "West Virginia's billion-dollar industry." He has in fact steered $1.5 billion to his home state, most of it for roads. And so his visits home are not campaign events so much as victory laps.
As he stood here, slicing a yellow ribbon to open a 12.7-mile segment of the new four-lane highway to Elkins, in the northeastern part of the state, his target was less the Republican who wants his job than those whom he describes as the "muddle-headed critics" in Washington who deride him as the "king of pork."
"On Tuesday, Nov. 8, you're going to have an opportunity to talk back to those critics in Washington," he reminded the crowd. "Tell those critics what you think of the West Virginia infrastructure."
A few protesters were on hand, but they were against extending the highway an additional 114 miles through the scenic mountains to Virginia, not necessarily against Senator Byrd. Kevin Woodcock, a 34-year-old graphic artist holding a protest banner, said he would have to "dig down way deep" before voting against the incumbent. "I'm a Democrat," he said simply. So are two-thirds of the state's voters and almost all of its elected officials.
The 76-year-old Mr. Byrd seems completely immune to the political Zeitgeist that is running this year against Democrats and incumbents and in favor of term limits. He was first elected to the Senate in 1958 and has served longer there than any other current Democrat, and only four years less than Strom Thurmond, the 91-year-old Republican from South Carolina.
The secret to his longevity?
"He is our greatest economic asset," said Don Marsh, retired editor of The Charleston Gazette.
In this hardscrabble mountain state, which ranks higher in many poverty indexes than in self-esteem, Senator Byrd revels unabashedly in bringing home the bacon.
"All roads, they say, lead to Rome," he told a rapt audience at the Logan Country Club the other night. "They haven't seen anything yet. All roads lead to Logan."
Having brought thousands of Federal jobs to the state, he has a good head start on transplanting the entire Government to West Virginia. Already to his credit: a new F.B.I. Identification Center, the Treasury Department's Bureau of Public Debt, an I.R.S. processing center, a Fish and Wildlife training center, a Coast Guard computer operations center, and a branch of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Dozens of other projects, including scholarships, locks and dams, and research centers, bear his name.
His office does not keep -- or at least does not distribute -- a master list of everything that Mr. Byrd has won for his state. "It would be a full-time job to keep it current," said an aide, Ann Adler.
Still, people here are fully aware of all he has accomplished.
"His campaigning was done in Washington," said Bob Phalen, president of United Mine Workers District 17, in southern West Virginia. Mr. Phalen said the state had been beaten down for so long by outside interests' extracting its rich natural resources that it was proud and grateful for what Senator Byrd could extract from Washington.
"People think it's their due," said Evelyn Harris, chairman of the political science department at the University of Charleston.
The Senator plays on this theme with his audiences. He reminds them that while they may receive a little something extra from Washington, they give, too. "You, the Federal taxpayers of this country, have invested $7 billion -- that's billion with a B -- for the mass transit system in Washington," he said in Logan. "Now that's pork."
"What I'm doing" in contrast, he said, "is spreading good seed that will bear fruit a hundredfold," ending West Virginia's isolation, spurring development and keeping the state's youth from looking elsewhere for jobs. "Prosperity flows along concrete rivers," he said.
But his inspiring the state with optimism only partly explains why Senator Byrd is so revered here. An orphan who grew up dirt poor, he is a self-made man, up from the coal fields, and his story gives others hope that they can make it too.
"He's a real class act," said John Skidmore, 41, one of the few Republicans in Logan, who brought his son Andrew, 14, to hear Mr. Byrd at the country club.
"He is one of a final breed of orator," said Mr. Skidmore, who despite his Republican allegiance acknowledged that he would vote for the Senator.
Speaking of Republicans, there is one running against Mr. Byrd. He is Stan Klos, a 40-year-old restorer of public buildings who is a newcomer to politics.
Mr. Klos said he was deliberately keeping a low profile in hopes that Democrats would not turn out on Election Day, thus allowing him to slip through.
The reason he is running, he said, is that the state, despite its infusion of cash, "still ranks first in unemployment, third in poverty and fifth from the bottom in life expectancy, proving that government, no matter how powerful, can't create jobs and prosperity."
But Mr. Klos said he would not campaign against the Senator. "How far out in left field can he be," the challenger said, "if he can bring $1.5 billion to the state?"

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: NEW YORK LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR;
McCaughey, the G.O.P. Stealth Candidate

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
It was 9:30 A.M. and Elizabeth P. McCaughey, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, had already downed a hamburger and two bagels and given the family chihuahua a bath. This was, after all, a big day.
The woman billed as her ticket's policy expert said she is usually buried in documents. "Do you ever look at this one?" she said at one point, holding up the Annual Statistical Report from 1992 of the New York State Department of Social Services. "It's a gold mine." 
 But on this day, her job was political. After months of being nearly invisible, she was on a statewide tour to say that a vote for B. Thomas Golisano, the Independence Fusion candidate for governor, was a vote for "four more years of economic decline." Her mission: to help stem a decline of her ticketmate, State Senator George E. Pataki.
"I know we've both tried very hard to get the message out," she said Sunday on a tiny plane over central New York. "I certainly have been working very hard."
Then, after a brief silence, she looked up from her papers and began a new conversation, an explosion of facts that was her favorite way of chatting: "Nineteen percent of all TB cases are drug resistant," she said, as if to underscore her commitment to the issues rather than politics of the campaign. "That means they are fatal."
Where Mr. Pataki tends toward the stiff and the scripted, Ms. McCaughey (pronounced McCoy), 46, leans toward spontaneous candor, which the Pataki campaign has taken steps to stamp out. Where Mr. Pataki dwells in the vague, Ms. McCaughey -- who earned a spot on the ticket for her published critique this year on the Clinton health care plan -- is often so specific that her listeners' eyes glaze over.
Now, as Mr. Pataki faces criticism for failing to define himself or his beliefs, some Republicans think that Ms. McCaughey could help voters connect with the ticket. The political newcomer exudes a wide-eyed optimism about what Republicans could achieve, which some think could be contagious.
"She believes in the tooth fairy, honey," said Fran Werner, the Queens County Republican chairwoman, who said the Pataki campaign has underused Ms. McCaughey. "She is starry-eyed and bushy-tailed talking about politics. She thinks the whole world is going to see the light. But the whole world isn't seeing the light about Betsy McCaughey. To me, this is one of the biggest mistakes of the campaign."
And after months of working on policy positions that she concedes have not become a part of the campaign, she has become more visible. She has an advertisement on television; she spent a weekend going across the state attacking Mr. Golisano, and on Wednesday, she stood beside another Elizabeth, Mr. Pataki's wife, to defend the candidate's support for abortion rights.
Republican officials and strategists say it is not unusual for a candidate for lieutenant governor to play only a small role in a gubernatorial campaign.
Ms. McCaughey's low profile, however, has been noticeable given the fanfare with which she was chosen as the running mate last spring. A scholar at the conservative Manhattan Institute, she was billed as the ideal combination of brains and glamour: the daughter of a factory worker who won a scholarship to Vassar, she earned a doctorate in constitutional history from Columbia and now counts as friends Henry Kissinger and Laurence Tisch, the CBS chairman.
Still, she became a Republican only two years ago, and Ms. McCaughey was chosen for the second spot on the ticket largely because of the mini-celebrity she earned earlier this year. She sat with a copy of the President's 1,342-page health care plan, then dissected it brutally in The New Republic and The Wall Street Journal, saying it would limit access to health care.
After the Republican convention, she and Mr. Pataki stumped for a few days, then she virtually dropped out of sight. Most speculation has been that her colorful spontaneity -- she has, for instance, compared herself to Barbie, and Mr. Pataki to Ken -- did not fit into a campaign that has taken few chances and said little about what it would do if elected.
That control was on display in September when Ms. McCaughey called a news conference to release a study on taxes and job loss in New York. When a reporter asked how she would cut spending, Ms. McCaughey said confidently, "Let me give you some examples."
She went on to say that New York could save over $150 million by reducing the cost of administering welfare to children and families. As a way to save money on Medicaid, the single largest burden on local governments, she has suggested increasing payments to doctors, to encourage them to take on more poor people as patients. She has also looked at reforming workers' compensation, home relief, and Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield, as well as tighter rules on work release for prisoners.
Her statements now are less prescriptions for change than detailed diagnoses, but she said she is deep into developing plans for after Election Day. "We have to be prepared to govern, not just campaign," she said as the plane buzzed toward the first stop of the day, in Cortland.
Ms. McCaughey, who is divorced, is dating Wilbur Ross Jr., the lawyer and investor, who is a financial contributor to the Cuomo and Moynihan campaigns. She has three daughters.
Her day on the stump was long, with stops in Cortland, Elmira and, finally, Jamestown, where Mr. Lundine was once the mayor. She was greeted by small, enthusiastic crowds, who nonetheless had their share of questions about what a Pataki governorship would mean to them.
"I wish it wasn't all ending in 10 days," she said at one point. "I guess I'm a much more social person than I thought. I used to spend 10 to 12 hours in my office. But I like traveling the state, shaking hands and listening to what they have to say."
On the way back to the city, as the twin propellers droned on the flight from Jamestown, she suggested a game of hangman using movie titles. One title stumped her and Neville Bugwadia, her assistant from her days at the Manhattan Institute.
"We're getting hung, Neville," she said. "And we're the ticket that believes in the death penalty."

HEADLINE: Detroit Sets Truck Records As Vehicle Sales Jump 8.9%

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 3

 BODY:
Drawn by the fresh curves of some 1995 vehicles and the reduced prices on 1994 models, customers continued to flock to new car dealerships in October, buying 8.9 percent more cars and light trucks than were sold during the brisk period a year earlier, the auto makers reported today.
During October, the first month of the 1995 model year, sales of cars rose 2.9 percent, to 738,221, while sales of light trucks -- pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles -- rose 18.8 percent, to 525,285. 
 "This is a continuation of steady growth -- not boom, not bust," said John Casesa, the auto industry analyst for Wertheim Schroder in New York. "I know the market is in agony about whether we're going into recovery or recession, but I think the auto market shows we're continuing a modest recovery."
Buyers continued to climb out of cars and into trucks; the Big Three domestic auto makers set light-truck sales records for October. But the apparent weakness of car sales in October was exaggerated by production constraints. Because they were switching over to new compact sedan models, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation had few vehicles to offer in that popular segment.
And the General Motors Corporation, which has had the greatest difficulty converting its plants to 1995 model production, was short of midsize and small cars. In October, Chevrolet's car sales plunged 27.3 percent, to 75,684. The drop was mostly a result of a shortage of its redesigned Cavalier small cars, which are assembled in a G.M. plant at Lordstown, Ohio. Chevy sold 27,542 Cavaliers in October 1993; it sold 3,098 last month.
Such production constraints contributed to the Big Three auto makers' loss of three percentage points of car market share last month, while the Japanese auto makers gained almost two points.
To combat the strong yen, the Japanese companies continued to emphasize sales of the cars they assemble in North America, cutting back on their imports.
In that vein, the Toyota Motor Corporation said today that it would invest $450 million to more than double capacity at its assembly plant in Cambridge, Ontario. By August 1997, Toyota said, the plant will produce 200,000 small Corolla cars a year, up from 85,000 now.
By the time the expansion is complete, Toyota plans to have hired 1,200 more workers at the plant, which now employs 1,000, and to have stopped importing Corollas from Japan.
Some industry analysts were not so sanguine about the October results. The chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association, Tom Webb, said in a statement that the seemingly strong results belie "a certain uneasiness we sense in the market."
He added: "With interest rates on the rise, it will become increasingly difficult to escape the affordability dilemma created by rising vehicle prices and stagnant household income. We don't expect sales to fall off a cliff, but it's time for analysts to rethink those rosy forecasts for 1995 and beyond."
Dealers, however, said they saw little evidence the market was softening. "We're very, very busy," said Bill Curtin, a salesman at Al Packer Ford in West Palm Beach, Fla., which posted its best October sales in 17 years.
Some dealers, particularly G.M. dealers, worried that they could not keep pace with the demand. "We can't keep enough trucks on the lot," said Tony Christensen, a salesman at Gus Paulos Chevrolet in West Valley City, Utah. Customers who choose to order, he said, face a wait of up to three months to receive a Suburban or Blazer sport utility vehicle.
"Customers don't like to wait that long," he said.
The seasonally adjusted selling rate for cars during the month was 7.1 million, the same as in September. The rate for light trucks was 6.0 million, compared with 5.6 million in the previous month. A year earlier, the rate for cars was 7.1 million, and the rate for trucks was 5.3 million.
Those rates are likely to jump in the next two months as the auto makers straighten out their production problems and dealers' stocks rise, said Susan Jacobs, president of Jacobs & Associates, an automotive consulting firm in Rutherford, N.J. "The fundamentals are still strong, and stocks are still tight," she said.
Luxury car makers continued to struggle for sales in October. Sales by the Honda Motor Company's luxury division, Acura, dropped 15.9 percent, to 7,649, and sales for Toyota's luxury division, Lexus, fell 13.7 percent, to 6,174. One notable exception was Mercedes-Benz. Its sales jumped 18.3 percent, to 5,856.
In the race to be the best-selling car in the United States, the Ford Taurus finished the month narrowly ahead of the Honda Accord, 316,041 to 313,851.

HEADLINE: Home Sales Rise, Even as Rates Do Too

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3

 BODY:
Strong labor markets are helping the nation's housing industry defy gravity, keeping it strong even as mortgage rates climb to three-year highs, a Government report showed today.
New single-family home sales in the United States rose an unexpected 2.6 percent in September to the highest level in six months even as mortgage rates climbed to two-year highs, the Commerce Department said. Separately, the Labor Department reported that first-time claims for unemployment insurance dropped last week for the third consecutive decline. 
 On a seasonally adjusted basis, claims fell 3,000 last week to 321,000 after decreasing by 1,000 the previous week to 324,000. The four-week moving average for jobless claims, a less volatile gauge of labor markets, edged up to 324,750 from 324,250. Analysts had expected the week's claims to rise by 1,000.
"If you have the income, you're buying the house," said Carey Leahey, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. "Rates are a lot less important."
They must be, because the rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to a three-year high this week of 9.05 percent, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation reported today, and the rate on the average adjustable-rate mortgage rose to 5.91 percent this week from 5.88 percent a week earlier.
The Labor Department is scheduled to report on Friday how the job market fared in October and the unemployment rate for the month.
"The economy is actually accelerating in the fourth quarter," said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at the Chicago investment firm Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson.
 Many analysts said the new data made it almost certain the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates a sixth time this year -- most likely at a Nov. 15 policy meeting -- even though there have been few signs of higher inflation.
The Commerce Department said home sales rose in the Northeast and South but declined in the Midwest and West. The September gain -- to 703,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate -- followed a revised 7.9 percent gain in August to 685,000, previously reported as an increase of 9.7 percent. September's level was the highest since 722,000 in March.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Bonds Fairly Steady On New Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were reasonably steady yesterday, although the yield on the long bond edged up to a two-and-a-half-year high. Investors remain concerned that inflation could accelerate, causing them to lose value on fixed-income investments.
Yesterday's report showing new- home sales in September were the highest in six months, even as mortgage rates climbed to two-year highs, added to their concerns. 
 The 30-year bond slipped 2/32 , to 9310/32 , for a yield of 8.10 percent, up from 8.09 percent on Wednesday and still at the top of its trading range. One factor that stemmed bonds' slide was that the dollar was steady with the Fed again in the market buying dollars to shore up the currency's value.
In when-issued trading ahead of next week's quarterly refunding, the three-year note was trading at a price to yield 7.34 percent and the 10-year to yield 7.95 percent.
Joseph V. Battipaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisors, said trading was cautious ahead of today's employment numbers, which the consensus says should be up about 230,000.
"I'm expecting something slightly less," Mr. Battipaglia added, "with the unemployment rate unchanged." Anything less than the consensus would be very good near term for bonds, he said.
On Nov. 15 the Fed will hold its Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Coming after next week's elections "will clear the plate for the Fed and allow it to do a 50-basis-point rate hike," Mr. Battipaglia said. "What is unfolding is that the economy is growing smartly, with inflation showing a tendency to whip here and there. And the thinking may be that another half-point now may be the right tonic for the economy, with the side benefit being support for the dollar."
In the morning, debt futures slid to the day's lows with the cash market trailing, following an unexpected 2.6 percent rise in the September new- home sales to 703,000. The market forecast had been a drop to 680,000.
While the home sales were well above forecasts, the downward revision for the prior month took some of the sting out of the latest report. Other data for the September period, starts, permits, and existing-home sales, had already tipped off the market to the resilience of the housing industry in this the year of rising interest rates, so the impact on the market was minimal, traders said.
Neither did the market find much inspiration from other economic news yesterday -- jobless claims and chain store sales data. Chain store sales were a little on the soft side, according to analysts, but still close to expectations. Initial claims fell 3,000, to 321,000, for the week ended Oct. 29,, just slightly lower than expected.
Elsewhere in the fixed-income market, the Republic of South Africa announced yesterday that it had filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for up to $2 billion in debt, marking its re-entry into the international capital markets. Standard & Poor's rates the country's debt at BB, two notches below investment grade.
The republic's first offering under the shelf registration is expected to be a global deal in dollar-denominated securities through Goldman, Sachs & Company and the Swiss Bank Corporation as joint lead managers.
And as rates steadied yesterday, the Banc One Corporation priced for sale $2 billion of fixed-rate securities backed by credit cards. The Columbus, Ohio, banking company issued the securities in three maturities, two- , three- and four-year notes, through Bear, Stearns & Company.
Asset-backed securities have found plenty of buyers amid a decline in corporate bond sales this year. According to MCM/Corporate Watch, corporations have sold $108 billion of debt in the first nine months of the year, down 52 percent from the comparable period a year earlier.
Underwriters priced the senior debt to yield from 7.292 percent for a two-year to 7.947 percent for a four-year, while the subordinated debt was priced to yield from 7.497 percent for a two-year to 8.148 percent for a four-year. The senior debt is rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, while the sub debt is rated A-2 and A, respectively.

HEADLINE: Auto and Retail Issues Lead Climb in Stocks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Led by automobile and retailing issues, stocks edged up yesterday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to their first gains in four days.
Even so, the market's performance was erratic, prompting concern that the rise in interest rates has sapped many investors' confidence. 
 "We've been living with this type of market for six months," said John Brooks, director of sales and marketing at the Notley Group in Atlanta. "People are a lot more nervous than they are saying they are."
The Dow industrials, which initially fell as much as 3.7 points, rose 8.75, to 3,845.88, adding most of its gain in the last 10 minutes of trading. Shares of Sears Roebuck & Company, the Walt Disney Company and the General Motors Corporation led the advance, in part because of better-than expected sales reports. Disney stock advanced 1 1/8, to 40.
Among broader stock market indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 1.40, to 467.91 after losing 1.91, to 466.51, yesterday.
The Nasdaq Combined Composite Index rose 0.28, to 772.10, after being up as much as 1.71, at 773.53. Declines were posted in the Intel Corporation, down 5/8, to 61 7/8; U S Healthcare Inc., off 1 5/8, to 44 1/8, and the Microsoft Corporation, down 3/8, to 62 5/8.The MCI Communications Corporation advanced 3/8, to 22 3/4; Price/Costco Inc. was up 7/8, to 16 3/8, and Tele-Communications Inc. had a gain of 3/8, to 20 3/4.
Shares of auto companies rebounded after being "blown apart over the last month" amid concern about profitability in G.M.'s North American operations and the car maker's future sales, said Jay Ferguson, market analyst at Ferguson, Andrews & Associates in Charlottesville, Va.
Yesterday, that concern eased after G.M. said it sold 1.3 percent more cars last month than it did a year earlier. Shares of G.M. rose 7/8, to 39 1/8; Chrysler edged up 1/2, to 48, and Ford added 1/2, to 29 5/8.
Robust sales among retailers buoyed their shares.
Shares of Best Buy, which gained 26 percent, soared 3 3/8, to 42; Ann Taylor, with a 20 percent rise, jumped 1 1/4, to 44 1/4; the Limited Inc. rose 1 3/4, to 20 3/4; Gap Inc. added 2 5/8, to 36 1/4; Sears, Roebuck spurted 1 1/8, to 49 1/2, and the Dayton Hudson Corporation skyrocketed 4 3/8, to 81 7/8.
"Retailers that specialize in or are very strong in home-oriented merchandise did exceptionally well, on the whole," said Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail Marketing Report.
Bank stocks gained as investors bet that the demand for capital would continue to grow as the economy rebounds.
"The economy has reached the point now that if it continues to expand, you're going to see companies having to borrow money," said Paul Mackey, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds who follows the industry.
The BankAmerica Corporation jumped 1, to 43 1/2; the Bankers Trust New York Corporation was up 5/8, tot 64 3/4, and the Nationsbank Corporation rose 5/8, to 49 1/2.
Advancing stocks equaled decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, where about 285.2 million shares traded hands as of 4 P.M. The three-month average volume is 292 million shares.
The Amex Market Value Index added 0.39, to 454.57.
Investors were reluctant to place big bets on stocks before today's October employment report, traders said. If the report shows signs that the economy is expanding too fast, the Fed's policy-making committee may be more likely to vote to raise interest rates at its meeting Nov. 15.

Warm Weather Slowed Retail Sales in October

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
Mother Nature seems determined to keep merchants guessing about their prospects for the all-important holiday sales season, which officially begins the day after Thanksgiving.
The nation's chain stores said unseasonally balmy weather in several parts of the country contributed to slowing sales in October, the same reason they gave for September's weak performance. 
 But analysts dismissed October's plodding pace, retaining their optimism that the holiday season, when most retailers realize the bulk of their profits for the year, will bring strong sales.
"If the weather in September and October inhibited demand for wool sweaters, it tells you absolutely nothing about business in November and December," said Edward A. Weller, a retailing analyst for Robertston, Stephens & Company.
Mr. Weller and many other analysts are counting on broader economic trends like low unemployment rates and increases in disposable income to drive holiday business. The estimates for sales growth during the holiday season range from 5 percent to 8.5 percent higher than last year's level.
Retailers, on the other hand, are not waiting for brisk business to materialize. Several are already offering promotions and decking their halls with holly.
Food Emporium is already selling Christmas candy, Toys "R" Us issued its first coupon book during the first week of October and the Express store on West 57th Street in Manhattan was hanging large glass ornaments in its windows yesterday.
"That's just Retailing 101," said Jeffrey M. Feiner, a retailing analyst for Salomon Brothers. "They've been promoting for the holidays since September, but that's nothing new."
The Salomon Brothers Same-Store Sales Growth index, a weighted average of sales increases reported by 22 large retailing companies, climbed just 3.8 percent in October. Same-store sales, or sales in stores open at least one year, are considered the best measure of a retailer's performance because they factor out the impact of new stores, which have uneven sales patterns.
The first week of November has also been unusually warm in the Midwest and Northeast, and weather forecasters have predicted a warm weekend. If retailers are correct and warm weather discourages sales, which is a matter of some debate in the industry, this month is not off to a great start.
"All in all, I'm remaining cautious about the holiday outlook, because October certainly didn't show results that would make me jump up and down," said Susan Silverstein, a retailing analyst for Gruntal & Company.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the largest retailer in the United States, said sales in its discount stores that had been open at least a year climbed 4.9 percent, lagging behind their usual growth pace. The J. C. Penney Company's comparable-store sales also increased less dramatically than usual, rising 4.5 percent.
The Ann Taylor Stores Corporation, which has outperformed its competitors all year, was the clear winner in October, posting an increase of 20 percent in comparable-store sales. Sears, Roebuck & Company's stores also outpaced the pack, producing an increase of 7 percent in same-store sales that was largely a result of strong sales of hard goods like appliances, snow blowers, shovels and car batteries.
But most companies, including the May Department Stores Company, Dillard Department Stores Inc. and the Kmart Corporation's discount stores that posted sales increases above 3 or 4 percent used heavy markdowns to increase sales. Or, like Ann Taylor, they accepted a slightly lower profit margin on their original prices.
"Those companies that played it tight on inventory got lower sales volumes, but their margins were surprisingly good," said Jeff Edelman, a retailing analyst for C. J. Lawrence.
The stock prices of many retailers rose yesterday on the expectation that in spite of weak sales increases, some retailers expect strong profits. Gap Inc., which had a comparable-store sales increase of only 2 percent in October, was hinting yesterday that most analysts had underestimated its third-quarter earnings, and its stock climbed $2.625 a share, to $36.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of the Limited Inc., which owns Limited, Express and Victoria's Secret, climbed $1.75, or almost 11 percent, to $20.75, in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Fed Intervenes for a 2d Day And the Dollar Ends Higher

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen and other leading currencies yesterday after the United States Government entered the foreign-exchange markets to prop up the value of the dollar for a second day.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which acts as the Treasury's agent in the foreign-exchange market, bought an estimated $1 billion yesterday, the same amount thought to have been purchased on Wednesday, traders said. Neither the Treasury nor the Fed normally comments on such interventions. 
 Traders said the Government bought dollars for a second day to underline its commitment to keeping the dollar strong. Many expect the Fed to add muscle to the purchases by raising interest rates, perhaps today.
"People are starting to believe that the U.S. is serious about defending the dollar," said David Durst, a currency options trader at Bear, Stearns & Company. "If the Fed follows this with a rate increase, the dollar will turn around."
Higher rates would ease traders' concern that the Fed has acted too slowly so far this year to control the inflation that often accompanies economic growth. Those concerns have dragged down the prices of Treasury bonds for much of this year. Currency dealers have been following the bond market to gauge foreign demand for American assets and the dollars needed to buy them.
The Fed started buying dollars just after 11 A.M. in New York and made its last purchase around 1:20 P.M., traders said. Other central banks did not assist the Fed yesterday or on Wednesday, they said.
"The Fed just kept buying, wave after wave," said Karl Halligan, vice president for strategic trading at CF-CIC Bank New York. He said the Fed wisely waited until London, the world's largest foreign exchange market, was closing; trading volume was then dwindling, giving the purchases more punch. "It was a smart move by the Fed," Mr. Halligan said.
In New York, the dollar jumped as high as 98.26 yen as the Fed bought, its highest level since Oct. 17, and up from a post-World War II low of 96.12 yen set in intraday trading early yesterday. The dollar settled at 97.72 yen, up from 97.63 yen on Wednesday. The dollar rose as high as 1.5247 marks before finishing at 1.5187 marks, up from 1.5138. The British pound fell to $1.6165 from $1.6225.
But the dollar failed to rise further on the Fed's efforts, in part because Treasury bonds remained weak.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Divergent Prices Recorded For Soybean Meal and Oil

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Soybean meal prices plunged yesterday while soybean oil prices surged.
Other commodity markets were relatively quiet. Gold prices fell, while crude oil moved briefly above $19 a barrel. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities slipped 0.69 point, to 233.92. 
 On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean oil for December delivery surged 53 cents, to $26.87 for 100 pounds; December meal tumbled $1.10, to $158.50 a ton, the lowest daily settlement for near-term deliveries since Aug. 26, 1987.
The divergent prices of soybean products reflect their different uses. Most soybean oil is consumed by people either as a cooking product at home or in processed foods. Soybean meal is fed to livestock to increase the protein in their mostly corn diet.
Demand for soybean oil has grown steadily in recent years as food makers, restaurants and home cooks have increasingly shunned tallow, butter and tropical oils in favor of vegetable oils with low saturated fat content.
"If you look at a package of crackers now or cookies, you don't see the coconut oils or palm oils," said Joel Karlin, research analyst with Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago. "That's helped domestic demand."
Gold prices declined as expectations grew that the Federal Reserve would move to increase short-term interest rates this month to slow inflation. Gold is a traditional hedge against inflation. On the Commodity Exchange of New York, the December gold contract fell $1.10, to $384.40 an ounce.
Crude oil prices finished slightly lower yesterday. Crude oil for December delivery rose above $19 on the New York Mercantile Exchange before ending at $18.90, down 3 cents.
Unleaded gasoline for December delivery fell 0.57 cent, to 58.95 cents a gallon. Home heating oil for delivery in December rose 0.22 cent, to 51.42 cents a gallon.
Prices were damped somewhat by news that Colonial Pipeline's network of pipelines near Houston, which was washed out in flooding late last month, was restored yesterday.
Colonial's 5,300-mile pipeline system carries two million barrels of petroleum products a day -- or about one-sixth of the United States supply -- and is a key supply point for the Northeast.

Hear Ye! Hear Ye! Four Days of Talks Scheduled

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Negotiators for baseball's striking players and owners agreed yesterday to the most ambitious schedule of bargaining sessions since they began working toward resolving their labor differences.
In a joint scheduling session with Bill Usery Jr., the mediator, in Washington, representatives of the two sides agreed to meet in the Capital next Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 
 Usery will hold discussions separately with each side next week before the joint sessions to establish an agenda for the meetings.
Usery was not in his office yesterday, and Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, who was in his office in Milwaukee, said only that negotiations would resume late next week, probably Thursday. He said he was waiting to hear from Usery today.
But a person familiar with what transpired at the meeting in Washington told about the bargaining schedule.
The only time since negotiations began last March that negotiators have met on four successive days was in the first week of August, but at none of those sessions was the core issue -- the owners' demand for a salary cap -- a topic of discussion.
They spent one meeting on a drug program and scheduling, another on the clubs' failure to make a $7.8 million payment to the players' pension and benefit plan, and two meetings on the players' ideas on revenue sharing.
The two sides, sometimes with bargaining subcommittees, met on three consecutive days the following week and four of five days, including Aug. 12, the day the players walked out. Since then, the meetings have been sparse.
Usery began the day yesterday meeting with the owners' negotiating team. He had met for two days last week with union officials, then saw them again Tuesday. After Usery's session with the management group, Donald Fehr, Gene Orza and Lauren Rich of the union joined them to discuss the resumption of joint talks.
Meeting with him yesterday were Richard Ravitch, the clubs' chief labor executive; two lawyers, Chuck O'Connor and Rob Manfred, and five club owners and executives -- Jerry McMorris of Colorado, John Harrington of Boston, Stan Kasten of Atlanta, Dave Montgomery of Philadelphia and Wendy Selig-Prieb of Milwaukee.
Selig said the same group plus Stu Meyer, formerly of the St. Louis Cardinals, will represent the clubs in the joint sessions next week,
At one of the sessions, the owners are expected to present a new proposal, which would be the first since they formally put their salary-cap plan on the table June 14. Barring a change in what negotiators have told the clubs, the owners will withdraw the $1 billion guarantee as part of their plan to give the players 50 percent of their revenue for salaries and other costs.
The change is necessary because of the drastic change the strike has created in the owners' economy. Instead of an anticipated $1.78 billion in revenue in 1994, the clubs will end up close to $1.2 billion.
The owners have not removed the salary cap from the table because that is the plan they intend to implement if they declare an impasse and unilaterally change the terms and conditions that were part of the expired collective bargaining agreement.
Initially, the clubs had been expected to take that step by Nov. 1, but they encountered problems that would have made it risky for them to implement their own rules without a serious challenge from the union. Then the Clinton Administration asked Usery, a veteran mediator, to become involved, and his presence insured further delay in the owners' declaration of impasse and implementation.

Downhill After the Los Angeles Riots

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN 

 BODY:
"Am I losing my mind? Am I sick?" worries John Boyz (James Le Gros), the unemployed, 30-something narrator of Peter McCarthy's brave but misguided contemporary satire, "Floundering." The Los Angeles riots have barely subsided, and John, who lives in Venice Beach, is haunted by what he calls a "pervasive feeling of doom." His edgy mood is made worse by his morbid habit of obsessively replaying his own homemade videotapes of the riots. Prominently featured in those videos is Merryl Fence (Nelson Lyon), a Los Angeles police chief who suggests a monstrous caricature of the real-life Daryl F. Gates.
John seems almost eager for disaster to strike, and on one especially terrible day it finally does. In the space of a few hours, he discovers that the Internal Revenue Service has put a lien on his savings account, his unemployment compensation has run out, and his brother has fled a drug rehabilitation clinic. Seeking solace from his girlfriend, Jessica (Lisa Zane), he finds her in bed with another man. 
 John begins losing his grip on reality, and as he does, the movie slips back and forth between reality and fantasy in a way that thoroughly mixes them up. Voices in John's television set address him. His dead parents appear at his bedside and advise prayer. John's descent accelerates when he joins some crack-smoking revolutionaries in front of his apartment building, takes a toke on a pipe, and winds up passed out on the sidewalk for hours while pedestrians gleefully strip him of his valuables. But somehow he is able to muster one last burst of spirit.
The movie, which has several frank sex scenes and profanity, eventually turns into an exhilarated daydream in which the poor and downtrodden of Los Angeles have miraculously organized into a revolutionary army, and John finds love with a woman he has kidnapped. The late-blooming love story seems tacked on and completely out of character.
"Floundering," which opens today at the Quad, is the directorial debut of Mr. McCarthy, a producer associated with such cult favorites as "Repo Man," "Sid and Nancy" and "Tapeheads." The movie, which includes vivid cameo performances by John Cusack, Ethan Hawke and Steve Buscemi, as well as appearances by rock performers like David M. Navarro, Exene Cervenka and Zander Schloss in acting roles, wants to be something like the slacker generation's answer to "Easy Rider."
In the movie's vague but impassioned us-and-them view of Los Angeles, the "us" are symbolized by a Hispanic woman who supports her family collecting soda cans in John's neighborhood. Representing "them" are the fulminating police chief whom John fantasizes assassinating and a smug businessman friend who refuses to lend him money.
Almost everybody in "Floundering" has a pet theory about what's wrong with Los Angeles and a drastic remedy for curing the city's ills. Mr. McCarthy's screenplay includes so many speeches on the subject that the film often takes on the emotionally frustrated tone of a radio talk show. Because the speechifying lacks the cutting comic edge that distinguishes good satire, "Floundering" too often blubbers when it should be viciously funny.

FLOUNDERING

BYLINE: By CHARLES HAGEN 

 BODY:
The images that Doris Ulmann made in the South in the 1920's and 30's occupy a curious position in the history of documentary photography. Ulmann's subjects, among them the mountain people of Appalachia and the blacks of the Gullah region of South Carolina, were staples of socially concerned photography during the New Deal era, whether Margaret Bourke-White's sensationalist reportage for Life magazine or the more measured documentary work of Walker Evans and other photographers working for the Farm Security Administration.
But Ulmann's soft-focus portraits, presented in richly expressive prints made using the platinum process, are distinctly unlike the sharp, detailed images favored by her contemporaries. A diverse selection of Ulmann's powerful but rarely seen images, at the 292 Gallery in SoHo, is a pleasure to see for its own sake, and also valuable as a challenge to the widespread notion that only the sharp-focus approach of Modernism is appropriate for social analysis and critique. 
 Ulmann was born in 1882. She took up photography at 20, studying first with Lewis Hine and later with Clarence H. White. The influence of both men can be seen in her later work, which combines Hine's interest in social issues with White's use of soft focus, dramatic lighting and fine printing to heighten emotional impact.
Ulmann's husband was an orthopedic surgeon, and among her first projects were series of portraits of leading physicians at Columbia and Johns Hopkins universities, as well as pictures of important editors of the day. Gradually she became interested in traditional rural communities, and after 1927 she began to travel the mountain areas of Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina with John Jacob Niles; Ulmann photographed the people while Niles collected their traditional folk songs.
Ulmann brought her experience as a portraitist to these pictures, posing the hill folk in typical costumes and often including simple props to indicate the quality of the people's lives. One old woman, dressed in a long gingham dress, stands in front of a spinning wheel as tall as she is; in another picture a woman sits in the doorway of a bare wooden shack, peeling potatoes; in a third, a woman poses with a basket of apples in her lap.
What makes Ulmann's pictures extraordinary is her assured control of lighting and gesture. In a later photograph that may have been taken on the coast of Alabama, the faces of two men pushing a crate of oysters are hidden in shadow, while the oysters themselves glow with light; in another, a man in overalls and a floppy hat sits in a doorway, hands relaxed in his lap, while behind him a bright window can be seen beyond the shadowy interior.
Ulmann's sitters offer themselves to the camera with remarkable dignity, and the photographs portray them with respect, treating them neither as victims nor heros. Instead, Ulmann's subjects were presented as representatives of a way of life threatened by the encroachment of the modern world.
In that light, her work can be seen as a counterpart to Edward S. Curtis's mammoth project in the early years of the century to photograph all aspects of American Indian life. The two photographers shared romantic attitudes toward their subjects, and both tried to preserve images of cultures they feared were on the brink of extinction.
No matter how well intentioned, such preservationist projects risk being patronizing, with photographers implicitly pretending to know what's best for the people being photographed. What saves Ulmann's pictures, though, is her attention to the human beings at their heart: whatever her beliefs may have been about the plight of the culture, she never lost sight of the people in front of her lens.
Before and after her death in 1934, Ulmann's pictures were included in books on folk crafts and the like. But neither Ulmann's soft-focus style nor her undogmatic approach fit in with the prevailing styles of the 1930's, which tended to regard poor Southerners as victims of economic oppression; partly as a result, her pictures fell out of fashion. Only in recent decades have they have come back into view.
Today, as in the 1930's, most documentary photographers rely on the seeming transparency of photographs to give their images the authority of reality. Ulmann's images openly acknowledge their status as pictures, consciously shaped to record scenes in a particular way; with the certainties of Modernism no longer accepted without question, her quietly respectful and unabashedly appealing photographs take on a surprising degree of interest.
Doris Ulmann's photographs remain on view at the 292 Gallery, 120 Wooster Street (near Prince Street), in SoHo, through Dec. 3.

HEADLINE: Indonesia's Phony Cleanup

 BODY:
Indonesia's rulers see this month's Asia-Pacific economic summit meeting as a terrific opportunity to improve an international image stained by repression in East Timor and other serious human rights abuses. How much more flattering to display a statesman-like President Suharto playing host to his counterparts from the U.S., China, Japan and a dozen other countries and touting the opportunities of the world's fourth-most-populous nation and one of its most vibrant economies.
Both images of Indonesia are true. But its crude effort to shove all human rights problems out of camera range only highlights the repressive character of the regime. 
 The effort, called "Operation Cleansing," began last spring under the guise of a drive against street crime. Since then it has been broadened to target "economically and politically motivated criminals" like academics, journalists, independent labor organizers and human rights activists, halting in its tracks the limited liberalization President Suharto proclaimed several years ago.
Three leading news magazines were shut down in June. Muchtar Pakpahan, leader of Indonesia's largest independent labor union, is currently being tried on patently political charges. George Aditjondro, a leading academic, was interrogated two weeks ago on criminal charges of "insulting a government body or authority" for remarks he made at an academic seminar in August.
President Clinton has proclaimed human rights a theme of his foreign policy, and U.S. law mandates a link between basic worker rights and the special trade privileges Indonesia currently enjoys. Yet the Administration has sent mixed signals about whether it will raise human rights issues during Mr. Clinton's one-on-one meeting with Mr. Suharto or at working sessions of the Asia-Pacific meeting.
If Washington fails to do so, it will reinforce the impression created by the President's retreats on human rights in China and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown's aggressive promotion of business profits at the expense of other values. It will also encourage other countries with serious human rights problems to do as Indonesia does and simply sweep its critics off the streets.

HEADLINE: What Rebound, Stupid?

BYLINE: By James K. Galbraith; James K. Galbraith teaches economics at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas.

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
Despite steady growth and low inflation, polls show that voters, especially the middle class, are unhappy and may not reward the Democrats. Have they forgotten economic growth? No, but higher interest rates have spoiled the benefits of growth for many Americans.
Contrary to the prevailing consensus, the growth record in this period of expansion is poor. Total real growth in the first three years after recessions in 1970, 1974 and 1982 averaged nearly 16 percent. But from 1991-94, total growth will barely reach 10 percent. Expansions have been rewarded at the polls in years of high growth: 5.3 percent in 1964, 5.4 percent in 1972, 7.8 percent in 1984. No such good year has occurred this time. 
 In recoveries, the early gains in income go mainly to businesses and the newly employed. Continuously employed working people -- the majority -- gain little at first. Average hourly wages and weekly earnings haven't risen in this expansion, when inflation is taken into account. Wages rise only when the economic growth rate is high and labor markets grow tight; this hasn't happened, and a policy that accepts 6 percent unemployment will prevent it now.
This year, rising interest rates have hit the middle class hard. They raise the cost of mortgages and other loans. They depress mutual funds. They depress the housing market, where homeowners have their equity. And they lead to tougher credit standards, squeezing buyers of new homes and cars.
On taking office, President Clinton presented a program that would have accelerated growth while placing maximum pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates down. The program, which was much maligned and quickly discarded, was meant to avoid the slow-growth, rising-rate trap we now see and to avert the angry reaction now upon us.
The Administration switched to a program of straight deficit reduction, placing the whole burden on low interest rates to support growth. Then came another mistake: failure to secure guaranteed cooperation from the Federal Reserve.
Thus the promised benefits of deficit reduction were not realized. Instead, the Fed started chasing phantom inflation. Long-term interest rates started rising just after Congress acted, as markets speculated that Chairman Alan Greenspan would soon jump Bill Clinton's ship. He did in February, raising short-term rates with the President's public but pained acquiescence.
Since then, the White House has been trapped. It predicted that higher short rates would bring long rates down. It turned out to be wrong. Now it claims that long-term interest rates will remain high because of demands for capital, even though total credit is up only 5 percent this year. The markets are not fooled.
All attention focuses every six weeks on the real seat of power, the Fed. This week, will it raise rates again? And every piece of good news -- for example, the rise in construction spending reported Wednesday -- sends the stock and bond markets down in anticipation of a new increase in interest rates.
The essential step now is to stabilize interest rates. If the Administration remains silent, the new Congress, which has authority over the Federal Reserve, should act. Some rates could even be lowered selectively, perhaps through a Congressional program of economic recovery loans to states with high unemployment, like New York, New Jersey and California.
But if interest rates continue to rise, Congress will be obliged to recognize that there is no way to reconcile responsible fiscal policy with the public's well-justified demand for economic progress. Congress should then forge ahead with its own round of public investment and employment programs, a higher minimum wage and even a working-class tax cut, perhaps in the Social Security payroll tax.
Then the next administration might relearn the lesson that low and stable interest rates must accompany deficit reduction.

Change Of Character

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS; A. M. Rosenthal is recuperating after surgery. His column will resume shortly.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
If you liked the 1992 Republican National Convention, with its bashing of the un-Christian and the un-straight, you'll love the 1996 convention. Assuming, that is, that the party wins as big as it expects in the upcoming midterm elections.
Last time we had Pat Robertson and Pat Buchanan. We had the Republican Chairman, Rich Bond, warning that if Bill Clinton was elected, Jane Fonda would be sleeping in the White House "as guest of honor at a state dinner for Fidel Castro." 
 Next time the powerful new committee chairmen in a Republican-controlled Senate will surely be featured. Among them will be Jesse Helms, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Alfonse D'Amato, chairman of Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.
The Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, will be on the platform, expanding on his theme that Democrats are "the enemy of normal Americans." But the star turn will be the charismatic new Senator from Virginia, Oliver North.
Pat Robertson will be back, too. His Christian Coalition will have been the single most significant factor in the choice of Republican candidates in 1994 and in the election of many. As a notable example, it made Senator North the Republican nominee over the objection of many party regulars.
Envisioning the 1996 convention after victory in 1994 makes one understand what has happened to the Republican Party. Across the country, in state after state, it has moved sharply to the right: to a conservatism of a kind distinct from the mainstream political right in Britain, France or any other developed country.
It is not Ronald Reagan's conservatism, whose central theme was lower taxes and the free market. President Reagan talked about the so-called social issues -- abortion, prayer, the family -- but in office did little about them.
For the new forces in the party, they are the issues. No one knows exactly what legislation they would pass. But the kind of society they want is quite clear: a more Christian and more pious America, with women's right to choose eliminated and their struggle for economic and political equality turned back.
Many who have nothing to do with the Christian right are distressed by aspects of American society today: the romanticizing of violence and vulgarity, the rise of illegitimacy, the decay of responsibility. For me, those are fundamental challenges to a decent society.
Because those problems exist, and the Christian right focuses on them, I think a lot of people have paid too little attention to the real nature of its political gospel. They do not realize how strident and narrow it is.
Pat Robertson himself comes on these days as an unfrightening figure, but that is only because his real views are not generally known. It took Michael Lind of Harper's magazine, writing last month in The Washington Post, to bring them to my attention.
In his book "The New World Order," published in 1991, Mr. Robertson said a secret cabal of international bankers, Freemasons and occultists had brought about the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution and the Federal Reserve. Jewish bankers were especially active.
The Robertson book asserted that Jewish bankers on Wall Street, trying to create a "new world order," supported the Bolshevik Government after the Revolution. Noting a report that Jews had been admitted to the Masonic order in Frankfurt for the first time, it said that, if so, "we have discovered the link between the occult and the world of high finance."
A Robertson spokesman wrote to The Post saying that he supports Israel, which is true, and that the quotations were taken "out of context." Well, here is another found by Mr. Lind: "It is my belief that John Wilkes Booth, the man who assassinated Lincoln, was in the employ of the European bankers."
That a person who would put those views in a book is a major force in the Republican Party today is not a trivial matter. The Christian Coalition this weekend is distributing 33 million election guides to voters. The character of a great American party is changing, to the anguish of some who have been among its leaders. Attention must be paid.

HEADLINE: Help Russian Workers Get Their Back Wages

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Despite growing unemployment in Russia and the widespread practice of companies not paying their workers for long periods, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia has called for a "more rigorous policy of economic reform to insure stability" (news article, Oct. 28). What this means is that impoverished working people and pensioners will be expected to tighten their belts even further. 
 In protest against this intolerable situation, the Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia organized mass demonstrations in the country's major cities on Oct. 27, demanding that workers be paid the back wages due them. The federation represents 50 million workers out of a total labor force of 70 million.
Neither the International Monetary Fund nor the Clinton Administration, which are pressing the Yeltsin Government to accelerate economic reform, has offered any public criticism of the arbitrary withholding of workers' wages, which, as of Sept. 1, was said to amount to 3.9 trillion rubles (about $1.3 billion).
In the United States, merchants' lien laws were enacted as far back as the first half of the 19th century, protecting the wages of workers and making them privileged creditors in case of bankruptcy or other employer defaults in payment. Russian workers deserve that same kind of legal protection. And when loans are granted to Russia by the I.M.F., the World Bank, the United States and other countries, it should be expected that workers will be paid in full and on time.

HEADLINE: Never Mind Those I.Q. Scores: It's Dedication That Counts

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Congratulations to Brent Staples for taking the I.Q. worshipers to task so pointedly and effectively in "The 'Scientific' War on the Poor" (Editorial Notebook, Oct. 28). 
 "The Bell Curve" and other books on the relationship of heredity and intelligence have made some constructive suggestions -- the importance of more research on social maladjustment, and the need for more creative imagination than we now observe in planning social welfare and in education.
But on the whole, their focus on I.Q. and bad heredity is a myopic one. As geneticists have pointed out, the high values of one social milieu are the vices of another, and our milieu is constantly changing.
The rate of genetic change in the population is very slow compared with the changes in our social institutions. As a consequence, the quantitative importance of hereditary variation for our social problems is quite unknown and impossible to measure.
The I.Q. worshipers overlook that achievements worthy of a true genius are accomplished by average human beings dedicated to a goal. Each person is a partial genius contributing one or more particular virtues, but together human beings can be organized as collective geniuses excelling an individual genius.
Under these circumstances we can hardly neglect another prescription: the need for working out the techniques of education, medical care and industrial and economic organization that would create opportunity and incentives for the whole wonderful variety of human beings.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Shifting Trade Emphasis Away from Japan;
More Growth Predicted for New Markets

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3

 BODY:
Suffering battle fatigue after two years of fighting Japan over trade issues, the Clinton Administration is putting a new emphasis on the emerging markets in the rest of Asia and Latin America -- areas that it believes will greatly outstrip Japan as consumers of American exports.
The change in emphasis will become evident over the next month, as Mr. Clinton flies off to two trade meetings, first with Asian leaders in Jakarta, Indonesia, and then with Latin American leaders in Miami. Already, Mr. Clinton's top economic aides are brandishing charts and graphs to prove their point that growth in American exports to those regions will dwarf exports to Japan over the next 15 years. This should be the case even if every trade barrier the United States has complained about in Japan is dismantled. 
 "We're not abandoning our efforts with Japan, because we can't allow the world's second-largest economy to have sanctuary markets," Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said over a lunch in his office the other day. "But when we looked at the numbers, we saw where the action is, and it is in our own hemisphere and in Asia outside of Japan."
Mr. Kantor's projections indicate that American exports to Japan will grow by nearly 70 percent, to $88 billion, by the year 2010. But exports to the rest of Asia are expected to rise 163 percent, to $248 billion, or nearly three times the Japanese volume. Latin American trade, including Mexico, should rise by similar bounds to $232 billion, Mr. Kantor's office projects.
So the Administration's new focus will be on creating export incentives and pressing for reduced barriers in those faster-growing markets in hopes that the United States will prove far more successful far more quickly.
For the Clinton Administration, Mr. Kantor's charts carry tremendous political resonance. The chances of any breakthrough improvement with Japan over the next year -- or at least a breakthrough that would reflect itself in the trade-deficit figures -- are now judged at nearly nil. But Mr. Clinton's advisers are betting that the new export strategy will yield much faster results, enabling them to claim a major increase in exports and jobs in time for the 1996 Presidential election.
The signs of frustration with Tokyo are everywhere, reflected in open questioning within the Administration about whether 18 months of talks has led to anything more than changes at the margins of Japanese industry. "We weren't counting on dealing with four different Japanese governments, and that threw us," one White House official said last week.
Another official deeply involved in the negotiating process said that "there are people here who have invested hundreds and hundreds of hours into this, and just like health care they have little to show for it."
If the Administration seems to be losing its passion for continuing struggles with Tokyo, it is partly a reflection of its overoptimism last year. Just hours after President Clinton signed a "framework accord" with former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa in July 1993, laying out a detailed series of sector-by-sector negotiations to be completed between Tokyo and Washington, his aides were contending that a huge breakthrough was at hand.
David R. Gergen, at the time Mr. Clinton's counselor and top news media adviser, told reporters in Tokyo that major agreements and a decline in the trade gap were only six months away. "This time it will be different," he said.
But after an initial era of good feeling that extended through last year's first summit meeting of Asian leaders, the relationship with Japan quickly dissolved into a familiar exchange of threats and counterthreats. The first agreements, on insurance, medical and telecommunications equipment, came only two months ago. Japan's trade surplus, at least in dollar terms, continues to rise.
On the key issue between the two countries -- trade in autos and auto parts -- there is still no agreement, and none is foreseeable for the next year. Even those Administration officials who say that it is essential to keep up the pressure on Japan concede that the primary value of the talks is symbolic: they discourage other countries from emulating Japan's practices and give credibility to Mr. Clinton's arguments in favor of free trade.
But there is a long-term danger, some Asian experts say, that the shift of American attention could come back to haunt the United States. Unless the largest American companies invest more heavily in Japan, study after study suggest, they will fail to acquire Japanese technology and bring more of it to American shores. Investing in emerging markets may be less expensive and more immediately profitable, but it may not keep the United States on the technological edge.
Administration policy is following American companies. Indeed, the shift in emphasis is easiest to see at the Commerce Department. Just a few years ago, it was regularly blitzing American companies with seminars and literature on strategies for exporting their products to Japan. It argued that American companies could not hope to compete there unless they made significant investments on Japanese soil. Those arguments still hold, but they are drowned out by conferences on the Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze River in China, on telecommunications opportunities in Brazil and Argentina, and the power generation needs in Indonesia and India.
Some economists and trade experts argue that the drive to focus on other markets may indirectly prove productive in dealing with the Japanese. Placing an emphasis on Japan's competitors, the theory goes, particularly in Asia, plays to some of Japan's national insecurities. Pressing for free trade in Asia sometime in the next two decades or so -- the political commitment Mr. Clinton is trying to line up from the leaders who will gather at the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation conference -- is seen by many as an effort to get other countries to join Washington in putting pressuring on the Japanese.
"It's not a bad strategy," said C. Fred Bergsten, the head of the Institute for International Economics and the chairman of a group of economists who have laid out the agenda for the Jakarta meeting. "It brings aboard the countries in Asia who agree with our goals and hate our unilateral tactics."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 12, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Nov. 4 about a reduction of American companies' interest in Japan referred incorrectly to the Asian offices of Merrill Lynch & Company. The headquarters for the Merrill Lynch's Asian operations have long been in Hong Kong; they are not being moved to Hong Kong from Tokyo, where the company maintains an office for Japan.

The Economy
 
The nation's unemployment rate eased to a four-year low of 5.8 percent and hourly wages rose by the largest amount in more than a decade. The report confirmed that the economy was in a robust recovery. But signs of accelerating inflation were also seen, and bonds and stocks fell sharply. [Page 1.] The New York region lagged behind the nation in job gains. The unemployment rate jumped in New York City, rose slightly in the state and remained level in New Jersey. [54.]
 
 
Markets
 
Long-term interest rates jumped to their highest level in more than three years after the Treasury market was unnerved by the Labor Department's employment report. [41.]
 
Stocks tumbled after the employment report heightened fears of an inflation rate that would hurt the value of stocks and bonds. Late computerized selling also weighed on prices. [42.]

Copper prices rose to a four-year high on a report of low inventory. Crude oil prices fell after an early jump. [53.]
 
 
Companies
 
McDonnell Douglas will manufacture 20 commercial aircraft for China at its plant in Long Beach, Calif. -- rather than let the Chinese produce the aircraft themselves in Shanghai. [41.]

Time Warner is talking with Cablevision Industries about a possible joint venture. Such an alliance would give Time Warner access to more homes in areas like New York State. [41.]

Your Money
 
A way to invest in the stock market without the risk?

HEADLINE: Job Report Jolts Bonds; Rates Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Solid gains in jobs and wages jolted the Treasury market yesterday, driving long-term interest rates to their highest level in more than three years.
 A decline in the nation's unemployment rate and a sharp rise in hourly wages rekindled concerns that inflation would accelerate and that the Federal Reserve would respond by raising short-term interest rates aggressively to slow growth. 
 The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury fell 18/32 , to 9224/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, surged to 8.15 percent, from 8.10 percent on Thursday, the highest it has been since Aug. 13, 1991. Stocks also declined, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing 38.36 points. [Page 42.]
 Bond prices initially rose after the release of the Labor Department's report on October employment. The small rally was sparked by the news that new nonfarm payroll jobs rose by 197,000 last month, less than market forecasts.
 But investors were soon troubled by hints of inflation they saw in the October data on wages and the workweek. The Government reported that earnings increased seven-tenths of 1 percent, raising fears of increasing labor costs. And the length of the workweek remained at levels not seen since World War II.
 "As you go deeper into the employment report it gets stronger and stronger," said Peter J. Canelo, chief investment strategist at NatWest Securities. "Hours are up significantly and the huge upward revision in jobs basically tells us inflation is coming."
 The October employment report also included major revisions for previous months that increased significantly the number of new jobs created this year.
 The increase in the average workweek and the rise in wages could help push the rate of economic growth up to 4.5 percent or more from its current pace of 3.4 percent, said Stephen D. Slifer, an economist with Lehman Brothers.
 The gain in average hourly earnings was the biggest increase in some time, Mr. Slifer said. "Earnings are growing quite steadily between 2.5 and 2.7 percent, and that has everybody nervous," he said.
 The current economic expansion has been marked by wages lagging behind other costs. But the employment report yesterday confirmed an increase in wage pressures seen in other reports. Signs of labor shortages have appeared in many parts of the country and in a number of industries, according to the Fed's "beige book" regional survey released on Tuesday.
 Analysts said the jobs report should put Fed policy on a more aggressive course, although that does not mean the central bank will raise its short-term interest rate target sooner than the Nov. 15 meeting of its policy-making committee.
 The market consensus is that the Fed will increase its short-term interest rate target by half a percentage point in November and by another half a percentage point in December. The Fed's target for the Federal funds rate, which it has raised five times this year, is now 4.75 percent. The funds rate is the interest paid on overnight loans between banks.
 Still, the lack of certainty over the Fed's next move could unsettle the Treasury's refinancing next week, analysts said. The Treasury plans to offer $68.2 billion in new securities, including $29 billion in new 3-year and 10-year notes.
 "Supply always makes the market queasy, particularly in a period of rising rates," Mr. Slifer said.
 In when-issued trading, the yield on the new three-year note was up 6 basis points from the previous day to 7.40 percent, and the 10-year note was up 7 basis points, to 8.02 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
 Mr. Canelo also noted the refinancing, saying the market was searching for price levels low enough to make it attractive to investors. Once it finds that bottom, bonds could rally, he said.
 "Bonds over the next week or two will reach a turning point," Mr. Canelo predicted, "but we've got to get through some significant events first. There are the elections, a coming supply of new Treasury paper and then the Fed can do its dirty work and then the air will be clear."
 The bond market yesterday was also weighed down by a weaker dollar, which discourages foreign investors.

HEADLINE: Dow Plunges 38.36 After Jobs Report

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Once again Wall Street took fright at news that Main Street was doing well. The Government's report yesterday that the unemployment rate had fallen to a four-year low rekindled fears that a too-strong economy would produce an inflation rate that would hurt stocks and bonds.
 Stocks dropped even though the dollar stabilized and the earnings season was coming to a close with a surprising number of companies reporting results that beat Wall Street's expectations. 
 Heavy use of computerized selling programs in the last 30 minutes of trading took the Dow sharply lower into the close. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 38.36 points yesterday, to 3,807.52, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 fell 5.63 points, to 462.28. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index dropped 6.02 points, to 766.08.
 Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 282.3 million shares changing hands, about 2 percent more than this year's average of 279 million shares.
 The proximate cause of yesterday's slide was the Labor Department's report that the unemployment rate had dipped to 5.8 percent. Even the news that the economy added only 194,000 new jobs, fewer than the 239,000 jobs that private economists had expected, failed to ease the bond market's slide, which promptly led to the fall in stocks.
"The numbers themselves were no surprise and built into prices anyway," said David Holt, market strategist for Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "The big downdraft came from the arbitragers, who were liquidating their positions as they go into the weekend."
 The absence of countervailing good news -- in other words, signs that elsewhere the economy was stumbling -- led the traders to veer toward pessimism over future moves by the Federal Reserve.
 Every economic report that can be interpreted as a sign of a slowing economy makes the market less certain that the Fed will raise interest rates a sixth time this year on Nov. 15. For now, however, the markets appear to be assuming the Fed will raise rates, bidding down stocks and bonds.
 Stock traders are in a bind. Earnings are better than ever: 441 of the S.& P. 500 companies have reported earnings so far and of these, 54.6 percent beat expectations. But the strong economy that produced those earnings is alarming the bond market with inflation fears.
 A variety of high-technology stocks fell. Shares of Chiron, a biotechnology company, fell 3 1/8, to 59, after it reported lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Thursday. Megatest established a 52-week low of 8 3/4 before closing at 9 7/8, down 3 5/8. Megatest, a maker of integrated circuit-testing equipment, said it could report a loss for the first quarter ending Nov. 26.
 The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.45 points, to 254.21, with declining stocks outnumbering advancing stocks by 1,486 to 662. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 1.66 points, to 452.91.
 Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 22 fell, led by I.B.M., which dropped 2 1/8, to 71 1/8. Of the 500 stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 390 fell, led by Exxon, which dropped 1 1/8, to 61 1/2.
 In Tokyo, stocks ended higher yesterday. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 60.91 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, at 19,811.56. For the week, the Nikkei was up 6.4 points.

HEADLINE: A Rescue for 3 Georgia Plants as Sara Lee Exits

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CARTERSVILLE, Ga.

 BODY:
Diane Barnette scudded across the factory's maple floorboards, sewing machines buzzing like a swarm of hornets, stopped to scrutinize some T-shirts and spoke of the day the factory was to shut.
 "It was a very, very traumatic day," she said, her blond hair bobbing above the din. "They said that if they didn't find a buyer or some other arrangement, they would close it on Sept. 6. It hit us pretty hard. I guess we were in denial that this would happen." And it didn't, thanks to a local bank and a group of entrepreneurs.
 For Ms. Barnette, who rose from a sewing machine operator earning $1 an hour 24 years ago to plant manager today, and for the 200 seamstresses here who start at $4.25 an hour, the impending shutdown bordered on the apocalyptic. "Everybody in this town has some connection with this place," she said. "Really, you had a certain group of people here, this is what they do. This is what they know."
 But the incessant drumbeat of international competition and the imperatives of the plant's owner, the Sara Lee Corporation in Chicago, signaled that the old mill in this north Georgia town of 12,000 was no longer needed, and that another small factory had to go.
 Last June, Sara Lee, considered one of the best-managed consumer products companies, announced that to improve profits it would cut the number of plants making knitwear, fleecewear and men's and women's underwear. "We were getting out of private label apparel manufacture, things like sweatshirts for the Gap, active wear." said Nancy Young, a spokeswoman. "We decided to get out and announced this closing in August."
 For the 230, mostly women, employees at the Cartersville factory of Spring City Knitting, a Winston-Salem, N.C., subsidiary of Sara Lee, and the 110 workers at a sister factory in Milledgeville about 120 miles away, unemployment seemed as inevitable as a rushing thunderstorm.
 Jerry Kemp, a lean 45-year-old Kentuckian who moved to Cartersville years ago as a Sara Lee vice president, had other ideas. The year before Mr. Kemp and three partners formed Springtown Inc., which bought a former Sara Lee plant in Wrightsville, Ga., where 350 workers made men's underwear.
 When news of the closing hit here and at a more modern plant in Midgeville, he agreed to buy them and to try to make a go of all three former Sara Lee plants.
 "I like this area and wanted to raise my family here," said Mr. Kemp, the father of two teen-agers. "I wanted to get into business by myself."
 He approached some friends, who had also spent their careers in the apparel business, and they poured their savings into the company. Mr. Kemp became its president.
 "We all had a good understanding of what it would take to make this work," he said, "but probably the hardest part was putting together the financial package and making this competitive internationally." He sees tough times ahead for the apparel industry in the United States, particularly as global trade is liberalized.
 Indeed, apparel industry employment has fallen 18 percent in the last decade, from 1.185 million workers in 1984 to 970,000 today, according to the American Apparel Manufacturers Association. And over the same period, the association says, apparel imports climbed 159 percent, to $28.2 billion, not including foreign fur, rubber, leather and plastic apparel.
 Under an unusual agreement, not yet final, Sara Lee donated the three factories to the state, which plans to enter into a lease-purchase agreement with Mr. Kemp's company, Springtown Inc. Eventually Springtown will own the factories and keep the local workers on the job.
 Mr. Kemp and his partners had some misgivings. The Milledgeville plant could quickly make small batches of a wide range of knitwear and active wear and could be profitable. But in Cartersville, "we decided to take a gamble," Mr. Kemp said. "This is a high-cost operation to run," he added. "It's old. It's not automated. But because of the management, the people, and because we ourselves were here, we decided it was worth taking a chance."
 David Dautel, Springtown's chief financial officer, said that the company had applied for two loans from the state for $250,000 each for the Milledgeville and Cartersville plants. The state grants the money to the localities, which, in turn, lend to the company at below-market rates. The loans are repaid over five to seven years to the localities, which can then relend the money to others.
 Putting the deal together involved persuading a nearby bank, the Trust Company Bank of Northwest Georgia, in Rome, that he and his partners could make a go of Sara Lee's old plants.
 David Johnson, the bank's senior loan officer, said: "I'd say the first question we asked was 'If they couldn't do it, why can you?' " After all, Sara Lee had a reputation for knowing how to run plants efficiently.
 But the bank, Mr. Johnson said, was encouraged because Mr. Kemp and his partners had spent their working lives in the business, Sara Lee's existing contracts were inherited by Springtown, the market and cost projections looked good, and interviews with Springtown customers were positive.
 "We asked them who is their primary market," Mr. Johnson said. "If they are making for Russell, that's a pretty strong company. If they're making for Jockey, that's a pretty strong company. We will call the company and ask how comfortable they are with the company -- can they produce a quality product at a competitive price?"
 He said that the fact the bank was lending to Springtown in Cartersville, which is on the fringe of its usual business territory, was an expression of confidence. "Our interest is in Cartersville," he said. "It is a viable employer. It has great potential and is important to the community there."
 While Mr. Kemp wants plants that can produce garments that were not being made by others, he said he was also determined to save jobs, even if it appeared risky. "They're good people here, and a lot of these jobs are in towns where there's not a lot of opportunity," he said. "Just writing this off is just not right."
 In starting an apparel company, Mr. Kemp and his partners, like mice scampering between the legs of elephants, are trying to find niches in the market and to compete aggressively. It is not easy, he admitted.
 "First," he continued, "our niche is in active wear and underwear, mostly contract manufacture," for other labels. "We want people like the Gap or Jockey or Calvin Klein. When they want a lounge or a fashion kind of underwear, we're the people who come to mind."
 Mr. Dautel, the financial officer, said that the company's expectations for the Cartersville plant hinged on transforming it into an efficient headquarters with a computerized inventory system and into the central distribution point for the company's other two factories.
 And while the Georgia plants are the core of his company, Mr. Kemp acknowledged that it needed lower-cost foreign operations to survive. For that, Springtown recently bought a small plant in Honduras. "Our thinking is long term, we wanted to be both domestic and offshore," he said.
 Although it is yet early, the company is off to a good start, Mr. Kemp said. "Business is strong," he said. "We hit it on an upswing. We have a good reputation, and we try to service the business we have well. We've been fortunate. We have people who believe we'll be successful."
 And, he said, the company is depending as well on the strength of its work force. "The folks in all these plants have been very supportive," he said. "They've hung in there. I wouldn't have even considered it without having them. They're really what makes it happen."
 Ms. Barnette finished her whirl through the factory, from sewing room to inspection tables, to bundling and packaging. "All in all, it's not a bad place to work, or I wouldn't have stuck around for 24 years," she said. "If this had closed, it would never have opened again."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: NEW JERSEY SENATOR;
Lautenberg Attacked on Age and Incumbency

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
In his first race for the United States Senate 12 years ago, Frank R. Lautenberg raised the question of whether his 72-year-old opponent, Representative Millicent Fenwick, was past her political prime, questioning her "fitness" and "her ability to do the job."
Six years later, in one of the most acrimonious political campaigns in New Jersey history, he sought to convince voters that his rival, Pete Dawkins, was out of touch. 
 Now, days away from an election to determine whether Mr. Lautenberg will return to Washington for a third term, the same issues are very much a part of this year's Senate race, only they have now been turned against the 70-year-old Democratic incumbent.
Mr. Lautenberg's Republican challenger, Chuck Haytaian, has pounced regularly on the age issue since his first fund-raiser last January.
In the second of their live televised debates on October 25, Mr. Haytaian said, "I think you might be hard of hearing." And after Mr. Lautenberg closed the debate by jumbling his note cards and delivering a stumbling, confusing closing statement, Mr. Haytaian's handlers made pointed off-the-record remarks to reporters about Mr. Lautenberg's fitness.
In 12 years in elected politics, Mr. Lautenberg, who made a business fortune in computers, has always played hard in his campaigns, and this time he is getting it back hard, too. "He calls me names occasionally," Mr. Lautenberg told students at a campaign stop today at Cliffside Park High School. "I trade back. I'm no sissy."
Mr. Lautenberg ignores questions about his age, saying it is not an issue. But his staff points out he works 12- to 14-hour days on the campaign and that he is quite athletic, touting himself as the fastest downhill skier in the Senate.
Mr. Lautenberg, who had been considered by the Republican Party to be one of the nation's most vulnerable incumbents this year, still enjoys a comfortable double-digit lead in the polls over Mr. Haytaian, the Speaker of the State Assembly. And his endorsement today by Ross Perot, the former Presidential candidate who has a strong appeal with Republican voters, is likely to help Mr. Lautenberg.
But the polls still show a large undecided vote, in a state where Christine Todd Whitman last year turned all pollsters on their heads by upsetting the Democratic favorite, Gov. Jim Florio. And neither Mr. Lautenberg's work during 12 years in Congress or a $6 million political war chest for this year's campaign have made him especially well-known among New Jersey residents.
The same polls have also shown that huge blocs of voters either do not know Mr. Lautenberg's name or cannot connect him with any particular piece of legislation or issue.
On the stump, one of Mr. Haytaian's most prevalent attacks is that Mr. Lautenberg has been an ineffective "Silent Senator."
Some of Mr. Lautenberg's recognition problem is because he must share the limelight with Senator Bill Bradley, the former college and professional basketball star who is 19 years younger than Mr. Lautenberg but senior to him in the Senate.
Except for their politics, Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. Haytaian have much in common -- blue-collar hometowns, immigrant parents and an unyielding belief that they were the toughest kids on the block.
Mr. Lautenberg bristles at such comparisons. But friends, family and Mr. Lautenberg himself have said that the tough and scrappy image that he cultivated first as a businessman and much later as a politician was shaped by his upbringing in Paterson and a dozen other working-class communities of northern New Jersey.
"I'm not saying I approve," Mr. Lautenberg said at one point of his 1988 campaign. "I'm saying that a lot of people like their politics the way they like their hockey: rough."
To the dismay of his Democratic colleagues and some supporters, Mr. Lautenberg's grittiness frequently extends to them, too. For example, he angered President Clinton when he withheld his crucial vote in last January's budget battle.
In a dozen years in the Senate, Mr. Lautenberg -- a member of the Appropriations, Budget and Environment committees and chairman of a transportation subcommittee -- has produced several pieces of major legislation, including a law banning ocean dumping of sewage and another banning smoking on domestic airline flights.
When it has suited him politically, Mr. Lautenberg has touted his Congressional seniority, but at other times he has joined the stampede of incumbents who have run away from Washington this year. "My opponent is the incumbent," he often says of Mr. Haytaian, noting that he has spent more than 20 years in politics.
"I came from the bottom of the ladder," Mr. Lautenberg says, beginning a stump-speech refrain that frequently replaces a discussion of his record. "But I am very proud of what I have been able to achieve."
Mr. Lautenberg is the son of Jewish immigrants, a Polish father and a Russian mother. When he was a child, his father, Sam, worked in the silk mills, sold coal, farmed and at one point, ran a tavern with his family living a floor above in a small apartment.
When Mr. Lautenberg was 19, his father died of cancer. To help his mother, Molly, and his sister, Mr. Lautenberg worked nights and weekends until his graduation from Nutley High School.
Mr. Lautenberg enlisted in the Army and served in the Signal Corps in Europe during World War II. After the war, he used the G.I. Bill to attend Columbia University, graduating in 1949 with a degree in economics.
In 1952, he joined two brothers -- Henry and Joseph Taub -- in a small Paterson-based storefront company that provided payroll services to businesses. That company evolved into Automatic Data Processing, one of the largest computing services companies in the world.
It built a fortune for Mr. Lautenberg and hardened an already competitive streak. He has used both assets to fight his way into elected office and since then to hold onto his job.
"Frank's a street fighter, a tough competitor and he likes to win," said Henry Taub, who was a business associate of Mr. Lautenberg's for more than 30 years and now serves as the company's honorary chairman and chairman of the executive committee. "He is a kid that came from the streets of Paterson and knows how to deal with adversity and pushiness."

HEADLINE: Unemployment Is Higher in New York City and State

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
The October unemployment rate darted up in New York City, rose slightly in the state and remained level in New Jersey, according to figures released yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Labor Department.
While the national unemployment rate was dropping to 5.8 percent, from 5.9 in September, the rate in New York City climbed to 8.2 percent, from 7.2. The New York State rate rose to 6.5 percent, from 6.2, and New Jersey's rate hovered at 6.7 percent. 
 Connecticut is not among the 11 states for which the Labor Department provides separate figures when it releases the national jobs data each month.
"The data on the labor market indicate some pause in the recovery that was chugging along earlier this year," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "For the region, it was basically timeout in October, because in both New York and New Jersey the unemployment rate and the number employed basically held steady in October."
He added, "Hopefully, it's a pause that refreshes the up trend."
In the city, the number of people employed rose in October to 3.02 million, compared with 2.95 million in September. In New York State and New Jersey, the employment figures were unchanged from the previous month, remaining at 8.05 million in New York and 3.83 million in New Jersey.
Discussing the gap between the national and regional rates of unemployment, Mr. Ehrenhalt cited two factors. "Demographics aren't pushing economic growth in this region the way they are nationally," he said. "The areas that are expanding rapidly in population are seeing more employment growth because the demographics drive some of the job growth."
The second factor, he said, was the continued revamping of industries in the region. "We are still in the throes of very extensive restructuring in key industries," he said. "They're reassessing their products, their markets, their production processes, their organization structure and their location, for that matter."
And, he added, New York State has historically lagged behind the nation in job recovery during the eight recessions that preceded the most recent. "The gap is wider than average, but it follows a well-established pattern," he said.
Mr. Ehrenhalt attributed the jump in New York City's unemployment rate to job seekers entering the labor market. "A recovery acts as a magnet, pulling people into the labor market," he said. But the number of people looking for work outnumbered the immediate supply of jobs. Nevertheless, he said, the figures showed an increase in the number of people employed in New York City.
And he said that if New York City's unemployment rate was removed from the state's, the state's jobless rate would be lower than the nation's.
Mr. Ehrenhalt said New Jersey's economy, which showed considerable strength earlier in the year, was in a holding pattern in October.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines as the U.S. Refrains From Intervention

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell yesterday, erasing early gains, after the United States Government refrained from buying the currency.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which acts as the United States Treasury's agent in the foreign-exchange market, bought an estimated $2 billion for Japanese yen and German marks on Wednesday and Thursday. The interventions successfully propped up the value of the dollar both days. 
 "Everyone was expecting the Fed to come in," Vicki Schmelzer Alicea, vice president of currency sales at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in New York, said yesterday.
In New York trading yesterday, the dollar started out strong, reaching a three-week high of 1.5266 marks after the Labor Department said the economy added a smaller-than-expected 194,000 jobs in October. The dollar gave up those gains after the United States failed to extend its dollar rescue. The dollar settled at 1.5147 marks, down from 1.5187 marks on Thursday. The dollar slipped to 97.45 yen, from 97.72 yen on Thursday.
Traders expect the dollar will resume its slide unless the Federal Reserve soon raises interest rates by a large enough margin to quell concern about inflation. Accelerating inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds, thus diminishing the demand among foreign investors for American securities and the dollars needed to buy them.
"Dollar purchases by the Fed alone won't turn the tables for the currency," said Mike Faust, international portfolio manager at Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser, a San Mateo, Calif., money manager with $1 billion in assets. "A rate increase is no guarantee that the dollar will strengthen, but it improves the odds."
The dollar failed to rise yesterday after Robert E. Rubin, the chairman of the National Economic Council, said the Clinton Administration wanted a strong dollar. Traders said the Mr. Rubin's statements merely reiterated what Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen had already said.
In other currency trading in New York, the dollar fell to 1.2665 Swiss francs, from 1.2685 francs on Thursday, and to 5.1895 French francs from 5.2028 francs. The Canadian dollar rose to 73.67 United States cents from 73.62 cents. But the British pound slipped to $1.6160 from $1.6165.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Gains Seen for Japanese In Auto Parts Efficiency

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Despite the recession in Japan, auto parts manufacturers there are improving their already superior quality and productivity faster than their competitors in North America, according to a study of 71 component plants in nine countries.
Auto sales are booming in the United States, automatically conferring productivity gains on manufacturers here as they use more of their plant capacity. As a result, the survey's results imply that domestic manufacturers may not be competitive when the market turns down. 
 The components delivered to assembly plants contribute the most to a car's cost -- 75 percent, according to this survey -- which is why auto makers worldwide have been urging their suppliers to become more efficient.
"The data suggest that the gap is widening between the U.S. and Japan and other countries in productivity and quality and that complacency is a real risk for the U.S.," said Carleton F. Kilmer, managing partner for the Worldwide Industrial Products Practice of Andersen Consulting. Andersen conducted the survey, which was released Thursday, with Cambridge University and the Cardiff Business School of the University of Wales.
While the Japanese parts makers surveyed increased their productivity by almost 38 percent from 1992 to 1994, the American companies made gains only in the mid-20's, said Donald P. Wingard, managing partner for Andersen's Americas Automotive Practice. On average, the plants in Japan were 18 percent more productive than ones in the United States, and 35 percent more productive than ones in Europe.
The surveyed plants, which manufactured brakes, seats and exhaust systems, were not identified. All belonged to so-called first-tier suppliers, that is, suppliers that send their parts directly to assembly plants, rather than to other suppliers.
In the survey, the 13 best plants had a 2-to-1 edge over their competitors in productivity and inventory control, and up to a 170-to-1 advantage in quality.
Of these 13 best plants, five were in Japan, three in France and three in the United States, one of which was owned by a Japanese company. Two were in Spain. The other countries surveyed -- Britain, Germany and Italy -- had none.
Japanese-owned plants outside Japan did not generally rate as well in the survey. "The Japanese suppliers did not do as well when they were outside their own corporate culture and span of control," Mr. Wingard said.
Indeed, the survey found that much of the weakness of the parts suppliers in the United States actually lay with their own suppliers, the so-called second tier. Those second-tier suppliers sent defective parts to first-tier plants at almost seven times the rate in Japan.
As a result, the first-tier suppliers must either fix the parts, wasting time, or reject them, wasting material. If each poorly performing plant could reduce the material coming in by 10 percent, it could save more than $5 million, the survey said. The results suggest that in Japan, Japanese auto makers and first-tier suppliers work more closely with the second- and even third-tier suppliers to insure lower costs and higher quality.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Psychological Pitfalls Can Trap the Unwary

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty 

 BODY:
WHERE does Charles Munger, friend and partner of the fabled investor Warren E. Buffett, get his financial insights? From his dog, for one. Mostly friendly, the animal shows a rare ferocity if someone pulls an item from its mouth. This "take-away syndrome" arises in investors, too -- as a costly resistance to selling at a loss, Mr. Munger says.
 Mr. Munger, vice chairman of Mr. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, is a student of such foibles. "The mind has certain standard inanities," he said, and investor patterns prove the point. 
 True, perhaps, but isn't such talk suited to psychiatry, not portfolios? No, say financial experts who gathered recently to discuss the topic at a meeting co-sponsored by the Cambridge, Mass., Center for Behavioral Studies. Know the enemy, they say, and you can outflank it.
 "Closing the barn door after the horse is gone," or taking action too late to matter, is one psychological peril, said Richard Zeckhauser, a Harvard economist in attendance. While many investors sold stocks after the 1987 crash from fear of further losses, others had more emotional reasons -- to pretend to themselves they foresaw the crash, or to remove evidence they did not. Either way, the reflex was costly.
 Investor inaction can be costly, too. Mr. Zeckhauser has studied the tendency to do today exactly what one did yesterday, or the status quo bias, in the T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F. pension fund from 1981 through 1986.
 Under the rules then, fund participants allocated contributions between mostly fixed-income investments (T.I.A.A.) and mostly equity ones (C.R.E.F.). Despite large variations in those investments' returns, however, collective allocations were nearly unaltered during the six years. The portion of investors with 50 percent in T.I.A.A., for instance, held steady at 22 to 24 percent.
 These tendencies, their students say, are solid science, drawn from experts like Ivan Pavlov and B. F. Skinner and backed by hard numbers. Take the "loss aversion" of Mr. Munger's dog. "Experiments prove," Mr. Munger said, "that people hate losing a dollar about twice as much as they like gaining one."
 This dislike, said Drazen Prelec of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is why investors hold losing stocks. Selling a loser, he said, "is like pulling off a Band-Aid." His tip: Fool yourself by pairing a losing sale with a winning one, for a net gain.
 Conversely, people tend to be too flip with profits. "Gamblers often put winnings in a separate pocket and bet them more riskily, even though that makes no sense," said Richard Thaler, a Cornell economist. Similarly, he said, "some pension funds that have made great gains invest more in stocks than do funds without such gains."
 "Mental accounting" is the term for this placement of fungible funds into different ledgers. And it is powerful, Mr. Prelec said. "If you wreck an unpaid-for car, don't you feel worse than if it was paid for? Even though the cost is the same?"
 For Mr. Munger, a very insidious habit is "to get so hooked by an idea that you ignore disconforming evidence." The bullish, for instance, may suppress bearish news.
 For this pitfall, Darwin offers some help. "He forced himself to be objective by looking at conflicting evidence extra hard," Mr. Munger said. "Investors should, too."
 The Darwinian exercise can overcome another problem. Imagine three buckets of water: one cold, one hot and one at room temperature, Mr. Munger said. If a person puts a hand in the cold and hot containers, and then plunges both in the third bucket, the "cold" hand will sense the water to be colder and the "hot" hand will feel it as hotter.
 In the same way, people habitually form frames of reference, which "greatly influence their market perceptions," Mr. Munger said. A standard ploy of real estate brokers is to show a client a few very overpriced houses, and then show the less over-priced places they hope to sell.
 And, he added, investors overreact to quick changes and underreact to slow ones. "A friend told me," he said, "that if you put a frog in hot water he'll jump out immediately, but if you put him in and heat the water gradually, he'll stay until he dies.
 "I have no idea if this is true of frogs. But it's true of people."
 To quiet all these nettlesome reflexes, know where your impressions come from, Mr. Munger advised, and rely only on germane data. Rather than be swayed by the costly houses, the home buyer should get house-sales reports. To avoid the frog's fate, dwell on the long term, not daily ups and downs. "Keep a log of your aims," Mr. Prelec said.
 More broadly, "Investors can train themselves out of these tendencies," Mr. Munger said. As for those who dismiss the subject as too fuzzy, he cites a weighty authority. "As Buffett says, in investing it's not the learning. It's the unlearning."

Wide Impact On the Land Is Seen in Vote On Property

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

 BODY:
In a vote that may influence environmental policy across the country, Arizonans will decide on a ballot proposition on Tuesday that would require the state to consider whether any proposed health, safety or environmental regulation violated a resident's private property rights.
The measure would give every Arizona government agency the authority to prevent state safety or environmental rules from going into effect if officials found that the restrictions would reduce the value of private property or unfairly block the use of it. Federal statutes would not be affected. 
 The initiative, Proposition 300, is based on a legal strategy developed at the University of Chicago in the mid-1980's to head off new environmental regulations by arguing that some violate the Fifth Amendment protection against the taking of private property for public use without compensation.
The "takings" strategy, as it is called, was adopted in an executive order signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1988. It requires Federal agencies to review regulations for their effect on private property. It is also the basis of legislation passed since 1992 in 12 states, including Arizona.
Environmentalists succeeded in preventing the Arizona bill from going into effect pending a public referendum. The vote on Tuesday will be the first ballot test of such legislation in the country. There are no independent polls on the hotly contested issue, so the prospects for passage are uncertain.
"In a very real way, I equate this to the battle at Gettysburg," said Rob Smith, the southwest representative for the Sierra Club, which is leading the fight to defeat the proposal. "No one picked the battlefield, but both sides are looking for this to be the decisive conflict."
The Sierra Club and other environmental groups are spending nearly $200,000 in an effort to convince voters that if the initiative is approved, state agencies will develop a costly bureaucracy to review new regulations for their effect on private property, thus diverting scarce economic resources from protecting health and the environment.
Property rights groups, meanwhile, are spending about $700,000 on their campaign to convince voters that constitutional freedoms have been eroded by a web of health and safety regulations. Proposition 300, they say, would send a message to Federal as well as state lawmakers that curbs are needed on regulations.
Advocates of the measure say it will help protect business. They point to a dispute in Tucson over the cleanup of a diesel fuel spill at an old Trailways bus depot. The owner, arguing that the government-financed cleanup prevents him from using his property, is seeking to block the cleanup or to require the state to pay him as much as $1.8 million to buy the land.
"Government rules are affecting people's lives, and it's not in a way that's helping them," said Linda McLure, campaign director in Phoenix for Arizonans for Private Property Rights, a coalition of farmers, small-business owners, cities, industrial executives and land owners supporting the measure. "It's like a clock ticking, taking away people's rights. We ought to stop this clock sometime."
The national property rights movement has made its presence known in Washington. This year, it was a factor in preventing the strengthening of five major environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act, by attaching amendments requiring reviews of new regulations for their effect on private property. Debate on the amendments resulted in the stalemate.
In September, 33 state attorneys general signed a letter to Congress opposing the "takings amendments," saying they "promote a radical new takings theory that would severely constrain the Government's ability to protect the environment and public health and safety."
As a legal strategy, the takingsapproach has been successful in several cases. In a Michigan case involving an attempt to drill for oil and gas in a protected coastal area, an energy company was awarded a $90 million judgment in 1990. A state court determined that the company had been illegally barred by the state from developing mineral rights that it owned in the protected area. The case is under review by the Michigan Supreme Court.
In Wyoming, a coal company barred by the Federal strip mining law from mining coal near the Tongue River was awarded $60 million by a Federal court in 1989. Last spring, the Court of Federal Claims in Washington held that the company was entitled to compounded interest in he case, and the judgment has grown to $250 million.

Voters Agree They're Tired of Being Taxed, and Congress Gets the Blame

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NORRISTOWN, Pa., Oct. 31

 BODY:
Along the highways of southeastern Pennsylvania, from the multiethnic blue-collar subdivisions of industrial Norristown, Allentown and Bethlehem to the malls and living rooms in the tonier villages of the Lehigh Valley and the Main Line, people who plan to vote in next week's elections are peeved about one issue above all others: taxes.
Property taxes, income taxes, Social Security and Medicare taxes, cigarette and alcohol taxes, trash collection taxes -- all are on the rise, the result of budgetary strains from City Hall to the White House. So ubiquitous are tax increases that the issue has emerged as the common, largely nonpartisan denominator of voter discontent and the root of the anti-incumbent fervor evident in many polls. 
 "Taxes, they take so much out," said Michelle Olsovsky, 21 years old and a Democrat. Ms. Olsovsky was taking a cigarette break outside the dress shop in Allentown where she is assistant manager. She earns $1,200 a month, not enough to let her leave her parents' home in Whitehall, an Allentown suburb. "I work overtime every week," she said. "The more you work, the more they take, take, take."
Typically in a strong economy, voters have looked kindly upon incumbents as wages and job opportunities have grown. But this time around, voters see the gross domestic product heading one way and their own domestic finances heading another.
Yes, they acknowledge, more people across the country are finding jobs, and new businesses are thriving. Yet in most cases, people say, their own wages have been flat or falling as they move into the low-wage, benefit-bereft service and retail jobs that have replaced the stable, high-wage industrial jobs of old.
For example, even as the nation's economy blooms, the Olsovsky family's fortunes are about to sink. The Bethlehem Steel Corporation is phasing down production; after 22 years with the company, Leonard Olsovsky, Ms. Olsovsky's 42-year-old father, expects to be let go next year. And still his taxes rise.
If voters have little to cheer about in their own economic conditions, other issues, like crime, education and health care, also loom large among their personal and political concerns.
"People are dissatisfied with their presumed future condition," like their ability to put children through college and support themselves through retirement, said John C. Smith, 48, of Norristown, a Republican who is unemployed after a career of lifting steel in a truck factory left him disabled. "They are looking around for someone to blame it on."
Many are blaming Congress. The 13th Congressional District encompasses most of Montgomery County, north of Philadelphia. It usually votes Republican by 2-to-1, but two years ago, it elected its first Democrat in 76 years and first woman ever, Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky.
After promising to hold the line on taxes, Ms. Margolies-Mezvinsky cast the deciding vote for President Clinton's deficit-cutting budget last year. That brought increases in income taxes for many wealthy Main Line residents and in gasoline taxes and taxes on Social Security benefits for many retirees in poorer towns.
Her vote has now become the defining issue in her race with Jon D. Fox, a prominent local Republican legislator whom she defeated by only 1,373 votes of 257,510 cast in the last election. "She's just a turncoat," said Vincent Drago, 64, a retired restaurant owner in Norristown who supported Ms. Margolies-Mezvinsky in 1992.
West of Norristown, in the middle-class town of Abington, a 62-year-old widow, who declined to give her name, said she barely got by on Social Security and income from stocks and bonds. "Clinton said only certain people would get hit with this tax increase," she said as she shopped for Halloween candy at Woolworth's. "I got hit, and I don't count as one who should."
In the elections, she said, "it's gotten to be, 'Just throw everybody out.' " She intends to help throw out Ms. Margolies-Mezvinsky, she said.
In a two-story brick house in an Abington subdivision, Laurie Scott, 32, who teaches aerobics part time, and her husband, Scott Smith, 39, who owns and drives an interstate truck, played with their daughters, ages 5, 4 and 5 months. The parents, who said they usually vote Republican, earn about $50,000 a year.
Mr. Smith said he voted for Ms. Margolies-Mezvinsky. But the Federal budget's 4.3-cent-a-gallon increase in the tax on fuel for his truck has dented his income. He will vote for Mr. Fox, he said, even though he doesn't trust him either. "Is there anybody running right now that I admire?" he said. 'No."
Cynicism seems entrenched in the 13th Congressional District. Rose Neri, 49, entering a supermarket in Willow Grove, said that while her taxes kept rising, her family was weathering the salary cut that her husband, a consulting engineer, accepted to keep his firm afloat. She voted for Ms. Margolies-Mezvinsky in 1992, she said, but next week she will vote for Mr. Fox. "And when the next election comes around, I'm going to vote him out."
Democrats are strong in the 15th Congressional District around Allentown, where Bethlehem Steel and Mack Trucks have eliminated tens of thousands of jobs. Polls give the incumbent Democrat, Paul McHale, an edge over his Republican challenger, James Yaeger, a prominent fuel oil dealer.
But Mr. Yaeger has been gaining support among people who worry about taxes. Carol and Joe Fryer, for example, are trying to sell their little 1,200-square-foot house in an Allentown subdivision so that they can move to an area where taxes are lower. When the Fryers, both 47, bought the house nine years ago, their property tax was $397; this year, Mrs. Fryer said, it is $2,500.
Both their wages -- hers as a personal care aide at a nursing home, his as a copying machine serviceman -- have been frozen. Their 21-year-old daughter and her toddler son live with them. With an annual income of about $45,000 a year, Mrs. Fryer said, "We've gone as high as we can go."
She usually votes for Democrats, she said, but this time she is wavering. "Democrats say they're going to take something from the rich," she said. "But they never seem to be able to do that. The middle class is always paying more."
The people here who have lost the most are those the big factories have shed. Larry Schollenberger, 47, earns about the same $450 a week today as a pest exterminator that he earned at Bethlehem Steel eight years ago. But inflation has taken a toll, and he works longer hours.
Mr. Schollenberger's home is a wooden duplex in a blue-collar subdivision on the fringe of town. The house needs work. He gets around on a 23-year-old motorcycle. "I live from paycheck to paycheck," he said. "I just can't get ahead. The cost of living goes up faster than my salary goes up."
Politicians, he complained, take too much of his pay in taxes and dispatch too much to people on welfare. Some welfare recipients need it, he said, "but you could let a lot of them clean up the streets and fix the highways. The Government has forgotten us. They're supposed to work for us. They make these outrageous salaries. For what?"

HEADLINE: Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, Leading Economist, Dies at 88

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a grand old man of economics who fled to the United States after Communists came to power in Romania, died on Sunday at the Vanderbilt University hospital in Nashville. He was 88.
Professor Georgescu-Roegen suffered complications of diabetes and had been ill for some time, said Anthony Tang, a member of the Vanderbilt economics faculty and a close friend of his family. Professor Georgescu-Roegen was on the economics faculty of Vanderbilt for more than 25 years, until he retired in 1976. 
 Fiery, strong willed and bristling with conviction, Professor Georgescu-Roegen was one of the top mathematical economists of his generation, but his interests included pure theory, economic history, biology and physics. His mathematical papers on consumer behavior, written in the 1930's, became instant classics. Forty years later, he was one of the first economists to reason rigorously about the interplay of economic growth and the environment, an achievement that made him a perennial candidate for a Nobel prize, although he never won one.
Always interested in the big picture, Professor Georgescu-Roegen solved problems that would scarcely have engaged more conventional economists.
One example, recalled Professor Paul Samuelson, a Nobel laureate, was an ingenious (and correct) explanation for why the ratio of baby boys to baby girls did not rise sharply in the wake of World War II, as it had during World War I. His argument involved the technology of war, the pattern of military leaves and the timing of conception. "That's not the kind of things Schumpeter would have figured out," said Professor Samuelson, referring to Joseph A. Schumpeter, the legendary growth economist at Harvard.
Professor Georgescu-Roegen was born of Greek descent in Constanta, Romania, on Feb. 4, 1906, the son of a Romanian army officer. A bright youngster, he received an education in mathematics and statistics from some of the leading European scholars of the day. Professor Georgescu-Roegen earned the equivalent of a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Bucharest in 1926 and a doctorate in mathematical statistics from the Sorbonne in 1930, when he was 24.
He continued his postgraduate studies in London, under the statistician Karl Pearson, before accepting a teaching post at the University of Bucharest in 1932, when he married a fellow mathematician, Otilia. The two were known among economists as an exceptionally close couple with similar interests in mathematics, politics and music. She survives him.
Against the backdrop of depression and rising fascism in Europe, Professor Georgescu-Roegen spent two idyllic and highly productive years at Harvard as a Rockefeller fellow in the mid-1930's. There he worked closely with Professor Schumpeter. During that "apprenticeship" in economics, as he called it, Professor Georgescu-Roegen published three theoretical papers that immediately established his reputation. Professor Schumpeter urged him to stay in the United States, but, an ardent patriot, he insisted that his native land needed him more than Harvard did.
In Bucharest, Professor Georgescu-Roegen became more and more involved in Romania's monarchist Government, holding various advisory and administrative posts and serving for a time as a delegate to the League of Nations. After World War II, he helped negotiate the peace with the Soviets on behalf of the Government.
As the Communists consolidated their power, Professor Georgescu-Roegen and his wife fled Romania in 1948 by stowing away aboard a freighter bound for Istanbul, hiding in barrels. The couple first went to Harvard, but within a year Professor Georgescu-Roegen was offered a permanent post at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. There, he dominated the economics department for more than 25 years.
During the 1970's, Professor Georgescu-Roegen's fame spread when he developed a critique of standard economic theory and published "The Entropy Law and the Economic Process" (Harvard University Press, 1971), which appealed to the growing environmental movement. He invoked the second law of thermodynamics -- useful energy gets dissipated -- to argue that the economy faced limits to growth. The trouble with the economics of John Maynard Keynes and Professor Samuelson, he argued, was that they envisioned the world's economy as a pendulum. The better metaphor, he said, was an hourglass.

HEADLINE: JOBLESS RATE FELL AGAIN IN OCTOBER TO A 4-YEAR LOW

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4

 BODY:
The job market improved in October as the unemployment rate eased to 5.8 percent, another four-year low, and hourly wages rose by the largest amount in more than a decade, the Labor Department reported today.
Payroll gains were relatively modest, though, with the economy adding 194,000 jobs last month, well below the quarter of a million jobs added during a typical month this year. California, which has lagged far behind the rest of the country, was particularly impressive, with unemployment dropping to 7.7 percent from 8.3 percent. Employment in New York and New Jersey was virtually flat. 
 Some economists detected worrisome signs of inflation in the figures, the last important economic indicators reported before Election Day. Bond prices fell sharply as investors seemed convinced that the Federal Reserve was now even more likely to increase interest rates to quell rising prices. [Page 41.]
Stocks dropped, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 38.36 points. [Page 42.]
Still, the news again inspired boasts by the Clinton Administration and other Democrats hoping to contain off-year election losses on Tuesday by convincing dubious voters that the economy is better than they thought.
President Clinton, traveling the country this week campaigning for Democratic Congressional and gubernatorial candidates, took credit for the five million jobs that have been added since he took office in January 1993. "We have delivered what the American people have long wanted," Mr. Clinton said.
Former President George Bush disputed that assertion. Stumping for Republicans in Nebraska, he argued that the Democrats did not deserve credit because "we handed the new Administration an economy that grew."
As politicians jockeyed for advantage, some economists expressed misgivings about certain elements of today's report.
The rise in earnings of seven-tenths of a percent, while satisfying to workers who have not shared in the recent prosperity, raised fears that labor costs might be about to ratchet up. Other analysts suggested that the jump might be only a one-month statistical fluke. A second straight surge of this magnitude would be highly worrisome to those who fear that inflation is rising.
Separately, an index designed by a research arm of Columbia University to predict inflation rose smartly again last month, reflecting in part a further rise in the proportion of the population with jobs. The share of eligible people at work reached the highest level since 1990.
Speculation intensified that the Federal Reserve would move to raise short-term interest rates by more than half a point at its Nov. 15 policy meeting. The price of fixed-income securities retreated, pushing the yield of the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction, up to 8.15 percent.
Some analysts argued that the Fed had been too slow in acting to rein in the economy's growth, which they contend is fueling inflation.
"The Federal Reserve has shifted gradually from a pre-emptive strategy to contain inflation to a more reactive strategy that merely monitors inflation," said John H. Makin, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
But whether or not the Fed has slipped "behind the curve," today's figures seemed to increase the pressure for strong action, especially in light of recent weakness in the international value of the dollar.
Economists noted that not only did hourly and weekly earnings leap, but the length of the factory workweek also continued to hover at levels not seen since World War II. In October, the workweek rose by 6 minutes, to 42.1 hours.
For the entire private sector, the workweek expanded 18 minutes to drive the index of aggregate weekly hours up 1 percent.
The increase in payroll jobs last month was 194,000, somewhat less than expected and the smallest gain since January. But analysts noted that this was on top of an upward revision for September and a large upward revision for August. In addition, the Labor Department disclosed that its annual match-up of survey results with records kept by each state indicated the existence of 760,000 more jobs in March than had been previously thought.
More than a quarter of the revision in the benchmark calculations -- an exceptionally large seven-tenths of 1 percent -- involved California, officials said.
Payroll gains in October covered a wide front, with factories adding 40,000 jobs, retailing 51,000, business services 32,000 and health services 27,000, the report also showed.
Among the highlights of the Labor Department's survey of households, from which the unemployment rate is calculated, were a 290,000 drop in the ranks of the newly jobless (less than five weeks) and an increase of 185,000 in those idle 15 weeks or more.
This lifted the average duration of jobless spells to 19.6 weeks, from 19.2 weeks in September. When asked about such a situation at a mature stage of the business cycle, Robert B. Reich, the Labor Secretary, said, "We're still seeing the effects of corporate restructuring combined with very rapid technological changes and international trade."
The national rate of 5.8 percent compared with 5.9 percent in September. The jobless rate in the West fell to 6.7 percent from 7 percent while it remained unchanged in the Northeast at 6.2 percent. The jobless rate in the South also remained level at 5.7 percent and the Midwest held steady at 5 percent.
California by itself added 239,000 jobs, enabling its unemployment rate to drop six-tenths of a point for a second straight month, to 7.7 percent. A department official said military contractors, which are big employers in the state, had stopped hemorrhaging jobs for the first time since major cutbacks began.
Among demographic groups, the report showed the jobless rate for adult women was down three-tenths of a point, to 5 percent.

HEADLINE: ARMS TRAFFICKING TO BOSNIA GOES ON DESPITE EMBARGO

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Nov. 4

 BODY:
Even as the United Nations discusses lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina, the embargo appears to have become largely a fiction, openly flouted.
Helped by the ready availability of arms and military components in the former Soviet bloc countries and by an apparent American readiness to turn a blind eye, Croatia is now building or assembling everything from battle tanks to MIG-21 fighter aircraft and acting as the main conduit for the flood of weapons reaching Bosnia. 
 "What I need, I get," the Croatian Defense Minister, Gojko Susak, said in an interview. "The arms market is saturated, so saturated you would pay three times the price if you got things legally."
Mr. Susak described buying arms in countries including Poland, Bulgaria and Russia as "an open market" and said Croatia was now providing the army of the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government with antitank weapons and ammunition for mortars, cannons and machine guns.
The effect of this increase in the arms available to the Bosnian Muslim and allied Bosnian Croat forces has been evident in the last week in two successful offensives against the long-dominant Bosnian Serbs. The first offensive burst through Serbian lines east of Bihac in the northwest; the second resulted in the capture of the town of Kupres in the west central part of the country.
An arms embargo imposed on the former Yugoslavia in 1991 froze the Bosnian Serbs' weapons superiority in place because Serbs controlled the Yugoslav Army and dipped into its arsenal to supply the Bosnian Serbs.
The Serbs used this advantage to take 70 percent of Bosnian territory, routing the nascent Bosnian Army and terrorizing Muslim civilians.
Their superiority in artillery and tanks remains but now appears to have been offset by the success of the Bosnian Government in providing basic weapons to a large army operating in a mountainous terrain where mobility can outweigh armor.
"The Bosnian Army has doubled in size over the past year to about 164,000 men, all in uniform and equipped, against about 102,000 Serbs," said Paul Beaver, a military analyst at Jane's Defense Weekly in London. "They have obtained Russian-made rocket-propelled grenades from the former East Germany, Chinese antitank weapons from Pakistan and ammunition from Iran."
Since the American-brokered Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia was formed in March, most of the weapons reaching Bosnia have come through Croatia, a country with more than 1,000 islands, several remote airstrips and a number of land routes into Bosnia.
The United States appears to have pursued a policy of turning a blind eye to this arms trade, which has had the effect of advancing one element of American strategy in the Balkans: achieving a balance of power in Bosnia to create conditions favorable to a peace settlement.
For example, Mr. Susak said the American military attache at the embassy in Zagreb, Col. Richard Herrick, had attended a recent demonstration of Croatian air power. Among the aircraft on show were 12 MIG fighter planes -- Croatia had no more than four when the embargo was imposed -- and several MI-24 armored assault helicopters that fired guided antitank missiles. Croatia had none of these helicopters or missiles when the embargo took effect in 1991.
Colonel Herrick declined comment. An official at the American Embassy in Zagreb, who confirmed Colonel Herrick's presence at the military exercise, said, "Yes, of course we're aware of circumvention of the embargo." She then corrected herself, saying the State Department had no verified reports of violations. Asked if the United States had done anything about possible violations, she declined comment.
Mr. Beaver of Jane's Defense Weekly described the American approach to Croatian arms imports as "not quite connivance, but almost."
Mr. Susak said Croatia was now assembling MIGs at a factory just outside Zagreb and already had about 20 aircraft. He added that tanks were being manufactured in Slavonski Brod, and mortars and rocket launchers at plants in other towns.
At the Duro Dakovic factory in Slavonski Brod, the success of Croatia in getting what it needs for its weapons industry is evident. The gleaming green hulls of five M-84 battle tanks stood recently, waiting for turrets and 125-millimeter cannons to be installed.
When Yugoslavia broke up in 1991, the tank plant was paralyzed because more than 70 percent of the components assembled there came from republics other than Croatia, the plant's managing director, Antun Milovic, said.
But by diversifying its own industry, and by buying essential military components in the former Soviet bloc, Croatia has now returned the tank plant to operation, and Duro Davkovic executives said prewar production levels of 100 to 150 tanks a year could soon be met.
Mr. Susak and Mr. Milovic said Croatia aimed to export tanks to Kuwait next year under a contract that had been interrupted when Yugoslavia collapsed.
Apart from East Europe, the other major source of arms in trafficking valued at about $500 million in the last two years appears to have been Muslim countries. Mr. Beaver and other analysts estimated that Iran alone had provided at least 1,500 tons of ammunition that reached Bosnia through Croatia.
Last week, Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic of Bosnia and Prime Minister Nikica Valentic of Croatia were in Teheran, where they agreed to set up a commission that would meet twice a year to strengthen economic and political ties among Iran, Croatia and Bosnia.
Although Croatia and Bosnia are clearly cooperating -- in the import of arms and on the ground in the capture of Kupres -- there are limits to their partnership. Mr. Susak said Croatia was not providing tanks or artillery to Bosnia, a decision that is perhaps not surprising, since Bosnian Muslims and Croats were at war with each other last year.
Thus a lifting of the arms embargo remains important to the Bosnian Government, because it would mean emancipation from dependence on Croatia and because it would provide access to the tanks and artillery the Bosnian Army still needs.
On Thursday the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for a lifting of the embargo on Bosnia. Though the General Assembly has no enforcement power, the United States has drafted a resolution for the United Nations Security Council calling for an automatic lifting of the arms ban on Bosnia in six months.
The Bosnian Serbs still have an estimated 600 pieces of heavy artillery against about 100 for the Muslims, and a marked superiority in tanks. A counterattack against recent Bosnian gains is possible.
"We cannot accept the status quo," Mr. Silajdzic said in a recent interview. "That is why we want the lifting of the embargo: to gain strength and negotiate from a balance of power."

HEADLINE: Pope Visits Sicily Amid Alarm Over the Mafia

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CATANIA, Sicily, Nov. 4

 BODY:
On his first trip since poor health forced him to cancel a journey to the United States, Pope John Paul II tonight began a weekend visit to Sicily, where alarm is growing over threats to priests from the Mafia.
The 74-year-old Pope, who broke a thigh bone in a bathroom fall in April, emerged unaided from his plane here, without the cane he has often used since his fall. But he seemed uncertain of his footing as he descended the few steps to the tarmac. As is usually the case on papal trips inside Italy, he did not kneel to kiss the ground. 
 The visit here, initially scheduled for last April but postponed because of his fall, was shadowed from the start by the tense yet sometimes ambiguous relationship between the Roman Catholic Church and the Mafia, which the Pope has often condemned.
Only a day before John Paul arrived in Sicily, a Catholic priest in Palermo, the Rev. Mario Scifo, went into hiding because of threats against his life. Father Scifo had given an anti-Mafia sermon that led many in his congregation to leave the church in fear of mob reprisals.
The priest told reporters he had received an anonymous telephone call after the sermon saying, "Sooner or later, someone will put a bomb in your church."
In an open letter to the Pope marking his visit, the Archbishop of Catania, Luigi Bommarito, said today: "The open, painful and bloody plague of the Mafia remains in our social fabric and in our flesh, returning like a bitter blow with its arrogance, its tentacles and its recurrent works of death."
When the Pope addressed thousands of Sicilians gathered in Catania's cathedral square tonight, he responded with what seemed an appeal to fight back against the mob's influence.
Most Sicilians "wish to leave behind them the corruption exercised by the few to the detriment of the many," he said. "There is no time or room for sitting silently by or fearful mediocrity. At the present historic moment, there can be no room for fearfulness or inertia.
"Too many times, the people of Catania have suffered the humiliation of being seen as residents of a degraded and violent city, dominated by crime. "Catania, rise up again in light and justice!"
The Pope is to spend two full days in Sicily at Catania and Siracusa before returning to Rome on Sunday.
Catania is one of Sicily's main ports and, like other cities on the island, is dominated by organized crime. Anti-Mafia campaigners here are hoping the Pope's visit will galvanize people anew to combat the mob.
"The Pope is coming to Catania and Siracusa and finds two cities preyed upon by fear, annihilated by endemic evils -- Mafia violence, unemployment, usury -- and by a 'culture of emptiness' that has stripped many people of the will to fight," wrote Giuseppe di Fazio, a commentator for the local newspaper, La Sicilia.
"His message, 'Do not fear,' is a challenge to all of us," he said.
While the Pope has inveighed in the past against organized crime, his appeals have seemed only to irritate the mob: last year several churches in Rome were bombed and investigators blamed organized crime.
There is close interest here, too, in the Pope's health.
While his address to people in Catania tonight seemed written for a passionate delivery, the Pope's voice seemed tired.
John Paul had been scheduled to visit the United States last month but canceled the trip on the ground that his recovery from a hip operation last spring was slower than he had expected.

HEADLINE: A Safer Russian Army

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has made remarkable headway in its efforts to help Russia dismantle its nuclear forces. Washington's engagement in this enterprise has reached levels that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. The U.S. has built housing for former Soviet missile controllers; Pentagon officials now give virtually the same briefing on U.S. nuclear policy to Russia's Parliament as they give to Congress.
Unfortunately, Washington has not yet given equal attention to the need to downsize Moscow's non-nuclear forces. U.S. cooperation is essential to reduce Russia's army to a level that Russia and its neighbors can live with. 
 Russia currently has 1.1 million people under arms. It cannot afford to maintain a force that size. Draft-dodging has reached epidemic proportions as recruits recognize that the army cannot provide them three square meals a day, never mind a timely paycheck. Yet even with its defense spending in free fall and arms procurements near a standstill, Moscow's defense bill still drives up its budget deficit, and threatens new inflationary pressures.
To generations that grew up fearing the Soviet threat, that may sound like good news. Yet while the armed forces must shrink, letting them collapse uncontrollably is risky. A collapse would put thousands of troops on the street, freeing them to engage in mischief in newly independent republics. It would also embitter career officers and help fuel a nationalist resurgence. The obvious course is for Russia to reduce its armed forces in an orderly way. But even that will meet strong political resistance unless the U.S. takes concrete steps to reassure Russia about its security.
Russia's vaunted air defenses, for example, have sprung leaks. The Defense Ministry may thus be tempted to keep more fighter planes than it can afford. The U.S. could ease Russian fears by offering to integrate Moscow into the Western air traffic control network. It could also invest in housing and job training for officers mustered out of the armed forces -- much as it has invested in those who manned Russia's nuclear arsenal. That would help minimize the prospect of a nation full of unemployed and potentially unruly soldiers.
Above all, the West should resist any immediate temptation to include Poland and the rest of Eastern Europe in an expanded NATO. Russian military planners are certain to view any such expansion as a serious regional threat and will be even less inclined to shrink their forces.
No U.S. official is better positioned to encourage a broadened dialogue on Russia's conventional forces than the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili. In the aftermath of Vietnam, when morale in America's armed forces hit bottom, he tasted the bitterness the Russian army is now experiencing. General Shalikashvili further understands the risks of an expanded NATO -- a move that would commit his troops to the defense of Eastern Europe but inspire a recidivist backlash in Russia. He should take the lead in discussing a Russian military build-down.

HEADLINE: Observer;
O Rare Newt Gingrich

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
Republicans last ran both houses of Congress during the two-year term 1953-55. Before that they had one other two-year term: 1947-49. Before that? You'd have to search back in the Bronze Age when most Americans knew who Herbert Hoover and Al Smith were.
Sixty years of losing tends to lower politicians' hopes. This is why there is real excitement about the Republicans' chances of winning both Senate and House next Tuesday. 
 A whole Congress under Republican control is one of those rarities like a full solar eclipse. It makes people feel special to see one in their own lifetime.
Even Democrats probably won't be too devastated if Republicans produce this spectacular trick. A Republican Congress would break the monotony, and -- Democrats might as well face it -- eternal Democratic control has produced a monotony that's starting to push their party into utter pointlessness.
Even the Democratic Senate leader, George Mitchell, who was probably a cinch for re-election, couldn't bear to face another six years, so quit. It's said he will even accept a job as water bearer for the bumbling tycoons who own major league baseball if that's what it takes to put the Senate behind him.
Democrats may also take perverse cheer in a Republican win. The two modern occasions when Republicans did control Congress turned out happily for Democrats. The first resulted from the off-year elections of 1946, which produced what was called "the meat Congress."
In 1946, like 1994, the country was in an unusually peevish mood because, for one thing, of soaring meat prices. At the grocery beef was over $1 a pound, an astonishing price in an age when the dollar was still real money. The end of wartime wage and price controls had produced price inflation while wages lagged, and Americans voted their spleen.
What they produced was the most conservative Congress since the 1920's. Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy came to Washington. Republicans immediately proposed to cut taxes, slash spending, end business and labor regulation and repeal such New Deal measures as Social Security and the labor law.
Such was the Republican Congress which Harry Truman immortalized in his 1948 campaign as "that good-for-nothing, do-nothing 80th Congress." Truman's campaign returned him to the White House and Democratic control to the Capitol.
Actually the Republican 80th was far from Truman's "good-for-nothing" Congress. In a remarkable act of two-party harmony, it laid the foundations of the foreign policy that carried the country successfully through 40 years of cold war.
Republican obstruction of Truman's domestic program also laid the foundation, however, for Republican defeat in 1948. This will be much noted and long written about by all wizards of political journalism if Republicans win next Tuesday.
The parallels between the widely disliked Truman of 1946 and the widely disliked Clinton of 1994 are so obvious that all masters of the political pronunciamento will be powerless to resist dilating ponderously upon them.
The next Republican Congress was a byproduct of General Eisenhower's big Presidential victory in 1952. Its immediate political result was to thrust the Communist-hunter Joseph McCarthy front and center in the national spotlight.
The bureaucracy in which he prowled in search of Reds was now a Republican responsibility. His forays inevitably brought him into conflict with his own White House. Congressional Republicans began to choose up sides, and Eisenhower fumed while McCarthy, overestimating the power headlines could give him, recklessly courted a fight with the White House.
It came, and it destroyed him, and it titillated the entire country. It also set Republican against Republican. By the end of Eisenhower's first two years the Republicans in Congress looked more like an opposition than a governing party.
Eisenhower had needed the help of politically shrewd Democrats to get bills passed while Republicans, thanks largely to McCarthy, had often looked like Eisenhower's enemy. Opposition seemed to have become their unshakable habit.
By 1955 Eisenhower may even have been pleased to see the Congress turned back to the Democrats and the Texans Sam Rayburn and Lyndon Johnson. Eisenhower was born in Texas. He and Texans understood each other.

HEADLINE: A Cashless Economy Would Make Larger Tax Cuts Possible

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In elections throughout the country, and particularly in New York, the most contested issue is which candidate can propose the most generous and feasible tax cuts. 
 One way to make tax cuts feasible is to make inroads into the extensive "underground economy." Unreported cash transactions have been estimated at more than $1 billion a year in the New York metropolitan area alone. The sales and income tax losses are undoubtedly substantial.
Debit cards could greatly reduce the amount of currency in circulation and could make a real impact on the underground economy. The cards, which deduct money from a prepaid account, are already available for telephone charges, vending machines and subway fares.
With the enhancement of security by use of a personal identification number, the debit cards would have several beneficial effects. They would reduce street crime, since stealing a debit card without the PIN would be worthless; they would reduce the incentive for robbery or employee theft, since less cash would be available from a store or other vendor, and they would provide easier tracking of revenue for tax purposes.
As the public increased its use of debit cards, more businesses would accept them. The extensive acceptance of credit cards proves that most businesses will adapt if the public demands it. With people carrying less cash, if any, the underground economy will shrink and tax revenues will rise without rate increases.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Coffee Bars;
Landlords Savor the Smell of Coffee Bars

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
THERE'S a building on Madison Avenue in the 40's whose owners tell a decidedly non-90's tale. A few months ago they put a 2,100-square-foot space on the market for an annual rent of $60 a foot, figuring that this would be a starting point for negotiations.
That it was. A couple of bids trickled in at $60. Then a coffee house, fearing that other tenants might grab the space, offered $65. A rival coffee house promptly offered $70. The rival will get the space -- provided a third coffee house does not bid even more. 
 "They just keep jacking up the rent," said the building's bemused leasing agent. "The space will be rented for a lot more than the landlord ever thought to want."
That scenario is being repeated all across Manhattan, as a tsunami of coffee houses, coffee bars and espresso bars (the terms are used interchangeably in the industry) sweeps through the borough, leaving inflated rents in its wake.
There's a coffee house in the West 30's that's paying an annual rent of $95 a square foot for a space that, the building's owner concedes, would command no more than $75 for any other use. Another coffee house in the East 50's is forking over a hefty $230 a foot on a block where comparable spaces are going for $175 to $200. On Third Avenue, a coffee house is paying $140 for a mid-block space that brokers say would normally rent for about $110.
"I haven't seen anything like this since Benetton came into town in the late 70's," said Benjamin Fox, a partner in the New Spectrum real estate brokerage. "In the last 18 months, the coffee houses have almost single-handedly hiked up New York rents."
Richard Seligman, a senior managing director at Edward S. Gordon Company, the brokerage concern, reports the same phenomenon. "They're consistently paying 10 to 15 percent more than the market would normally demand," he said.
It doesn't take Juan Valdez to discern the reason: The inexorable law of supply and demand is bearing down. No new space has been built in New York for several years. But in the last year coffee behemoths like Starbucks, based in Seattle; Brothers Gourmet Coffee, based in Boca Raton, Fla., and Timothy's, based in Toronto, have all opened numerous outlets in Manhattan. New entrepreneurial firms like Coopers Coffee and New World Coffee are going head to head with them. Even bookstores and department stores are doing double duty as coffee houses; Barnes & Noble has cafes run by Starbucks in several of its superstores, and New World Coffee just signed an agreement with Saks Fifth Avenue to run cafes at several of its suburban stores.
Phillips/Norwalk, a real estate consulting firm in Westport, Conn., counted only 55 coffee houses in New York last spring. Its president, Lee Phillips, guesses that the number has more than doubled since -- and he still thinks the city is nowhere near saturation.
"Manhattan, with its heavy pedestrian traffic, is particularly conducive to coffee bars, yet it still has the lowest ratio of coffee bars to office workers of any city," he said.
Indeed, New York is one of the last cities to embrace the coffee bar trend. Coffee bars have been social staples in Europe and the Middle East for centuries. In the United States, the trend started in Portland, Ore., and Seattle, then moved east through Chicago before landing here a year or so ago. Last year the Long Beach, Calif.-based Specialty Coffee Association released a study saying there were about 5,000 coffee houses in the country, up from just 200 in 1989. It forecast that by 1999 there would be 10,000.
"Already I believe that was too conservative," said Ted R. Lingle, the association's executive director.
So why so late to hit Manhattan? "I think coffee operators felt they couldn't afford Manhattan rents, and Manhattan landlords didn't want tenants who are riding a fad," Mr. Lingle said. "Now everyone realizes it's not a fad, which will end. It is a trend, which may wax and wane, but won't disappear."
WHAT New York coffee houses have lacked in timeliness, they have made up for in speed of market penetration. Dennis L. Boyer, the head of Brothers Gourmet Coffee, remembers the reaction he got when he took his company public last year.
"People on Wall Street kept asking, 'What is this business about coffee bars?' " he said. "Now they're already asking, 'Is the market saturated?' "
Apparently Mr. Boyer doesn't think so: He just opened a coffee bar at 147 West 40th Street and has already leased several more sites in New York.
Ramin Kamfar, co-owner of Manhattan-based New World Coffee, tells a similar tale.
"My partner was talking about opening coffee bars three years ago and everyone said, 'Nah, no New Yorker will stand in line to pay $3 for a cup of coffee they can get for 70 cents at the deli,' " he said. "Then we looked at Chicago, where even secretaries were lining up to buy cappuccinos, and decided everyone was wrong."
In February 1993, New World opened a tiny coffee bar just south ofthe upscale Jefferson Market on Avenue of Americas, near 10th Street, a store that is still among its most profitable. It has since leased 13 other sites.
The new breed of coffee house is not to be confused with coffee shops, which offer full meals and table service. Those are mundane places where coffee is simply an after-meal beverage that comes in two varieties, regular and decaf.
The new coffee houses are expensively appointed, rich with ambiance. And while many do serve pastries and sandwiches, their emphasis is on specialty coffees in dozens of flavors and strengths and degrees of foamy milk. They are not after the lunching crowd, although they certainly welcome them. Instead, they are after people looking for an alternative to mediocre deli coffee for a quick refresher and to alcohol-service bars for meetings and hangouts.
Anyone who thinks the difference is specious should talk to Marvin Haas, chairman of Chock Full o' Nuts. For decades Chock was the quintessential coffee shop, a chain whose U-shaped counters were filled with people looking for a cheap but high-quality sandwich and an excellent cup of coffee. The once thriving chain closed its restaurants in 1983.
"We could serve 100 people at lunchtime, while a fast-food chain could serve 600," Mr. Haas said. "The economics just weren't right anymore." Now, after a decade of relying on revenues from institutional food-service clients and sales of coffee beans and spices, Chock is jumping back into the restaurant fray with -- surprise! -- new-style coffee houses.
It has a spacious one on Madison Avenue near 49th Street, in a location that the company has leased since 1958. Last month it opened a smaller store on Second Avenue near 66th Street, and last week it opened two stores in the West 40's. Within the next 12 months Mr. Haas expects to open 15 more.
All are high-tech-looking places that rely on self-service and provide many types of coffee and food. There is still at least one reminder of the past -- the cream cheese on datenut bread that was the old Chock Full o' Nuts's signature sandwich.
Chock's flagship Madison Avenue store is right next door to an Au Bon Pain, another coffee-and-light-food operation that, the uninitiated would assume, would provide formidable competition. But coffee houses seem singularly unafraid of one another. In fact, they've been known to open new branches not only across from competitors, but across from themselves. Chock just opened a 2,500-square-foot cafe on the 43d Street side of 1114 Avenue of the Americas, the W. R. Grace building, and a 300-square-foot take-out space on the 42d Street side of the same building.
And when Starbucks, the industry's biggest player, opened a store on DuPont Circle in Washington, it was so successful that it opened another a couple of blocks away.
Weren't they afraid of cannibalizing their own sales?
"Are you kidding?" asked Laura Moix, a Starbucks spokeswoman. "We have two stores across the street from each other in Vancouver, and they're both doing well."
ONE reason for the willingness to crowd together is that, unlike, say, record stores or apparel shops, which can draw traffic from many blocks away, coffee houses rely primarily on walk-by trade. They are the ultimate impulse buys.
"It is the visibility and the traffic counts that are the most important things to a coffee house, not how close the next one is," said Faith H. Consolo, a vice president with the Garrick-Aug Associates brokerage firm.
Of course, there is a bit of a Catch-22 in this, in that high-traffic, high-visibility locations are attractive to retailers other than coffee bars. And some landlords still prefer to go with more tried and true types of tenants -- say, apparel stores.
Coffee bars, they say, are "wet" operations, which generate smells -- albeit smells that most people find appealing. Because the trend is so new to New York, they are often run by relatively unproven operators, making them high-risk tenants. And, if they are not run properly, they can attract a somewhat seedy customer who does not enhance a building's image.
"IN a location where you already have a lot of foot traffic, you can usually get a better type of tenant," said Anthony E. Malkin, president of W&M Properties, one of the few building-management companies not pursuing coffee house tenants.
Most prefer to cash in on the coffee-house bonanza, and look for ways to minimize the downside. Some will only rent to known players like Starbucks. Others will insist on letters of credit or other guarantees. Still others will rent to newcomers only if it seems they have done their homework.
"A lot of these new people do spend six months in Seattle and really research this industry," said Bruce A. Spiegel, senior vice president of Rose Associates, which owns many Manhattan buildings. "They seem like good risks."
At least one landlord is leaving nothing to chance: The Durst Organization is building its own coffee bars in 1133 and 1155 Avenue of the Americas, two buildings it owns on 44th Street. Both will be managed by Cafe Un Deux Trois, a nearby restaurant, and will serve food that is cooked at the restaurant. But the Dursts will own the bars.
"We see this as providing a service to the tenants, and the only way we can be sure they will get good service is if we retain control of the space," said Douglas Durst, a vice president of the organization.
Mr. Durst is onto something that has helped coffee bars persuade risk-averse landlords to overcome their fears. They provide a nice amenity for tenants in office buildings. And they are wonderful generators of traffic -- read customers -- for nearby stores.
In fact, it is that last attribute that has made landlords, if not the shops themselves, worry about concentrating too many coffee houses together.
Rockefeller Center Management just rented 690 square feet of streetfront space on the 49th Street side of 30 Rockefeller Plaza to Cafe Duomo, an Italian-style coffee bar that will serve and sell only products from Italy. Rockefeller Center agreed to rent the space only on the proviso that Cafe Duomo offer no take-out service.
"Our concourse-level coffe bars are generating traffic for the other stores down there," said Alan L. Stein, a senior vice president of Rockefeller Center Management. "You don't want someone intercepting those customers upstairs."
You also don't want someone keeping away a larger tenant in the future, added Kate D. Coburn, the center's vice president for retail. She has a 3,000-square-foot space in 30 Rockefeller Plaza that she is hoping to rent to a full-service coffee shop; she would not have rented to Cafe Duomo if it had served enough food to siphon off customers from that prospective tenant.
"It was important that Cafe Duomo be aimed at tourists and passers-by who want a quick stop, not at office tenants who want takeout coffee or lunch," she said.
For their part, coffee bars seem to good-naturedly accept landlords' restrictions, or desires to shoehorn them into small or out-of-the-way places. They are far more flexible than most retailers: A coffee bar can squeeze into 350 square feet, confining itself to specialty coffees, a few biscotti and a couple of bar stools. Or it can expand to 2,500 feet, providing tables and sandwiches.
Indeed, since most coffee house operators own more than one store, they can create their own synergies. For example, many of the stores that Chock Full o' Nuts expects to open will be too small to handle a lot of on-site baking and food preparation. But the new 43d Street store has room to bake enough for several.
"We'll use it as a commissary for our smaller locations," Mr. Haas said.
And coffee houses often thrive in spaces that other retailers shun.
The two coffee houses that Mr. Stein wants to protect are operating in parts of the concourse below Rockefeller Center that had been low-traffic areas before. Both are doing lines-out-the-door business, primarily from Rockefeller Center tenants, and both are taking more space.
A Pasqua coffee house just rented a problematic space at 450 Lexington Avenue, Sterling Properties' elegant landmarked building on 45th Street.
"SURE we would have preferred a designer leather-goods store," said Amy Strong, Sterling's director of retail leasing. "But the store doesn't have great windows, and a lot of upscale retailers do not like the mixed high traffic near Grand Central Station. We wouldn't have put in a deli, we'd have left the space empty first, but this coffee house looks like a piece of art."
But coffee houses are not milksop tenants. Most are seeking niches and have ground rules for where they will or will not go. Some -- Coffee Station is an example -- like being inside office buildings, preferring the captive and weather-impervious audience of a large tenant population. Others -- Coopers Coffee fits in here -- concentrate on residential areas, preferring the seven-day and evening traffic those provide.
Some -- Chock Full o' Nuts is one -- insist on serving a lot of food. Others -- Cafe Duomo is typical -- feel coffee and maybe some biscotti is enough. Yet others -- like New World -- are pushing the sale of coffee beans as much as the sale of $3 cups of latte.
Operators like Starbucks and Brothers, which are bean wholesalers, are also looking at their coffee hosues as vehicles for expanding their wholesale trade.
Scarcely two months after opening his first New York coffee bar, Mr. Boyer of Brothers already is talking about doing cross-promotions for coffee-by-the-cup and coffee-by-the-pound, and of economies to be derived from getting double duty out of distribution centers and other facilities.
"We feel the synergy will let us establish ourselves as New York's premier coffee brand," he said.
Unfortunately for Mr. Boyer, others in the ever-growing host of players in the coffee game are chasing that title, too. For them, it means a fierce competitive battle. But for landlords it continues to mean but one thing -- a rich, hearty cash windfall.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Once-Sliding Agriculture Is Making a Comeback

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
FOR hundreds of years, Connecticut, like much of America, was farm country -- until the 50's, when city folk began pouring into its villages, wealthy suburbs and developing subdivisions, and hundreds of office buildings created an urbanized state.
Only about 400,000 of Connecticut's 3.2 million acres is farmland today. But 1.7 million acres of forest and 50,000 acres of shellfish grounds bring the total amount of agricultural land to more than 2.1 million acres. 
 By the 70's the state was faced with a seriously eroding agricultural base, fueled by the rapid spread of residential and commercial development. An aggressive agricultural preservation program was begun that has come into maturity in the 90's, bringing agriculture back into the economic mainstream.
Connecticut has emerged as the leading agricultural state in New England, producing revenues of nearly $800 million in 1993, and exporting over $70 million in agricultural products to 30 countries.
"Connecticut Grown -- by the State That Thinks Like a Business" is the slogan of the State Department of Agriculture. Last spring a task force was formed to develop more effective market strategies and technological improvements for the industry in partnership with the academic and private resources within its borders, among them Yale, the University of Connecticut, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers, and DeKalb Genetics.
A major step was an acquisition program begun in 1978 under which the state has since bought, for about $70 million, the development rights to more than 154 farms totaling almost 24,000 acres. The program is voluntary, giving the farmer an alternative to selling out to developers and insuring his continued ownership of the land but restricting it permanently to agricultural use.
A modification of the program last year permits outright purchase of farms by the state, aimed at buying farms in foreclosure that can be resold to one or more farmers. "We bought the first one last year for $2.2 million," Mr. Filchak said. "It was appraised at $4 million."
The state also sponsors farmers' markets. Three opened in 1986; now there are 155 in 38 of the 169 municipalities, providing profitable outlets for the farmers and economical fresh produce for consumers.
"We have changed from dairy-based farms to greenhouses, nurseries, shellfish, wineries, mushrooms, Christmas trees and hydroponically grown produce," said John J. Filchack 3d, Deputy Commissioner of Agriculture. "Small vegetable growers with up to 25 acres are pooling their resources with larger growers to market their products. We are one of three top oyster producers in the country. Most of our egg production goes to mainland China and our breeder chickens are sent all over the world."
The decline in dairy farming was caused in part by federally fixed milk prices and the sale of hundreds of acres of pasture to real estate developers during the 80's. Today, new opportunities in an increasing variety of agricultural disciplines and the movement of local farming into the electronic age are attracting college students.
"Enrollment since 1992 increased from 550 to 850," said Dr. Kirklyn Kerr, dean of the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources of the University of Connecticut, a $2 billion state system of 10 campuses based at Storrs. "About 20 percent come from farm backgrounds, 80 percent have limited exposure to farming or an interest in fields related to farming -- animal science, nutrition, biotechnology, aquaculture."
ONE of the state's newest projects is the intensification of the relationship between the university, its Cooperative Extension Service and farmers. Plans are under way for an 11,000-square-foot building for the extension service on the university's Torrington campus.
"Litchfield County in particular is heavily involved in agriculture," said Bruce Wilbur, administrative service officer for the Cooperative Extension Service and its eight offices around the state. "Our mission as the outreach arm of the university is to take research information and make it available on a practical level to the farmer and the general public. We are involved in food handling and food safety, nutrition, conservation, environmental issues, land-use planning and zoning, as well as farming."
Ralph Gold, a 60's graduate of the university's College of Agriculture, has a 400-acre dairy farm in Cornwall that has been in the family since 1723. Mr. Gold is a a member of the planning committee for the new building and is a founding member of the Litchfield Agricultural Center.
"Zoning is a real dilemma," he said. "In 30 years time Litchfield will be like Fairfield. People move here for the picture-quality life close to New York, but they are intolerant of the noise and odor that takes place for a few hours, a day, even a week, that gives them the quality of life for the rest of the year. Connecticut has right-to-farm laws, but the reality is that if the farmer is severely harassed he gives up."
Mr. Wilbur, the extension officer, said, "Towns often don't have the resources or expertise to know what their options are in land use. We get involved in zoning issues and try to moderate problems."
"BEING on the Torrington campus," he said, "will give us access to the university's telecommunications system, connecting us via satellite throughout the country and the world. We will be able to transmit information rapidly to more than 300 extension agents and faculty members in offices and campuses around the state, carry on discussions by electronic mail and develop means for farmers to tap into the system directly, using an easily understandable menu."
The current office in a turn-of-the century building on West Street in Litchfield, about seven miles southwest of Torrington, was acquired in the 50's by a group of county farmers who felt the need for a one-stop location where a variety of agricultural services were available. Outgrown and outmoded, the building was sold in September for $350,000 to the Greater Litchfield Preservation Trust, which will make improvements and offer it for rent. Proceeds from the sale will go toward the cost of the new building in Torrington.
Dr. Adriane R. Lyon, director of the Torrington campus, looks forward to a new partnership. "We see this as enabling on both sides," she said. "They will have access to our library and other amenities, we will have access to their sophisticated communications equipment during their off-hours."
About 450 day and evening students attend academic classes in the single building on the 190-acre campus. Many are past traditional college age and an influx of another few hundred students over the next five years is expected.
"We have not yet chosen a site on campus, nor a building style," said Fritz Farquhar, a planning consultant. An architect will be hired later to design the building, for which unofficial estimates range from $750,000 to $1 million.
"We recognize that the College of Agriculture and Natural Resources must focus on helping agriculture as it relates to an urban state," Dr. Kerr said, "through the environment, waste management, water quality, open space -- things that benefit the producer, the consumer and Connecticut's quality of life."

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Sizing Up Airline Seating

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE 

 BODY:
IF you were crammed into economy-class seats all summer with the rest of us, you discovered airlines are no more generous with their leg room than with their peanuts. There may be an inch of hope on the horizon in the new twin-jet Boeing 777, but don't hold your breath: The 777 will not make a commercial debut until next summer, and it is a protean plane, one with an interior that can be rearranged quickly, so what you see on the charts may not be what you get.
Seating in the main cabins of major United States airlines continues to get tighter as competition intensifies. As John McDonald, a spokesman for Trans World Airlines said, schedule and price are the bottom line for air travelers, and extra space will attract new customers only when bottom lines are equal. "The market won't support it," Mr. McDonald said. "Comfort is one thing everyone talks about, but you still see 300 people crowded aboard a charter 727 to San Juan." This would be more than twice the capacity on a scheduled flight. 
 The major United States airlines say the standard coach-class seat pitch, or measurement from one spot on a seat to the same spot in the next row, is now 30, 31 or 32 inches. The airlines do not agree when this small space became standard; most estimate four to five years ago. Ed Perkins, editor of the Consumer Reports Travel Newsletter, which has been surveying seat pitch every two years since the late 70's, said that the standard was 34 to 36 inches when he began. The crowding began in earnest in the 90's, he concurred. Two airlines said that a safety rule that went into effect in the fall of 1992, requiring more space around the overwing exits, caused most airlines to compensate by pushing the rest of the seats tighter together. My measurements in the last two years indicate it's a rare occasion when you get 32 inches of space.
 
Reasons for Crowding
The course followed by T.W.A. illustrates how the economic squeeze mashes your knees.
In January 1993, T.W.A., then still in Chapter 11 reorganization, began to offer economy-class seating with more space, which it called Comfort Class. The space was created by removal of 3 to 40 seats, depending on the plane. On T.W.A.'s trans-Atlantic 747's, the pitch, which had been between 31 to 34 inches, went to a maximum of 36 inches, a minimum of 34 inches. On the 767's, where the old pitch was 31 or 32 inches, it went to 33 or 34 inches.
A year ago, J. D. Power and Associates of Agoura Hills, Calif., which annually rates business travelers' views, gave T.W.A. top place for customer satisfaction among airlines used for flights of more than 500 miles. Power said the survey was based on more than 23,000 travelers. Seating comfort accounted for 14 percent of overall satisfaction, the same level as scheduling, flight accommodations and aircraft interior, exceeded by on-time performance, which contributed 16 percent. (November was also the month that T.W.A. emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization, although its financial troubles continue.)
But after 16 months of Comfort Class, T.W.A. began to pull back. In April, ads announcing six extra flights between New York and Los Angeles and New York and San Francisco showed asterisks for two of its flights. The note said: "Extra legroom in Comfort Class not available on these flights." Although the line continues to use the title Comfort Class, the 36-inch pitch is disappearing. It was gone from all 10 747's serving Europe before the summer season, where the pitch shrank to 33 or 34 inches.
According to Mr. McDonald, the airline is reconfiguring all of its planes into two-class service, eliminating its Ambassador business-class seats by mid-1995 and absorbing most of this space into the main cabin. By that time, Comfort Class will be a matter of two or three inches' extra space, not five, and the asterisks will be gone.
 
Two Airlines That Tried
Innovation in the area of seating may not pay. Last summer, six-year-old Carnival Air Lines saw a way to make money by selling a little more space. It created Coach Plus, a plan to sell a seat with an empty seat next to it at a price above coach but below first class. The price for the test case was $159 for a ticket between Westchester Airport and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The week after Carnival announced its idea, according to Gabriel Gabor, the company spokesman, Continental came out with a fare of $79 on its New York-south Florida routes. "We figured no one would be interested in our plan," Mr. Gabor said. "Coach Plus never got off the ground."
Last fall, Ultrair began flying between New York and four Florida cities, offering 34-inch seat pitch on 727's. This line took a heavier blow: It folded in July, citing heavy competition in the New York-Florida corridor. (Atlanta-based Valujet, which started a year ago, offers 31-inch seat pitch and is still flying.)
 
The Roomier Boeing 777
The Boeing 777, now undergoing test flights, offers extra cabin width, compared with the planes it is designed to compete with. The two first lines scheduled to fly it say they will not stuff an extra seat in each row, which may be a help.
The 777 will be flown commercially first by United, which plans to put its initial three planes on a route to Europe -- United will not say which one -- on June 7. British Airways will be the second with passenger use, in September, also on a trans-Atlantic route.
The 777 cabin is 19 feet 3 inches wide, 10 inches narrower than the 747 but 5 inches wider than what Boeing calls the "trijets" it is intended to replace, meaning the McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 and MD-11 and Lockheed's L-1011, as well as the Airbus A-340 and A-330, all wide bodies that accommodate two aisles in economy class. The extra five inches on the 777 can be used to squeeze in 10-abreast seating, or if seating is kept 9 abreast, as in the competing widebodies, the space can be added to seat or aisle widths.
According to Donna J. Mikov, a spokeswoman for Boeing, airlines will be able to rearrange the interior of the 777 in 72 hours to switch from three to two classes or adjust the seat pitch. Ms. Mikov said the airlines might add extra space for long hauls, or subtract it for short trips.
For space-hungry consumers, all this means that the 777, even with nine-abreast economy-class seating, will not automatically offer more space. Passengers would be well advised to ask how many seats there are on the plane. Boeing says the upper limits are 328 seats in three classes; 400 in two classes and 440 in an all-economy arrangement.
According to Joseph P. Hopkins, a United spokesman, the airline will put in 303 passenger seats. In economy class, 235 seats will be arranged 2-5-2; the seat cushions will be 18 1/2 inches wide, and the pitch will be "31 or 32 inches."
British Airways, according to John W. Lampl, its spokesman, would put 281 seats in. In the main cabin, the 193 seats will be arranged 3-3-3 with a pitch of 32 inches and a cushion width of 18 inches. In both cases, the seat width, which Boeing says will be the widest in any economy-class cabin, will be what provides any added comfort; the seat pitches are the same old thing.

HEADLINE: Q and A

BYLINE: By Terence Neilan

 BODY:

San Blas Islands
Q. We will be cruising the southern Caribbean in December and will be going to the San Blas Islands. Information about them seems hard to come by. Can you help? -- Marcy Johnson, Fresno, Calif. 
 A. The archipelago, which extends in a narrow strip off northern Panama, is made up of what the guidebooks say are 365 islands. The Kuna Indians, to whom the islands are home, put the number at 378.
The islands range in size from relative specks with a couple of coconut palms to those with hundreds of Kuna, who exercise internal autonomy over the archipelago. They have their own economic system, language, customs and culture, with distinctive brightly colored dress, music and dance. If you are tempted to take photographs of them be aware that it is customary to pay about 25 cents for each picture.
One of the most sought after Indian artifacts is the multi-layered applique mola, the most famous of Panamanian traditional handicrafts, which is worn by women and often sewn onto the front and back of a colorful short-sleeved blouse. A high-quality mola can cost anywhere from $50 to several hundred dollars.
Some of the islands are uninhabited. The capital is El Porvenir, where the airport is situated. From there boats go out to the other islands, many of which offer good fishing, swimming and snorkeling.
There are only a handful of hotels and restaurants on the islands, with two of the most popular places the 14-room Hotel Anai, (507) 39-3025, on nearby Wichub-Wala island, ($55 a person for three meals and a guided boat tour of the islands) and the 21-room Hotel San Blas, (507) 62-5410, five minutes away by boat on Nalunega ($37.50).
Several airlines operate 10-seater planes between Panama City and Porvenir, including Ansa (507) 26-7891 and Aerotaxi (507) 64-8644. All flights leave Panama at 6 A.M., arriving at 6:30 A.M. Return flights leave the next morning at 7 A.M., although day trips can be arranged on Sunday through a hotel or with one of the many travel agencies in Panama City. Round-trip fares are $50.
Chadwick Travel Service, Post Office Box J, Balboa, Panama, (507) 52-2741, fax (507) 28-1409, offers round-trip fare to Porvenir, accommodation at the Anai, meals and a tour of the island for $110 a person. For two nights at the Iskardup Ecoresort the price is $266 a person based on a minimum of six passengers. The tour runs to Dec. 15.
Other agents include Jungle Adventure, Post Office Box 871254, Zona 7, Panama, (507) 69-6017, fax (507) 69-1604, and Eco-Tours de Panama, Post Office Box 465, Panama 9A, Panama, (507) 63-3076, fax (507) 63-3089.
 
Seeing Asia from Hong Kong
Q. We will be visiting Hong Kong each April for the next five years to stay with friends. We would like to see other parts of Asia, even Australia, while we are there and wonder if we should book our trips from New York or wait till we get to Hong Kong. -- Frank Carucci, New York, N.Y.
A. The decision rests with so many variable factors, from where precisely you want to go and at what time, to the type of accommodations you are looking for, that the best course is probably to contact tour operators here and there and make a choice.
The following agents should be able to help:
Pacific Bestours, 228 Rivervale Road, Rivervale, N.J. 07675; telephone (201) 664-8770, fax (201) 664-1497.
Orient Flexi-Pax, 630 Third Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 692-9550, fax (212) 370-1477.
Pacific Delight Tours, 132 Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10016; (212) 532-3406; (212) 684-7707, fax (212) 532-3406.
Jecking Tours and Travel, Seventh Floor, China Insurance Building, 48 Cameron Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong; (852) 739-1188, fax (852) 721-2748.
PC Tours and Travel, 506 Energy Plaza, 92 Granville Road, Tsim Sha Tsui East, Kowloon, Hong Kong; (852) 369-9052, fax (852) 723-9044.
Swire Travel, 18th Floor, Devon House, Taikoo Place, 979 King's Road, Quarry Bay, Hong Kong; (852) 579-6699, fax (852) 590-0099.
For general information on Hong Kong contact the Hong Kong Tourist Association, Fifth Floor, 590 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10036-4706; (212) 869-5008.
 
 A Swiss Christmas
Q. My husband, 8-year-old son and I will be spending the last two weeks of the year in Zurich but would like to spend a few days at Christmas in Zermatt, ideally at a hotel with a special dinner and other activities. Can you suggest somewhere? -- C. B., Atlanta
A. According to the Swiss National Tourist Office most hotels require a minimum two-week stay at Christmas, and in general it is very hard in winter, Switzerland's peak season, to find a hotel that will accept guests for under a week.
In case of a last-minute cancellation, however, and particularly if you are prepared to travel to Zermatt for Christmas dinner and then go back to Zurich the same night, it is worth contacting one of the following. The address for all the hotels is simply Zermatt, 3920 Switzerland. The dialing code for Switzerland is 41 and the code for Zermatt is 28.
Mont Cervin, 66 11 22, fax 67 28 78.
Zermatterhof, 66 11 00, fax 67 48 42.
Monte Rosa, 66 11 33, fax 67 11 60.
Alex Schlossshotel Tenne, 67 18 01, fax 67 18 03.
Julen, 67 24 81, fax 67 14 81.
Prices for two with breakfast and dinner at Christmas run from $238 to $541 a night, calculated at 1.2 Swiss francs to the dollar.
 
Sapporo Snow Festival
Q. I have wanted to attend the famous Sapporo Snow Festival in Japan for many years. Can you tell me the date of next year's event and if there are connecting flights to Sapporo from Tokyo? -- M. Coughlin, Los Altos, Calif.
A. The Sapporo festival, which will take place next year from Feb. 6 to 12, has grown to be the biggest and most famous of its kind in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, although it is only one of many winter festivals held there at that time of year.
Teams of snow sculptors from around the world compete to produce the most fantastic snow and ice creations at four festival sites: Odori Park, Makomanai, Nakajima Park and Susukino. At night the parks glow with thousands of white lights. The White House, the Statue of Liberty and the Paris Opera House have been among snow carvers' subjects. The event attracts about two million visitors, according to Japanese tourism officials.
From Tokyo there are about 30 flights a day to Sapporo on Japan Air Lines and Japan Air System. The flight takes about 90 minutes.

 BODY:
Charles Murray says that what he is peddling is social science porn ("Daring Research or 'Social Science Pornography' "? by Jason DeParle, Oct. 9). I pray that it will not turn into sociological poison. The moral conclusions do not follow from his data. People who have lower I.Q.'s deserve more of our help, not less.
His data are clearly in error; the American economy has grown in years that our collective I.Q. is said to have declined, while the economies of white-only societies have collapsed (Eastern Europe) or are lagging. Rapid-growth economies are largely nonwhite. 
 Murray is positioned as the courageous champion of an unpopular truth. I fear that these kinds of arguments will turn out to be all too popular falsehoods.

Lots More Drag Queens

 BODY:
As tobacco queens fade from sight, drag queens are becoming increasingly evident. Whether these trends are connected is a subject for sophisticated social science.
In the simpler realm of economics Alex Heimberg, a.k.a. Miss Understood, has started a business in Manhattan called Screaming Queens. He provides drag queens for parties. Their role is to amuse and entertain, like adults-only clowns. The cost runs from $125 on up, and some clients are as straight as Rush Limbaugh. "A women in New Jersey had us come to a party at a country club for her husband's 40th birthday," says Heimberg. "We put a wig on him and sang 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.' They're going to be talking about us for years." 
 Among Heimberg's freelance crew are Dolores ("Carmen Miranda goes to 14th Street"), Varla Merman ("the illegitimate daughter of Ethel Merman and Ernest Borgnine") and himself ("an outer space goddess.") They do smoking and nonsmoking events.

The Bloopie Awards!

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
TIME ONCE AGAIN for the coveted Bloopie Awards, recognition of Madison Avenue solecisms that sends thrills of Schadenfreude through the ranks of advertising copywriters.
Because the top of this column gets the lowest rating (the audience increases as we approach Prime Space), we begin with the least important award, "For the most egregious abuse of the comma." Push the envelope, please: 
 We have a five-way tie, or quintuple dead heat, as racing fans say. CBS erred in a spot for the mini-series "Scarlett." (That's the sequel to "Gone With the Wind," but CBS says Ted Turner's outfit, which owns that film, won't let CBS use the title in its ads; this column, however, is keenly aware of its First Amendment rights.) The network printed on screen: "Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn" as a voice-over intoned, "It was the most controversial statement of its time."
Let us set aside the affected pronunciation of controversial as con-tro-VER-see-ul -- the preferred form is con-tro-VERSH-ul -- and zero in on the statement that first used the word damn in movies. The Hays Office would never have permitted it, Will Hays once told me, had not Clark Gable, playing Rhett Butler, de-emphasized the profanity, delivering the line as "don't GIVE a damn."
The CBS line has no comma after the sentence adverb frankly, although the "Gone With the Wind" screenplay has it with the comma, and an exclamation mark to boot: "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn!" (In Margaret Mitchell's novel, she never used the frankly: "He drew a short breath and said lightly but softly: 'My dear, I don't give a damn.' ") In direct address, the name or its substitute (as in my dear or my fine feathered friend) must be set off by commas.
The comma is also needed in Sherlock Holmes's famous line "Elementary, my dear Watson." Holmes, however, never spoke that line, at least not in Arthur Conan Doyle's stories. (Basil Rathbone did use the phrase when he played Sherlock Holmes in movies.) With the comma for direct address, the familiar saying would also answer the question "What school did you go to, darling?" Without that comma, dear reader, the copywriter has made a mistake.
As has Toyota in this line: "To us, a successful business shouldn't just try to make a profit, it should try to make a difference as well." That's a comma splice: two complete sentences incorrectly joined by a comma. Toyota could have used a semicolon after "profit," or put a period after that word and started a new sentence, or added a conjunction: "profit, but it should try. . . ."
Catching Toyota on the test-track turn is Mercedes-Benz, with its "Technologically speaking it had no rivals. . . . Even standing still the S 320 easily leaves other cars behind." Both Technologically speaking and Even standing still are used as introductory participial phrases that cry out for punctuation to separate them from their sentences' main thoughts. Also, nothing in the first sentence has to do with speaking, and the result is a dangling modifier; it should read "Technologically, it had no rivals," or "Technologically speaking, we are sure it had no rivals" (though Toyota can rival it on comma splicing any day).
Not to be outdone by foreign rivals, the Ford Citibank credit card, in conjunction with Hertz and Texaco, offers an ungrammatical rebate: "To apply see your Ford or Lincoln-Mercury dealer." An introductory infinitive phrase, like To apply or To run up a whopping bill, calls for a comma to separate it from the main clause, especially when misreading is possible. The comma should be left out only if the infinitive phrase is the subject of the main clause, as in "To apply is to get rejected."
Fifth entry is "The Coca-Cola Company in collaboration with Franklin Heirloom Dolls, authorizes their first-ever heirloom collector doll." The comma after "Dolls" requires a balancing comma after "Company"; you could get away with no commas at all, but if you're going to start down the comma road in this instance, you need both.
In the non-comma bloopie group, the winner is Attends, the incontinence product: "Attends' patented Perma-Dry fibers pull in wetness faster than other leading retail brands to help protect you." This is a misplaced modifier; for clarity, it should read "To help protect you, Attends'. . . ." Also, I'd put another s after that apostrophe, though some authorities disagree; the possessive should sound like Attends-ziz.
In the field of word choice, an ad writer for the realty division of The New York Times Magazine wins the coveted bloopie: "Whether it's a city tower . . . manor house . . . or seaside cove, it's here for you to dream on. And one day (soon, perhaps) to act on." The writer was reaching for a parallelism -- dream on and act on -- but dream on is a different idiom, something you tell a copywriter when he tells you he thinks he will one day be a poet. We dream about and dream of; nobody ever dreamed on Jeanie with the light brown hair.
And now -- in Prime Space, with readers breathless with suspense -- we come to the Most Horrendous Solecism of 1994, submitted by Thomas Luskin of Bayside, Queens. By virtue of the prestige of the sponsors, it is the Super Bloopie.
It goes to 87 Nobel laureates -- in chemistry, economics, literature, medicine, physics and peace -- who signed an ad titled "A Call to Reason" in support of measures to control population growth.
"The survival of mankind, and of the earth which sustains all of us, are in serious jeopardy," it begins, and is proudly signed by wreathed worthies from Christian Anfinsen to Geoffrey Wilkinson. Linus Pauling signed it, too, though he is dead.
Let us not nitpick about mankind, a word embracing male and female that is being replaced by humankind. And there are those who will let the Nobel laureates get away with the which when that is better to introduce a dependent clause not set off by commas. No; the inescapable root problem here is subject-verb disagreement.
The simple subject is survival. That takes the singular verb is. Everything between the word survival and the verb is falls in the domain of prepositional phrases, not part of the subject of the sentence. Only if the subject had been repeated -- "The survival of mankind and the survival of the earth" -- could you correctly use the plural are.
The Nobel laureates, or their petition copywriter, would do well to study the similarly constructed statement posted at the entrance to Busch Gardens amusement park in Virginia: "Clothing with suggestive or explicit language or insulting statements is not allowed." Although explicit is a foolish euphemism for "obscene," the sentence's simple subject -- clothing -- leaps over the intervening phrases to agree with the singular verb is. You can learn plenty at amusement parks.
One thing about the language dodge: a cat can look at a king.

A NATION OF SALESMEN
The Tyranny of the Market
and the Subversion of Culture.
By Earl Shorris.
352 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $23. 
FROM the selling of diaper service to your parents to the selling of a funeral service to your survivors, your life, particularly if it is an American life, literally begins and ends with sales.
Indeed, the writer Earl Shorris, a former advertising executive who helped the Ayer agency sell automobiles for General Motors and long-distance calling for AT&T, asserts that "selling has become the determinant activity in the United States." The sale -- "the wedding of information and desire" -- has become so intrinsic to the character and culture of the nation, he contends in this thoughtfully argued book, that a new man, Homo vendens, has evolved, reflective of America's condition as an "oversold" society.
The breadth of Mr. Shorris's occasionally lyrical, always unconventional survey of salesmanship is impressive, starting at the start, as it were, with the snake in the Garden of Eden, which sells Eve on biting into the apple as assiduously as any Fuller Brush man or Avon lady would sell a whisk or a lipstick centuries later. It continues through the years until it arrives at Michael Milken plying his trade on Wall Street.
"A Nation of Salesmen" details the abrupt shifts in attitudes about selling in America's history, from the days when a nascent political democracy seemingly required economic democracy, in the form of consumerism, to assure its manifest destiny. Decades later it was the salesman's booster mentality that put the roar into the Roaring Twenties, followed by the bitterness of "a generation bankrupted by salesmen," which put the depress into the Depression. The postwar world was transformed first by television -- "as if a salesman had been placed between Americans and life" -- and then by human salesmen like Lee Iacocca, Donald Trump and Mr. Milken, all of whom Mr. Shorris deftly skewers.
Politicians -- who sell by making policies conform to voters' desires rather than by making products conform to consumers' desires -- do not escape his barbs: if voters found one aspect of Bill Clinton "most unpalatable, it was the suspicion that the Democratic candidate was a salesman, 'Slick Willie.' Apparently, they could live with the rest of his foibles."
And many of Mr. Shorris's former colleagues on Madison Avenue will squirm as they read his opinions of what he once did for a living. Advertising "is not immoral, except as waste is immoral," goes a typical passage. "It is closer to bad art than to good business."
The book is thankfully free of cant and stereotype about selling, particularly the belief that all who sell are by nature guilty and all to whom they sell by nature innocent. To answer those who maintain that salesmen manipulate their customers by creating desire, he outlines how selling can only exploit desires that already exist -- contradicting his former employer, Ayer, which after a series of reversals that left it "too desperate for subtlety" posted a sign in its main reception area reading: "We create your wants. We create your desires."
One aspect of "A Nation of Salesmen" that might disconcert readers is that each chapter begins with a fictional depiction of a salesman plying his trade. While some of these musings are effective, they more properly might have appeared in another kind of book. Another distraction comes in spotting a mistake like referring to Robert Bork as David.
But those are minor reservations about an important work.
So, are you sold yet?

THE UNITED NATIONS, IRAN, AND IRAQ
How Peacemaking Changed.
By Cameron R. Hume.
269 pp. Bloomington:
Indiana University Press. $29.95. 
LIKE a similar but more famous event in Boston over 200 years before, the tea party Javier Perez de Cuellar gave on Jan. 16, 1987, proved a harbinger of dramatic political change in the world. In his 38th-floor United Nations office overlooking Turtle Bay, the Secretary General used the occasion to plead with the United Nations representatives of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China, the five members who had permanent Security Council seats and a veto on decisions, to sink their differences and take decisive action to end the murderous war between Iraq and Iran, then entering its seventh year.
His carefully timed appeal fell on fertile ground. In Moscow Mikhail S. Gorbachev had just come to power, easing cold war tensions. Meanwhile, after cynically ignoring the war while selling arms to both sides -- during the conflict's first five years, Iraq and Iran together accounted for 78 percent of China's arms exports, 68 percent of France's, 51 percent of Britain's, 33 percent of the Soviet Union's and 31 percent of America's -- the five big powers were now worried that the struggle might spark a wider Middle East conflagration.
Sir John Thompson, Britain's man at the United Nations, responded to the Secretary General's appeal by promptly inviting his colleagues from the United States, France, China and the Soviet Union to a series of secret meetings held in the drawing room of his Beekman Place residence.
Over the next few months the P-5, as the permanent members are informally known, drafted a resolution that in ensuing years was to serve as a model for United Nations action aimed at dampening conflicts around the world. Adopted by the Security Council in July, Resolution 598 demanded an immediate cease-fire between Iraq and Iran, the withdrawal of both sides' forces from occupied territory, the insertion of peacekeepers between them and a negotiated settlement to their quarrel.
It is the thesis of "The United Nations, Iran, and Iraq," a ground-breaking book written by a rising star of the American diplomatic service who was himself intimately involved in the Beekman Place negotiations, that these meetings marked the beginning of the present renaissance in the United Nations' fortunes.
Resolution 598 did not, in fact, bring a quick end to the Iraq-Iran war, which dragged on for another year. But its important truth, Cameron R. Hume argues, was what it showed the P-5 -- that after 42 years of cold war paralysis they were capable of exercising their common responsibility under the United Nations Charter for curbing wars and other threats to peace around the globe.
That discovery, he says, enabled them to bring Namibia to independence; resolve longstanding civil wars in Central America and Cambodia; impose punishing trade embargoes on errant nations like Iraq, Yugoslavia, Haiti and Libya; and most spectacularly of all, launch the 1991 gulf war that drove Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. Ironically, Iraq's decision to invade Iran in 1980 became the catalyst for its defeat in 1991.
SUCH achievements led to an explosion in United Nations peacekeeping, so that today the United Nations has 70,000 blue helmets serving in 18 different operations at an annual cost of over $3 billion.
As Mr. Hume writes: "Soon after the council first met in 1945, it became a place for divisive public arguments rather than for solving conflicts through collective action. Then, starting in 1985, changed Soviet policies and improved superpower relations made cooperation within the council possible. In 1987 the council's permanent members cooperated to seek an end to the Iran-Iraq war. By 1990 such cooperation was an established practice, making possible for the first time the use of the U.N. Charter's progression of steps for collective security."
Mr. Hume, who is now back at the United Nations as a top political adviser to Madeleine K. Albright, the United States' chief delegate, guides the reader through the complex diplomacy that surrounded the Iraq-Iran war, showing how the great powers came to recognize that ending the conflict was in their interests. He then carries the story forward, relating how the P-5 expanded their cooperation into other areas, creating in theprocess a powerful new institution that meets almost daily at United Nations headquarters in New York and serves as the Security Council's driving motor. And he provides a detailed concluding account of the negotiations that lead to the authorization of Operation Desert Storm by the Security Council.
The Security Council has no difficulty authorizing classical peacekeeping operations where blue helmets monitor a truce between belligerents anxious to make peace. But the United Nations Charter also foresees members placing their armies under Security Council command to impose peace on warlike nations.
At the end of his book Mr. Hume asks a pertinent question about peacekeeping's future that he does not answer. Is authorizing individual nations to use force, as in the gulf war and now Haiti, the closest the council can realistically get these days to creating a permanent peace enforcement system as foreseen in the United Nations Charter? The tentative answer must be that the big powers show as little appetite for placing their forces under United Nations command now as they did during the Iraq-Iran war, when the United States rejected Moscow's call for a United Nations fleet to protect Persian Gulf shipping, preferring to do the job itself. Since that time the United States, Russia and France have all asked the Security Council to authorize private military interventions in Somalia, Haiti, Georgia and Rwanda, when they felt their interests or prestige were at risk.
A Security Council blessing may now be necessary to give legitimacy to such operations. But the practice of United Nations intervention that has grown up since the Beekman Place meetings is far removed from the system of enforced collective security that the charter's authors envisaged.

HEADLINE: FILM;
A Romanian Director Tells A Tale of Ethnic Madness

BYLINE: By ANNETTE INSDORF; Annette Insdorf is head of the film division of the School of the Arts at Columbia University.

 BODY:
Lucian Pintilie couldn't simply bask in the glow of the reception for his film "An Unforgettable Summer" at the Telluride Film Festival, in Colorado, in September. The Romanian film maker was incredulous that he couldn't smoke indoors. For someone who had just made a film about tolerance and freedom -- or the lack thereof -- no-smoking policies were a reason to grumble.
Then again the 61-year-old Mr. Pintilie (pronounced pin-teel-YEE-ay), whose film opens in New York on Friday, has been known as someone who does what he wants. After becoming one of Romania's leading directors of theater, film and television, in 1972 he was deemed subversive and unemployable by the Communist Government, which suspended his stage production of Gogol's "Inspector General," a satire of governmental bureaucracy. 
 "I was told, 'If you want to continue working here, you have to change your conception of the world.' I answered, 'But I've just started formulating it.' " He leans forward and enunciates each syllable: " 'All I can do is develop it.' "
Mr. Pintilie lived and worked abroad from 1973 to 1990 with dizzying mobility, building a reputation as a director of theatrical productions like "The Magic Flute" in Italy, "Turandot" in France and "Carmen" in Wales. By 1990, a year after the collapse of the Communist regime, Romania was far more welcoming: Mr. Pintilie returned as head of national film production at the Ministry of Culture.
Just two years later his movie "The Oak," a darkly comic reaction to the fall of the regime, was acclaimed internationally. "Though sometimes baffling," wrote Vincent Canby in The New York Times, "the film is never boring. It begins as a nightmare and ends with a vague expectation of the break of day."
"An Unforgettable Summer" (in Romanian, with English subtitles) unfolds in 1925 at a ball in Romania, where the radiant Marie-Therese Von Debretsy (Kristin Scott-Thomas, from "Four Weddings and a Funeral") scorns the advances of a general, her husband's superior in the Romanian Army. Her rejection leads him to transfer the couple and their children to an isolated garrison on the Danube.
But, says Robert D. Kaplan, the author of "Balkan Ghosts: A Journey Through History," "Romania in the 1920's was like Germany," in that no one was certain about borders. This was the time of the Balkan Wars, with their unceasing ethnic conflicts, and soon Marie-Therese's husband is commanded to take Bulgarian villagers hostage to avenge the massacre of Romanian guards by Macedonian bandits (primarily of Bulgarian origin). When he refuses orders to kill the hostages, the family is sent to an even more remote post -- and the Bulgarians are executed anyway.
Yet at the conclusion of "An Unforgettable Summer," the narrator -- one of the children, now grown -- recalls the warm months of 1925 as a beautiful memory. "The irony was deliberate on my part," Mr. Pintilie says. "Maybe I'm even a bit perverse to begin the film in a light and playful way: people fall into the trap of thinking it's not a serious film.
"Then I allow myself the last sarcasm at the end: even if the child remembers it as 'unforgettable,' it's better not to have a summer like that."
ALTHOUGH MR. PINTILIE adapted the film from Petru Dumitriu's short story "The Salad," the tale has personal resonance. When the director left Romania, he was "older than the boy of the tale, 6 or 7 rather than 3," he says, "with the perception only of what is idyllic." And like the captain in the film, Mr. Pintilie is no stranger to absurd displacement. He was born in the region of Bessarabia, in a German village inhabited by Romanians, Ruthenians, Turks, Tartars, Jews, Ukrainians and Russians.
"There wasn't even a hint of racial tension," he recalls. "Everybody lived without being conscious of their differences." When he left, he spoke "a sort of Esperanto, a patchwork of languages that exasperated and enchanted everyone."
World War II ushered in what he describes as a paradise lost: "One night, German schoolteacher colleagues of my father's rang our doorbell; they were terrified, like escaped convicts. What an irony of fate that the first victims of ethnic cleansing I encountered were German!"
Curiously, "An Unforgettable Summer" seems to criticize an era for which Mr. Pintilie professes affection: "If there's one regime with which I identify, it's the bourgeois regime up to the arrival of the Communists. And I'm proud to belong to a people known for their tolerance."
In the film, Mr. Pintilie depicts what he sees as the bad aspects of the regime. "I believe that an artist should not be a hostage to his own political convictions," he says. "If the Romanians are shown as intolerant, at least once, it has to be discussed. Each person, in this ethnic madness, must clean his own doorstep."
He expresses surprise that the American press generally believes "ethnic conflicts always existed and that Communism prevented them from surfacing," as he puts it.
"There has always been this absurd and monstrous manifestation in history of fanning ethnic conflicts to reinforce power. In 'An Unforgettable Summer' the Bulgarian peasants have no consciousness of ethnic difference: they are executed simply because examples must be set."
Mr. Pintilie now plans to direct a contemporary film, followed by a sequel to "An Unforgettable Summer." It will depict Marie-Therese transformed into a possessive mother who chases young women away from her son. "I will start the sequel in two years," he says. "My life is programmed. I only hope God doesn't spit on my plans."

HEADLINE: Erosion Pact Could Help Other Beaches Around U.S.

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

 BODY:
AN $80 million pact by the Army Corps of Engineers to restore the beaches of West Hampton Dunes and modify the jetties in Westhampton Beach could set a precedent for similar accords between Washington and other shorelines.
The agreement not only benefits homeowners in West Hampton Dunes who suffered severe damage in the major storm in December 1992, but it will also protect Moriches Bay and low-lying mainland areas, as well as create a two-mile-long public beach in the Hamptons. 
 The beach, when coupled with Pike's Beach, which Southampton owns, and Cupsogue Beach County Park, will be a significant amenity on the South Shore, with more than 2,000 parking spaces, according to Mayor Gary Vegliante of West Hampton Dunes, president of the Barrier Beach Preservation Association. Mr. Vegliante added:
"This should help to answer the concerns of many people who do not live near the water who say, 'Why should the government pay for the protection of beach property?' They'll also be helping to preserve endangered and threatened sea birds like the piping plover and rare plants like the seabeach amaranth.
"The agreement works for the general public, environmentalists and property owners. It's a solution that could be applied in similar disputes all along the East Coast and in California." Mr. Vegliante said his village of 750 residents had fewer than 90 houses, down from 270 before the 1992 storm.
Among the winners in the agreement, although not party to the suit, are residents of Fire Island and other barrier beaches west of the Hamptons, according to Gerard Stoddard, chairman of the Long Island Coastal Alliance and president of the Fire Island Association.
"It may take as long as 10 years," Mr. Stoddard said, "but the river of sand that normally drifts westward past the Hamptons groin field should someday again start replenishing Fire Island. The people on Fire Island are not only relieved that this agreement is finally in place, but that the settlement recognizes it was a major mistake not to complete that groin field. The Government is beginning to realize that if it's going to fiddle around with inlets and put up groins it's got to deal with the results and maintain them just as it maintains its highways, roads and bridges."
Mr. Stoddard noted that the settlement was in line with recommendations by the State Coastal Erosion Task Force. That panel has urged government agencies to correct problems created by interfering with natural coastal processes and that the work provides such public benefits as recreational areas, parking and restrooms.
Supervisor Fred W. Thiele Jr. of Southampton said although he was not a party to the pact he was pleased that "the long overdue settlement had finally been reached."
"The loss of the beaches along Dune Road have kept a lot of tourists out of Southampton over the last two years," Mr. Thiele said. "We're looking forward to their coming back and to a return of equity for the homeowners in that area, which was so adversely economically impacted."
The agreement, which settles a $200 million suit by homeowners in West Hampton Dunes, was filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn last week and signed by officials of the Army, State and Suffolk County.
The final settlement includes a provision calling for the Army to build "an interim storm-damage-protection plan" that the State Environmental Conservation Department had proposed. That project calls for restabilizing beaches in West Hampton Dunes to a depth of 420 feet from the center of Dune Road to the Atlantic at high tide at an initial cost of $30.6 million. The Federal portion of the initial cost is $21.4 million, and the non-Federal cost is $9.2 million, of which the state will pay 70 percent and the county 30.
An east-west dune line will be constructed from the last jetty of the Westhampton Beach groin field to Cupsogue County Park. The northern end of the line will be a minimum of 100 feet south of Dune Road, allowing for the reconstruction of houses in the 100-foot zone, according to John J. O'Connell of the law firm of Stein, Zauderer, Ellenhorn, Frischer & Sharp in Manhattan, who represented the homeowners.
The project also provides for 30 years of maintenance by the Army at $1.5 million a year, according to Peter Shugert, a spokesman for the New York office. Mr. Shugert aid the plan consisted of re-establishing the beach to the west of groin No. 15 at nine and a half feet above sea level, backed by a 13-foot-high dune.
The plan also includes shortening groins Nos. 14 and 15 at the western end of the line of jetties. An additional groin, or jetty, will be constructed between Nos. 14 and 15, and the compartments between Nos. 11 and 15 will be filled with sand.
Mr. Shugert said the tapering of the groin system was to encourage the littoral drift of sand to provide material west of the groin field.
The Army had planned to install 21 jetties in the late 1960's and 1970's in a hurricane-protection program. The final six jetties, which would have completed the project to a downdrift point of closure, were canceled because of political and budget problems in Suffolk.
There has been no construction work on the groin field since the early 70's, and substantial sectors have been filled as they trapped the sand that naturally drifts from east to west. But the shore immediately after jetty No. 15, lacking drifting sand, was vulnerable to scouring by tides and storms.
The problems created by the unfinished field came to a head in the winter of 1992, when a half-mile-wide breach opened at Pike's Beach in West Hampton Dunes, washing away nearly 200 houses, Dune Road and utility services linking the village to the mainland.
The Army has refilled the breach and plans to resolve the problems created by the jetties. The work is to begin at the end of next year and take about a year to complete. It is to provide protection against a 44-year storm, meaning, Mr. O'Connell said, the beach would be able to survive a storm about four times the intensity of the December 1992 storm.
The Army has also promised to revive a dormant study of erosion between Montauk Point and Fire Island Inlet. The corps now estimates that the study will take 10 years.
The settlement agreement also provides for Suffolk County to pay $4 million to West Hampton Dunes to cover legal fees for the suit and for infrastructure repairs. Mr. O'Connell said the property from the southern side of Dune Road to the southern toe of the dune line, a distance of 190 feet, would remain in the hands of the property owners. The county will own the area south of that line to the ocean as a public beach, and the public will have access to the area through Cupsogue Park, Pike's Beach and six pedestrian crossings to be built along Dune Road.
The settlement, Mr. O'Connell said, will provide homeowners with the complete restoration of their property and property values. At present, he said, the property is viewed essentially as valueless because of the erosion.

HEADLINE: How the Candidates For Statewide Offices See Major Issues On Election Eve

 BODY:
The political races of '94 are almost run, and along the way, the candidates have spoken hundreds of thousands of words -- in speeches, debates, mailings and advertisements. Often, though, dialogue on the issues of governing has been overshadowed by discussion of other matters, some substantive, others less so. 
 Here is a look at the key issues in the four statewide races -- for Governor, Comptroller, Attorney General and United States Senator -- and what the major candidates have said about them.
 
ISSUES: RACE FOR SENATE IN NEW YORK
 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan
 
Personal: Democrat. Senator, elected 1976. Served in the administrations of four Presidents -- Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford.
 
Views On Qualifications For Office: A self-described "Al Smith Democrat," he offers nearly four decades in public life, three terms in the Senate, and the chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee, wielding power over taxes, Social Security and trade -- half the Federal budget.
 
On Abortion: Supports a woman's right to abortion. Of Ms. Castro's financing proposal, he asked, "Does anybody really think that makes a difference?" and noted that the states pay the cost of Medicaid-financed abortions.
 
On GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade): He is a staunch advocate of the international agreement, which is one of President Clinton's highest legislative priorities and would lower tariffs by an average of 40 percent to promote exports around the world. He calls it "the largest tax cut in history and the culmination of 60 years of American trade policy."
 
Bernadette Castro
 
Personal: Republican. Former chief executive of Castro Convertibles
 
Views On Qualifications For Office: Calls herself a "Christine Todd Whitman Republican," and says she would offer an alternative to Mr. Moynihan's approach to government, including holding the line on taxation.
 
On Abortion: Says she supports a woman's right to abortion and Medicaid financing for poor women; however, she says those who oppose abortion should be allowed a check-off on their Federal tax returns stipulating that none of their payments go to finance it.
 
On GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade): Says she is favorably inclined toward GATT, although she fears that the agreement might lead to a loss of manufacturing jobs, especially for unskilled workers.
 
ISSUES: RACE FOR GOVERNOR
 
Mario M. Cuomo
 
Personal: Democrat. Governor, elected 1982. Lieutenant Governor, 1979-82.
 
Views On Economy And Taxes: Has called for a package of tax cuts that would be worth up to $1.7 billion, but has not disclosed details about how long he would take to cut taxes by that amount, how he would structure the reductions and how he would pay for them. Favors reducing the top income tax rate from 7.875 percent to 7 percent for single people earning more than $13,000 but less than $50,000 a year and for married couples earning more than $26,000 but less than $100,000. In addition, would increase the state's credit on the income tax for those who pay a large proportion of their income in property taxes, and would cut the state's tax on utility revenues, known as the gross receipts tax, from 4.25 percent to 2 percent. Would insist that the savings be passed along to ratepayers and not kept by the utilities.
 
On Crime: Opposes the death penalty on moral and practical grounds, but supports a referendum that would give voters a choice between the death penalty and his preferred maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole. Supports life without the possibility of parole for third-time violent felons. Favors banning assault weapons, with provisions to allow collectors and target shooters to own them under certain circumstances. Favors eliminating the state law requiring prison time for second felony offenders, saying that more drug treatment is needed for many such criminals.
 
On Welfare: Would gradually expand his program to force many welfare applicants to search for work before they are placed on the rolls. Would expand the Child Assistance Program, which gives some welfare mothers financial incentives to pursue child support orders from fathers and to find work. Would expand the state's workfare program. Would require children of welfare recipients to go to school and to live at home. Would expand fingerprinting of welfare recipients to the entire state.
 
On Abortion: Supports abortion rights and Medicaid financing of abortions without restrictions.
 
On Education: Would revamp the state's education aid formula to drive more money to New York City, which has 37 percent of the state's students and receives less than 35 percent of state aid. Favors special schools for the state's brightest students. Supports reducing state regulations over schools and offering them more local control. Would abolish the Board of Regents and give the Governor the authority to appoint the Education Commissioner. Would allow parents to choose among several public schools for their children.
 
George E. Pataki
 
Personal: Republican. State Senator, elected 1992. State Assemblyman, 1984-92. Mayor of Peekskill, 1981-84.
 
Views On Economy And Taxes: Has proposed a tax-cut package that would be worth $5.6 billion by the fourth year. Says it could be financed by cutting waste in state government agencies, keeping growth in the state budget to the rate of inflation, and revenue growth of 6 percent a year. Has not provided detailed plans for spending cuts. Would reduce the top income tax rate from 7.875 percent to 5.9 percent, while raising the annual income for the top tax bracket from $26,000 to $50,000 for married couples. Would keep the bottom rate at 4 percent. Would replace the current $1,000 exemption for dependents with a tax credit of $200 for each dependent. Would raise the earned income tax credit for lower-income working people to 20 percent of the Federal earned income tax credit immediately rather than waiting until 1997, as is required under a law passed this year. Has called for a variety of cuts in business taxes, but has not actually proposed any specific measures.
 
On Crime: Favors the death penalty for murderers. Would end parole and work release programs for violent felons. Would require mandatory prison terms for those who use a weapon in the commission of a felony. Favors an absolute ban on assault weapons. Supports more prison construction if it is needed to house felons. Opposes rescinding the state law that requires prison time for second-time felons, even if their crimes were nonviolent.
 
On Welfare: Would require more welfare recipients to work in public sector or community service jobs like cleaning highways and government buildings. Would threaten welfare families with the loss of their benefits if their children do not attend school. Would increase use of managed care in the Medicaid program. Would eliminate certain services provided by the state's Medicaid program, but has only identified a few. Supports statewide fingerprinting of welfare recipients and other measures to combat fraud.
 
On Abortion: Says he unequivocally supports abortion rights, but acknowledges that he has changed positions on the issue twice. Favors a state law requiring notification of the parents of girls under 16 who seek abortions. Opposes Medicaid financing of abortions unless it includes mandatory counseling on birth control.
 
On Education: Would cut the Education Department bureaucracy, but has not said how or by how much. Supports abolishing the Board of Regents and giving the Governor the authority to appoint the Education Commissioner. Would allow parents to choose among several public schools for their children. Favors increasing state aid to schools, but refuses to say if he believes the state's education aid formula is fair to New York City.
 
B. Thomas Golisano
 
Personal: Independent-Fusion. Founder, in 1971, of Paychex Inc., a Rochester company that prepares payrolls for small businesses.
 
Views On Economy And Taxes: Says the state's business climate is ruinous principally because of a state and local tax combination that he says is 45 percent higher than the national average. Over the next 10 years, he says, the tax burden must be reduced to no more than 5 to 10 percent above the national average, which would produce a tax cut even more dramatic than Mr. Pataki's. Wants to cut spending by about 50 percent over a decade, but beyond targeting welfare and Medicaid, has not been specific about where the cuts would come from.
 
On Crime: Proposes what he calls a "holistic approach" to crime, primarily by improving the state economy. Beyond that, proposes tougher sentencing for violent criminals and more emphasis on rehabilitation in prison, and would sign the death penalty into law. Has talked about decriminalizing certain drugs, but now says he wants to study the issue.
 
On Welfare: Says the state attracts welfare recipients because its welfare benefits are too generous compared to those of other states. Proposes cutting benefits substantially to match other states', as well as slashing administrative costs. Wants to reduce benefits for welfare recipients who have more than one baby, and to structure benefits to encourage teen-age mothers to live at home, rather than in subsidized apartments.
 
On Abortion: Supports abortion rights
 
On Education: Supports a sliding tuition at state colleges and universities, based on the applicant's ability to pay, as well as greater local control of schools.
 
ISSUES: RACE FOR COMPTROLLER
 
H. Carl McCall
 
Personal: Democrat-Liberal. Minster, United Church of Christ. State Senator from Manhattan, 1975-79. Deputy delegate to the United Nations, 1979-81. Citibank vice president, 1985-93. New York City Board of Education president, 1991-93. Appointed Comptroller, 1993.
 
Views On The Office: Sees audits as "management tools" to save money in state and local government. Would like to expand the Comptroller's role in the budget process by giving him the authority to approve revenue projections. Wants to use the pension fund to help finance job creation while still insuring a good return on investment.
 
Debt Reform: Prime sponsor of a debt-reform package that would limit the state's total debt and restructure the way money is borrowed. It would allow the Governor and Legislature to approve billions in debt without voter approval - the amount would be tied to the total personal income in the state - but would also end fiscal gimmicks like "back-door borrowing,' in which public assets are sold to a governmental authority that can issue bonds on its own.
 
Their Ideas For Government: Advocates lower taxes, especially on businesses, state takeover of local Medicaid costs and consolidation of governmental service. Also wants to expand audits of school districts. Wants new rules that would prohibit state spending untile a budget is passed.
 
Herbert London
 
Personal: Republican Conservative-Right to Life. John M. Olin professor of humanities at New York University, where he was dean of the Gallatin Division for 20 years. Conservative Party candidate for New York City Mayor, 1989. Conservative Party candidate for Governor, 1990.
 
Views On The Office: Has called the Comptroller's job a "think tank" for changing government and advocating for tax cuts. Wants to use the office to re-examine governmental structure and efficiency, including overlapping local jurisdications. Believes that the Comptroller should have a larger role in forcing the Legislature and Governor to deliver more responsible budgets.
 
Debt Reform: Opposes Mr. McCall's proposal. Says its debt ceiling is too high and believes that voters should approve all debt related to capital projects for the state and its authorities.
 
Their Ideas For Government: Advocates lower taxes and creating a better enviroment for business. Has spoken in favor of greater privatization of governmental services, a Medicaid takeover, increased competitive bidding and the introduction of school vouchers, starting with special education.
 
ISSUES: RACE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL

Views On Role Of Attorney General: Maintains that the Attorney General is not a "super prosecutor" whose mission is to fight street crime. But has promised to be a "crusader" on domestic violence by helping to coordinate prevention efforts in the state. Has also said that she will focus on civil rights cases, environmental crimes and fraud against consumers and the elderly.
 
On Abortion: She is a longtime supporter of women's rights, including the right to abortion, and says that she would vigorously enforce abortion laws, including a new Federal law giving state attorneys general broader authority in guaranteeing access to abortion clinics.

HEADLINE: How the Candidates For Statewide Offices See Major Issues On Election Eve

 BODY:
The political races of '94 are almost run, and along the way, the candidates have spoken hundreds of thousands of words -- in speeches, debates, mailings and advertisements. Often, though, dialogue on the issues of governing has been overshadowed by discussion of other matters, some substantive, others less so. 
 Here is a look at the key issues in the four statewide races -- for Governor, Comptroller, Attorney General and United States Senator -- and what the major candidates have said about them.
 
ISSUES: RACE FOR SENATE IN NEW YORK
 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan
 
Personal: Democrat. Senator, elected 1976. Served in the administrations of four Presidents -- Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford.
 
Views On Qualifications For Office: A self-described "Al Smith Democrat," he offers nearly four decades in public life, three terms in the Senate, and the chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee, wielding power over taxes, Social Security and trade -- half the Federal budget.
 
On Abortion: Supports a woman's right to abortion. Of Ms. Castro's financing proposal, he asked, "Does anybody really think that makes a difference?" and noted that the states pay the cost of Medicaid-financed abortions.
 
On GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade): He is a staunch advocate of the international agreement, which is one of President Clinton's highest legislative priorities and would lower tariffs by an average of 40 percent to promote exports around the world. He calls it "the largest tax cut in history and the culmination of 60 years of American trade policy."
 
Bernadette Castro
 
Personal: Republican. Former chief executive of Castro Convertibles
 
Views On Qualifications For Office: Calls herself a "Christine Todd Whitman Republican," and says she would offer an alternative to Mr. Moynihan's approach to government, including holding the line on taxation.
 
On Abortion: Says she supports a woman's right to abortion and Medicaid financing for poor women; however, she says those who oppose abortion should be allowed a check-off on their Federal tax returns stipulating that none of their payments go to finance it.
 
On GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade): Says she is favorably inclined toward GATT, although she fears that the agreement might lead to a loss of manufacturing jobs, especially for unskilled workers.
 
ISSUES: RACE FOR GOVERNOR
 
Mario M. Cuomo
 
Personal: Democrat. Governor, elected 1982. Lieutenant Governor, 1979-82.
 
Views On Economy And Taxes: Has called for a package of tax cuts that would be worth up to $1.7 billion, but has not disclosed details about how long he would take to cut taxes by that amount, how he would structure the reductions and how he would pay for them. Favors reducing the top income tax rate from 7.875 percent to 7 percent for single people earning more than $13,000 but less than $50,000 a year and for married couples earning more than $26,000 but less than $100,000. In addition, would increase the state's credit on the income tax for those who pay a large proportion of their income in property taxes, and would cut the state's tax on utility revenues, known as the gross receipts tax, from 4.25 percent to 2 percent. Would insist that the savings be passed along to ratepayers and not kept by the utilities.
 
On Crime: Opposes the death penalty on moral and practical grounds, but supports a referendum that would give voters a choice between the death penalty and his preferred maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole. Supports life without the possibility of parole for third-time violent felons. Favors banning assault weapons, with provisions to allow collectors and target shooters to own them under certain circumstances. Favors eliminating the state law requiring prison time for second felony offenders, saying that more drug treatment is needed for many such criminals.
 
On Welfare: Would gradually expand his program to force many welfare applicants to search for work before they are placed on the rolls. Would expand the Child Assistance Program, which gives some welfare mothers financial incentives to pursue child support orders from fathers and to find work. Would expand the state's workfare program. Would require children of welfare recipients to go to school and to live at home. Would expand fingerprinting of welfare recipients to the entire state.
 
On Abortion: Supports abortion rights and Medicaid financing of abortions without restrictions.
 
On Education: Would revamp the state's education aid formula to drive more money to New York City, which has 37 percent of the state's students and receives less than 35 percent of state aid. Favors special schools for the state's brightest students. Supports reducing state regulations over schools and offering them more local control. Would abolish the Board of Regents and give the Governor the authority to appoint the Education Commissioner. Would allow parents to choose among several public schools for their children.
 
George E. Pataki
 
Personal: Republican. State Senator, elected 1992. State Assemblyman, 1984-92. Mayor of Peekskill, 1981-84.

Geography Put Back In the Future

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GOSS 

 BODY:
CLARK UNIVERSITY in Worcester, Mass., has seen the future and it is geography.
Long ago abandoned as a separate discipline by many colleges, which incorporated it into subjects like global studies, geography has a new life in the new age.
"Environmental issues are becoming dominant on the heels of the cold war," said Dr. Roger Kasperson, the Clark provost -- and a geographer by training. Clark is creating an Environmental School "to reconcile economic development and economic growth with environmental issues," he said. 
 "As national security becomes dominated by environmental questions, we need to produce an educated person with a depth of knowledge in environmental issues that students currently don't get," Dr. Kasperson added.
The school, which is in the final stages of approval from faculty and trustees, is to begin with 50 students in the fall of 1995. Students will receive a standard liberal arts education while also pursuing "almost a second major in environmental sciences and policies," said Dr. Kasperson. Students who choose an accelerated program can also study for a fifth year and earn a master's degree.
The curriculum aims to avoid the "consciousness-raising" tone of some similar courses and to focus on "producing an education that is more rigorous and substantive than has existed in the past," he added. So some courses will have input from the humanities department, examining human interaction with the environment and emerging environmental ethics and values.
Since Clark created a graduate school of geography in 1921, it has awarded more doctorates in that area than any other school in the country.
"The increased interest in global and environmental issues," said Dr. Kasperson, "has given a real shot of adrenaline to geography."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Social Security: The Issue They Chose To Ignore

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
PESSIMISM may be this year's most important public attitude. And that will be true whether or not it leads voters to punish the Democrats.
The belief that the future is going to be worse than the present has historically been a negative for the stock market, and one market indicator, based on the Conference Board's consumer confidence index, is close to giving its first sell signal since shortly before the 1987 crash. 
 That indicator is based on how people think the economy will be in six months. But the pessimism goes much deeper than that. In the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, 57 percent of Americans say they think the next generation will be worse off than the current one. In 1990, the figure was 36 percent.
Just why people are so pessimistic about the outlook for their children and grandchildren is not easy to answer. But one part may be the fear that the political system will be unable to come to grips with long-term problems facing the country.
The most visible example of that is the health care deadlock. But it is possible to argue that the health care cost crisis, like that of energy 15 years ago, will eventually be solved by market forces. The entitlements mess is something else again.
There are few politicians who do not realize that the budget deficit cannot be brought under control without attacking middle-class entitlements, of which Social Security is the most important. But they fear even mentioning the fact.
Both Democrats and Republicans have been accused of planning to do something responsible. Both have indignantly denied it.
But the most depressing aspect of the campaign and entitlements came from the Republicans' Contract with America, put together by Newt Gingrich, the would-be speaker of the House. It promises to raise Social Security benefits for the better off by reducing taxes on such benefits for those with substantial incomes. The taxes, part of last year's deficit reduction plan, slanted benefits a bit toward those who really need them, which is the direction almost every expert thinks is needed. But Mr. Gingrich is going for quick political popularity.
Social Security is a prime example of the dangers of a good marketing campaign. It was sold as a pension plan by Franklin Roosevelt, and that is still how many see it, figuring they contributed to it and therefore deserve to get their money back.
In fact, it is and always has been a transfer program, taking money from working people and giving it to the retired and disabled. View it as a transfer program, and the idea of providing benefits only to those who need them is obvious. But the political system is unable to act. And the public grows more pessimistic each year. When asked about the effect of President Clinton's hard-won deficit reduction bill, 24 percent of Americans say it raised the deficit, while only 17 percent think it lowered it.
To long-term bears on the dollar, the entitlements gridlock is argument No. 1. To pay its bills, they say, America eventually must debase the currency.
For now, the gridlock probably has been good for the stock market. Retirement savings are on the rise because many doubt Social Security will be there for them, and a lot of that money ends up in stocks. But that may not last. Bear markets often come along with weak, unsuccessful Administrations.

HEADLINE: Ticketmaster's Mr. Tough Guy

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
PERHAPS the only thing not in rancorous dispute in the ticketing business these days is this: ticketmaster wanted the business and Ticketmaster got the business. In the pugnacious world of selling entertainment and sports tickets, Ticketmaster is the winner and still ambitious champion.
It is the company that figured out how to sell tickets quickly by phone and at retail outlets. It cultivated the music industry and other contacts so that it would have tickets to sell. It then bound the stadiums, halls and other sites to long-term exclusive contracts that kept rivals out in the cold. 
 Most important, it shared the revenue from ticket service charges so that the sites would make more money if Ticketmaster, rather than the sites alone, sold the tickets.
As a result, Ticketmaster enjoys the exclusive rights to be the outside sales agent for nearly two-thirds of the nation's 10 million seats at major halls. A handful of rivals, like Dillard's in Phoenix and Protix in Madison, Wis., scramble for the rest.
Ticketmaster's reward: last year, it handled more than $1.3 billion worth of tickets, collecting $191.1 million in service and other charges from what is far and away the biggest markup in the business.
The Public Interest Research Group, a consumer advocacy organization, recently contended that Ticketmaster's fees added almost 30 percent to the face value of an average ticket. Ticketmaster says the group's estimate is too high because its sample is too small; the company says its service charge adds 14 percent to the cost of the average ticket.
Ticketmaster is a company marked by what supporters call grit and critics call guile -- and the Government may yet call monopoly.
The simmering uneasiness with Ticketmaster's market dominance reached a head this summer, when the rock group Pearl Jam accused the company of anticompetitive practices and canceled its summer tour. Pearl Jam demanded that the Government investigate Ticketmaster as a possible monopoly.
Suddenly, promoters, agents and other entertainers joined Pearl Jam's crusade. Congress held hearings. The Justice Department began an antitrust inquiry, which is continuing. A rash of class-action suits against Ticketmaster, accusing it of monopolistic practices, including exorbitant service charges, followed.
Whether a company's broad reach constitutes a monopoly is a complex legal and economic question, complicated further in Ticketmaster's case by the fact that unlike, say, the old Bell telephone system, Ticketmaster has relatively little control over supply -- the tickets themselves.
But for critics, the issue is clear-cut. "It's really very simple," said Kelly Curtis, Pearl Jam's manager. "Ticketmaster said, 'If you don't like us, go someplace else.' But we found out that there wasn't anyplace else."
Robert Sacks, a lawyer for Pearl Jam, said, "The genius of Ticketmaster was in converting what was a pain in the neck, selling tickets, into a profit center by tacking on high service charges. If you're a stadium, that's fantastic. But who gets hurt by that? The fans."
Nonsense, except he does not say nonsense, said Frederic D. Rosen, Ticketmaster's profane president and chief executive. "If we do have a lot of market share, guess what?" he asked. "We earned it! And if we earned it, it's something to be proud of. Proud of!"
Tired of the bad publicity, Mr. Rosen is fighting back by allowing a rare look inside Ticketmaster, a privately owned company whose services millions use but whose inside workings few have ever seen.
How the company became the market leader is pretty much the story of Fred Rosen, who convinced Chicago financier Jay Pritzker a dozen years ago that he was the man to revive the moribund Pritzker property known as Ticketmaster.
Mr. Rosen's charming, earthy, blustery personality has both amused and alarmed the world of entertainers, agents, promoters and, most of all, "the buildings," industry argot for the executives at performance sites like the Great Western Forum in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood and Radio City Music Hall in New York that are Ticketmaster's principal clients.
A native New Yorker and son of an advertising executive, Mr. Rosen is a 50-year-old former corporate lawyer whose knack for dealmaking at Ticketmaster won the financial backing first of Mr. Pritzker and then, last year, of Paul G. Allen, the billionaire cofounder of the Microsoft Corporation, who bought 80 percent of Ticketmaster from Mr. Pritzker.
During a recent visit to his Wilshire Boulevard office, Mr. Rosen seemed restless. His inflamed appendix had been removed only days before, yet he couldn't stop pacing the hallways lined with old movie posters. Tieless but wearing a blue dress shirt, Mr. Rosen delivers the nonstop patter of Ed Koch, the former Mayor of New York, filtered through the about-to-explode voice of Al Pacino. Even a mild question about Ticketmaster's squabbles with Pearl Jam can provoke an intense answer.
"You know what I believe all this really is?" asked Mr. Rosen, his two index fingers stabbing the air. "It's jealousy and envy. Nobody knew this was a good business. And nobody took the time to do it correctly."
Many of Ticketmaster's clients seem satisfied. Michael R. Rowe, executive vice president at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, N.J., was typical, saying Ticketmaster's service had been excellent during the course of its five-year contract, which expires next year. "I'm very pleased," he said.
What is beyond dispute is that Ticketmaster and Mr. Rosen worked hard for the dominant market position. Here in Los Angeles, where Ticketmaster is headquartered, if someone wanted the convenience of buying a ticket with a credit card over the telephone or at an outlet in a record or department store, it would be difficult to avoid going through Ticketmaster.
Indeed, if someone wanted to hear Placido Domingo, the opera singer, this week, or cheer for the Los Angeles Lakers against the New York Knicks next week, or take her children to Walt Disney's World on Ice next month, and, above all, if she had wanted one of this year's hottest tickets -- one of the 16,000 that sold out in 13 minutes -- for the Eagles' concert last May, then Ticketmaster is the only game in town.
IN Southern California alone, Ticketmaster has access to 12,000 events and has 175 retail outlets. And the consumer pays for that convenience, as much as $1.75 a ticket for Disney on Ice to $6.25 for the Grateful Dead. By contrast, Advantix, a ticketing service in Cleveland, typically charges $2 a ticket for a similar range of events.
The story is the same in the rest of the country. To be sure, Ticketmaster is far from dominant in every state and region. It is especially weak in the Sunbelt and border states, for example, where it started its expansion much later.
But in 1991, Ticketmaster had exclusive contracts with sites holding 45 percent of the nation's seats, according to Pollstar, an industry magazine. Today, Ticketmaster has such contracts with halls and arenas representing 63.2 percent of the country's 9.9 million seats, according to the latest Pollstar data. And even this figure does not tell the whole story: Ticketmaster, on a nonexclusive basis, sells tickets for some of the remaining 36.8 percent as well.
If Ticketmaster has by far the biggest share of the pie, it has little to do with how much filling is inside.
Every site controls its own inventory of tickets and sells the bulk of the tickets directly in group or other advance sales, said Mr. Rosen. "We, as a service company, control nothing," he said.
"Take the Hollywood Bowl," he continued. "By the time that they're through with season tickets, Monday night plans, Tuesday night plans, Wednesday night plans and Thursday night plans, probably 12 percent of their dollar sales are going through Ticketmaster."
Indeed, Ticketmaster sold only 51 million tickets last year through operations it directly owns and another 10 million through licensees.
Mr. Rosen goes out of his way to play down Ticketmaster's share. In Congressional testimony this summer, he contended that Ticketmaster handled "less than 2 percent" of 1.5 billion tickets sold in 1993.
That huge overall figure came from numbers compiled by Marketdata Enterprises Inc., a Valley Stream, L.I., research firm whose study was commissioned by Ticketmaster. But more than two-thirds of that national figure comes from museums, amusement parks, state parks and county fairs, where Ticketmaster and other computer services sell few tickets.
A smaller, more reasonable figure, of 178 million tickets -- from professional sports like football and events at arenas, auditoriums and theaters -- would indicate that Ticketmaster's market share was closer to 37 percent today.
That said, most tickets are low-priced and can take weeks to sell, like those for the Laserium at Griffith Observatory here or the Debussy Trio at the Orange County, Calif., Performing Arts Center.
The rare act that sells out in minutes -- like Elton John or the Rolling Stones -- carries a high service charge that helps subsidize the majority of slower sellers, or at least that is the Ticketmaster argument.
Even when the ticket is free, Ticketmaster imposes a service charge. At the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, for example, a Ticketmaster licensee charges $3 a ticket when issued in advance (down from $3.50 last year). "It's a good cause, but I can't get my phones or computers for free," said Paul d'Eustachio, the president of Ticketmaster in Landover, Md.
Mr. Rosen's overall strategy was to latch on to as much supply in as many different places as he could. That way he could afford to build an infrastructure of telephone rooms and ticket outlets staffed full-time throughout the year.
But first he had to defeat Ticketron, the dominant ticket service in the 1980's. When Mr. Rosen became chief executive of Ticketmaster in 1982, he convinced Mr. Pritzker that Goliath was vulnerable.
"Fred wooed venues very cleverly and energetically," Mr. Pritzker said. "And Ticketron had a problem. They didn't have a Fred Rosen."
TICKETRON also had a reputation for selling expensive computers from the Control Data Corporation, Ticketron's parent, to major arenas and stadiums, but then neglecting customer service when the computers broke down.
If Ticketmaster could offer better computer performance -- and at less cost to the hall -- it could grab market share, Mr. Rosen reasoned.
One problem, however: ticketmaster had inexpensive Digital Equipment computers costing $50,000 or so that had to compete with Ticketron's Control Data mainframes costing $1 million or more.
Of necessity, Ticketmaster programmers, headed by Peter Gadwa and Albert Leffler, who founded the company in 1976, somehow had to leverage Ticketmaster's cheap computers with some clever software. They did. With an elaborate computer program, now numbering more than 1.5 million lines of code, they were able to make a computer that normally served 50 telephone operators serve 1,000 or more.
"We were able to make a P.T. boat act like an aircraft carrier," said Mr. Gadwa, director of programming in Ticketmaster's Tempe, Ariz., office.
At the same time, Mr. Rosen was cajoling halls and arenas into granting Ticketmaster long-term exclusive contracts of three to five years or more. In contrast to Ticketron, Ticketmaster would provide computer terminals and other equipment at little or no cost.
Ticketmaster would make its money from what it called "convenience" charges. Ticketmaster and the hall would negotiate proportional (that is, higher) service charges for customer tickets, where Ticketron typically charged flat service charges of $2 or less.
Mr. Rosen's strategy dovetailed nicely with a new trend: higher concert ticket prices. Since the mid-1980's, prices for even superstar acts typically were $25 to $35 a ticket; but in recent years, and especially this summer, they have ranged from $50 to $100 and for the rare act, like Barbra Streisand, $350.
What's more, entertainers have been less willing to share concert revenue with the halls and arenas, sometimes demanding nearly all of the take instead of the traditional arrangement of turning over as much as 40 percent. The sites, in turn, wanted to make up the concert revenue they had lost. They were all ears when Mr. Rosen suggested raising service charges.
Ticketmaster's ascent was complete when Ticketron, after several money-losing years, failed to find a buyer to rescue it in 1991. The Justice Department reluctantly cleared the liquidation of Ticketron's assets, most of which Ticketmaster bought.
Mr. Rosen's transformation from giant-killer to giant was underscored last year when Mr. Pritzker sold most of Ticketmaster to Mr. Allen. (Mr. Pritzker retains a stake in the company, while Mr. Rosen gained a stake. Mr. Gadwa and Mr. Leffler, the co-founders, were bought out.)
THE sale price was based on a value for the company of $325 million. The value was unusually lush: twice the fiscal 1994 revenue and 54 times operating profit.
Results for that fiscal year, which ended Jan. 31, were distorted by extraordinary items related to the sale to Mr. Allen. Although Ticketmaster Holdings Group Ltd. lost $1.9 million during the period, on an operating basis it had a profit of $6 million compared with the year-earlier $7.5 million, according to Mr. Rosen. Full-year revenue totaled $191.1 million, up 11 percent from $172 million the year before.
It is with this backdrop that Ticketmaster's most recent troubles started in June, when Pearl Jam wanted to mount an inexpensive summer tour for its young fans.
The band sought to limit ticket prices to less than $20, and planned to lower its own take to $18. Pearl Jam therefore wanted Ticketmaster to settle for under $2 for its service charge. But Ticketmaster balked at the low fee and wanted the band to lower its take slightly.
Frustrated with other Ticketmaster actions (the band contended the company threatened to organize a boycott of concert promoters against it, a charge Mr. Rosen denies), Pearl Jam canceled the tour.
The band promptly brought its complaint of monopolistic practices with the Justice Department.
Pearl Jam is planning a summer tour next year but must still decide how to sell tickets nationally without Ticketmaster. It is considering a mail-order ticketing system, details unknown, according to Mr. Curtis, the group's manager.
THE new scrutiny of Ticketmaster has heartened competitors. "History repeats itself," said Laurence F. Schwartz, founder of Hill Arts and Entertainment Systems, which sells ticketing software to Ticketmaster rivals. "Ticketmaster, with 1970's technology, defeated Ticketron, which had 1960's technology. And people like us, with our more advanced technology, will defeat Ticketmaster by the year 2000."
But Michael Green, a Wayne, N.J., entrepreneur who is trying to develop a nationwide computerized ticketing service, said he sees little incentive for Ticketmaster to modernize its computer system. 'Why spend the money when they already own the market?" he asked.
For its part, Ticketmaster denies that it is technologically backward. But executives acknowledge that it may have to move to what is known as "open architecture," a hardware and software arrangement that allows computer equipment made by different manufacturers to "talk" with Ticketmaster.
It would, for example, allow home computers, automated teller machines and shopping-mall kiosks to tap into Ticketmaster data bases. Someday, that might allow a consumer to dial up Ticketmaster's computer, look at a seating plan for a concert hall, pick out tickets and order them.
Ticketmaster's present arrangement is closed architecture, a legacy of its cheap computer/clever software days. Mr. Allen, the majority owner and co-founder of Microsoft, is sure to be a major force for modernization.
Whatever the case, Mr. Rosen is already restless. "We've become a nation of whiners," he said. "Let's just all compete."
 
 
 
COMPUTERS AND ENVELOPE STUFFERS
 WHAT Ticketmaster does is more complicated than might first appear. Of the 61 million tickets it sold last year, only 40 percent were ordered over the telephone. The rest were sold at 2,800 retail outlets, like record and department stores. In the largest cities, as few as 10 percent of the sales for hot concerts may be by phone.
Sales at outlets, which take only cash, are a boon to Ticketmaster. Such transactions do not require the labor- and telecommunications-intensive efforts of processing and clearing credit cards. An outlet sale can thus take seconds, while a phone sale can take three minutes or more.
But as ticket prices rise, more people are buying by phone and credit card, raising Ticketmaster's costs. Indeed, one reason that Ticketmaster cites for imposing a charge for each ticket (rather than a cheaper per-order charge) is credit-card costs. Even though a $10 ticket costs the same to process as a $100 ticket, the higher-priced ticket is more likely to be rejected by the credit-card issuer or found to be charged on a stolen card.
Except for the computers, little of the Ticketmaster transaction is automated. Ticketmaster staffs phone lines with 3,200 to 4,000 operators at peak periods.
While much of the data associated with the transaction, such as a customer's name and address, are stored in computer data bases, the actual tickets are stuffed into envelopes by hand to reduce error.
"Getting it right before it leaves our hands saves us a lot of aggravation in refunds, phone time and angry customers," said W. David Anderson, vice president, telephone sales and service. (Ticketmaster says its error rate is 1 percent, but that another 7 percent of orders are lost or delayed in the mail.)
It is just such labor costs that persuaded major arenas like the Meadowlands in New Jersey to hire Ticketmaster rather than handle sales themselves.
"I'd need 200 phone operators who really knew what they were doing, but would not think it was odd that I needed them only 8 days during the summer," said Karen T. Sullivan, director of box office operations at the Meadowlands.

HEADLINE: At Wind River, Cautious Steps Toward Capitalism

BYLINE: By DOUG McINNIS; Doug McInnis is a freelance writer based in Casper, Wyo.

DATELINE: ETHETE, Wyo.

 BODY:
WHEN Patrick Goggles sees tourists streaming through the Wind River Indian Reservation to Yellowstone National Park, he sees money -- money that isn't flowing to his Northern Arapaho tribe. Tourists spend $1.6 billion a year in Wyoming, and the Arapaho are moving only belatedly to extract the tourist gold that Anglo businesses just outside the reservation have mined for generations.
As general manager of the Northern Arapaho Trust, which manages the tribe's investments, Mr. Goggles oversees a venture that includes a small group of retail and service businesses that serve tourists and tribal members alike. These enterprises sometimes lure tourists traveling to and from Wyoming's biggest draws -- Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks -- but not often enough, and Mr. Goggles wants to lure more. 
 One familiar route is probably not open to the Arapaho. Tribes in more populous states, like Connecticut, Florida and California, have cashed in on big-time casino gambling. "The odds always favor the house," observed Mr. Goggles. "It would be pretty hard to screw up gaming."
But in Wyoming, the nation's least populous state, the Arapaho would have a tough time attracting enough customers to make it work. While Wyoming gets plenty of visitors, they are often families on their way to national parks, not high rollers with money to burn. So while the Arapaho have some small gaming operations, they have settled on tourism as the most likely vehicle to generate jobs.
And that is the crying need. Despite publicity that might indicate otherwise, gambling has not proved a cure-all for most tribes. "A majority of the tribes are not getting wealthy because of gaming," said Manley Begay, executive director for the Project on Indian Economic Development at Harvard University. Most tribes "are very poor, with unemployment reaching in some areas to 90 percent."
The big obstacle is the lack of a capitalist tradition. In other communities, budding capitalists can tap the experience of many business managers. But on a reservation with few college graduates and few tribal members with experience running a business, there is often no one to ask for advice. "Our problems are worse because we don't have this business tradition," said Anne McIntosh, chairwoman of the trust.
Mr. Goggles, whose Arapaho name is "Strong Bear," is trying to build that tradition. He is part of an emerging class of Indian executives whose job is to speed the creation of Indian-owned businesses, while helping to educate their tribes in the ways of market capitalism. And the Arapaho have certainly made some missteps and had some growing pains along the way.
Mr. Goggles is largely self-taught, having earlier held positions at tribal businesses and in the tribal political structure. At 42, when many managers have M.B.A.'s, Mr. Goggles is completing work at the University of Wyoming for a bachelor's degree in political science, with a minor in business.
Twenty-five years ago, there were only a handful of Indian business managers, Mr. Begay said. Today, Indian businesses bring in billions of dollars annually, and though the number of Indian managers is growing, he said "there is still a long way to go in being able to have a crop of Indian managers you can dip into any time you feel like it."
As a result, tribes must still turn to outsiders, although they prefer Indian managers, because, Mr. Begay said, "it promotes sovereignty and it's part of nation-building."
Strong managers also increase the odds that Indian-owned ventures will succeed. Success is essential because tribes like the Northern Arapaho have little capital to play with. A serious misstep could prove disastrous. The neighbors of the Arapaho on the reservation, the Eastern Shoshone tribe, invested roughly $5 million in high-risk derivatives and took a multimillion-dollar loss. As a result, Shoshone tribal leaders had to tap savings accounts to cover tribal operating expenses this year.
DEPENDING on the assets of a region, the best fit may be manufacturing, farming, ranching, tourism, mining, service industries, gambling or something else. So tribal leaders must select the right businesses, then make them work. And the Arapaho believe much of their future lies in tourism.
Mr. Goggles says his tribe can cash in on outsiders' fascination for Indian art, souvenirs and traditions. "They want to see, they want to buy, they want to touch Arapaho," he said. "They want T-shirts and caps. We can market our culture."
At the Wind River Reservation, Mr. Goggles' job is to help build enterprises that will slice the tribe's 70 percent unemployment rate, and cut deeply into their dependence on public assistance. "What we're talking about for the Northern Arapaho Nation is economic independence and self-sufficiency," he said.
 The tribe has a sizable asset in the reservation itself, which it shares with the Eastern Shoshone tribe. The reservation covers some two million acres, an area larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined. It stretches across high-plains ranch and farm land until it disappears into the cloud-covered Wind River mountains at the Continental Divide, which forms part of the reservation's Western boundary. The area's beauty has long been appreciated by tribal members and visitors alike, but now the Arapaho want to turn this beauty into jobs.
The goal is an economic infrastructure that will serve tourists and residents of nearby towns -- as well as the tribe's 6,200 members.
In 1988, to aid business development, the Arapaho took the unusual step of placing tribal businesses in the trust, which is separate from the sometimes contentious politics of the Arapaho's governing counsel. In 1991, the trust sold $2.1 million in bonds to increase its capital.
THE Arapaho own a grocery, a convenience store, a truck stop, small-scale gaming operations, a laundromat, a screen printing company and a construction concern. These businesses provide 85 jobs, and generate $7.5 million in annual revenues. The trust doesn't disclose profits, but Mr. Goggles said all but one venture, a convenience operation, are making money.
Soon to be started is a reservation tour service. Under consideration are a dozen more enterprises, including a trading post, a recreational vehicle park, a hunting outfitter's service, a fast-food outlet, and expanded gambling operations. The tribe also hopes to attract some industrial plants.
The tribe is trying to reinvent the commercial legacy that was lost when the Arapaho were forced onto the reservation in the late 1800's. The Arapaho and other Great Plains tribes once traded buffalo robes, meat and other commodities for farm goods supplied by agricultural tribes on the edge of the Plains. But confinement to the reservation and near extinction of the buffalo largely ended that culture, said Colin Calloway, an associate professor and specialist in Indian history at the University of Wyoming. "Once on the reservation," he said, "Indian people were not supposed to leave without a pass."
Reservation life also fostered a debilitating history of public assistance. Many new employees of tribal businesses have never worked in conventional jobs and cannot adjust to the working world. Some find that service-industry wages cannot compete with government benefits. But the tribe shows considerably more patience with new employees than most private businesses would, because turning lives around is the ultimate goal of Arapaho capitalism.
"I definitely want to make a profit," said Ms. McIntosh, the trust's chairwoman, who is a rancher by training. But, she said, "my main goal is to provide a higher standard of living for the reservation." She estimated that 40 percent of problem workers become productive workers for the tribe's businesses.
From the beginning, the Arapaho have moved cautiously. So far they have avoided debacles of the magnitude that hit the Eastern Shoshone. Mr. Goggles will not comment on the Shoshone derivatives investment other than to say the Arapaho never invested in anything as risky. The tribe stuck to "T-bills, Ginnie Mae's and C.D.'s," he said.
Even so, capitalism has provided nasty jolts, including the closing of a clothing factory and a video store. The factory was hurt by short production runs, and a high turnover of workers who found wages of $4.25 an hour could not compete with public assistance. The venture ultimately failed because it relied on a single client that went out of business.
"We weren't big enough," Mr. Goggles said. "If you're going to get into the cut-and-sew business, you've got to have a huge volume or you'll be eaten alive. Basically, we were eaten alive."
The failure was an expensive lesson. The factory was financed through a bank loan guaranteed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. When the plant closed, the trust could have let the Government absorb the loss. Instead, the trust paid off the balance of $280,000 -- to keep the trust's integrity and its credit rating intact, Mr. Goggles said. The factory has since been converted into a profitable bingo hall.
Some remaining businesses have learned the hard way. The tribe's convenience store paid for orders that were not delivered in full and for perishable items whose expiration dates were the day after they were delivered, trust officials said. Employees have since been trained to check vendor deliveries carefully, and the tribe has contracted with a convenience-store chain to train Indian managers and provide expertise in inventory control, customer service and security.
FOR the future, Mr. Goggles and the tribe's business leaders must walk the tightrope that all young enterprises face -- growing without losing money. Profits are essential because they provide funds to open new ventures.
For a tribe with massive unemployment, jobs cannot come fast enough. On a recent day, two single mothers approached Mr. Goggles about jobs at the tribe-owned truck stop. He had none to offer.
But Mr. Goggles is optimistic that the tribe can cash in on its lands, its culture and its scenic location to create a variety of businesses that will put hundreds of tribe members to work and land a substantial piece of the area's tourist trade. "I can capture a portion of that business," said Mr. Goggles. "As a matter of fact, I already do. It's just that I want more."

HEADLINE: The Very Quiet Behemoth of the Philanthropic World

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: CHEVY CHASE, Md.

 BODY:
THOUGH other philanthropies are better known, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute is actually the leviathan of the nonprofit world, and C. F. (Terry) Wolfe is the man who minds the money.
No wonder he keeps a pie-sized Bayer aspirin on his desk. "You just have to cross out the zeros," he said. Otherwise, he has discovered, "you'd lose perspective." 
 His is a daunting task. With $7.5 billion in assets, the Hughes institute is the world's largest philanthropy, larger than the Ford Foundation or Harvard University. And given its do-it-yourself philosophy, its chief investment officer has more to do than many conventional money managers.
The institute takes the view that the best way to manage its hoard is in-house. That means Mr. Wolfe, and his three deputies, do not parcel the money out to a dozen pricey Wall Street hands or follow the herd by plowing the funds into a market index.
In the face of all the choices that must then be made, Mr. Wolfe tries to keep a cool head. Disclaiming any special skill as a stock picker or market timer, Mr. Wolfe describes his role, played out on the ground floor of the institute's gleaming new $55 million headquarters, as that of a conductor.
"I just try to orchestrate things," said Mr. Wolfe, 55, a native of Mt. Carmel, Pa., who took over as chief investment officer on May 1 after 30 years at I.B.M.
At the time, the Hughes institute was at something of a crossroads. Started in 1953 by the billionaire to promote medical research, the institute owned but one asset for more than three decades: the Hughes Aircraft Company. Mr. Hughes had donated it to the institute, but retained control as the institute's sole trustee. So, the institute spent years defending itself against charges from the Internal Revenue Service that its real purpose was to serve as a tax dodge.
By the time Mr. Hughes, a filmmaker and aviator as well as reclusive industrialist, died in 1976, the aircraft maker was more valuable than his estate. But only a small fraction of its profits was going to medical research, and the institute was tight-lipped about the projects it did bankroll.
Under pressure from the I.R.S. and in an effort to diversify, the institute sold the aircraft company to General Motors in 1985 for $5.2 billion in cash and stock. Two years later, the institute settled its long-running feud with the I.R.S. in exchange for being allowed to remain a tax-exempt "medical institute," a designation that obligates it to give away only 3.5 percent of its assets each year, rather than the more stringent 5 percent required of foundations.
ONCE the nest egg was diversified, the institute's professional money managers have been crucial in making sure that the institute can fund its philanthropic goals. The institute has also been making more of an effort in recent years to shed some of the secrecy of its past, not the least of which was agreeing to give a reporter a glimpse into how it manages the money.
Mr. Wolfe, who startled colleagues with enthusiastic comments about foreign markets just weeks into the job, seems comfortable with that effort at openness. At the same time, he has no intention of tampering with a formula that has enabled the institute to move ahead of other philanthropies in sheer size. Thus, he keeps the portfolio broadly diversified, devoting about 60 percent of it to equities, 30 percent to fixed-income securities and 10 percent to riskier ventures like venture-capital situations, corporate buyout funds and oil, timber and other partnerships.
That type of cautious asset allocation has paid off. For the six years 1988 through 1993, Hughes averaged gains of 12.9 percent on its mixed portfolio of stocks and bonds, handily surpassing its goal of five percentage points more than the inflation rate, or 9 percent. It even beat the 12.5 percent averaged in those years by balanced mutual funds tracked by Morningstar. This year, the Hughes portfolio eked out a five-tenths of 1 percent gain through Sept. 30, not bad when compared to the 1.9 percent lost by the balanced funds in the Morningstar group.
Far be it from Mr. Wolfe, however, to shun the adventure of a calculated plunge. "We do make bets," he said. "We tend to make micro-bets." By that, he means commitments to trends, industries and "things we understand," but not bets on market direction as a whole.
For instance, the institute for some time has favored capital equipment, technology and other companies involved in enlarging the nation's infrastructure while playing down the consumer sector. As a result, Hughes is overweighted in technology (14 percent vs. 8 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500 index), level in energy (11 percent) and severely underweighted in consumer stocks (6 percent vs. 12 percent).
What most distinguishes Mr. Wolfe is tight management and attention to detail, according to Wall Streeters who knew him during a 30-year career at I.B.M., where he climbed to chief investment officer in September 1993 and oversaw $36 billion of retirement money.
"Discipline is a big thing with me," said Mr. Wolfe, a graduate of M.I.T. and Harvard Business School who prides himself on being able to measure risks and root out the cause of variations in performance.
"He's from the old Harold Geneen school of keeping on top of every number," said Remi Browne, a managing director of Ark Asset Management in New York, referring to the legendary former chairman of the ITT Corporation. "He's a very fair but tough manager who at I.B.M. put a lot of needed quality-control structure in place."
For all the bouquets, Mr. Wolfe left his job at I.B.M. shortly after the new management team led by Louis V. Gerstner Jr., its new chief executive, arrived this spring and farmed out more pension funds to outside managers. Mr. Wolfe was eligible for retirement anyway, because of his age and tenure. So he retired after lining up the job at Hughes, where his do-it-yourself approach was quite at home.
The Hughes institute does employ a handful of outside managers to fill specialty niches, such as Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management in San Diego, and TCW Asset Management in Los Angeles. But 80 percent of the assets are handled in-house.
The biggest holding in the stock portfolio is still $650 million of the original General Motors Class H stock that the institute got when it sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985. The next biggest positions are the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, the AT&T Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association, which together account for about 4 percent of all stock holdings.
The rest of the stock portfolio is scattered across some 135 equities around the globe, stakes ranging in size from $4 million to $70 million. Hughes tends to hold stocks for about three years, one or two years longer than the typical institutional manager, according to Mr. Wolfe. And it shuns the increasingly fashionable game of stalking underperforming companies that are vulnerable to outside pressure or hostile takeovers. "We are not management activists," he said emphatically.
JUNK bonds, puts and calls, Eurodollar futures and other derivatives have a place in the Hughes portfolio but below-investment-grade bonds are limited to 5 percent of the fixed-income portion and derivatives are never leveraged.
Mr. Wolfe, who divides his time between Washington and Westport, Conn., won't discuss his pay, but his predecessor, Graham O. Harrison, earned $415,000 plus $92,732 in benefits the year before he retired, the institute's filing with the I.R.S. shows.
One constraint Mr. Wolfe labors under is the need to make sure that the institute has enough cash and liquid investments like Treasuries on hand to be able to carry out its philanthropic mission. Just to meet the statutory minimum of 3.5 percent, the institute awards about $275 million a year to some 275 clinical researchers -- $1 million apiece on average -- around the country.
In fact, the institute has been donating closer to 5 percent a year, the rate that foundations are obligated to give away each year, if a program of grants for science education is also included. Without the need to generate all that cash, Mr. Wolfe said he would probably take a bit more risk.
Notably, the stock portfolio is light on medical issues, and none of the major American drug companies are in the top 25 holdings. Indeed, there is little discussion of investment possibilities between its scientists, whose work is largely confined to basic research, and Hughes officials.
"We don't mix the investment policy up with what our investigators are doing," said Dr. Purnell W. Choppin, a former vice president of Rockefeller University who has been the Hughes president since 1987. Hughes does share royalties from patents and licenses resulting from research it sponsors.
Mr. Wolfe will have to wrestle with one big issue fairly soon: what to do with 15 million shares of G.M. Class H, which until the end of February can be bought back by the automaker at $37.50, about 10 percent above the current price, or sold back to the company by the institute at $30. If neither side exercises its option, Hughes would be free to trade them along with another 5 million unencumbered Class H shares sitting in its portfolio.
Mr. Wolfe and his chief deputy on stocks, Lillian H. Blucher, are giving no hint of their strategy for the shares. His two other deputies are Ellen B. Safir, who has day-to-day charge of the bond portfolio, and Nina Scherago, who runs private investments.
As for personal investments, Mr. Wolfe said he and his wife Lillian, an architect, have put most of their money into mutual funds and some closed-end investment companies devoted to single countries, especially Mexico, Thailand and China. (He generally avoids buying individual stocks because of possible conflicts of interest.) As a rule, he thinks the typical 25-year-old investor should be 100 percent invested in stocks, a 55-year-old about two-thirds invested in stocks and a 70-year-old about 25 percent invested in stocks.
Beyond that, he advises individual investors to invest regularly, be patient, and not to try to outsmart the market. "Above all," he insists, "diversify."

HEADLINE: A Patriotic Pitch: Honda Is American

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
FOR years, the Big Three auto companies and the United Automobile Workers have tried to make patriotism part of the car-buying mentality of Americans. As a marketing pitch, the effect of showroom jingoism has always been debatable -- so has its economic logic.
Still, the idea that driving a Chevy or a Chrysler is a patriotic act, while owning a Honda or a Toyota is not, clearly appealed to some. And in their lobbying efforts and in their advertising, Detroit has long argued that buying American-made cars is good for the American economy and that buying imported cars is bad. 
 To support this marketing doctrine, the Big Three and the auto workers' union helped write Federal legislation, which went into effect last month, requiring stickers to appear on all new vehicles stating the percentage of domestic and foreign parts used to make them. Detroit is hoping that the new domestic-content labeling will sway more consumers to buy American cars.
Maybe, but guess who's wrapping itself in the flag with its current marketing drive? The Honda Motor Company of Tokyo. Lately, Honda has been promoting its American links and its beneficial effects on the United States economy with new print and broadcast advertisements.
Painting itself red, white and blue is nothing new for Honda or any of the Japanese auto makers operating in America. But Honda's campaign is a redoubled effort, aggressively taking the offensive on an issue that could be seen as a weakness. Though Honda disputes the Government's method of calculation, the domestic-content sticker says that 50 percent of the Accord is made in America. By contrast, the domestic content on the Pontiac Sunfire, a comparable model, is rated at 90 percent.
"There's always a 'buy American' undertow in the market that we must contend with," said Eric Conn, a Honda senior manager for automotive advertising. "We do an awful lot in the United States, and we don't get credit for it."
Besides, Honda has a pretty strong argument to make. In addition to employing 14,000 workers at its manufacturing complex in Marysville, Ohio, its American headquarters in suburban Los Angeles and its dealerships, Honda just happens to be the nation's leading exporter of vehicles.
This counterintuitive fact is illustrated in a new television ad, produced by Honda's longtime agency, Rubin Postaer of Santa Monica, Calif., showing right-hand-drive and left-hand-drive cars rolling off the assembly line in Marysville.
"Why do we do this?" asks the narrator. The answer: Shots of Japan and other export destinations appear on screen. The bottom line: Honda helps reduce the trade deficit.
In a two-page advertisement in the October 31 issue of Sports Illustrated magazine, a Honda sedan ("manufactured in America since 1982," the ad states) appears with a series of other icons of American popular culture including a double decker burger ("cooked up in America since 1855"), a pair of cowboy boots ("handcrafted in America since 1868"), a baseball ("played in America since 1845").
The ad copy describes some automotive manufacturing techniques, followed by the sentences: "What it all adds up to is the Accord. An excellent example of American quality for the last twelve years."
By implying that the Accord is as American as baseball and burgers, the Honda ads make the argument that America's enormous trade deficit with Japan and the issue of competitiveness are not simple cases of white hats and black hats. The TV ads, along with traditional Honda product advertising, have been scheduled mainly during weekend and Monday night football games.
THE Nissan Motor Corporation, which builds cars and light trucks in Smyrna, Tenn., has refrained from advertising that draws attention to its American roots. Don Spetner, vice president of public relations for Nissan, said the auto maker decided instead to focus its advertising on "product launches, brand image and dealer support."
But Nissan has undertaken direct-mail and lobbying campaigns to counter "buy American." In one brochure, Nissan said, "Labeling requirements are not an accurate indicator of the actual content of vehicles." Therefore, "Nissan believes Congress must corrrect the glaring flaws" in the Labeling Act.

HEADLINE: Technology;
900,000 Striped Bass, and Not a Fishing Pole in Sight

BYLINE: By HUBERT B. HERRING 

DATELINE: TURNERS FALLS, Mass.

 BODY:
TO Josh Goldman, it's all very simple. On a display board, he draws one line, slanting upward -- that's the world demand for fish. Below that, a second line, slanting down -- the wild supply, steadily being depleted. The widening gap represents the fish the world will need from other sources. And for reasons he is eager to enumerate, he insists that traditional fish farming will be unable to fill that gap.
But Mr. Goldman says he has the solution, and with supreme confidence and the blinders of the true believer, he is out to prove it. 
 At age 31, Joshua N. Goldman has turned a passion born in his college days into a three-year-old venture called Aquafuture Inc. And it is here that he sees the future of fish farming -- or aquaculture, as it's called in this $28.4 billion global industry.
Aquafuture is closing in on selling a million pounds a year of hybrid striped bass, all raised in a single building here in western Massachusetts. As a private company, Aquafuture does not divulge financial data, though Mr. Goldman did say annual revenues exceed $2 million.
That is far larger than all but a few pond-based farms. But Mr. Goldman hopes to build plants 10 times the size around the nation.
Aquafuture now occupies a boxy 45,000-square-foot building (that's an acre-plus) in an industrial park, the bland facade giving no clue to what's inside -- an elaborate web of tanks and piping and electronics. And, oh yes, an awful lot of fish.
Those fish -- a hybrid of saltwater striped bass and freshwater white bass -- are spawned elsewhere, then brought here at two months of age. In the first tank, thousands of these "fingerlings" can be kept for up to nine months, their growth slowed by chilling the water, if the company wants them to mature later; here, striped bass are always in season.
They move on to ever-larger tanks, always monitored, graded, given more elbow room. They have an ever-faster current to swim against; it's their instinct to do this, and without it, Mr. Goldman says, their texture would be wrong. No slouches, by the time they do their last laps before becoming dinner, they log 20 miles a day. And they're far from lonely: cradle to fillet, the building houses 900,000 fish.
THE last stop is a "purge tank," where the fish are given no feed. Mr. Goldman says he can grow the fish to market size in nine months, half the normal time.
All is controlled and sanitary. A visitor entering a cavernous, tank-filled room follows Mr. Goldman's lead and dips his shoes in a pan of disinfectant. Up ahead, two orange-aproned men work under lights on a high platform, as if on a surgical stage set. On a table lies a pile of anesthetized 6-inch fish, and, needles flashing in a quick rhythm, the men vaccinate fish after fish -- between them, they say, 6,000 an hour.
From there, the fish plunge through a plastic pipe into a cold wake-up bath, electronically counted en route. All these safeguards, Mr. Goldman says, enable Aquafuture to reduce mortality to less than 15 percent, half the industry average.
The fish that make it, he insists, aren't tainted the way many wild fish are, taste better than other farm-raised fish -- and are produced with less environmental damage.
The need is clear. Relying on the wild supply is like "having a livestock industry based on hunting," said Mark Priest, president of the New York City chapter of Trout Unlimited, a conservation group.
So why not traditional fish farming, in either ponds or offshore cages? There are many environmental concerns, like the creation of faster-growing hybrids. When these escape, "we are genetically polluting the wild fish stock," said Rebecca Goldburg, senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund.
Such farms also consume large amounts of water -- at least 1,000 gallons for each pound of fish, Mr. Goldman said. "Even the best water resource in the world," he said, would eventually prove wanting.
And the water discharged, unless it's treated properly, is laden with fish feces and uneaten feed. "The public does not want another source of pollution," said Victor Mancebo, executive director of the Northeast Regional Aquaculture Center, which advises fish farmers.
Mr. Goldman says his system solves these problems. Because the fish are raised indoors, it would take a striped Houdini to find its way to the nearby Connecticut River. And no birds, bearing disease, can get in.
AQUAFUTURE uses a nearly closed system -- constantly recirculating and purifying the water -- and thus uses just 150 gallons to create a pound of fish. The water it does discharge, after treatment, exceeds numerous drinking-water standards, Massachusetts environmental officials say. The feces are given to farmers for fertilizer.
Also, Mr. Goldman said, traditional farms waste feed because, unable to count dead fish, "you're feeding an unknown inventory." So while ponds use 2.5 pounds of feed to produce a pound of fish, he said, Aquafuture needs just 1.4 pounds. By contrast, Mr. Goldman said chicken farming used 15 pounds of feed to produce a pound of chicken in 1925. Today, the ratio is 2 to 1.
Ms. Goldburg said she "was very impressed by the steps they've taken to create an environmentally sound" operation. And Mr. Mancebo called Aquafuture "a world-class attempt to fill a niche that is really pretty much vacant." Production costs may be high, he said, but as fish prices rise, "this will be successful."
Mr. Mancebo estimates that in 1991, the United States accounted for just $636 million, or 2.2 percent, of the world aquaculture industry, which in turn accounts for roughly 12 percent of the world fish harvest. He said that China, which farmed fish 5,000 years ago, has more than 90 percent of world aquaculture production, but that indoor Chinese systems are mainly hatcheries.
As for Mr. Goldman's fish, the proof is in the eating. Arthur Kloack, director of seafood processing for the big Boston restaurant chain Legal Seafoods, said Aquafuture's fish -- he buys as much as 3,000 pounds a week of it -- is "cleaner and more consistent on quality" than much of the fish he buys. "The feedback from customers is tremendous," he said. The fish are sold from New York to Toronto, at $2.25 to $3 a pound, with some sold live to Asian buyers.
The idea was born at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., where Mr. Goldman took part in a fish-breeding project involving 30 students over two years. After graduating in 1986, he co-founded a company called Bioshelters to put his theories to the test. But he and his co-founder, John Reid, differed on goals, and a year later he left.
Mr. Reid, still Bioshelters' president, says he favored a less-risky approach, that he wanted to move slowly. He still considers Mr. Goldman a good friend, but says that his former partner fell prey to a bit of the "techno-arrogance common in aquaculture circles," that he "wanted to get big fast."
Mr. Goldman's response: "At a certain point you have to confront the realities of scaling up. I think we've met that challenge."
BIOSHELTERS breeds tilapia, a tropical fish that Mr. Reid says is less costly to raise. It is also a much smaller operation, though Bioshelters too is expanding. There are only a few operations around the country on Aquafuture's scale, mainly raising tilapia.
One approach elsewhere is to combine raising fish with growing hydroponic vegetables with the nutrients in the water, but Mr. Goldman said he had tried this and decided it was "dragging down" the operation.
When Mr. Goldman moved on, he started a research operation, going three years without pay. (He started drawing a salary three years ago, just in time: he is now married, with two sons aged 2 1/2 and 3 months.)
Convinced that Mr. Goldman was onto something, a Hampshire classmate, Artemis Joukowsky 3d, was there with the seed money.
Backed by his family's insurance fortune, Mr. Joukowsky had provided financing for Mr. Goldman all along, believing in his "total focus" on his goal. In January 1990, through his venture fund, HFG Expansion Fund One, he enabled Mr. Goldman to break ground on Aquafuture's current home. The fund has now put $4.5 million into Aquafuture, much of it from Mr. Joukowsky's family.
The partners soon felt the need for a seasoned manager, and in 1992 they brought in Charles S. Olcott, a former president of Burger King, as chairman and chief executive; Mr. Goldman is president.
They make a slightly odd couple -- Mr. Olcott, at 47, a hearty veteran of the rough-and-tumble corporate world outside, and Mr. Goldman, a generation younger, a slim, dark-haired man with the air of a sober, slightly distracted graduate student.
What next? Mr. Olcott says the company is on the verge of being profitable. The partners have no plans to go public, but say they are close to getting more venture capital. And just last month, Aquafuture received a $654,000 grant from the National Marine Fisheries Service for a project to raise flounder.
Mr. Goldman foresees true economies of scale in expansion, with his only reservation being finding committed people to run the plants. "People here have been part of creating the process," he said.
For now, Mr. Goldman's research continues into creating new hybrids. Does he have any qualms about this genetic tinkering with nature? "We're merely doing what every good farmer's done since the dawn of agriculture," he says quickly.

HEADLINE: At Work;
Still In the Dark on Diversity

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble 

 BODY:
THOSE whose business it is to ride up in the crow's nest of life, scanning the trend horizons, say there are few instances of a single piece of work having as fast and pervasive an impact as the Hudson Institute's "Work Force 2000: Work and Workers for the 21st Century."
The 1987 report projected an increasingly diverse American labor force, that is one increasingly composed of women, members of minority groups and other alternatives to the traditional white, male breadwinner. A certain number of forward-looking companies immediately grasped the implications of employing a work force that might -- but might not -- arrive at the office sharing the same social and cultural assumptions. Diversity, the consulting specialty, was born. 
 Diversity could, of course, cause confusion, but handled properly could also be turned into a tool to open up markets, improve profitability and allow companies to compete globally. It seemed hard to find a company that had not jumped on the diversity bandwagon.
Time for a reality check, according to a benchmark study released last month by researchers in New York. Business, says the report, "Corporate Responses to Diversity," has actually responded "passively" to what many would say are the economic opportunities presented by diversity.
Awareness of diversity issues is high at the 300-plus companies in the New York metropolitan area that responded to the survey because their own employees have grown more diverse. But most of the companies indicate they are doing what is necessary to comply with government employment law and little more. For the most part they have not taken the step beyond what would move diversity out of a pigeon hole in the personnel department and into the strategic center of the corporate environment.
"Companies have diversity, but they don't do anything with it to make it work for them," said Joanne Miller, the study's director and interim head of the Center for the New American Workforce at Queens College. "They don't think in terms of productivity."
What companies do think in terms of, Dr. Miller said, is compliance with affirmative action guidelines and disability law. Nearly 90 percent of the surveyed companies have established programs for groups identified as having "distinct needs," all but two of them mandated by government. Of the eight groups typically targeted by company programs, only part-time and skill-deficient employees are not covered by some type of government mandate.
A diversity program, in the eyes of the company, Dr. Miller said, may be anything from a family leave policy to a company-wide posting of a promotion opportunity. That in itself is troubling, because it suggests diversity has become an omnibus category so broad it may be meaningless. Indeed, Dr. Miller and her colleagues were surprised to find, when they began exploring the diversity question, that companies have little information on diversity policies at other companies.
Most experts would say diversity is no longer simply about recruiting mere numbers of, say, African-American or female employees and keeping them moving along the company pipeline, although the latter especially is by no means a non-problem. Diversity is taking people from different backgrounds, with different expectations and at different stages of life and melding them into a force that will drive the company's profitability and competitiveness.
MOST companies deal with post-affirmative action diversity only when they try to switch from a hierarchical management mode to some version of employee empowerment, in which workers are expected to work together in teams. They often find the switch daunting, in part because they have not prepared employees for the kind of communication and cooperation required of teams. The company brings in consultants, sends employees on retreats, gives them therapy -- and yet the teams don't jell.
In a genuinely diverse work force, employees may worry about extending trust to colleagues who appear not to be like them. "What do you do when you think another person's interests are not your own?" Dr. Miller asked. "When you worry someone won't behave as you would, you don't use them in the same way."
It may be little wonder that companies are reluctant to tackle the conundrum of difference, which, after all, roils many sectors of American society far beyond the boundaries of business. On the other hand, as Dr. Miller pointed out, sociologists regard the work place as a microcosm of society, which suggests however much executives may hope diversity will blow over and become last week's management revolution, it is not likely to happen.
The reluctance of business to confront diversity in the New York area, one of the most diverse in the country, is especially disturbing, Dr. Miller contended. "If it's not happening in New York," she said, "it's probably not happening anywhere."

To the Editor:
Apart from their flawed economic logic, John Cavanagh and Sarah Anderson have employed questionable arithmetic in contending that International Monetary Fund and World Bank adjustment loans to developing countries have reduced United States exports by $1 billion a year ("For U.S., Aid Banks Aren't Too Helpful," Viewpoints, Oct. 2). 
 Their mistake is to assume that if the loans and the policy reforms had not been made, United States exports to these countries would have continued at the same pace as in the years before the loans.
This assumption is absurd. The countries in question had been spending beyond their means. Their deficits were unsustainable. Their import levels were likewise unsustainable, having been financed by a rundown of international reserves or by foreign borrowing that was rapidly drying up. They had to reduce their imports. There was no money left to continue buying -- from the United States or anywhere else. And without significant reforms, no one was going to lend these countries any more money.
Anyone whose economic knowledge is sophisticated enough to understand that things cost money can see the problem with Mr. Cavanagh and Ms. Anderson's analysis.
As to their arithmetic, one flaw is that Mr. Cavanagh and Ms. Anderson have left Mexico and Argentina out of their calculations. Both have been recipients of World Bank and I.M.F. adjustment loans, and both are significant markets for American exports. Recalculating, using their method but including Mexico and Argentina, shows that World Bank-I.M.F. adjustment lending increased United States exports by $8 billion a year and provided 162,000 new jobs in the United States.
It is easy to see then how the writers reached their conclusion: they fudged the economics and they fudged the arithmetic.
In the last decade, about a quarter of the World Bank's loans have been adjustment loans. Several decades of success in Southeast Asia and a decade of success in Latin America attest to the economic sense of such adjustments. Because of such success, adjustment lending is declining -- it was 12 percent of World Bank lending in fiscal 1994.
Though increasing the exports of donor countries is not the primary objective of World Bank lending, it should be obvious that prosperous countries will import more than stagnating ones. In fiscal 1994, United States companies earned $970 million from contracts from World Bank-financed projects. Over the 50-year history of the bank, United States companies have received back $1.10 for each $1 of paid-in capital and International Development Agency contributions that Washington has invested in the World Bank.

HEADLINE: A Hot Investment Entices, But It's Not Always Wise

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Do you pay too much in taxes?
You bet. 
 Do you invest in mutual funds?
Yessir.
What would you say if I told you about mutual funds that grow tax-free -- and you don't have to pay a commission to buy?
Sign me up.
That pitch is being repeated millions of times a year, all across the country, as brokers, insurance agents and financial planners sell Americans on a hot investment product with a long, boring name: variable deferred annuities.
And the hard sell is working -- this year, people are expected to pour more than $55 billion into these investments, which blend mutual funds with a little life insurance to qualify for Federal tax breaks. That roughly equals the net investments so far this year in American stock and bond mutual funds, and is up from less than $10 billion five years ago.
But along with raising money, today's sales are raising concerns among financial watchdogs and advisers. Because while this hot investment may be a winner for a small group of people, it may not be a great deal for many buyers who may be better off in simpler, less restrictive investments with lower annual fees. And buyers will probably not find that out for years -- if ever.
For most people, a variable annuity is not a wise choice, said Robert Markman, president of Markman Capital Management in Minneapolis, who refuses to sell such investments. Nonetheless, he said, "it sounds great when it's being pitched to you over the phone at dinner time."
No one is suggesting that investors are being defrauded or predicting an investment debacle. But regulators, who are starting to receive complaints from people who have bought these investments, worry about the future.
"I feel very strongly in my gut that this is the next big problem," said Debra M. Bollinger, director of the South Dakota Division of Securities. "People don't know what they are buying."
Variable annuities are basically a group of mutual funds from which investors can pick and choose, wrapped inside a very small insurance policy. Generally, the policy guarantees that investors willing to pay a big annual fee can be sure that if they meet an untimely death, their heirs will get back at least the amount originally invested.
That little insurance policy brings with it another big benefit: investors do not have to pay taxes on their investment gains until they start spending the money, so long as they do not begin making withdrawals before they reach age 59 1/2. So money that will eventually go for taxes remains in the mutual fund to earn interest in the meantime. That appeals even to people who expect to remain in the same tax bracket once they retire; it is even more attractive to those who expect their tax rates to fall.
 
 
Insurance Policy With Yearly Charges
 But that insurance has big drawbacks, too, chiefly large annual charges for the policy, which can be more than $310 a year for a $25,000 investment. Those costs can wipe out the benefits of tax deferral unless the buyer holds on to the variable annuity for 15 or 20 years -- a very long time for the average investor. It takes sizzling investment gains -- the kinds made by extremely aggressive investors in very strong markets -- to overcome the handicap of the expenses.
Most insurance companies impose steep penalties on investors who take their money out within seven years, and investors who need their money before they reach age 59 1/2 must pay a 10 percent tax penalty along with the Federal Government's regular bite.
Financial planners say that variable annuities can be good investments for a small group of people: those who pay a lot of taxes; and have already put all the money they can into their other retirement plans; and have a lot of extra income; and are sure they will not need that money for a very long time, certainly not until they retire; and are aggressive, successful investors, and plan to withdraw the money very slowly.
But this leaves a lot of people for whom variable annuities are a bad investment: those who are too old to leave the money locked up for a decade or two; those who are too young to be sure they will not need cash to pay college tuitions or mortgage bills; those whose tax brackets are too low (or even too high), and those who are cautious or just average investors (and who, investment advisers note, tend to be the ones most attracted to the insurance guarantee).
"That's typical of what happens when the insurance industry comes up with a great idea -- they intended something for specific people, but on the agent level, they sell it to everybody," said James A. Shambo, a Colorado accountant who heads the personal financial planning division of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
 
The Seductive Vision Of Avoiding Taxes
 The sheer complexity of these products may make them a bad choice for many investors. One sign that Americans do not really understand the pros and cons of variable annuities is that many are sold to people for individual retirement accounts and the retirement savings accounts known as 401(k)'s and 403(b)'s, which are already sheltered from taxes. So these buyers may be paying a big price for a benefit they already have.
If variable annuities are bad bets for so many people, why are Americans suddenly snapping them up? Tax avoidance, said Laura Pantaleo, first vice president of Smith Barney Shearson, the big brokerage firm. Avoiding taxes has become harder in recent years as Congress has eliminated most tax shelters, limited contributions to retirement savings plans and even tightened the rules on tax-free municipal bonds.
Sales of variable annuities have become big business for large insurers like the Equitable Life Assurance Society and Prudential Insurance, and more are getting into the act every day. Meanwhile, many mutual fund companies, like Franklin Resources, have teamed up with insurers, while others, like Fidelity Investments, have started their own insurance units so that they, too, can offer variable annuities. And banks are becoming big sellers, too.
Insurance companies, which every year charge fees based on the amount in the variable annuity, like the fact that these investments -- and thus the fees -- are likely to remain around for a long time. Investors can move their annuity accounts from one firm to another, but they must fill out special tax forms, which many find daunting. And some salespeople like the fact that the insurance company pays them a relatively fat commission, perhaps as much as 6 percent of the investment, at a time when commissions on regular mutual funds have been falling (they generally range from 1 to 4.5 percent up front, with perhaps an annual fee as well).
 Insurance and investment executives say their firms make every effort to explain variable annuities and sell them only to people who will benefit. "I would never put a person in a variable annuity if they themselves didn't completely understand the reason for the product and the restrictions," said Ted M. Beal, the Equitable district manager in New Jersey.
 
Picture Is Rosy For Some Investors
 For the right person, in the right financial circumstances, with the right investment results, variable annuities may turn out to be wise investments.
Glenn S. Daily, an independent insurance consultant in New York, compared investments in variable annuities with those in similar mutual funds. In his model, the mutual funds had annual costs of 1.3 percent of assets, and the variable annuity had annual costs of 2 percent; both are slightly higher than the average, according to Morningstar Inc., a Chicago research firm.
 In the best case for the variable annuity, an investor whose combined state and Federal taxes put him in the 35 percent bracket -- a high rate, but not the highest -- invests $25,000 in a variable annuity's mutual fund that earns 12 percent a year before expenses. If the investor holds onto it for 20 years he would end up with $117,048, Mr. Daily found. But if the same investor put the same amount directly into a mutual fund, received the same return and paid taxes every year he would end up with considerably less: $103,798.
Of course, in the real world an average investment gain masks a lot of ups and downs: in some years the market goes up more, in some years it goes up less, in some years it falls. Using a statistical model that insurance actuaries use to simulate real returns, Mr. Daily found that this investor had almost a 75 percent chance of doing better in the variable annuity than in the mutual fund.
In fact, this investor could improve his financial picture if he were willing to withdraw the money from the variable annuity very slowly, which allows the money to grow longer without being taxed. He could also help himself if he were willing to use those investment proceeds at retirement to obtain a traditional annuity, an insurance product that pays income for life and also provides tax benefits. The proceeds of the variable annuity would then provide annual income of $13,158 a year, compared with $9,741 a year from the annuity bought with the mutual fund proceeds. Unfortunately, very few variable annuity holders -- probably fewer than 20 percent -- choose to do this.
 
 
The Payoff Comes Only With Patience
 There are a lot of ways this nice picture can go awry.
One obvious problem is that few Americans seem prepared to stay in the same investment for decades, so that there is enough time for the benefits of tax deferral to overcome the costs. Variable annuities have not been around long enough for anyone to know if their buyers will hold on for many years, but if investor behavior holds true to form, many people will not have such patience. For example, in stock mutual funds, investors take out about half of the money they put in each year.
In Mr. Daily's example, an investor who locks up his $25,000 for 10 years but then takes it out would be worse off in a variable annuity than in a regular mutual fund, getting back $50,613, compared with $50,774. That $161 difference may not seem like much, but investors in variable annuities have given up a lot of flexibility, because they cannot use the money to buy a house or a car or invest in gold or real estate or move the money to a better investment manager (unless that manager happens to run a variable annuity, too). And if the investors are not about to turn 60, they also face a big tax penalty.
And the results could well turn out worse -- Mr. Daily's actuarial analysis shows that over 10 years, an investor has a 75 percent chance of doing worse in a variable annuity than in a mutual fund.
Then there is the fact that few if any investors will be able to achieve 12 percent gains every year for two decades. The average annual gain for the stock market since 1928 has been about 10 percent; at that level of return, an investor has to hold on to a variable annuity for 15 years before it begins to match the mutual fund's after-tax results.
 
 
Picking Investments With Low Returns
 Even a 10 percent gain may be too rosy an assumption, because many annuity buyers are too conservative -- or too scared -- to invest only in stocks. Many choose money-market funds or low-yielding fixed-rate accounts that barely beat inflation.
The most popular new investment options for variable annuity investors are asset-allocation funds and balanced funds, which mix stocks and bonds, said Geoff Bobroff, a consultant in East Greenwich, R.I. Such funds historically have lower returns than regular stock funds.
With an 8 percent return, one that might be more typical of a balanced fund, an investor in a variable annuity would have almost $1,100 less after 10 years than in a similar mutual fund, because of the high annual costs. Even after 20 years, he would be just barely ahead in the variable annuity -- and Mr. Daily calculates that there is more than a 50 percent chance that he would be doing worse.
For people in the very highest tax brackets, there is still another potential drawback: profits from variable annuities are taxed as ordinary income, instead of as capital gains. This means an investor who might pay Federal taxes of 28 percent on mutual fund gains could end up paying 36 percent or more on the profits from a variable annuity.
 
Regular Insurance Is Called Cheaper
 Despite the high costs, insurance executives argue that because of the death benefit, variable annuities are good for people who are scared of investing in stocks. "People may know that to hedge against inflation they should put money into equities, but a husband will say, 'If I do this and something happens to the market, when I die my wife will complain about me forever,' " said Rodney R. Rohda, chairman of Fidelity Investments' insurance company. Once the guaranteed death benefit is explained, he added, "You can see the tension leave the guy's face."
That person should just buy more life insurance, many financial advisers say; it would be a lot cheaper. Furthermore, if he really is investing in stocks for the long haul, his chances of losing money are small; Ibbotson Associates of Chicago notes that there has been no 20-year period since 1926 in which investors would have suffered a loss by investing in the stocks included in the Standard & Poor's 500 index.
Regulators, who are understaffed and overwhelmed by other investment problems, can only hope that investors do value the death benefit and that they understand what they have bought. As Barry Barbash, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's investment management division, put it, "Variable annuities shouldn't be viewed as just another way to buy mutual funds -- because people are paying a lot."


GRAPHIC: The people who sell variable deferred annuities often use payout statistics based on rosy assumptions about long-term rates of return and emphasize the annuities' favorable tax treatment. But unless investors stick with them for a long time, their high costs make variable annuities a lackluster choice even after taxes are considered, especially if returns turn out to be not so rosy.

HEADLINE: In Poignant Public Letter, Reagan Reveals That He Has Alzheimer's

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Former President Ronald Reagan said today that he had entered the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, an incurable brain ailment that steadily destroys memory and eventually leads to death.
In a handwritten letter to the American people, the 83-year-old Mr. Reagan said he was in good health now, and while he maintained a positive tone, he did strike a fatalistic note. 
 "I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life," Mr. Reagan wrote. "I know that for America there will always be a bright dawn ahead." [Text of the letter, page 47.]
Mr. Reagan's letter, issued by his office in Los Angeles, was accompanied by a statement from his doctors, who explained that the disease was diagnosed through repeated observations and testing for a year.
"Over the past 12 months we began to notice from President Reagan's test results symptoms indicating the possibility of early-stage Alzheimer's disease," the doctors wrote. "Additional testing and an extensive observation over the past few weeks have led us to conclude that President Reagan is entering the early stages of this disease."
The doctors said that Mr. Reagan's current health was good, but "it is expected that as the years go on it will begin to deteriorate."
Alzheimer's disease is an incurable neurological disorder, which affects communication between brain cells and, ultimately, causes the cells to die.
The disease leads to memory loss, which can produce disorientation, difficulty in speaking and personality disorders. It afflicts about four million people in the United States. Most victims are older than 65.
At a Democratic rally in Alameda, Calif., this afternoon, President Clinton asked the crowd to put its partisanship aside and wish Mr. Reagan well, and then he passed on the news that Mr. Reagan was suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
Mr. Clinton recalled a visit with Mr. Reagan shortly after his own election and said there had come a point when the former President stopped and said he had forgotten what he was going to say.
"When he said that, it touched my heart in a particular way," Mr. Clinton said.
While he was the President, Mr. Reagan had a relaxed leadership style and was know for occasionally becoming disengaged and bored during White House meetings. His associates said that in recent months he had changed markedly and that he was failing to recognize people he had known. Some longtime friends of Mr. Reagan said tonight that the former President's memory had begun to slip noticeably for two years.
"You could tell that he had it as early as, say, two years ago," said an associate who spent considerable time with the former President in recent years. "He was having a definite memory problem, and he'd say time and again, 'I just can't remember.'
"He talked at times about his memory problems," said the associate, who spoke only on the condition that he not be publicly identified. "He even mentioned that his mother had died of Alzheimer's, and he wondered whether he might have inherited it. But then he'd go on in his usual breezy manner and that would be the end of the discussion."
The oldest man ever to serve as President, Mr. Reagan said when he was elected in 1980 at age 69 that he would have the White House physician test him periodically and that he would resign if serious evidence of senility or mental deterioration were detected.
"If I were President and had any feeling at all that my capabilities had been reduced before a second term came," he said at the time, "I would walk away. By the same token, I would step down also."
He was elected by overwhelming margins in 1980 and 1984, touting his program to cut taxes, strengthen the military and reduce the deficit.
On foreign policy, Mr. Reagan was more pragmatic than his cold war talk suggested. But his supply-side economics led to soaring deficits.
During his final year in office, he was politically hobbled by the Iran-contra scandal. But while the Iran-contra affair claimed many victims, Mr. Reagan's popularity was relatively unscathed.
During office, he survived an assassination attempt in which he was shot in the chest. He has also been operated on to a remove cancerous polypfrom his colon and has had prostate surgery.
After retiring, Mr. Reagan remained physically vigorous. In 1989, hesurgeons removed fluid from his brain, apparently the result of his having been thrown from a horse.
One associate speculated that Mr. Reagan's family decided to issue a public announcement today because his behavior was becoming too difficult to ignore. Even so, many old friends were shocked.
"It catches me totally by surprise," said Fred F. Fielding, who was Counsel to the President from 1981 to 1986.
Sheila Tate, who served as Mrs. Reagan's press secretary, fought back tears tonight. "The letter was quite emotional," she said. "But it was so like Ronald Reagan to do something like this -- so gracefully."
Ms. Tate said that she had spoken at length with the former First Lady earlier this week but that Mrs. Reagan had provided no clue that she was under any special strain. "She was in good humor," Ms. Tate said. "We talked about everything, from politics to politics."
In his two-page letter, Mr. Reagan said he had decided to make his condition known to raise public awareness of Alzheimer's disease after discussion with his wife.
"I have recently been told that I am one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease," Mr. Reagan wrote in his hand-written letter, which was faxed to news organizations. "Upon learning this news, Nancy and I had to decide whether as private citizens we would keep this as a private matter or whether we would make this news known in a public way.
"In opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater awareness of this condition. Perhaps it will encourage a clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are affected by it."
Mr. Reagan said he felt "just fine" and planned to spend his time with his wife and family and to enjoy the outdoors in California.
He thanked the American people for electing him.
His letter was written in a steady hand, his writing marred only when he speculated about his death. In that passage, Mr. Reagan crossed out two words and then continued his phrase.
"When the Lord calls me home, whenever that may be, I will leave with the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal optimism for the future," he wrote. "I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life. I know that for American there will always be a bright dawn ahead."
At the Democratic rally, Mr. Clinton, recalled Mr. Reagan's sense of optimism.
"We disagreed on a lot of things over the years," the President said of his predecessor. "But he always fought with a sense of optimism and spirit."
Mr. Clinton said he was particularly grateful for Mr. Reagan's support in the last year for the North American Free Trade Agreement, the ban on assault weapons and for criticizing Oliver L. North in the Virginia Senate campaign.
"I want every one of you in this room to give Ronald Reagan a hand and wish him well and goodness," Mr. Clinton said.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE SENATE;
CONTROL IN SENATE NEAR G.O.P. GRASP AS RACES WIND UP

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
One of the closest, nastiest and perhaps most consequential off-year set of Senate campaigns in decades is clattering to an end in the same volatile climate of voter unrest, partisan invective and incumbent anxiety with which it began.
After months of state-by-state drama punctuated by increasingly mean and shallow advertisements, and after a record-breaking total of more than $200 million in Senate campaign spending, the central question remains: Can Republicans pick up the seven seats they need to control the chamber? 
 And the answer is no easier to come by than it was when Congress adjourned in October after a display of legislative bickering and gridlock that left much of the public disgusted.
Both sides agree that the goal is within the Republicans' grasp, and with it the chance to thwart President Clinton's legislative agenda for the next two years and alter the political balance heading into the next Presidential election cycle.
But with polls showing at least half a dozen races still too close to call, the outcome will hinge on whether Democrats, in the next three days, can counter what now appears to be a significant advantage in turnout for Republicans.
In state after state, Democratic stars once thought virtually immune from serious challenge this year -- from Edward M. Kennedy in Massachusetts to Harris Wofford in Pennsylvania to Jim Sasser in Tennessee and on to Dianne Feinstein in California -- have had to fight for their political lives.
With each party constantly checking its polls to see where national leaders could do the most good on the stump, the frenetic campaigning continued today.
After stumping in California today, Mr. Clinton planned to return to Minnesota on Sunday for his second stop there in three days, hoping to give a boost to Ann Wynia, who is in a neck-and-neck race for a Senate seat.
Vice President Al Gore was back in his home state, Tennessee, trying to give a lift to the flagging campaigns of the two Democratic senatorial candidates there.
And after campaigning in Minnesota, the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, returned to the capital today and declared in his response to Mr. Clinton's weekly radio address that Democrats were "in a state of near panic."
Despite the Democrats' early campaign predictions that the continued growth of the economy would be the overriding issue, it fell flat on the campaign trail this fall, as did moves by Democrats to seize on other public concerns, like welfare and health care.
Instead, campaigns across the country featured broad attacks, by incumbents and challengers alike, against government itself. If they were not flailing at government, the candidates were bitterly ridiculing one another's character, and often distorting opponents' records, in 30-second bursts of paid television time.
When they did turn to issues, the language of both parties was decidedly conservative, with candidates battling in particular to look toughest against criminals.
Republicans in the Senate have already proved a formidable stumbling block to Clinton-proposed legislation. And if they take their first control there since 1986, thus assuming leadership of the Senate's committees, they will be in a position to derail the President's legislative program entirely. Whatever legislation did pass would likely be pushed to the right, not only because of the change in party control but also because many Republican candidates are more conservative than the Republicans who are leaving the Senate.
Republican dominance in the Senate would also influence the politics of the 1996 Presidential campaign.
Consoling themselves in anticipation of bad news, some Democrats even argue that Mr. Clinton might benefit from losing the Senate because he could then campaign against the Republicans in the tradition of President Harry S. Truman's 1948 crusade against the "do-nothing 80th Congress."
But Republican control would energize the Senate Republican leader, Mr. Dole, who is considering a run for the White House, as well as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, who is already putting a 1996 campaign structure in place.
Most polls show that in their quest for seven more seats, the Republicans are likely to pick up Democratic seats in Ohio, Maine, Tennessee and Arizona. The question is whether they can win three other seats now held by Democrats without losing any now held by Republicans.
That is possible, if by no means certain. Polls show that Democratic seats in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Oklahoma and Virginia, and a second one in Tennessee, could go either way. And Democratic seats in California and New Mexico are not completely safe either.
In contrast, the only Republican seat that polls show could be in real jeopardy is in Minnesota, where Senator Dave Durenberger is retiring, although two other Republicans -- Senators James M. Jeffords of Vermont and Slade Gorton of Washington -- are in tight races.
"One poll has us 10 points down; our own poll has us a little ahead," said Mr. Wofford, the Pennsylvania Democrat who won in an upset two years ago and now finds himself in one of the tightest races, against Representative Rick Santorum. "I'm in the eye of the storm, and I feel it's the Battle of Gettysburg."
One possibility, less talked about than a Republican takeover, is that the elections will produce a Senate of 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans for the first time in a century. In that case, Vice President Gore, in his role as President of the Senate, might frequently cast tie-breaking votes. There is also the chance that Senator Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Democrat who often votes with the Republicans, would be enticed to switch parties.
It was not supposed to end up this way. Senator Bob Graham of Florida, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, sounded perfectly reasonable seven months ago when he asserted that "there's no single factor that is as significant in 1994 as the state of the economy."
But although the economy continued to improve, few voters gave the Democrats any credit. Meanwhile, the Republicans' success at blocking legislation like that on health care seemed to neither help nor hurt them.
In this season of the campaigning outsider, ignorance in the ways of Washington was championed. Incumbents did not dare include the image of the Capitol dome in their advertisements; challengers used photographs of the dome with relish, lampooning good-for-nothing insiders, and boasted of political naivete.
"I worked in the Senate as a young college student in 1963, when it was an enormously revered institution and Ted Kennedy was lean, young and attractive," said Thomas Cronin, a political scientist who is president of Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash. "But there has been a massive sea change where the burden is on the members of the Senate to defend themselves. The high water mark is this year."
With 16 Democratic incumbents and only 10 Republican incumbents running, it is the Democrats who seem to be paying the price for the discontent with Washington. And Republicans have had another advantage: their relentless linking of Democratic opponents with the unpopular President.
Republican challengers whom the Democrats did not initially view as serious threats have become the candidates to beat. There is Fred Dalton Thompson, a lawyer and movie actor in Tennessee; William Frist, a heart and lung surgeon, also in Tennessee, who did not register to vote until 1988, and, of course, Oliver L. North of Virginia and the Iran-contra affair.
"Once again, we are proving that whatever you say a year out is likely to be wrong," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. "People seen as safe a year ago, like Sasser and Feinstein, are having trouble; people who were very endangered, like Frank Lautenberg, are doing relatively better."
The roots of the Democrats' predicament date from early this year -- long before the talk of ousting incumbents reached a fever pitch -- when the party failed to persuade some of its strongest potential candidates, like former Gov. James Blanchard of Michigan, to run for the Senate.
In addition, there were the unexpected retirements. First, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, announced that he would be leaving; his seat is widely expected to turn Republican. Then Senator David L. Boren of Oklahoma announced that he too would retire, two years before the end of his term, to become president of the University of Oklahoma; his seat could go either way.

HEADLINE: Political Turmoil Distracts Poland as NATO Decisions Loom

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WARSAW, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Poland's increasingly chaotic political situation is more confused than ever these days.
Embarrassing the Government at an important juncture in its foreign policy, Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski announced last week that he would resign because his reputation had been impugned by a fellow Cabinet member. 
 He soon changed his mind, saying that he would stay for now, but the damage was already done.
"The consequences won't be good," said Krzystztof Skubiszewski, a former Foreign Minister.
"In the eyes of international public opinion, the picture of Poland is changing for the worse for a number of reasons," he said, alluding to the Government's uncertainty over how strongly Poland should push to join NATO, and the Prime Minister's slowing of the privatization of state enterprises.
The uncertainty over Mr. Olechowski's future developed just as Washington announced a more aggressive policy toward welcoming former Soviet-bloc countries into the NATO alliance.
The country's relations with Russia are also taking a turn for the worse.
The Russian Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, suddenly postponed a visit to Warsaw this week, saying that the Polish Government had failed to apologize for an incident in which Polish police beat some Russians at a Warsaw rail station. The cancellation was seen here as a way of showing opposition to Poland's efforts to join NATO.
Mr. Olechowski resigned after he found his name on a list released last week of 68 Government officials who had broken a little-known law forbidding them to draw salaries for second jobs outside the Government.
An economist who worked at the World Bank and served on the boards of several Western corporations, Mr. Olechowski chaired the supervisory board of the state-owned Bank Handlowy, one of Poland's largest banks. Under Polish law, Government officials are permitted to represent the Government on the boards of nationalized companies but are not allowed to accept pay. Few knew of the law and it contains no penalties.
"The fact is that nobody has ever heard of the act, never mind observed it," Mr. Olechowski said last week when he announced his resignation. "The prosecutor general, with the Prime Minister's knowledge, challenged my honesty."
A few days later, Mr. Olechowski apparently sensed that the Justice Minister, Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, who is also known as the prosecutor general and was a prominent figure in the former Communist Party, had found little support in the Government for the so-called anti-corruption campaign. The Foreign Minister said that he would suspend his resignation until a constitutional tribunal ruled and that he would leave if there was no ruling by year's end.
In what many here see as a more serious of conflict of interest, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak traveled in an airplane provided by General Motors and Ameritech when he visited the United States recently. Both companies do business in Poland.
The fuss over Mr. Olechowski briefly overshadowed the intense squabbling between President Lech Walesa and Mr. Pawlak's Government, which is a coalition of parties rooted in the Communist past.
"If I had the power I would have dismissed this government a long time ago," said Mr. Walesa, who is seeking re-election. This was Mr. Walesa's tit-for-tat against the Parliament, which had passed a motion accusing Mr. Walesa of "destabilizing" the country.

HEADLINE: Report Says Group Long Had Deficits

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
The financial crisis that led the N.A.A.C.P. to furlough most of its employees last week is part of a longstanding pattern of unusual financial practices and cash flow problems, according to sworn statements by two officers, a newspaper reported today.
Depositions given in September by the civil rights group's treasurer and chairman indicated that the organization routinely operated in the red and had a "liquid asset deficit" of $500,000 when Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. became its executive director in April 1993, The Washington Post reported. The depositions by the treasurer, Jerry L. Maulden, and the chairmain, William F. Gibson, were given in connection with a wrongful dismissal suit filed by Mr. Chavis. 
 National leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People have contended that Mr. Chavis alone created the organization's current $3.8 million deficit. They said Mr. Chavis's financial mismanagement contributed to his dismissal in August. But the depositions suggest that the financial troubles may have dated to the term of his predecessor, Benjamin L. Hooks, The Post said. Mr. Hooks has said there was no deficit when he retired.
Mr. Chavis, Mr. Hooks and Mr. Gibson could not be reached for comment today.
The auditing firm of Price Waterhouse has been working with the N.A.A.C.P. to sort out its tangled finances.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: Massachusetts
The Last Weekend: Senate Races Where the Battle Has Been Intense;
Romney Eclectic In Final Sprint

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
Mitt Romney, the Republican venture capitalist who wants to replace Senator Edward M. Kennedy, is down in the polls as the election campaign nears the wire. So he is borrowing a tactic or two from Presidential races of recent and not-so-recent memory.
Taking a page from the Ross Perot scrapbook, Mr. Romney went on television Friday night with the first broadcast of a new half-hour commercial. Then, appropriating an old Harry S. Truman trademark, the Romney campaign pulled out of North Station here this afternoon on a whistle-stop train tour. And Mr. Romney plans to spend Sunday campaigning through the state by bus, reminiscent of the Clinton-Gore caravans of 1992. 
 Mr. Romney is even using an old Kennedy strategy, enlisting the help of a family dynasty. Dozens of Romneys are hitting the campaign trail in these last days, led by the candidate's 87-year-old father, former Gov. George Romney of Michigan. There were 68 members of the Romney family on the whistle-stop tour this afternoon, wearing sweatshirts emblazoned with "Romneys for Mitt" and "TKO Squad."
TKO? That means "Ted Kennedy Out," Mr. Romney explained.
Mr. Kennedy, who campaigned with Hillary Rodham Clinton in Springfield on Friday, went to South Boston this morning to announce a $330 million Federal grant for Boston's transportation system.
"Nothing else will work unless we have a growing, sound economy," the Senator told a small group of supporters. "And that means jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs for Boston and jobs for Massachusetts."
Mr. Romney, who was even with Mr. Kennedy in polls just five weeks ago, has seen his support erode during the last month. A Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll published today showed him trailing Mr. Kennedy by 55 percent to 37 percent.
The challenger, placing blame for his waning popularity on negative advertisements run by the Kennedy campaign, said he hoped to regain lost ground with his new half-hour television commercial. "It will give me an occasion to talk, once again, in some depth on the issues that I think people really care about," he said before videotaping the ad on Friday.
Unlike Ross Perot productions, this infomercial has no pie charts. It begins with a short biography of Mr. Romney, and most of it is set in a television studio where the candidate fields questions from an audience selected by his campaign staff. Although he said he was modeling the program on a town-hall-style meeting and would not know the questions in advance, many of those questions -- including one about recovering drug addicts in senior citizen centers -- touched on themes he had addressed in a campaign speech earlier in the day.
In the last days of the race, the Romney campaign will spend $100,000 to broadcast the commercial five times. MICHAEL COOPER

HEADLINE: The Governor's Race: What's in It for Us?

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
A glossy red, white and blue pamphlet prepared by the State Democratic Committee arrived last week in thousands of New York City mailboxes. It carried a simple message: If George E. Pataki is elected Governor, "Your rent-stabilized or rent-controlled apartment is history."
 "When tenant protections are ended, how many minutes will your landlord wait to call?" the brochure went on. "And if you can't afford your new rent, how long will he give you to pack your bags?" 
 It is surely no accident that Election Day follows hard on the heels of Halloween. If they cannot get your attention, and elicit your support, by promising things, politicians these days are not reluctant to try to win your vote by scaring you to death.
 With the New York State gubernatorial campaign in its final frenzy last week, supporters of State Senator Pataki, the Republican challenger, and of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the Democrat seeking a fourth term, missed few opportunities to heighten - some might say exaggerate - the distinctions between the candidates. (The independent candidate, B. Thomas Golisano, missed few opportunities to dismiss them both.)
 Even if seasonally adjusted for political hyperbold, these pictures are extremely grim.
 If Mr. Pataki is elected, Cuomo supporters insist, his plans for a large income tax cut would cause state aid to cities and towns to dry up, resulting in huge increases in local taxes just to maintain services. They suggest, too, that he would favor upstate and suburban communities, where his political support is strongest, at the expense of New York City.
 If Mr. Cuomo is re-elected, the Republicans say in turn, the state's - and the city's - economy will stagnate, businesses will flee, services will decline and crime rates will surge.
 So, come Tuesday, how is a New Yorker to decide which candidate will best serve the city's interest? What is a New Yorker to do?
 First, relax. However different Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Pataki may be on everything from tax policy to the death penalty, their campaigns' attempts to sharpen those dissimilarities ignore a fundamental fact: far from presiding over the state like an unfesttered despot, the Governor, any Governor, is checked constantly and significantly by the political realities of the State Legislature.
 For years, the Democrats and Republicans have shared power in the Legislature, a fact of life that blunts the excesses of each party and tempers the ability of any Governor to carry out his agenda. (It is responsible, too, for the gridlock that frequently engulfs the State Capitol.)
Any promises being offered by Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Pataki -- as well as all those nightmare scenarios -- would likely be altered or blocked by the Democrats who control the Assembly or the Republicans who dominate the Senate.
Mr. Pataki, for instance, may have voted against the renewal of rent stabilization and rent control in 1989 and 1991, but he voted in favor in 1993 because the law was changed to eliminate the most expensive apartments. He has not indicated that as Governor he would seek to eliminate them. And even if he tried, the Assembly Democrats, most of whom are from New York City, would never let him succeed.
Similarly, if, as a Pataki television commercial has been suggesting, Mr. Cuomo were to try to pay back his new political friend, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican who surprisingly endorsed the Democratic Governor and reinvigorated his campaign two weeks ago, by funneling hundreds of millions of upstate and suburban dollars to New York City, the Senate Republicans would certainly rise up and defy him.
Still, while the candidates' most extreme promises or most alarming warnings are unlikely to come to pass, that hardly means that the Governor's race is without significance. Though the real differences between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Pataki may often be on the margins -- matters of nuance, tone and attitude -- in the setting of public policy the margins do count. And the ultimate point may lie less in what a Governor can get enacted by a politically divided Legislature than simply in what he proposes.
"I think the tone a Governor sets is most important," said Nathan Leventhal, a former Deputy Mayor who is chairman of the Citizens Union, a nonprofit research and advocacy group. "Most services in New York are delivered by the local government. You look for the Governor to provide a real sense of policy direction, of goals that must be set but that may not be reached."
How, then, might the life of the average New Yorker -- or even of the city itself -- change as a result of this election? Will the outcome of the campaign determine, for example, whether the city receives more state education aid? New York has 37 percent of the state's students, but gets only 34.5 percent of the aid. Mr. Cuomo says that is unfair, while Mr. Pataki says he wants to study all state aid to the city, including for mass transit and social services. As always, the Legislature will make the final decision.
Indeed, only one thing is reasonably certain: those who commit capital crimes would fare less well under Mr. Pataki. He supports the death penalty, as does a majority of both the Senate and Assembly. Mr. Cuomo opposes the death penalty, and has vetoed it annually. (Of course, whether reinstituting capital punishment in New York would actually diminish crime, especially in a city where crime rates have been declining for three years, is a subject of endless debate.)
 
THE CASE FOR CUOMO
 Mr. Cuomo has promised during the campaign to help New York City survive its continuing and severe fiscal problems. Foremost among his pledges is a proposal for the state to assume much of the city's cost of Medicaid, health care for the poor. The city spends more than $2 billion a year on Medicaid, picking up 25 percent of the cost. The state pays for an additional 25 percent, and the Federal Government assumes half of the bill.
New York is one of the few states that requires a city, as well as suburban and upstate counties, to pay any Medicaid costs. The burden on the local governments is immense. About $1 of every $16 spent by New York City goes to Medicaid, for example. A vivid measure of the scale of that expenditure is that $2 billion is more than the combined budgets of the Departments of Parks, Fire, Sanitation, Health and Cultural Affairs.
If the city's share of Medicaid were assumed by the state, it would virtually end the fiscal distress that New York has endured for five years. It would probably eliminate the need for Mr. Giuliani to slash even further at essential city services, from the schools to park maintenance to garbage pickups.
"Rudy Giuliani won't be able to deal with the structural deficit without help from Albany," said Esther Fuchs, a political science professor at Barnard College.
Nothing the Governor could do would more dramatically benefit the city, in the view of many elected officials and fiscal experts. But the promise is not new; Mr. Cuomo first pledged to assume the city's Medicaid burden in 1991. He has been blocked by the Senate, whose Republicans leaders have demanded containment of health care costs before they will consider allowing the state to assume the city's and counties' Medicaid burdens.
Even Mr. Cuomo's supporters say that if he is re-elected, he will be able to deliver on his Medicaid pledge only he is much more deft and bold in lobbying the Senate.
"There is some real reason to believe that, in getting elected to a fourth term, Mario Cuomo will exercise the combination of ingenuity and political skill that he possesses to find ways to get more of his agenda enacted into law than the Senate has allowed him to do in the last 12 years," said the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, a Democrat who supports the Governor.
Ms. Messinger and other Democrats also note many ways that Mr. Cuomo could be helpful to the city, and to Mr. Giuliani, beyond money. These include relaxing state rules that mandate countless city actions and increase its operating costs, from how quickly the city must provide housing to the homeless to maximum caseloads for welfare caseworkers.
The Mayor could also get help from Mr. Cuomo on several of Mr. Giuliani's pet proposals, such as obtaining legislative approval for a restructuring of the city's Board of Education or getting the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, whose board the Governor controls, to go along with Mr. Giuliani's plan to merge the transit and housing police forces with the city's Police Department.
"The Mayor needs to have a very focused agenda," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University. "He has to know what he wants, and a lot of it has to be structural reform, not just cash."
 
THE CASE FOR PATAKI
 The regional distinctions that have defined New York's statewide campaigns for decades have loomed large in this year's gubernatorial race. Mr. Cuomo's base support is in New York City, Mr. Pataki's is upstate and the suburbs are up for grabs.
Thus Mr. Cuomo, who is from Queens, has cultivated an image as a loyal protector of the city. Mr. Pataki, who is from Peekskill and still lives nearby in Garrison, has sometimes seemed to campaign against New York City, especially in the days since Mr. Giuliani crossed party lines to endorse the Governor.
But Mr. Pataki and his supporters also contend that the broad tax- and cost-cutting plan he has proposed for the state would benefit the city significantly. Mr. Pataki has called for slashing the state's personal income tax by about a third, or $5.6 billion, over four years, to stimulate business expansion and job growth.
Mr. Pataki has also proposed trimming the state's operating costs, by consolidating agencies and by restraining the growth in Medicaid spending, among other things. He has also said he would consider imposing time limits on welfare for able-bodied, childless adults.
Mr. Pataki, who has not provided comprehensive details on his tax plan, also generally favors relaxing state mandates on local governments, to help them cut costs. Mr. Pataki and his supporters say that if he can cut taxes, shrink the size of state government and ease the regulatory burden on businesses, he could generate an economic boom that would eventually produce more tax revenue for the city and state. And that, they say, would do more to help the city than almost anything else a Governor could do.
"I think the danger to New York City is: will the long-term stagnation of the state's economy harm the city?" said Fred Siegel, a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute, a research group associated with centrist Democrats.
"I had a business person say to me, 'If Cuomo wins, I have to give up hope,' " Mr. Siegel said. "He's not going to leave the state, but if he has to expand, as he expects to, he's not going to do it here."
"What the Pataki tax plan offers to Giuliani is the tax cut that Giuliani can't afford to grant," Mr. Siegel said. "Giuliani is in a tight fiscal box. If Pataki can hold state spending to below the rate of inflation or the rate of growth in personal income, if he does that alone, it will have an enormous beneficial impact on the state economy."
Many Democrats have derided the Pataki plan, arguing that his fiscal methodology is seriously flawed. Mr. Cuomo and his supporters insist that deep state tax cuts would lead inevitably to huge gaps in the state budget, forcing reductions in state operations and drastic cuts in state aid to localities, including money for local schools.
Only about 30 percent of the state budget is actually spent on state operations, like prisons or highways; the rest flows back to cities, towns and counties. The Democrats contend that whatever money voters might save from Mr. Pataki's proposed income tax cut would ultimately be balanced by large increases in local property taxes.
But Mr. Siegel, like many Pataki supporters, dismisses the Democrats' assessment of the tax-reduction plan. "When I hear people say this," he says, "I think what they are saying is that things cannot change."

Mini-McDonald's Squeeze In But Hold Quarterpounder
 McDonald's Corporation is introducing a smaller version of their restaurants -- McDonald's Express -- all over Manhattan. One has already opened on Avenue of the Americas at 42d Street. 
With a scaled down menu -- there are no Quarterpounders and no vanilla shakes and a smaller space (about 1,400 square feet, seating 32 people) -- the company hopes to penetrate areas that would be more difficult to get into with a full-sized McDonald's (which can run from 2,500 to 5,000 square feet).
The Express near 42d Street, seating 32 people, is owned and operated by James R. Lewis, who has seven McDonald's restaurants in Manhattan.
"With the concept of Express, we're bringing our burgers closer to our customers, closer to where they work, closer to where they live," said Mr. Lewis.
The Express restaurants also cost 30 to 40 percent less to open and operate than a traditional McDonald's in the city. It can cost $500,000 to $2 million just to open in New York.
The Express kitchens are also smaller. "With the newer technology we can produce a lot more in a lot less space," said Mr. Lewis. Though the Quarterpounder has been eliminated, most of the menu is the same as at a traditional McDonald's.
Owners of an Express restaurant must already own a traditional McDonald's.
Sixteen more restaurants are scheduled to open within the next 12 months. And 18 to 20 are to open within the year throughout the five boroughs.
 
New Jersey Furniture Chain Opens in South Bronx Center
 The Furniture King opened a store in the HUB, the business district in the Melrose section of the Bronx, last week.
"It is an unexpected and very welcomed anchor store on the strip," said William Bollinger, assistant vice president for planning and development for the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation. "It will bring in a lot of advertising and people to the street."
The store, run by the Dweck family for over 35 years, with five stores in New Jersey, moved into the old Sach's department store building on the corner of 150th Street and Third Avenue.
"We're going to basically cater to the same type of customer we cater to in New Jersey," said Mark Dweck, an owner. He said they look for low- to middle-income customers and advertise very heavily in the Hispanic media.
The six-story building has not been used for anything but storage for over a decade. The Furniture King renovated the building and plans to eventually have four floors of selling space.
 
Competitors to Pick Up Memberships in a Failed Spa
 The Jeff Martin Studio, which is closing its West Side location on Dec. 1, has made a deal with several of the area health clubs to accept the balance of a Jeff Martin membership.
"Basically the people that we're merging with are the people that put me out of business," said Jeff Martin. People are looking for full service gyms, he said.
The health clubs that will honor the membership are: Crunch, 83d Street between Amsterdam and Columbus Avenues, Uptown Equinox on 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, and World Gym, on Broadway and 64th Street.
The Jeff Martin Studio on the East Side, which is owned by Steve Cid, Pumping Iron Gym and Jeff Martin, will stay open and also honor the West Side memberships of the studio.

When Drugs and Terror Stalk a Housing Complex

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Her apartment door was blown off by a firebomb. One car was stolen, another was torn apart. A third was burned. Fifteen of her tires have been slashed. Then there are the death threats -- not to be taken lightly considering the random gunfire, shootings and killings in the neighborhood last year.
"My life is threatened several times a week, but I'm still here," said Millie Poblador. "I will not let them chase me out of my home." 
 This is the price Ms. Poblador says she has paid for fighting drug dealers at the Elliott-Chelsea Houses as its tenant association president and the founder of the Chelsea Crime Committee. Community leaders say crime has been on a rampaging increase at the 13-building Housing Authority complex, which stretches from 25th to 27th Streets between Ninth and Tenth Avenues.
"It was once among the safest public housing in the city," said Rita Feldman, vice president of the 10th Precinct Community Council. "Now they have a lot of problems. People walk in fear, and I can't blame them."
A recent Community Board 4 letter to the housing authority complained that Elliott-Chelsea's crime "has increased to epidemic proportions" with "numerous reports of drugs and prostitution in apartments with a constant stream of outsiders." The board also asked the police for a drug crackdown. Tim Gay, the board's quality of life chairman, said: "It's no longer tolerable. It has people terrified."
Things have gone downhill since the authority took people who were homeless or on welfare, the unemployed, addicts and ex-convicts, said Ms. Poblador, who has lived in the complex for 31 years and remembers a much more orderly atmosphere. "You had to be screened, had to have a job, had to be married, and if you hung a sock out the window, you got fined," she said.
Ruben Franco, the Housing Authority's chairman, agrees that the lower number of working families in public housing has undercut stability, and he says he is trying to recruit more of them. Although some critics like Ms. Poblador blame elected officials and the authority, others, like Ms. Feldman, defend official efforts as sincere.
While anecdotally the problem is clear, meaningful crime statistics remain elusive. Unlike crimes like robbery or assault, incidents of drug sales and prostitution are recorded only if arrests are made.
Capt. Raymond Pietranico of the housing police said two uniformed officers were posted at Elliott-Chelsea, in addition to plainclothes and undercover agents. Since June 1993, when he took command, he said, "We stepped up enforcement, effected hundreds of arrests at that location, did evictions and made an impact." He said that conditions were not as bad as some residents charged.
But Capt. Charles Hanley of the 10th Precinct said, "There are drug problems there -- not like Washington Heights -- but still, the people are right to be worried, which we are too." He said his officers were working with housing police and drug squads.
Despite prominent blue signs warning "Tenant Patrol Active," the patrol has vanished from most buildings. Many residents say they are afraid to volunteer.
The Housing Authority said planned security improvements at Elliott-Chelsea would include better lighting and locks and new intercoms. Mr. Franco of the housing authority says that applicant screening is being tightened and evictions streamlined.
In one courtyard, Peggy Linzalone pointed to places where various shootings and killings had occurred. Daniel, her son, who now lives in Queens, said: "I got shot at three times hanging out on the corner. It's much worse now. I was raised here, but I'm afraid to walk around any more." BRUCE LAMBERT

The Early Signs Of a New SoHo?

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
West Chelsea, long dominated by old warehouses, factory buildings and automobile repair garages, has suddenly blossomed into a serious player in the city's art scene.
Several new galleries and dozens of studios have opened in recent months, and more are on the way. Some people are calling the neighborhood the new SoHo, and it is, in fact, attracting artists fleeing old SoHo's high rents. A few think it should have a new name: WeChe. 
 Raymond Naftali, an owner of two factory buildings on West 26th Street, said he and his partners were amazed at the response they received after they renamed the site the Chelsea Art Center and encouraged artists and dealers to rent there. Since July, about 35 artists, photographers and craftsmen have moved in.
"We don't even advertise anymore," he said. "They come by word of mouth. We're getting world-class artists and people just breaking into the business, struggling artists who need that kind of space."
West Chelsea's buildings have those large open spaces, as well as low rents compared to SoHo and uptown. "SoHo was getting too expensive," said Abraham Joel, a recent transplant. "There wasn't even any point negotiating. We were told there were a lot of midtown architects and attorneys ready to move in." A decade of SoHo's rising property values inflated his annual property tax from about $700 to $13,000, he said.
West Chelsea is also drawing from the 57th Street and Madison Avenue galleries. "We needed a big exhibition area," said Elizabeth Ivers, director of the Matthew Marks Gallery on Madison Avenue, which has opened another gallery in a former truck garage on West 22d Street.
For more than a decade, west Chelsea has been a modest arts outpost. The Italian painter and sculptor Sandro Chia opened a studio in a factory building on West 23d in 1981. Over the following years, the building housed art enterprises like the Gagosian Gallery and Julian Schnabel's studio. Perry Rubenstein, a dealer there, said, "The potential has always been there as a logical alternative to SoHo."
In 1987 the Dia Center for the Arts opened a block away on West 22d, but then the recession hit. The status quo held until a year ago, when the Arnulf Rainer Museum opened across the street from Dia.
Then things took off. Dia announced an expansion next to the Rainer. In recent weeks two galleries have opened on the same block, and two more plan to open in February. And two galleries and a studio moved into the Chia building.
Marilu Lannon, who once ran galleries in emerging art districts in Boston and Chicago, is now in west Chelsea. She has space above a taxi fleet garage and adjacent to a parking garage, both of which she expects will be converted to galleries.
Chelsea is best known for its genteel tree-lined streets of brownstones, and most residents seem to welcome the upscale changes that artists and dealers are bringing to the gritty old manufacturing area to the west. Edward Kirkland, chairman of Community Board 4's Chelsea committee, said, "I assure you the local block association is most enthusiastic." B.L.

72d St. Riders Protest Delay In Repairs

BYLINE: By JENNIFER KINGSON BLOOM 

 BODY:
Four years after West Siders were told that the subway station at Broadway and 72d Street would be renovated and expanded, news that the project has been deferred indefinitely for lack of funds has ignited outrage from local residents, who staged a rally on Thursday night to call attention to what they say are the station's dangerous conditions.
While the rally may have provided an emotional lift to the 100 straphangers who attended, transit officials say it is unlikely to restore financing to the project, which was budgeted for $40 million in 1990 but is now estimated to cost up to $200 million. Because of the new cost projections and municipal budget cuts, the Transit Authority announced last month that renovations to the station at 72d Street and Broadway and five other stations would be deferred. 
 But the residents and public officials who demonstrated at the station last week said that the platform crowding was already too dire for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the parent agency of the Transit Authority, to ignore, and that it would worsen as new development projects -- such as a multiplex movie theater at the Millenium and Donald Trump's proposed Riverside South housing development -- draw additional riders.
"The big story is going to be a year from now, when there's a terrible tragedy at this station," said Assemblyman Scott M. Stringer.
"We would like the Mayor and Stangl," he said, referring to the chairman of the transportation authority, Peter E. Stangl, "to come here during rush hour and see what it's like."
Commuters say that during the morning rush hour, the station's narrow, almond-shaped platforms are so mobbed that people must wait on the stairs for a train. "I've had to wait for the second or third train, because people could only go on in shifts," said Carley Broder, a public relations executive who lives on 67th Street and calls her morning commute "terrifying."
Gerald Valadier, a business analyst who lives near the station, said the overcrowding makes it difficult to get to work on time. "They should have another entrance," he said. "I live in fear of what would happen if the station had to be evacuated in a smoke emergency."
The renovation project would have created a second entrance to the 91-year-old station, widened platforms, added elevators, and resurfaced floors and walls. The project's cost estimates rose after transit officials determined that fixing the station thoroughly would require digging through bedrock and moving tracks.
"New York City transit hired architecture and engineering firms to do a study, and when the results came back, they discovered that the scope of work was much greater than originally anticipated," said John Cunningham, a spokesman for the transportation authority.
Though Mr. Trump, the developer, pledged to contribute $12 million toward the renovation to accommodate increased ridership from his Riverside South project, his contribution was contingent on the M.T.A.'s commitment of financing.
Melissa Farley, a Transit Authority spokeswoman, said the proposal to defer the project will be voted on by the M.T.A. board at its Nov. 22 meeting, then submitted to the Capital Program Review Board in Albany. While the demonstrators vowed to call Mayor Giuliani and other officials to express their fears, Ms. Farley said, "I don't now how a rally would affect the board's decision, the Mayor's decision or what the oversight committee in Albany says."
The other five stations at which renovations have been deferred indefinitely are: 53d Street and Lexington Avenue; Broadway and Nassau Streets; 42d Street and Avenue of the Americas; 50th Street and Avenue of the Americas near Rockefeller Center; and Jay Street near Borough Hall in Brooklyn.

Ride the R Train, See Semper Fi

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Pity Sgt. Ariel Carty's feet.
Squeezed just so into black patent-leather shoes, they stomp along the terrain of the N and R subway platform in the Pacific Street station, where he ferrets out young riders to serve in the United States Marine Corps. 
 Working the subway station is just part of the job of the recruiter, a marine for 11 years who has often been stationed in more glamorous locales, like Norway and Japan.
He also hits Brooklyn high schools and other places where teen-agers congregate. Two years ago, Sergeant Carty volunteered to an assignment at the Pacific Street station, one of the busiest in the borough.
But underground is where he says he is best able to corner the city's youth as they amble off the trains, for a moment vulnerable to his imposing form, which seems even larger in his uniform, as he steps in front of them and begins to drill them about their future.
He says he talks to about 15 youths in the station each afternoon and manages to persuade four to sign up.
His oft-repeated motto is, "It all depends on you." But his targets could easily feel that indeed most of what transpires in the few minutes they spend with him is dependent largely, in fact, on Sergeant Carty.
He cornered one group of teen-agers, focusing on a boy with braces and a black leather jacket, who told him, "I would really like to join the Marines, I admire what they do, but now is just not the time." He nodded with sympathy.
"What are you doing, homey?" he boomed at another young man whose head peeked out from under a sweat-shirt hood. "Just chillin'? I thought so. Get your G.E.D. and give me a call." The boy nods, his eyes glazed over.
Sergeant Carty, who is 29 and went to Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn, ticks off all of the reasons people cannot sign up for the Marines, even if they are interested: Outstanding traffic tickets. Felony convictions. Asthma. Inability to pass the written test.
"Some students fail miserably," he said of the test, which many of his recruits do not pass. "What is amazing is that those who get low scores want the best jobs -- aviation, computers, stuff like that. Now, that just won't work. That dog don't hunt."
He steps in front of a young woman, peels off a business card from the small heap he carries, and shoves it in her hand. "Thanks!" she said. "Now can you tell me how to get to DeKalb Avenue?"
So he has to give a few train directions. He takes it in stride. "I love what I do, that's all I can say," he said with a shrug.
There is, of course, flat-out rejection. When one young man refused his card he said, "He says he's an actor. I'm like, uh-huh, fine, next week, you'll probably be on the unemployment line.
"I like to help people," he said. "If they don't want help, at least I tried." J.S.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MORRISANIA;
Ghostly Spot, New Life . . .

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
When Pearl Fleming moved to Walton Avenue more than two decades ago, she would see the bustle around the Morrisania Hospital's emergency-room entrance and the students in the adjoining nursing school. But for the last 18 years, her apartment window has looked out at enormous ghost buildings in an abandoned block surrounded by a 15-foot-high barbed-wire fence.
To some like Mrs. Fleming, the deserted hospital, more than anything else, came to symbolize the misfortunes of Morrisania. To others, the hospital represented abandonment of the South Bronx. 
 "For how long has the hospital been a symbol of a broken promise to the community?" the Borough President, Fernando Ferrer, asked last week. But the occasion was a healing one: Mr. Ferrer was speaking at a ceremony unveiling plans to turn the site into a community center providing low-cost housing, health care and job-training. The Board of Education also plans to build a new elementary school on the site by the year 2000.
The announcement was the culmination of a six-year effort to obtain funds to remedy the area's most visible eyesore, between Gerard and Walton Avenues and between East 167th and 168th Streets. And although the plans show that progress is being made in the South Bronx, it is also a reminder of how basic services are sorely lacking there.
Two nonprofit organizations, the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation and the Institute for Urban Family Health, are redeveloping the hospital through state and private funds totaling $24 million. The final chunk of money -- $6.3 million from the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal -- was announced last week.
Refurbishing of the vacant buildings is scheduled to start in the spring and to be completed within a year, said Nancy Biberman, the president of Women's Housing and Economic Development. The center will include 131 apartments and a child-care center, as well as a commercial kitchen for women interested in starting catering businesses. In addition, the Institute for Urban Family Health will open a primary health-care center with up to five doctors, said Maxine Golub, vice president for programs. The institute will also operate training programs for people interested in jobs in the health-care field.
Morrisania has been repopulated by thousands of new residents in the last decade. It has not seen a corresponding rise in services. In Community Board 4, where the center expects to draw most of its clients, 23 percent of all households were headed by single mothers, 42 percent of the population ranked below the poverty line and 31 percent collected welfare, according to 1990 Census figures analyzed by Prof. Andrew Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College.

HEADLINE: The New York Vote: Candidates on the Issues

 BODY:
The political races of '94 are almost run, and along the way, the candidates have spoken hundreds of thousands of words -- in speeches, debates, mailings and advertisements. Often, though, dialogue on the issues of governing has been overshadowed by discussion of other matters, some substantive, others less so. 
 Here is a look at the key issues in the four statewide races -- for Governor, Comptroller, Attorney General and United States Senator -- and what the major candidates have said about them.
 
ISSUES: RACE FOR SENATE IN NEW YORK
 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan
 
Personal: Democrat. Senator, elected 1976. Served in the administrations of four Presidents -- Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford.
 
Views On Qualifications For Office: A self-described "Al Smith Democrat," he offers nearly four decades in public life, three terms in the Senate, and the chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee, wielding power over taxes, Social Security and trade -- half the Federal budget.
 
On Abortion: Supports a woman's right to abortion. Of Ms. Castro's financing proposal, he asked, "Does anybody really think that makes a difference?" and noted that the states pay the cost of Medicaid-financed abortions.
 
On GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade): He is a staunch advocate of the international agreement, which is one of President Clinton's highest legislative priorities and would lower tariffs by an average of 40 percent to promote exports around the world. He calls it "the largest tax cut in history and the culmination of 60 years of American trade policy."
 
Bernadette Castro
 
Personal: Republican. Former chief executive of Castro Convertibles
 
Views On Qualifications For Office: Calls herself a "Christine Todd Whitman Republican," and says she would offer an alternative to Mr. Moynihan's approach to government, including holding the line on taxation.
 
On Abortion: Says she supports a woman's right to abortion and Medicaid financing for poor women; however, she says those who oppose abortion should be allowed a check-off on their Federal tax returns stipulating that none of their payments go to finance it.
 
On GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade): Says she is favorably inclined toward GATT, although she fears that the agreement might lead to a loss of manufacturing jobs, especially for unskilled workers.
 
ISSUES: RACE FOR GOVERNOR
 
Mario M. Cuomo
 
Personal: Democrat. Governor, elected 1982. Lieutenant Governor, 1979-82.
 
Views On Economy And Taxes: Has called for a package of tax cuts that would be worth up to $1.7 billion, but has not disclosed details about how long he would take to cut taxes by that amount, how he would structure the reductions and how he would pay for them. Favors reducing the top income tax rate from 7.875 percent to 7 percent for single people earning more than $13,000 but less than $50,000 a year and for married couples earning more than $26,000 but less than $100,000. In addition, would increase the state's credit on the income tax for those who pay a large proportion of their income in property taxes, and would cut the state's tax on utility revenues, known as the gross receipts tax, from 4.25 percent to 2 percent. Would insist that the savings be passed along to ratepayers and not kept by the utilities.
 
On Crime: Opposes the death penalty on moral and practical grounds, but supports a referendum that would give voters a choice between the death penalty and his preferred maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole. Supports life without the possibility of parole for third-time violent felons. Favors banning assault weapons, with provisions to allow collectors and target shooters to own them under certain circumstances. Favors eliminating the state law requiring prison time for second felony offenders, saying that more drug treatment is needed for many such criminals.
 
On Welfare: Would gradually expand his program to force many welfare applicants to search for work before they are placed on the rolls. Would expand the Child Assistance Program, which gives some welfare mothers financial incentives to pursue child support orders from fathers and to find work. Would expand the state's workfare program. Would require children of welfare recipients to go to school and to live at home. Would expand fingerprinting of welfare recipients to the entire state.
 
On Abortion: Supports abortion rights and Medicaid financing of abortions without restrictions.
 
On Education: Would revamp the state's education aid formula to drive more money to New York City, which has 37 percent of the state's students and receives less than 35 percent of state aid. Favors special schools for the state's brightest students. Supports reducing state regulations over schools and offering them more local control. Would abolish the Board of Regents and give the Governor the authority to appoint the Education Commissioner. Would allow parents to choose among several public schools for their children.
 
George E. Pataki
 
Personal: Republican. State Senator, elected 1992. State Assemblyman, 1984-92. Mayor of Peekskill, 1981-84.
 
Views On Economy And Taxes: Has proposed a tax-cut package that would be worth $5.6 billion by the fourth year. Says it could be financed by cutting waste in state government agencies, keeping growth in the state budget to the rate of inflation, and revenue growth of 6 percent a year. Has not provided detailed plans for spending cuts. Would reduce the top income tax rate from 7.875 percent to 5.9 percent, while raising the annual income for the top tax bracket from $26,000 to $50,000 for married couples. Would keep the bottom rate at 4 percent. Would replace the current $1,000 exemption for dependents with a tax credit of $200 for each dependent. Would raise the earned income tax credit for lower-income working people to 20 percent of the Federal earned income tax credit immediately rather than waiting until 1997, as is required under a law passed this year. Has called for a variety of cuts in business taxes, but has not actually proposed any specific measures.
 
On Crime: Favors the death penalty for murderers. Would end parole and work release programs for violent felons. Would require mandatory prison terms for those who use a weapon in the commission of a felony. Favors an absolute ban on assault weapons. Supports more prison construction if it is needed to house felons. Opposes rescinding the state law that requires prison time for second-time felons, even if their crimes were nonviolent.
 
On Welfare: Would require more welfare recipients to work in public sector or community service jobs like cleaning highways and government buildings. Would threaten welfare families with the loss of their benefits if their children do not attend school. Would increase use of managed care in the Medicaid program. Would eliminate certain services provided by the state's Medicaid program, but has only identified a few. Supports statewide fingerprinting of welfare recipients and other measures to combat fraud.
 
On Abortion: Says he unequivocally supports abortion rights, but acknowledges that he has changed positions on the issue twice. Favors a state law requiring notification of the parents of girls under 16 who seek abortions. Opposes Medicaid financing of abortions unless it includes mandatory counseling on birth control.
 
On Education: Would cut the Education Department bureaucracy, but has not said how or by how much. Supports abolishing the Board of Regents and giving the Governor the authority to appoint the Education Commissioner. Would allow parents to choose among several public schools for their children. Favors increasing state aid to schools, but refuses to say if he believes the state's education aid formula is fair to New York City.
 
B. Thomas Golisano
 
Personal: Independent-Fusion. Founder, in 1971, of Paychex Inc., a Rochester company that prepares payrolls for small businesses.
 
Views On Economy And Taxes: Says the state's business climate is ruinous principally because of a state and local tax combination that he says is 45 percent higher than the national average. Over the next 10 years, he says, the tax burden must be reduced to no more than 5 to 10 percent above the national average, which would produce a tax cut even more dramatic than Mr. Pataki's. Wants to cut spending by about 50 percent over a decade, but beyond targeting welfare and Medicaid, has not been specific about where the cuts would come from.
 
On Crime: Proposes what he calls a "holistic approach" to crime, primarily by improving the state economy. Beyond that, proposes tougher sentencing for violent criminals and more emphasis on rehabilitation in prison, and would sign the death penalty into law. Has talked about decriminalizing certain drugs, but now says he wants to study the issue.
 
On Welfare: Says the state attracts welfare recipients because its welfare benefits are too generous compared to those of other states. Proposes cutting benefits substantially to match other states', as well as slashing administrative costs. Wants to reduce benefits for welfare recipients who have more than one baby, and to structure benefits to encourage teen-age mothers to live at home, rather than in subsidized apartments.
 
On Abortion: Supports abortion rights
 
On Education: Supports a sliding tuition at state colleges and universities, based on the applicant's ability to pay, as well as greater local control of schools.
 
ISSUES: RACE FOR COMPTROLLER
 
H. Carl McCall
 
Personal: Democrat-Liberal. Minster, United Church of Christ. State Senator from Manhattan, 1975-79. Deputy delegate to the United Nations, 1979-81. Citibank vice president, 1985-93. New York City Board of Education president, 1991-93. Appointed Comptroller, 1993.
 
Views On The Office: Sees audits as "management tools" to save money in state and local government. Would like to expand the Comptroller's role in the budget process by giving him the authority to approve revenue projections. Wants to use the pension fund to help finance job creation while still insuring a good return on investment.
 
Debt Reform: Prime sponsor of a debt-reform package that would limit the state's total debt and restructure the way money is borrowed. It would allow the Governor and Legislature to approve billions in debt without voter approval - the amount would be tied to the total personal income in the state - but would also end fiscal gimmicks like "back-door borrowing,' in which public assets are sold to a governmental authority that can issue bonds on its own.
 
Their Ideas For Government: Advocates lower taxes, especially on businesses, state takeover of local Medicaid costs and consolidation of governmental service. Also wants to expand audits of school districts. Wants new rules that would prohibit state spending untile a budget is passed.
 
Herbert London
 
Personal: Republican Conservative-Right to Life. John M. Olin professor of humanities at New York University, where he was dean of the Gallatin Division for 20 years. Conservative Party candidate for New York City Mayor, 1989. Conservative Party candidate for Governor, 1990.
 
Views On The Office: Has called the Comptroller's job a "think tank" for changing government and advocating for tax cuts. Wants to use the office to re-examine governmental structure and efficiency, including overlapping local jurisdications. Believes that the Comptroller should have a larger role in forcing the Legislature and Governor to deliver more responsible budgets.
 
Debt Reform: Opposes Mr. McCall's proposal. Says its debt ceiling is too high and believes that voters should approve all debt related to capital projects for the state and its authorities.
 
Their Ideas For Government: Advocates lower taxes and creating a better enviroment for business. Has spoken in favor of greater privatization of governmental services, a Medicaid takeover, increased competitive bidding and the introduction of school vouchers, starting with special education.

Views On Role Of Attorney General: Maintains that the Attorney General is not a "super prosecutor" whose mission is to fight street crime. But has promised to be a "crusader" on domestic violence by helping to coordinate prevention efforts in the state. Has also said that she will focus on civil rights cases, environmental crimes and fraud against consumers and the elderly.
 
On Abortion: She is a longtime supporter of women's rights, including the right to abortion, and says that she would vigorously enforce abortion laws, including a new Federal law giving state attorneys general broader authority in guaranteeing access to abortion clinics.
 
On Death Penalty: Opposes the death penalty, arguing that it does not deter crime, but says she would enforce it if it were to become law in New York State.

The Boom in Jails Is Locking Up Lots of Loot

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TWO of the dominant sentiments in America today are the desire to get tough on criminals and the desire to reduce government spending. Yet these two impulses are clashing across the nation as the United States finds itself in the midst of an unparalleled prison building boom.
 Spurred by public anger over persistent crime, the Federal Government and the states have been beefing up police forces, imposing tougher sentences and restricting parole. As a result, the nation's inmate population has been climbing at a rate of more than 900 new prisoners a week for about the last decade and a half. The result of this flood of inmates -- which in Federal and state prisons topped one million this summer for the first time -- is a penal system bursting at the seams and scrambling to expand. 
 The military was the hot growth area for government spending in the 1980's, but it is beginning to look as if prisons will be the hot spot this decade. And, much in the way President Reagan capitalized on Americans' contradictory desires for a bigger military and a smaller government, today's politicians are selling safety combined with frugality. Yet the incarceration boom points up the price of security (much as the record deficits of the Reagan era did), for it is eating up an ever-increasing share of state budgets. And still, no one can say for sure what all this will do in the long run to decrease crime.
 Criminologists and public-finance experts estimate that Federal, state and local governments will spend more than $30 billion on corrections this year, including building new prisons and expanding existing ones, up from $4 billion in 1975. According to the Census Bureau, state government spending on prison construction increased 612 percent, adjusted for inflation, between 1979 and 1990, the last year for which the bureau has complete data.
 In an era of tight money, spending on construction and operations of prisons is increasing twice as fast as the growth in overall state spending, said Jon Felde, a justice expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures. New York State's corrections budget, for example, has nearly tripled in 11 years, to $1.5 billion, and now accounts for 4.5 percent of state spending, up from 2.9 per cent in 1983.
 "Prison construction is going crazy all over the country," said Jim Hawthorne, project supervisor of Lott Constructors Inc., which is building the Coffeewood Medium Security Prison about 70 miles southwest of Washington in the rolling hills of northwest Virginia.
 The surge in inmates occurred even before many states and the Federal Government passed laws mandating life sentences for criminals convicted of three felonies, the "three strikes" laws. Experts say recently passed laws -- especially the Federal crime bill, which toughened sentences for Federal crimes and encouraged states to adopt mandatory minimum sentencing -- will further fuel the boom. Indeed, the crime bill provides $8.7 billion for state prison construction.
 California officials estimate they will have to add 20 new prisons to the state's 58 to handle the increased number of inmates expected under the state's new three-strikes law. Florida, which doubled spending for prison construction between 1990 and 1994, plans eight new prisons, dormitories at 22 others and four new work camps by the year 2000. Texas officials say that they plan to open a new corrections installation each week for the next 18 months.
 
Prisons 'R' Us
 "The future of it is phenomenal," said Jerome G. Miller, president of the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives. "It's now an industry in and of itself."
 Even with the explosion in construction, the Federal Bureau of Prisons and state governments are having trouble keeping up. Though the number of Federal prisons has risen to 77 this year from 43 in 1982, they still house 30 percent more inmates than they were designed to accommodate. Forty-one states have either the entire state prison system or one or more major institution under court order to alleviate overcrowding or poor delivery of services to inmates.
 In New Jersey and Arizona, inmates are housed in tents. North Carolina is shipping hundreds of prisoners to Rhode Island. In Texas and Virginia, local jails are overflowing with inmates who have been sentenced but cannot be squeezed into crowded state prisons.
 "The problem we have is that your needs are a moving target because each time the legislature comes in it demands longer sentences," said Senator John Whitmire, chairman of the Texas Senate's criminal justice panel. "So you're always playing catch-up."
 Much of the new construction reflects not so much a desire for rehabilitation but simply a clamor for secure criminal warehousing, and comes at a time when public sentiment is growing in favor of curtailing or abolishing what are perceived as inmate "privileges," like television and exercise equipment. James A. Gondles, executive director of the American Correctional Association, a national organization of corrections professionals, sees such restrictions as "knee-jerk" and ultimately a danger to prison security. "If we're going to put people in prisons, we're going to have to have them manageable," he said.
 
Second Thoughts
 Even as they pass laws mandating tougher sentences, some lawmakers are detecting a growing unease over the amount of money going into prisons.
 In Virginia, Gov. George Allen Jr. was forced in September to scale back a plan to abolish parole because lawmakers were concerned over costs. While it passed a bill limiting the ability of inmates to gain parole, the Massachusetts legislature has, in the last two years, defeated a $591-million prison construction bill submitted by Gov. William F. Weld. In 1990, voters in California rejected a $450-million bond for prisons. Last month the California legislature kept another bond issue for prisons off the November ballot.
 Still, the desire to adopt a punitive approach remains strong. And some penologists worry that even if public attitudes shift against the lock-'em-up approach (especially if it proves ineffective in reducing crime), the prison-building surge may create its own constituencies -- architects, contractors, vendors, labor unions, whole communities -- with a vested interest in maintaining the status quo.
 "Corrections today is a gigantic cash machine," Alvin J. Bronstein, executive director of the Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, told the public-affairs weekly National Journal recently. "There is a correctional-industrial complex."

For the Environment, Compassion Fatigue

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

 BODY:
THE 1990's could hardly have begun better for the national environmental movement. A new Clean Air Act to clear the skies of toxic chemicals became law. Polls indicated that Americans overwhelmingly supported tough environmental rules and said they would pay more for them. Democrats elected a new team to the White House, in part because the Vice President was sympathetic to ecological concerns and wrote a best-selling book on the subject.
 But midway through, the decade is shaping up as a period of turmoil for the environmental movement. Membership and budgets have dropped for most of the national groups. A well-organized counter-movement of landowners, city officials and industrial executives steamed into Washington and halted Congressional work this year on strengthening environmental laws. They argued that environmentalists were exaggerating and using inconclusive data to frighten people and influence lawmakers. 
 Those criticisms, and its own frustration, have brought the movement to a state of self-doubt it never faced before.
 
The Problem With Congress
 In Washington, environmental leaders blamed poisonous partisanship for what Blakeman Early, a Sierra Club lobbyist, called "the worst environmental Congress in two decades." Another Capitol Hill veteran, Representative Mike Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, who was one of the strongest environmental voices in Congress for eight terms, was defeated in the primary in part because of his steadfast support for tougher rules on a range of environmental issues.
 But Mr. Synar said something more basic than politics and legislative strategy is at work, and that is the environmental movement's message that every problem is a crisis, an emergency worthy of public alarm. "If I could give the environmental community one piece of advice, it is to do outreach to people who have not traditionally been part of their movement," he said. "They need to establish relationships with cities, with rural water districts, with county commissioners. They are not going to be able to do what they want by sowing fear."
 Since Earth Day in 1970, environmentalists have built a movement and achieved legislative and judicial successes by showing that industrial development produced polluted water and air, nuclear radiation, abandoned toxic waste dumps, destruction of forests, loss of species and erosion of farmland.
 By the 1990's, though, a web of statutes written in part and advocated by environmental groups had sharply reduced air and water pollution and alleviated other problems. The vocabulary of devastation was applied to new issues -- electromagnetic radiation, genetic engineering, global warming and overpopulation -- that were said to be even more threatening.
 The language of emergency that suffused debate about the environment has become institutionalized in large part because it was effective in reaching the public and Congress. But now some observers are noting psychological and political problems with the message itself.
 "I agree with the urgency of the issues, but my judgment is that the environmental movement got grounded in a one-dimensional psychology," said Theodore Roszak, a history professor at California State University in Hayward and author of "The Voice of the Earth -- An Exploration of Ecopsychology" (Simon & Schuster, 1992). "The movement wants a lot of change very rapidly and tries to get this by scaring people and shaming people. It's bad psychology. People resent being talked to that way, and if you continue to talk that way without helping them understand and make the changes, they stop listening. That's what is happening. My concern is that they need a better way to talk to the public."
 Martin W. Lewis, who teaches environmental conservation at the University of Wisconsin, reached a similar conclusion in "Green Delusions -- An Environmentalist Critique of Radical Environmentalism" (Duke, 1992). He said that mainstream environmental organizations were adopting some of the tactics of groups like Earth First! and that the entire movement was coming to be perceived by the public as hostile to capitalism, new technology, industry, even modern civilization itself.
 "Radical environmentalism is dismissive of modern life, but it seemed to be growing more prominent and risked discrediting the mainstream environmental movement," said Professor Lewis. "Any philosophy that says economic growth must end, that technology needs to be dismantled, and that we must turn away from science -- most people find that threatening."
 Jim Maddy, president of League of Conservation Voters in Washington, said most groups did not adopt a radical position. He also said that environmental leaders have by no means accepted the premise that they are exaggerating problems. "I don't see any evidence of that in the polling that we are doing," he said. "The public believes we are telling the truth."
 Mr. Maddy added that national environmental leaders were very concerned about their legislative failure in Congress and its causes. One problem, he said, may be how the movement is talking about itself and its work. In a departure, Mr. Maddy said, leaders are starting to tout their accomplishments. Until recently, environmentalists were reluctant to do so because they thought it would lull the public into thinking the problems had been solved.
 In addition, it's not startling that public alarm would wane in an Administration that is sympathetic to environmental concerns.
 
No Satisfaction
 "It's inherent in advocacy organizations," said Mr. Maddy. "If you are in the business of advocating progress in this relatively broad range of issues, you are not in the business of being satisfied. At the same time, we are not in the business of being blind to progress."
 Other environmental leaders are watching the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the few national groups whose membership and budget is growing.
 The New York-based organization has been working with large corporations to develop business practices that reduce waste and lower costs. In the group's newest project, several of the country's largest buyers of paper, including Time-Warner, McDonald's and Johnson & Johnson, are working with the group to develop purchasing standards that improve forestry practices, reduce pollution in manufacturing and encourage recycling of finished paper products.
 The Environmental Defense Fund periodically comes under fire from colleagues who view its ties to industry as too close. Fred Krupp, the organization's executive director, said his goal was not to attack big business but to "get environmental results."
 "Being willing to consider new ways to regulate and being willing to talk with business in a businesslike way is not the same as being in favor of halfway compromises," Mr. Krupp said. "We are experimenting with new approaches and as those approaches get results, more people are using them."

When a Woman Earns Like a Man

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
From the day laborer to the millionaire, the wife's worn dress or flashing jewels, her low roof or her lordly one, her weary feet or her rich equipage -- those speak of the economic ability of the husband.
 -- Charlotte Perkins Gilman, 1898
 
HUSBAND, the noun, was orginally a management title: it meant the manager of a household. The verb means to manage economically. Wife, the noun, was no title at all: in its obscure Germanic roots it meant simply "woman." Its spousal connotation came later. Which may help explain why the small but growing number of women who earn more than men are leading society into uncharted territory. 
 "It's psychological, it's a matter of ego and it's a matter of economics," said Letty Cottin Pogrebin, the feminist author. "The culture has taught women that they're supposed to marry men who are bigger, taller, older, smarter and richer. Women who don't are perceived to be marrying down. Men are supposed to marry down. It helps to elevate them and it reinforces their supremacy.
 
'Deep Secret'
 "I'm not sure women would own up to it, but they don't want to have to deal with the ego of a man who's going to be upset by this," Ms. Pogrebin said. "She may be very attracted to a waiter, but if she's working for a Fortune 500 company and she has aspirations, she has to worry about presenting him to her world and how he feels as a male. Class is the deep, dark secret of this society, and class plus gender is as volatile as you can get."
 This has become a very real problem for some women, though over all, women still make about 70 cents for each dollar that men make. Analyses conducted for The New York Times by the Economic Policy Institute in Washington and by Queens College of the City University of New York have found that among recent black college graduates, women earn more than men. Black women earn, on the average, more than black men and as much as white women, though white men continue to outpace every other group.
 Distilling those numbers is simple compared to assessing the impact on relationships when women outearn men, as researchers now seek to do.
 Among blacks, the gap in income has typically been smaller than among whites. So, some black women say, is the stigma attached to marrying a man who makes less. But William Julius Wilson, the University of Chicago sociologist who flagged the deficit of employed black men in his book "The Truly Disadvantaged," now suggests that the marriageability gap extends to the middle class, with potentially profound consequences.
 "Better educated black women face a real dilemma: do they remain single or do they marry down?" Professor Wilson said. "All the various surveys reveal that people tend to marry within their own social class circles. One outcome could be not intraracial marriages, but more interracial marriages."
 Or fewer marriages altogether. And, perhaps, more divorces.
 The likelihood of black women out-earning black men is, for the near future, far higher than the likelihood of white women out-earning white men. Moreover, income is rarely static. A man who made more than his wife when they were married may wind up jobless for a year or two, and outearn her later.
 "Why it happens probably makes a lot of difference," said Kay Snyder, a sociology professor at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, who, with her husband, has studied income disparities between men and women.
 "Is it happening because the couple made a conscious decision? Or is it a case when a man has been laid off from a job and the woman would prefer him to be in the labor force making more money? It happens at all income levels, with married couples and couples living together, although women who are making more tend to be in lower income households. Another thing we know is that people move in and out of this category a lot: the atypical case is the woman making more than the man consistently year after year.
 "But what seems to be going on when women make more than men is there appears to be a greater likelihood of divorce," Professor Snyder said, though she acknowledged that her research had not yet produced numbers on that point.
 She and her husband, Dr. Thomas C. Nowak, found that women made more than men in 4 percent of all couples in 1969, nearly 7 percent in 1979 and nearly 16 percent in 1989.
 The 1990 census found that women now account for more than half the bachelor's degrees awarded, and that for the first time most mothers of young children work outside the home. Among blacks, women made important wage gains in the 1980's, while men's earnings eroded. And among black college graduates, the woman's initial income edge may frustrate her search for a husband.
 "You have to look at the base relationship first," said Victor Bracey of Culver City, Calif., a bank loan officer whose wife, Susan, makes about twice about much as he does. "I'm the man here. I'm supposed to be making more. But times have changed. They're not like when our parents grew up. As long as you keep it in perspective, we're a team."
 "It depends on how secure the guy is," said the writer Gay Talese. "I'm more of a traditional guy, but I had a two-year period between books when I made nothing and my wife made all the money. I felt great. Was I glad I had a working wife."
 
Only the Young
 Dr. Suzanne M. Bianchi, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland who formerly worked as a Census Bureau researcher, suggests that Mr. Talese's viewpoint is uncommon among the middle-aged. "Where it would first make the least difference is among young couples," Professor Bianchi said. "It might even look attractive to men. But to the extent that gender roles are still differentiated over childbearing, there's still much more of a decision by women than men then to cut down work. A 50-year-old man who doesn't earn as much as his wife is more unusual, and studies have shown that the higher the percentage of income that the wife provided, the higher the likelihood of divorce.
 "But change is happening, and I would still hold out the expectation that this would come to matter less," she said. Still, while men like Mr. Talese say they welcome the change, Professor Bianchi cautioned: "I hear many husbands say that. But do they mean it?"

Sweetie! The Zeitgeist Just Blew In. Tablecloth Chic and the Neo-Groovie

BYLINE: By AMY M. SPINDLER 

 BODY:
THERE are a few words designers do not want audiences to walk away thinking about after runway shows like those that just ended Friday for the 1995 spring and summer collections. Those words are: shirts, trousers, dresses, jackets and shoes.
 So every season, staging runway spectacles that cost almost $200,000, they attempt to direct observers' thinking a bit, by constructing a raison d'etre for their collections. In their program notes, they philosophize on women's images, on their own role in forming those same images and on themselves (often in the third person, like royalty). Although these notes are read only by jaded members of the fashion industry (and sometimes not even by them), there is always a pretense that the designer is addressing an idealized woman, the way Billy Joel might in one of his songs. 
 Like prescient Dr. Feelgoods, they prescribe the nostrums that will ward off a constantly changing world. Here, a few thoughts from the program notes of some of the collections for spring and summer of 1995. Of course, any emphasis (designers love emphasis) is the designer's own. AMY M. SPINDLER
 
Tracy Feith: Nude. Nude. Nude. This spring is all about sex, flesh, form, exposed skin and attraction. Tracy's woman is in control. She wears the proverbial pants and cracks the whip.
 
Gianni Versace: I am defined as an 'impulsive artist.' This may not be true, perhaps it is this definition which is 'impulsive.' Actually, I love to think for hours on end about the things I do and see. It is extremely important to me, in these changing times, to observe people's desires, listen to the young, perceive not only interior but also social changes, and in this particularly difficult period, when the crisis has practically taken over a part of our daily lives, I want to imagine a future for fashion.
 Behind this word there is a lot more than just a fleeting symbol tied to the past, to a decade that no longer exists. More than ever today, fashion stands for business reality which creates jobs, which exports Italian taste all over the world and promotes the image of our country along with our economy. . . . Fashion is a value to defend because it is a value which is helping us to improve our future. Everyone's, with no exclusions.
 
Dom Casual by Walter Cessna and Simone Colina: Future Artificial Bar-B-Q Spring '95. Something borrowed, something found, something lifted, something . . . Dom Casual. Uber-casual, neo-groovie, semi-soft, reel ruff, fiercely futuristic, impeccably uninclined.
 
Kitty Boots: The leopard section is dedicated to famous 50's pin-up Betty Page, whom Boots has long been influenced by. Formerly a designer for London's "Pure Sex" fetish boutique, Boots has a gift for the sexy female-dominant archetype that transcends cliche or mere rehash. Many of Boots's friends and models are in bands like D-Generation, Fur and New York Loose. . . . These are clothes for vamps, supervixens, rockers and XXX Girls, and those who want to look like them . . .
 
Donna Karan for DKNY: Tablecloth chic. Picnic wear for the woman who doesn't do anything quietly. Tablecloth short shorts, pegged pants and shapely sundresses. And for dining under stars, picnic ball skirts and dresses with mosquito netting to keep the bugs out.
 
Nicole Miller: Elegant. Sophisticated. Tailored Taffeta and Matte Satin. No Nipples. No Navels. Muted Pastels. Jumpsuits. Darts. Detailed. Ladylike. Sexy.
 
Robert Danes: As I began to design this collection, I had three things on my mind -- love, sex and romance -- matters all dear to my heart. Late one night I happened to switch on Romeo and Juliet. I had not seen it since high school, and I sat enthralled through the story. What inspired me was how precisely Zeffirelli had balanced an aching almost painful love with sheer physical lust.
 
From Miu Miu by Miuccia Prada: New Groupie. She is a born fan. Ready to be on the road. To run away. To follow her idols. Impulse, improvisation are her spontaneous ways to dress. She is young: basics, a certain "bad taste," artificial fabrics, impossible colors, suit her. . . . The background of "early" Miu Miu could have been a bus stop, "eating apple tart and ice cream" (Jack Kerouac, "On the Road," 1959). The new Miu Miu is more likely to be on a cult-movie set, with mixed references: Tom Robbins-Gus van Sant, a touch of "Taxi Driver." "Paris, Texas," "Autostop" (1976), but also a 1940's Italian comedy, like "Grandi Magazzini" ("Department Stores") starring Maria Denis as a little salesgirl.
 
Mark Eisen: 90's sure pure echo force listo drive driven pace ace speed dynamic spartan strength shape form filere cool kick card glide pride fly nineties slick slam savor flavor lekker blue crisp fresh air breath entice intoxicate evaluate laminate strong sensitive hard soft feel touch home pony boy woman white sugar lover sex bully boy whisper girl mark eisen spring summer 1995 boy clean laundry fresh less more spirit angel saint dealer viper killer run stay pace sparkle tingle electric shiver . . .
 
Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana on their D & G collection: A magical moment, an imperceptible borderline exists between adolescence and the discovery of one's own femininity, between being a girl and the aspiration toward becoming a woman, perfectly captured by Jodie Foster in "Taxi Driver." It is to that moment of emotions, enthusiasm, agitation and ardent feelings, propelling one into life, that this collection is dedicated: one poised between the accentuation of respectability and the piece of clothing which shocks, between the exaltation of both well-imposed and maternal good manners and the provocative exhibiting oneself.
 
Marina Spadafora: It's the ancient beating of Africa, the inspiration of the new collection: urban Africa . . . downtown Dakar or maybe Nairobi. Odd characters in multicolored atmosphere: mercenary soldiers on secret mission, schoolgirls in school uniforms, prostitutes in colored dresses . . .
 
Joan Vass: I haven't changed the opening words of this release since my second show, and they continue to represent my intentions. Suddenly, I want to explain myself further. Thank you for reading this far. Anything still goes.
 Believing that the clothes I make are theoretically designed for everybody, they are: as unisex as possible; regardless of length because people come in all sizes and shapes and in the 90's men and women will not be dictated to by mere fashion designers, and I honor that independence; as unconstructed as possible, thus without shoulder pads because they look like prosthetic devices to me. . . .
 Finally, it should be amusing and make the wearer feel relaxed and good looking, because in the end the wearer is The One. I aim to please, but if my clothes don't suit, there are any number of my fellow designers who will provide your hearts desire. Good luck to us all!

HEADLINE: Partying With Newt

 BODY:
The voters are angry. When they think about where the country is headed they feel bad, but not nearly as bad as they are going to feel if they accept Representative Newt Gingrich's invitation to make Tuesday a national day of binge voting.
 Mr. Gingrich is like an enabler at a neighborhood cocktail party. His message is familiar and seductive: Don't worry about tomorrow. So what if it gives you a headache? Let's tie one on! 
 That Newt is a charmer, all right. He's got Phil Donahue's hair and Huck Finn's smile. He is smart, too, always has been, even back in the early 70's when he was a Rockefeller liberal. He is also persuasive. Who else could get 366 supposedly independent-minded Republicans to sign a contract that throws away their right to independent thought on the legislative agenda for the next Congress?
 Mr. Gingrich got his party's candidates to obey him by promising the destruction of the welfare state. Republican candidates love that kind of talk. But voters should not enlist in Mr. Gingrich's army without understanding what his so-called contract really means.
 It is dishonest on a defining civil rights issue of the moment -- the right of American women to have abortions without Government interference. The contract does not oppose abortion directly, but sneakily espouses a new Federal gag rule on abortion information. In this respect, the Gingrich contract represents a stealthy attempt to install the Reagan-Bush dream of an America where abortion is illegal and available only to people wealthy enough to flee the law or ignore it.
 The great majority of the American people believe in freedom of choice on abortion. Mr. Gingrich does not. The majority of candidates who obediently signed his contract do not believe in it or do not care one way or another. Moreover, virtually the entire group is beholden to the money and votes of the right-to-life movement and evangelical religious activists. A House controlled by Speaker Gingrich would come under irresistible pressure to outlaw abortion. No one should vote for the "Contract With America" without understanding that it is a vote against freedom of choice.
 Of course, Mr. Gingrich will not admit to this. Instead he promises that the new Newtonian majority will instantly pass term limits and a balanced-budget amendment. He is quieter about the worms in his balanced-budget apple, including a greater than 50 percent cut in capital gains taxes.
 Just when President Clinton has trimmed the deficit to $203 billion, and at a time when wage-earning Americans have yet to feel the benefits of economic recovery, Mr. Gingrich proposes to reintroduce the hoariest trick of Reaganomics. Reward the handful of Americans who reaped profits from the 80's with another round of tax benefits while the rest of the population gets to choose between Reagan-style deficit growth and Reagan-style cuts in social programs.
 Mr. Gingrich, by the way, refuses to be drawn out on benefits or programs he would cut. He speaks vaguely of some kind of welfare reform and those ever-elusive savings from reforming Pentagon purchasing practices. He is understandably silent on what the "Contract With America" is really saying to the voters. If you are mad at the Democrats, punish yourself.
 Of course, the impulse to punish the Democrats is understandable. The failure of the party's Congressional leadership has been abject. They bear heavy responsibility for the fact that so many voters view their Congressional district or senatorial vote as a choice between Democratic disarray and Gingrichian rigidity.
 Maybe the frustration is great enough to entice a majority to party with the jovial Georgian. Just remember this. The headache will be a big one, and it will last for a long time.

The Rites of Fall New York's Religion: What Else but Fashion?

BYLINE: By SUSANNA RODELL 

 BODY:
To the list of most-repeated lies -- the check is in the mail, I'm from the government and I'm here to help you -- add one more: I don't care what I look like.
 Especially in New York, this is self-deception at its most flagrant. A quick look at police statistics, combined with a little basic research, will confirm that people are much more likely to commit a major felony than to show up at the office in the wrong shoes. Yet even here, in this city of surfaces, where walking down the street looking good is the most widely practiced art form, people cling to another strange vanity: that they have none. 
 This week, of all weeks, perhaps it is time to let go of this last scrap of Calvinist mythology, as New York finishes up another round of fashion fever. All week long the runways set up in the tents in Bryant Park behind the New York Public Library have thudded under the stilettoed heels of Kate and Naomi and Linda. All week long the papers have screeched with speculations about models' pay and threatening boyfriends, and even the once-restrained New Yorker magazine has devoted a whole issue to this alleged non-issue.
 Face it: this city cannot live without fashion. For one thing, its economics feed us. Other industries may have fled, but the rag trade -- from the design schools to the sweatshops to the upmarket showrooms to the modeling agencies to the magazines to the department stores, boutiques and street markets -- remains spiritually and practically fused with New York.
 More personally, New Yorkers themselves, though they often hate to acknowledge it, are fashion's most ardent devotees. It is a matter of necessity. This is a hierarchical city; rank matters. It is also a city in which few people have any time. Impressions must be made quickly. To do this verbally takes precious minutes. The witty remark, the display of erudition need the right opening and the right, relaxed setting. It's so much more efficient to display these qualities in a way that takes mere seconds to appraise: the cuff button, the combination of boot top and hemline, the cocktail of old and new, grandfather's tweeds and this week's loony handbag, the Dead-Serious suit with the small visual joke of red bobby socks.
 In fact, we are talking religion. Nowhere was this more evident last week than under those canvas pavilions where the yearly rites were being performed. The pilgrims had arrived from all over the world and lined the magic aisle to worship. The high priests delivered the goods: the magic potion of young female forms and cloth. The acolytes, who sat in banks opposite the altars, pointed their lenses, whistled and stomped.
 The priest or priestess of each denomination proffered his or her interpretation of the textile text: the younger ones going for tacky wit with variations on 50's Ban-Lon sportswear accessorized with food containers; the older, long-ordained bishops offering classic girl-clothes that would do Audrey Hepburn proud.
 On Friday morning, the reigning Pope -- a Mr. Klein -- offered the most New York statement of them all, unremitting black and white and beige and the tiniest hint of mauve in maybe one garment, clothes that said: "I'm from New York and I care deeply about how I look, but I also care very deeply that people should not know how deeply I care, and I've therefore just thrown on this little silk number that really isn't any color at all and has no shape either except for my perfect body, which you can see just enough of.
 "Oh? I look stunning? How very surprising. Thank you." SUSANNA RODELL

HEADLINE: In America;
The Doom Mongers

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The Republicans in Washington in the spring and summer of 1993 predicted catastrophe.
 President Clinton, in office only a few months, was struggling to pass his deficit reduction plan. Nowhere could he find a Republican, not one -- not in the House and not in the Senate -- who would vote for it. 
 Late in May, when the bill narrowly passed the House, Republican Congressman Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania said: "We will remember this vote when unemployment goes up, when inflation goes up, when spending goes up, when the national debt goes up. No more blaming Reagan and Bush."
 Senator Bob Dole, who will become majority leader if the Republicans take control of the Senate in Tuesday's election, said in August 1993, "President Clinton knows . . . I know, and the American people know that the plan does not tackle the deficit head on."
 Republican Congressman Rick Santorum, who is challenging incumbent Democrat Harris Wofford for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, said: "I rise in opposition to this bill because it is bad for America. It does not create jobs."
 And Republican Senator Phil Gramm of Texas declared, "We are buying a one-way ticket to a recession."
 Maybe they really believed the sky was falling. Maybe they just wanted to hurt a young Democratic President. Whatever the reasons, they were wrong. Very wrong.
 Employment is up, inflation is down and there has been a startling decrease in the Federal budget deficit.
 For the many who claimed the President's program was a "jobs killer" came the news last week that unemployment had dropped to a four-year low. Nearly 5.5 million jobs have been created since Mr. Clinton became President.
 Since passage of Mr. Clinton's economic plan, 79,000 jobs have been created in the automobile industry. By the end of this year, the United States will overtake Japan as the world's top auto producer for the first time since the 1970's.
 Despite the dire predictions (and perhaps wishful thinking) of the G.O.P., the Clinton Administration has managed to sustain the economic recovery and create jobs while keeping inflation low. And it has done this while sharply reducing both the budget deficit and the size of the Federal bureaucracy.
 If Ronald Reagan had done these things he would have been canonized.
 The deficit ($73.8 billion when Mr. Reagan took office) had climbed to nearly $300 billion in the last year of the Bush Presidency. Under Mr. Clinton, the deficit fell to $255 billion in the first year and $203 billion in fiscal 1994. That is the sharpest two-year drop in history. And it is the first time the deficit has fallen two years in a row in more than 20 years.
 This is not widely known. A recent poll showed that only 23 percent of Americans were aware that the deficit had been reduced at all. Next year the deficit will fall below $170 billion.
 Proponents of smaller government should know that the Federal work force is already shrinking rapidly. By fiscal 1999, under the President's plan, we will have the smallest Federal bureaucracy since John Kennedy was President.
 There is so much chaos, static, incoherence, mean-spiritedness, gutlessness and deliberate deception in the political discourse that voters are finding it increasingly difficult to know what is really going on. Few Americans realize, for example, that the income tax increases in the Clinton budget plan affected only the top 1.2 percent of all taxpayers. The remaining 98.8 percent paid the same amount in taxes, or less.
 Americans are discontented, and with good reason. Despite a surge in the economy, too many are without good jobs, too many are without adequate health care and too many are afraid of the very real threat of violent crime. But voters should ask themselves if those kinds of problems will be handled best by a rerun of the Reagan-Bush years.
 If it were not for the interest that still must be paid on the debt run up by Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush, President Clinton would have a balanced budget. In fact, he would have a $7 billion surplus.
 The Republicans were wrong last year when they derided the Clinton economic plan; and those who continue to make the fantastic claim that they can cut taxes, increase military spending and balance the budget are wrong now.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Players Are Talking Rival United League Seriously, Agents Say

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
With the price of franchises pegged in the area of $5 million, the United Baseball League should have little trouble finding owners for their projected 10 franchises. That's a bargain-basement rate compared with the $150 million that major league baseball will probably charge the people from Phoenix and St. Petersburg, Fla., to get into that exclusive club.
More difficult for the fledgling league will be the seduction of major league players into their teams' uniforms, and a still more arduous task will most likely be the effort to induce 10 cities to build stadiums in return for 15 percent equity in the team and a 15 percent share of the pretax profits. 
 But, said Tom Reich, a prominent player agent who is knowledgeable about the economics of baseball: "Dick Moss and his associates deserve to be taken very seriously. They are not autumn leaves blowing around in the wind."
Speaking of the new league's ability to lure players, Reich said: "I think some very good players will play in that league if it succeeds in getting started. Do I think Frank Thomas or Junior Griffey, guys like that, will play? No, not so fast. There is no question the established league always will have a big leg up on a new league for a variety of reasons, not least of which is Cooperstown. But I think there would be a lot of very good players who would be willing to play in the new league."
By the very salary strategy they have pursued in recent winters and that will be most pronounced this winter, major league clubs will drive veteran, but very usable, players to the other league. The middle class of players is shrinking because teams would rather pay the minimum salary to a rookie than the average salary to a veteran.
An increasing number of experienced players will not find jobs with established teams and will look for employment where it is available. If initial indications are accurate, some players may not even wait to discover they are unemployed to seek jobs in the United League.
Tony Attanasio, another long active agent, said he polled all of his clients about the new league and they reacted with unanimous interest. Attanasio said he presented this proposition to each of his players:
"If you were offered 'x' to play in major league baseball and 50 percent of 'x' to play in the new league with profit sharing, which would you take?"
"I was shocked at the response," Attanasio said. "One hundred percent would go to the new league. The point is that guys are fed up to their eyeballs with the Bud Selig-Jerry Reinsdorf nonsense. I've talked to other agents and they've said essentially the same thing."
Now if the new league's founders can find places for these players to play, they'll be ready to open for business.
"We're not talking about having to talk 10 cities into spending $170 million to build a replica of the stadium in Baltimore," John Bryant, a Congressman from Texas, said, referring to state-of-the-art Camden Yards.
Richard Moss, whose name has become most popularly attached to the venture because of his vast experience with major league baseball, talked about two types of stadiums that interest the new league.
One type could be built in 9 or 10 months, Moss said. It would have a basic shell with permanent seats and luxury boxes from first base to third base and temporary stands around the rest of the park. Those stands could be replaced in the following year or two. The cost of the initial structure, Moss said, would be about $30 million for a stadium with 35,000 to 40,000 seats.
Project No. 2, he said, would resemble the much-praised Pilot Field in Buffalo, being constructed as a more permanent edifice at a cost of about $50 million to $60 million. It would have 20,000 to 25,000 seats initially, with expansion in the following year to 40,000 to 45,000. Initial stage of the construction could be done within a year, Moss said.
"Stadium construction has become very advanced in the past few years," he added.
Besides equity and profit sharing, Bryant said, cities would have the benefit of using the stadiums the rest of the year for whatever profit-making purpose they desire.
"It won't be like it is in most of these cities, where the cities build stadiums and get hardly anything in return for it," he said.
The line forms to the left.
 
Memos, They Get Memos
 Instead of box scores and scouting reports, club executives read memos and directives about labor negotiations. Except they can't always agree on what's in them.
One executive said last week that he was reluctant to speak to a reporter because management people had been "gagged" under a threat of fines. The executive said everyone had been instructed, at the request of the mediator, Bill Usery Jr., not to talk about the collective bargaining process now that it was in mediation.
An executive of another club said he saw a memo from Bud Selig attached to a copy of an Oct. 24 letter from Usery asking that people not comment or engage in rhetoric that wasn't constructive. But, he said, he didn't recall any reference to a fine in Selig's memo.
But officials from two other clubs said they either had read or heard about the threat of fines for saying the wrong thing.
Selig said he sent to the clubs a memo stating what he said Usery said to him at the White House last month, but he added, "There never has been any suggestion of a fine."
Selig, however, acknowledged sending a more recent memo. That one, he said, dealt with the disclosure of the details of a memo outlining the ingredients of the new proposal the owners plan to make.
"When we send internal memos," Selig lamented, "we find it disturbing that even before the ink is dry, it's in the newspapers."
 
Threat or No Threat?
 The owners' Player Relations Committee may have been unfair to Bobby Bonilla in the unfair labor practice charge it filed with the National Labor Relations Board last week against Bonilla and John Franco, the Mets' player representatives, and the Players Association.
In the charge, which stemmed from harsh comments attributed to the two players about players who might report to training camps next spring, the clubs' labor lawyers said that Bonilla "threatened that club employees who crossed the M.L.B.P.A.'s picket line would 'end up in the East River.' "
Gene Orza, a union lawyer, said Bonilla never made that statement. He noted that as the basis for the charge, the Player Relations Committee relied on newspaper reports, one of which quoted Bonilla as saying, "You've got to remember, our negotiations are not any different than any negotiations in any labor situation. Try to cross that teamsters line. You'd end up in the East River, right?"
Lou Melendez, a management lawyer, said he thought Bonilla's meaning was clear even if he didn't link the East River directly to players.
"I think from the statement he's made you can draw the inference that he's applying it to replacement players," Melendez said. "The board will investigate the charge. If the board doesn't believe you can draw the inference from that statement, they'll say so. But we think you can draw the inference."
Melendez also said that contrary to another report, the Yankees' Scott Kamieniecki, who also made comments about strikebreakers, was not included in the charge because he is not a player representative.
 
Richards vs. Bush
 In what might be the generally nastiest and angriest midterm campaigns ever, much worse has been said about candidates for public office, but a campaign spokesman for Gov. Ann Richards of Texas recently made some comments about George W. Bush, her Republican opponent, that were far off base.
Bill Cryer, the spokesman for the Democratic Governor, criticized Bush for his "his hands-off management style" of running the Texas Rangers.
"He doesn't know what's really going on and apparently doesn't really care," Cryer said of Bush, one of the Rangers' two managing partners. "I think his management of the Texas Rangers mostly consists of sitting in the stands and watching games -- when they had games."
Political views aside, Cryer could not have been more wrong. It is true that when Bush began running for Governor he distanced himself from the day-to-day operation of the Rangers, but he was involved in the recent selection of Doug Melvin as the club's new general manager and before he became a candidate, he was the most vigorous supporter of the baseball operation.
Bush always opposed cutting funds for scouting and player development, and he didn't stop the baseball people from spending to get good experienced players. In fact, as much as he would like to be governor, the Rangers will be better off if he loses Tuesday. Bush's involvement also could be beneficial to baseball's labor problems.
The Texas race, incidentally, has developed an interesting stretch-run matchup: Ross Perot versus Nolan Ryan. Perot has endorsed Richards while Ryan has been spending his own money in support of Bush.

HEADLINE: Marathon Stories Almost Outnumber the Runners

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
As they stream by his Brooklyn church today, the Rev. David Dyson says he will honor the New York Marathon runners from the pulpit, summoning Isaiah's prophecy that the young shall run and not be weary. But he will also read from the first verse of the 12th chapter of Hebrews, in which Paul speaks of runners being surrounded "by a great cloud of witnesses."
It is this verse that inspired the mural surrounding the inside of the church, which depicts "a cloud" of neighborhood folks from street people to firefighters to a kilt-wearing chap playing a bagpipe to, yes, runners in sweats. 
 "The marathon is for everybody in New York who can sweat and get sore feet -- and that includes all of us," said Mr. Dyson, pastor of the Lafayette Avenue Presbyterian Church in Fort Greene. "Occasionally, the little miracles of grace do occur."
Through the church's open doors, worshipers will be able to glimpse a tide of 27,000 runners, about a third of the way through a tour of 26.2 miles and zones of sometimes inexpressible pain. The runners come from nearby -- a firefighter from the neighborhood company, a delivery man from a local supermarket -- and from every state and 100 countries.
They will huff past two million people, maybe more, from myriad places themselves -- standing on curbs, relaxing on lounge chairs, sipping soft drinks and taking pride in someone else's immense accomplishment.
The marathon has transformed the city for almost a week: Central Park has been filled with faster runners than usual, and sporting goods stores are crowded with customers eager to buy running shoes. The observation decks of the World Trade Center and Empire State Building are packed, restaurants serve mountains of such high-carb delicacies as pumpkin ravioli and some poorly heeled contestants from out-of-town find accommodations on strangers' floors.
"It's one of the few events that makes the city seem like a huge amount of fun," said Bruce Blank, the owner of Paragon Sporting Goods at Broadway and 18th Street, who was giving away lunch outside on Friday. The store hired four translators just for the week.
At Fitzpatrick's Hotel on Lexington Avenue (between 56th and 57th Streets), a group of 30 runners from Ireland has been staying. They are led by the world-class runner Eamonn Coughlan, but say they are equally inspired by the chief of New York's Police Department, John Timoney, who ran last Sunday in the Dublin Marathon and was planning to return yesterday to run in New York today.
"There's going to be a wild party here," promised the hotel's owner, John Fitzpatrick, who promised corned beef and cabbage, Irish stew, smoked salmon and something to wash them down.
And if ever this city is a glorious mosaic it is on Marathon Day, with the human spectator landscape changing as much as the tide of runners flowing by: a clump of French here, a pocket of Argentines over there, the Mexicans out ahead with the Africans.
Along Fourth Avenue in Bay Ridge, the first neighborhood runners pass in their long journey through Brooklyn, the Scandinavians are almost gone, but the Arabs who have bought many of the stores will cheer. In Sunset Park, the next neighborhood, Chinese are increasingly prominent in the still largely Hispanic crowd. National flags are always in evidence, along with special words of encouragement for compatriots.
Nowhere is the constant flux of things more apparent than in Brooklyn's Williamsburg section, where Hasidic supporters have long passed out glasses of seltzer instead of water to runners. An emerging Mexican-American population there eagerly anticipates cheering for the many elite runners their native land has produced in recent years.
"I think a Mexican will win; I just don't know which one," said Hector Martinez, who owns a tiny restaurant called Valle Mexico along the marathon route at 280 Bedford Avenue. He plans to drape a huge Mexican flag outside and set up tables to sell tacos.
It all rings melodically at the municipal cash register, with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani estimating that this year's marathon will mean $100 million to the city's economy. More than that, the race offers an image of the city decidedly different from the many television series about the N.Y.P.D. "It gives a little depth to the normal picture of New York," said Richard Altman, spokesman for the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. "And it gives us an opportunity to remind people we have five boroughs."
For those who live here, this long, winding course makes the event different from the much shorter holiday parades on Fifth Avenue or the Macy's Thanksgiving parade on the West Side. "We bring the race to the people, not the people to the race," said Allan Steinfeld, president of the New York Road Runners Club, sponsor of the race. "You have to go to a parade."
It is hard to describe how much the race means to participants, particularly the many who never imagined they could do such a thing. Gary Baronofsky, a Brooklyn Pepsi delivery man, ran the race in 1984, and still carries in his wallet a picture of himself crossing the finish line that he'll be glad to show you. On his second date with Shelley, the woman he married five years ago, he showed her a video of his marathon in which he appears for perhaps five seconds passing another mid-pack runner.
"The marathon is one of the great New York moments," he said. "It's like the seventh game of the N.B.A. playoffs and you're Willis Reed coming out to center court, or you're Muhammad Ali at center stage in the Garden."
For families, it's the same story. Michele Hagen plans to send her husband, Claude, a firefighter in the Bronx, off for his first marathon from a house festooned with inspirational posters. Afterward, she plans to call her family in Sicily to report his certain success.
Manfred Klein, a businessman from Hamburg, Germany, is running his first New York City Marathon since 1970, the year the event began. His wife, Ulla, says she has been monitoring his training menu closely, crammming him mainly with bananas and noodles. "He will finish between 10 and 25,000," she predicted.
To be sure, the marathon can have its dark side. Dr. William Fried, associate director of psychiatric residency training at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn, notes that anorexic women tend to be runners, and that for runners in general the pursuit of perfection can sometimes get out of hand.
"You can see it as a symbol of the rat race we engage in every day," he said. "There is a mean-spirited way to approach it."
Indeed, marathon preparation can be a threat to marriages. Raoul Felder, the divorce lawyer, says complaints about the time a spouse spends training have been the death knell of many matches. And in at least two instances, he says wayward husbands used marathon preparation as an excuse for liaisons.
One was caught by his wife because he never came back sweaty. The other thought he was being shrewd and always wet his clothes after visiting a woman friend a block south on Park Avenue. But one day he forgot to wet his underwear and the jig was up. "I don't know how he did in the marathon," Mr. Felder said.
This year the marathon has actually changed the shape of the city. The Vernon Avenue Bridge in Long Island City, Queens, was scheduled for demolition as part of a new development project, but appears to have been at least temporarily spared. "Because it was on the marathon route, the bridge is still there," said Rochelle Wyner, a member of a community group fighting to save it.
But some things may be less susceptible to change. Anna Moses, a spokesman for Weight Watchers International, promised to try to find some members who run. Though she didn't expect marathoners, she couldn't find anybody.
"Our members don't like the 'e' word," she confessed, referring to exercise.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: GOLISANO;
Perot Backs Golisano as a Shaker-Up in His Own Image

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
There was an unmistakable pride of authorship in Ross Perot's eyes yesterday as he stood next to B. Thomas Golisano and backed the businessman's independent bid to become governor of New York. Mr. Perot may have met Mr. Golisano only once before, but he clearly discerned a candidate very much in his own image.
"Tom has lived the American dream, and he is determined to pass it on," Mr. Perot said, using phrases almost identical to the ones he used to describe himself two years ago. "He's putting his time, his money and his reputation on the line for the people of New York State and the United States." 
 Both men, in fact, are very wealthy entrepreneurs in the data-processing business who are willing to spend millions of their own money to make a political point. Both are essentially conservatives, appalled at what they see as the excesses of the two-party system. Both are convinced that their experience as chief executives is the best possible qualification for governance.
But while Mr. Golisano does not share Mr. Perot's sandpaper personality, neither does he have anything like the Texan's way with a crowd. At yesterday's endorsement appearance in Manhattan, Mr. Perot described Mr. Golisano's candidacy as, variously, a shot heard round the world, electroshock therapy to the political system, a Weimaraner at the gate and an alligator emerging from the swamp. The best that the somber, earnest Mr. Golisano could do was claim to be an iceberg headed for the two parties.
Mr. Perot's menagerie of symbols seemed to underline his depiction of Mr. Golisano as basically a symbolic candidate. Reflecting Mr. Golisano's standing in the polls -- he typically draws 5 to 10 percent, impressive for a third-party candidate but still not competitive -- Mr. Perot said almost nothing about what Mr. Golisano would do in office. Instead he praised him simply for running at all as a third-party candidate.
The effect of those who vote for him, Mr. Perot said, will be mostly to shake up the political system.
"If you want political change in America, if you want a third party established as a tangible signal to Albany and Washington, go ahead and vote for Tom Golisano on Tuesday and you will be making history, big history in this country," he said. "It can be the beginning of a new direction in American politics."
Mr. Perot rejected the notion that by endorsing Mr. Golisano, who has been drawing support from voters who might otherwise have supported the Republican candidate, State Senator George E. Pataki, he was actually helping the Democrat in the race, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
He had heard himself called a spoiler during his entire Presidential run, he said, adding that those who see him and his endorsements solely in those terms are missing his point, which is to support a third party.
Actually, though, Mr. Golisano is the only independent among the four candidates Mr. Perot has endorsed this year. He has campaigned for George Nethercutt, the Republican trying to unseat House Speaker Thomas S. Foley in Washington State, and for Gov. Ann Richards, Democrat of Texas, and yesterday at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey he endorsed Democratic Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who he also said was living the American dream.
"Frank Lautenberg is an independent," Mr. Perot explained. "They say, 'Ross, he is a Democrat.' Oh, he is a Democrat. But I have watched him up close go nose to nose with the Democratic party, when he disagreed with them on the Clinton economic plan. He voted against it and that takes courage."
There is, as always, little detectable pattern in Mr. Perot's series of endorsements beyond what may be a rewarding of like-minded entrepreneurs or a settling of scores with opponents. Some New York Republicans have charged that Mr. Perot is doing a favor for Mr. Cuomo, who has become a telephone friend of his in the last two years. But those in Mr. Golisano's camp insist the Texan simply agreed with his philosophy.
"We asked him about endorsing maybe six or eight weeks ago," said Gordon Black, Mr. Golisano's campaign manager and a former pollster for Mr. Perot. "I think he's been kicking it around as a possibility. He wanted to see what kind of a campaign we were running, and I guess he wouldn't have come up if he didn't like it."
Beyond the adrenaline shot of publicity that it gives to Mr. Golisano, the effect of Mr. Perot's endorsement is not easy to determine. Though he won 16 percent of the Presidential vote in New York two years ago, many of his supporters have drifted away from him or grown weary of his personality.
His grass-roots organization, United We Stand America, has splintered into several different groups, some loyal to him and others proudly in dissent. One group that broke from him, United We Stand America-New York, has endorsed Mr. Pataki, while many other Perot supporters are working for Mr. Cuomo.
Susan Stehling, a Rochester resident who was formerly Mr. Perot's regional campaign coordinator for the nine-county Finger Lakes area, says he now holds little sway among his former voters.
"His message was the right message at the time, but most people have turned against him now," said Ms. Stehling, who is now a volunteer for Mr. Cuomo. "I don't think he's going to change anyone's vote."
Alex Rodriguez, president of the New York splinter group that backs Mr. Pataki, said New Yorkers did not appreciate a Texan's telling them how to vote, and she questioned whether Mr. Golisano would hold the same appeal that Mr. Perot once did.
"He's not charismatic like Perot is," Mr. Rodriguez said. "He doesn't fire people up. People are looking for someone who's going to save them, and he doesn't fill the bill."
A festive rally late yesterday afternoon in Rochester, Mr. Golisano's hometown, drew about 100 people to hear the two men, and each had his supporters. Warren Schmidt, a member of United We Stand from Rochester, said he had attended to hear Mr. Perot and believed the endorsement could make a difference for those still on the fence.
"This could be the beginning in this state of a third party," Mr. Schmidt said amid the balloons and marching-band music. "We need to take a different tack, not just Republicans and Democrats."
Mr. Golisano, who might otherwise have had a hard time getting attention this weekend, made it clear he was grateful for the endorsement.
"I think this is of tremendous importance," he said yesterday. "I think the fact that somebody of Mr. Perot's stature recognizes the importance of third-party movements in this state, and is willing to travel here and energize the third-party movement, I think it's indicative of this iceberg I talked about coming to the two-party system."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: LEGISLATURE;
Democrats On Defensive In a Handful Of Contests

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
The Democrats are on the defensive in a handful of contested legislative races around New York State this year, and while the Republicans could pick up seats in both the Assembly and the Senate, the gains would not upset the balance of power in either house and seem unlikely to have any sway in the death-penalty debate.
In the Assembly, where 100 of the 150 members are Democrats, officials from both parties estimate that the majority could lose up to seven or eight seats, though it will probably be fewer. In the Senate, where 35 of the 61 members are Republicans, both parties have concentrated efforts on two tough races in the Rochester area currently held by Democrats. 
 There does not appear to be a blanket reason for the Democrats' potential weakness this year, officials in both parties say: over the last decade, the Democrats have lost seats in every year when there is no Presidential election, except for 1990, because lower turnout seems to favor local Republicans.
And while many races have focused purely on local issues and personalities, Republicans say that their party's themes -- crime, taxes and, in some cases, the tensions between the Republican upstate and the Democratic New York City -- are playing better this year.
"Frankly, the discontent that people are feeling throughout the state concerning the economy and crime are issues where the Republican Party has more credibility with the voters than the Democrats," said Assemblyman John J. Faso, Republican of Kinderhook, who oversees his party's election efforts in the Assembly. "We're seeing that nationally as well."
But any shift in seats will apparently not affect the annual drive for the death penalty, which would probably be a moot issue anyway if State Senator George E. Pataki, the Republican candidate for governor who supports the measure, beats Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. For 12 years, Mr. Cuomo has vetoed death penalty legislation, but the Assembly has been unable to muster the two-thirds vote to override his veto.
This year, supporters of the measure in the Assembly stand to pick up only two, at most three, new pro-death-penalty votes, in addition to the estimated 95 current supporters. That remains short of the 100 votes required for an override, if Mr. Cuomo is elected and continues to veto the measure, as he has vowed.
In the Senate, money from both parties has been pouring into two Rochester districts, where two freshmen Democrats fight to hold onto their seats.
In the 54th District, there is a rematch between the incumbent, Richard A. Dollinger, who beat his challenger, Ralph Quattrociocci, a four-term State Senator, in a Democratic primary two years ago. Mr. Quattrociocci has since registered Republican.
In the 55th District, Mary Ellen Jones, the incumbent, a former school teacher, is facing a challenge from Carol Ellis McManus, a Republican Monroe County legislator, in a district where Republicans outnumber Democrats.
There is also a battle for the Republican Senate seat currently held by Mr. Pataki, representing Putnam County and parts of Westchester and Dutchess Counties. In the 37th District, Alfred B. DelBello, a Democrat and the Lieutenant Governor in Mr. Cuomo's first term, is running against Vincent L. Leibell 3d, a Republican Assemblyman, in what looks like a tight race.
Also, in what has been a Democratic seat in Albany, Michael Hoblock, the first Republican county executive in decades, is fighting James McCaffrey, a former Albany county director of social services and a Democrat.
State Senator Martin Connor, the Brooklyn Democrat who will become the body's minority leader next session, said: "I'll be happy if we maintain 26 seats. I'll be delighted if we gain one or two. And I'm prepared to be down one."
In the Assembly, the closer races have concentrated upstate in the suburbs.
On Long Island, in the Third District, the incumbent Democrat, I. William Bianchi, faces a challenge from Debra Mazzarelli, who owns a real-estate brokerage.
In the 96th District, an open seat which has been represented by a Democrat, Michael Murphy, a Democrat who heads the public works in Poughkeepsie, faces Thomas Kirwan, a Republican and former state trooper.
In the 97th District, representing parts of Dutchess, Greene and Columbia Counties, Eileen M. Hickey, the incumbent Democrat, is running against Joel Miller, a Republican and a dentist who has never run for office.

The Election: A Voters' Guide To the Candidates

 BODY:

UNITED STATES SENATE
 
CANDIDATES
FRANK R. LAUTENBERG, 70, Democrat. Elected to the United States Senate in 1982; no experience in elective politics before that. A millionaire businessman who co-founded one of the most successful computing services in the world, Automatic Data Processing. Born in Paterson, now lives in Cliffside Park. Has raised $7.4 million for this race.
GARABED (CHUCK) HAYTAIAN, 56, Republican. An electrical engineer first elected to the State Assembly in 1981; Speaker of the Assembly since 1992, which makes him the third most powerful elected official in New Jersey. Born in the Bronx, now lives in Independence, in rural Warren County. Has raised $4.4 million.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	ANDREA LIPPI, independent
RICHARD J. PEZZULLO, Conservative Party
GEORGE PATRICK PREDHAM, independent
ARLENE GOLD, Natural Law Party
JOANNE KUNIANSKY, Socialist Workers Party
BEN GRINDLINGER, Libertarian Party
MICHAEL P. KELLY, independent
 
THE ISSUES
Politically, the candidates are polar opposites -- Mr. Lautenberg's politics are liberal to moderate and Mr. Haytaian is a strict conservative. The centerpiece of Mr. Haytaian's campaign is a flat Federal income tax, and one of his campaign props is a slick brochure outlining 94 ways to cut waste and spending in Washington. Mr. Lautenberg says the tax plan is a fraud that would add $1 trillion to the national deficit over five years; he calls other Haytaian ideas unworkable or unoriginal.
Although both candidates have been in office a long time, each is trying to cast himself as the outsider and his rival as the career politician. At times, however, Mr. Lautenberg portrays himself as an inside outsider, saying that he would be able to do more for New Jersey as a third-term Senator than Mr. Haytaian would as a novice in Washington.
 
ANALYSIS
Though polls throughout the campaign have shown Mr. Lautenberg with a comfortable lead, the New Jersey electorate is notorious for last-minute volatility and there is still a large bloc of undecided voters.
Mr. Lautenberg needs a good turnout from the traditionally Democratic urban areas. A year ago, Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, lost to Christine Todd Whitman by about 25,000 votes out of 2.5 million votes cast, largely because he did poorly and she did surprisingly well on that kind of turf. For Mr. Haytaian to win, he must rally his bedrock of conservative voters and the rest of the Republican faithful, but as importantly, he must match Mrs. Whitman's performance in urban areas, particularly among black voters.
 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 
SECOND DISTRICT CANDIDATES
FRANK A. LOBIONDO, 48. Republican from Vineland, a State Assemblyman who works as the operations manager for his family's trucking business. A former member of the Cumberland County Board of Freeholders, first elected to the State Assembly in 1987. Has earned a reputation as its most conservative member. Sponsored law making "stalking" a crime. Lost 1992 race for Congress against the Democratic incumbent, William J. Hughes.
LOUIS N. MAGAZZU, 37, Democrat from Vineland. A lawyer, currently the solicitor for the city of Vineland; has never held elected office.
 
THE DISTRICT
Before 1974, the Second could be counted on to vote Republican. But Mr. Hughes rode to victory that year on the Watergate wave that swept dozens of Democrats into office. In spite of his party label, his conservative politics and his support of environmental protection, anti-crime legislation and senior-citizen issues helped him hold on to that office for 20 years before he decided earlier this year to retire. It is expected that with the popular Mr. Hughes now off the political scene, the district will return a Republican to office.
 
THE ISSUES
Mr. LoBiondo has campaigned unwaveringly on conservative beliefs: lower taxes, spending cuts and reduction of the Federal Government. Mr. Magazzu has stressed fighting crime as the main theme of his campaign, including championing gun control laws.
 
ANALYSIS
In land mass, southern New Jersey's sprawling Second District -- which encompasses all of Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland and Salem counties and parts of Gloucester and Burlington counties, is the largest in the state. In politics, it is bedrock Republican and conservative. In 1992, registered Republicans outnumbered Democrats 85,000 to 70,000 with about 150,000 unaffiliated voters. If Mr. LoBiondo loses, it will rank as a major Election Day upset. The Republican candidate has raised more money than his opponent by a 3-to-1 margin and polls show him with at least a 30-point lead.
The race has significance beyond even the impressive boundaries of the Second. Under the redistricting that reduced the New Jersey Congressional delegation to 13, Mr. Hughes's lock on the Second District gave Democrats a 7-to-6 majority. The majority will assuredly shift to the Republicans on Nov. 8. In practice, it will give the Republicans little more than political bragging rights, but it will be another blow to the political psyche of New Jersey's Democrats, who in the last four years have also lost control of both chambers of the Legislature and the Governor's mansion.
 
EIGHTH DISTRICT CANDIDATES
HERB KLEIN, 64, a Democrat and a lawyer from Clifton. Served in the State Assembly for four years in the 1970's. Won Congressional seat two years ago in an expensive and bitter race. A prominent Democratic fund-raiser between his two stints in elected office, Mr. Klein spent more than $500,000 of his own money and $1.2 million overall in his victory two years ago.
BILL MARTINI, 47, a Republican and a lawyer from Clifton. Served on Clifton City Council and is a Passaic County Freeholder; also a former Assistant United States Attorney for New Jersey.
 
THE DISTRICT
The Eighth was redesigned two years ago after New Jersey lost one of its 14 Congressional seats as a result of the 1990 Census. When Representative Robert A. Roe, a 12-term Democrat, saw the new district lines, he decided to retire. The district, once a haven for Democrats, is now highly competitive. It includes the blue-collar urban centers of Paterson and Passaic, as well as suburban towns like Glen Ridge, Cedar Grove and Verona.
 
THE ISSUES
Both candidates say fear of crime is the chief concern of voters, with the economy, taxes and government spending also high on the list. Mr. Klein points to the recently enacted Federal crime bill as the first initiative coming out of Washington in years that offers real hope of increasing public safety. Mr. Martini calls the bill "pork laden," with programs that have little to do with crime-fighting. He has said that only the certainty of prison sentences will reduce violent crime. Mr. Klein said he voted against the Clinton budget because it did not have enough spending cuts, and has consistently opposed tax increases that affect the middle class. Mr. Martini charges that his opponent later voted for all the spending proposals in the budget he opposed and that he repeatedly passed up opportunities to vote for further deficit reductions.
 
ANALYSIS
Leaders in both parties agree that this is the closest Congressional race in the state this year. Both sides have spent heavily on campaign advertising and have been supported by visits from party luminaries from outside the state.

JOHN G. ROWLAND, 37, Republican. Congressman from Waterbury from 1985-91, barely lost the 1990 race for governor, member of House Armed Services Committee. Consultant since 1990 for several military contractors based in Connecticut.
TOM SCOTT, 36, radio talk-show host, State Senator from 1981-1991, led anti-income tax movement in 1991, ran unsuccessfully for United States House of Representatives in 1990 and 1992.
 
THE ISSUES
The state income tax, imposed in 1991, has been the central issue. Mr. Rowland and Mr. Scott promise to scrap it without raising other taxes. Mrs. Groark would not change the income tax, and Mr. Curry wants to keep it and economize elsewhere to provide money to cities and towns to cut property taxes. All candidates have called for expanded efforts to reduce crime, and all four favor the death penalty. Mrs. Groark has been attacked over the Weicker administration's policy of giving tax breaks and cash incentives to attract and retain companies, an approach she favors. Mr. Rowland and Mr. Scott says tax cuts would do more for the economy than such incentives. Mr. Curry would shift economic assistance to smaller companies.
 
ANALYSIS
Mr. Rowland has been the front-runner since the campaign began, and has had a large advantage in financing, spending much of his money on television commercials. But Mr. Scott, who appeals to many of the same conservatives, has drawn off some support, and many voters, particularly women, have been troubled by Mr. Rowland's efforts to suppress a police report on a domestic dispute with his ex-wife in April. After a surprise primary victory, Mr. Curry has campaigned aggressively, but in a close race he may lose critical votes to Mrs. Groark.

UNITED STATES SENATE
 
CANDIDATES
GERALD LABRIOLA, 62, Republican, retired pediatrician, State Senator from 1981-83, ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 1982 and for the Republican nomination for governor in 1982 and 1986.
JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN, 52, Democrat, United States Senator since 1991; State Attorney General from 1983-89, State Senator from 1971-81.
 
THE ISSUES
Mr. Lieberman's TV advertising depicts him as an advocate for creating jobs, fighting crime and making Congress more accountable. Dr. Labriola, relying largely on handshaking and yard signs, assails Mr. Lieberman for backing President Clinton's budget plan last year, calling it the largest tax increase in history. Dr. Labriola says Mr. Lieberman "fakes right and votes left."
 
ANALYSIS
Mr. Lieberman has had a commanding lead in the polls from the beginning and a huge advantage in fund raising, allowing him to air television commercials that focus on his family and his achievements and do not mention his opponent. Dr. Labriola has had little money for television ads. Some Democratic Party analysts have predicted the most lopsided victory in state history.
 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 
SECOND DISTRICT CANDIDATES
SAM GEJDENSON, 45, Democrat, dean of the Connecticut delegation to the House of Representatives, seeking his eighth term.
EDWARD W. MUNSTER, 53, Republican, a retired statistician at Pfizer. Served one two-year term in the State Senate before challenging Mr. Gejdenson in 1992, a race he narrowly lost.
 
THE DISTRICT
The Second Congressional District is the state's largest, geographically, covering most of eastern Connecticut. It has been in flux economically as military jobs have declined and as gambling and tourism jobs have increased with the rise of the Foxwoods casino in Ledyard.
 
THE ISSUES
Mr. Munster campaigned last time on the argument that Mr. Gejdenson had lost his local bearings after more than a decade in Congress. This time, the debate has centered more on effectiveness. Mr. Munster's commercials attack Mr. Gejdenson's attendance record for major votes. Mr. Gejdenson's commercials say Mr. Munster failed to do much of note as a State Senator.
 
ANALYSIS
Mr. Gejdenson did not appear to take Mr. Munster seriously in 1992, but he is fighting hard this time, trading blow for blow in a negative campaign that seems to have shifted the advantage to Mr. Gejdenson. He has portrayed his Washington savvy as reaping huge benefits for the district in business for military contractors.
 
FIFTH DISTRICT CANDIDATES
GARY A. FRANKS, 41, Republican, seeking his third term, the first black Republican elected to the House of Representatives in 60 years. Former labor-relations executive.
JAMES H. MALONEY, 46, Democrat, State Senator from Danbury since 1986.
 
THE DISTRICT
The district is economically diverse, encompassing wealthy enclaves like Wilton and Ridgefield and blue-collar cities like Waterbury and Meriden. Once a Democratic stronghold, it was seized by the Republicans in the 1984 Reagan landslide.
 
THE ISSUES
Mr. Maloney, with far less name recognition or money than his opponent, has tried to portray Mr. Franks as a Congressman more interested in gaining a national reputation than serving constituents. Mr. Franks has contended that Mr. Maloney has no real agenda to pursue if elected.
 
ANALYSIS
Mr. Franks was considered vulnerable in 1992, when Bill Clinton carried Connecticut in the Presidential election, but he won with a 43 percent plurality when two Democrats -- one running as an independent -- split the Democratic vote. This year, he could benefit from having John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate for governor, on the ticket. Mr. Rowland represented the district from 1985 to 1991, and remains popular there.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: NEW JERSEY;
A Negative Lautenberg and Haytaian

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 5

 BODY:
In New Jersey, it's all the other guy's fault.
The Democrat is soft on crime and big on raising taxes, and an incumbent to boot. The Republican is a hypocrite who consorts with racists, and besides, that was a pretty expensive parking garage he voted for. 
 The polls show that New Jersey's voters are angry at government and cynical about the promises politicians make. If that is so, the television commercials produced for the United States Senate race between Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, the Democrat, and Chuck Haytaian, the Republican challenger, are tailor-made for a public in the mood to hear bad news about politicians.
Only two of Mr. Lautenberg's six television commercials are positive in the sense that they speak to his own record, and do not mention Mr. Haytaian. None of the six television commercial released by Mr. Haytaian, the Speaker of the General Assembly and less well known in the state than the senator, focus solely on himself and his accomplishments.
"Between 75 percent and 90 percent of the information we get about campaigns we glean from commercials," said Steven A. Miller, an instructor at the Rutgers University department of journalism and mass media. "What strikes me about this race is that Lautenberg's commercials and Haytaian's commercials all seem to be about the same information, and they meld together after a while -- they even use the same colors and the same style."
While both campaigns also use mailings and newspaper ads, they are putting by far a majority of their money into television.
When they do speak of themselves, the candidates seem to be reciting the same political text: Each has commercials promising to be tough on crime and tougher on taxes. Mr. Lautenberg adds his sponsorship of legislation to prevent the dumping of sewage sludge in the ocean -- a potent message for shore-conscious New Jerseyans -- and to toughen Federal penalties for rape.
Mr. Haytaian stresses his support for the death penalty, which Mr. Lautenberg opposes, and he makes full use of his most important ally, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. Mrs. Whitman, who is hugely popular right now, appears in three Haytaian commercials as a polished and soothing witness for the gravel-voiced and rough-edged speaker's virtues as a champion of tax cuts.
When attacking each other, the candidates use the same themes. Each calls the other a longtime incumbent, Mr. Lautenberg for his 12 years in the Senate, Mr. Haytaian for 20 years in public life, counting back to two years on a school board.
Each attacks the other for votes for spending bills and tax increases.
These themes reflect the public's interests, according to an Oct. 24 poll conducted by Rutgers's Eagleton Institute of Politics and The Star-Ledger of Newark.
Crime topped the respondents' list of major concerns, cited by 20 percent of probable voters. Job creation and the economy, unmentioned by either candidate in television ads, was second, with 14 percent, and taxes, Mr. Haytaian's major emphasis, was mentioned by 9 percent. Issues stressed in other states, like schools, patriotism and family issues, are untouched in the New Jersey race in the advertisements.
The negativity of both sides' ads also elicited a negative response from poll respondents. Of those who had seen Mr. Haytaian's ads, 39 percent said they had made them less likely to vote for him, and 28 percent said the ads made a Haytaian vote more likely.
For viewers of Mr. Lautenberg's commercials, 38 percent said they were less likely to vote for him and 34 percent said more likely.
Most of Mr. Lautenberg's attack ads have focused on Mr. Haytaian's tenure as a New Jersey assemblyman, including a spot devoted to the construction of a badly needed but expensive underground parking garage for the State House. Aware that reporters these days check the veracity of each side's commercials, the Lautenberg campaign investigated the costs of all of New Jersey Transit's parking decks and the Short Hills Hilton's underground garage to buttress its claim that the new Capitol parking garage will cost three times as much per parking space as other garages.
But it was a Lautenberg advertisement released on Wednesday that provoked a particular uproar, not only among Republicans, but also in negative coverage in the press.
The commercial strikes heavily at Mr. Haytaian's refusal, so far, to disavow his friendship with Bob Grant, the sometimes crudely spoken and always conservative host of an afternoon radio talk show on WABC in New York City.
Asking "How much do you know about Chuck Haytaian?" the ad builds a triple-decker assault. It illustrates the Speaker's opposition, on constitutional grounds, to a law to stop demonstrations around abortion clinics with footage of a wild melee between protesters and the police. It treats Mr. Haytaian's efforts to overturn a state ban on certain semiautomatic firearms with a scene showing a bullet-spitting machine gun of a type which is federally regulated, outlawed in all states and not the subject of the New Jersey ban.
And the commercial finishes up with some of Mr. Grant's barely printable comments while aiming at separating Mr. Haytaian from Mrs. Whitman's appeal.
"Grant calls blacks 'savages,' " reads the voice, over a throbbing musical score. "Governor Whitman renounced Grant, Haytaian called Grant to offer his support. Pro-life extremists. The national gun lobby. Racists. They're all supporting Chuck Haytaian. Should you?"
Mr. Haytaian's reaction to this, the hardest-hitting commercial from either side, may be significant. While state Republicans from Mrs. Whitman on down sharply deplored what they said was the commercial's inflammatory tone, the candidate seemed almost to get a lift from it.
"Desperate people do desperate things," he told interviewers on Wednesday. And, perhaps mindful of Mr. Grant's large following among conservative voters in the state, Mr. Haytaian would not be drawn into condemning the talk-show host's racial remarks.
For his part, Mr. Haytaian, 56, portrays the Senator, who is 70, as nearly doddering with age. A clip of the Senator played in slow motion makes Mr. Lautenberg shake his head at his own suitability for office.
Mr. Haytaian's favorite commercial, judging by its frequent broadcast, does not even feature him. Instead, it shows citizens being interviewed on the street and reacting negatively to Senator Lautenberg's two terms, his opposition to the death penalty and his votes for spending bills.
One element that has not turned up in this season of commercials is the last-minute spot known in political lingo as the "warm and fuzzy."
"Usually the pattern is for the candidates to hit hard and try to define their opponent before the opponent defines him, and then, with about a week to go, to come out with the warm and fuzzy ads about themselves," Mr. Miller said. "But in this race, we're not seeing that. They're both hitting hard."

Civil Rights Act Failed,
Movement Veterans Say

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn., Nov. 5

 BODY:
Veterans of the civil-rights battles of 30 years ago gathered at Connecticut College on Friday to reflect on the movement they led, but they agreed they had little to celebrate.
Herbert Hill, a professor of African-American studies and industrial relations at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, told a crowd of about 250 civil-rights advocates, teachers and students that the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a high point in the history of the movement and that there has been a retreat ever since. 
 "It is tragic to see what has now happened," said Mr. Hill, who was involved in the original drafting of the equal employment provision of the Civil Rights Act. "The movement failed to eliminate the great disparity in the economic status of blacks and whites."
Mr. Hill, who spent more than 20 years on the staff of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, speculated that if the law were to come to a vote today, it would die.
"As far as I'm concerned, this is not a celebration. It's a funeral for the Civil Rights Act," he said. "Abolishing legal racism does not produce racial equality."
Nicholas D. Katzenbach, the former United States Attorney General responsible for implementing the law during the Johnson administration, called the Civil Rights Act "a drop in a very large bucket."
"It did nothing, nothing for the great mass of African-Americans citizens in this country," Mr. Katzenbach said. As long as blacks are subjected to poor education, poor housing, unemployment and crime, there will be racial discrimination, he said, because some whites will "feel they're superior."

HEADLINE: Religions Are Putting Faith in Environmentalism

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
Considering that insulation, energy-saving light bulbs and low-flow shower heads are sold along with menorahs and seder plates, the gift shop at Temple Adath Joseph might seem like a one-stop shop for the observant and conservation-minded handyman. Rabbi Jeffrey Glickman considers all the items to be Judaica, and he will even help install them.
"The concept of the environment is central to Judaism," said Rabbi Glickman, who also talks about ecology at services at the Reform temple in St. Joseph, Mo. "God, who could have done any number of things to talk to Elijah, didn't waste. He used the smallest possible means for communication: the still, small voice. We should choose the same." 
 More and more religious groups nationwide are choosing to renew -- or begin -- an examination of their responsibility to the environment. Evidence comes in several forms: inserts about recycling in the bulletins handed out at Southern Baptist services, a new magazine called Green Cross that is devoted to a Bible-based approach to ecology, and a new nationwide coalition that is urging Protestants, Catholics and Jews to incorporate the environment into their congregational life.
Whether the efforts are purely educational or have a more specific goal, like cleaning up a neighborhood, most share a common thread: They are firmly rooted in the believers' religious traditions.
For some groups, this means making sure no one interprets their actions as a New Age form of pantheism, the belief that the divine resides in all aspects of the natural world. Others are concerned about building a theological foundation distinct from the secular environmental movement, whose liberal bent could offend more conservative believers.
"We make it very clear, we do not worship creation, we worship the God of creation," said Richard Land, the executive director of the Southern Baptist Convention's Christian Life Commission. "What we're trying to do is combat what is a real bad image among rank-and-file Southern Baptists about the environmental movement, while at the same time speak to our concern for the environment. For us to join with other groups that don't speak expressly in Biblical terms dilutes our message."
The Southern Baptist Convention has produced a book on environmental issues and a series of bulletin inserts on conservation, recycling and pollution reduction. The publications emphasize biblical foundations for the messages, noting that the Bible said God took joy in His creation and that it was up to people to preserve and develop it responsibly.
Bruce Hamilton, national conservation director of the Sierra Club, which has helped some religious groups in poor communities organize against pollution, said he welcomed the religious involvement.
"I see the churches as one natural and very helpful ally," he said. "Ultimately, there can be no justice without environmental justice."
The Rev. Thomas Berry, a Roman Catholic priest of the Passionist order, who has written extensively on the link between faith and ecological responsibility, said the issue cuts to the heart of humanity's relationship to the spiritual. The destruction of nature, he said, is as much a loss to the soul as it is to the earth.
"We need the experience of the natural world to activate our emotions and our sense of the sublime," he said. "If we do not have this experience, or these wonderful natural phenomena are destroyed or disfigured, then our experience of the divine is disfigured."
Earlier this year, a coalition called the Religious Partnership for the Environment mailed 53,000 information kits to Catholic, Jewish and Protestant congregations across the country, urging them to integrate the environment into their traditions of worship and social action.
The kits sent to Roman Catholic parishes, for example, talk about the statements on the environment made by Pope John Paul II and Catholic bishops, and feature ways to introduce themes on caring for the earth into the liturgy.
In June, Clinton Administration officials, led by Vice President Al Gore, met with members of the partnership. Paul Gorman, executive director of the partnership, said he and his colleagues were not asked to endorse any legislation or testify at hearings. In a way, he said, Administration officials wanted spiritual counsel.
"They were looking for a deeper, moral vision in how to frame the environmental issue and communicate it to mainstream America," he said. "They came back to how the major obstacles they faced were individualism, greed and social fragmentation. If the religious community cannot address these conditions, who will?"
Christian evangelical leaders were looking for answers themselves when they convened earlier this month in Michigan for discussions on the environment. Also this month, the first issue of Green Cross magazine, a new publication devoted to a Bible-rooted approach to ecology, will feature articles about congregations that saved energy or reduced waste, as well as tips on starting similar activities.
Congregational responses have ranged from establishing ecology discussion groups and encouraging home recycling to demanding action from public officials.
In Dallas, members of the New Waverly Baptist Church persuaded city officials to open up a clinic at the church, which is near a closed lead smelting plant. Pollution from the plant, which closed more than 10 years ago, was thought to be responsible for rashes and headaches, among other problems, which are treated at the clinic.
Augustana Lutheran Church, a Chicago congregation that belongs to the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, performed an energy audit that resulted in the installation of energy-saving lights. The change sliced a third off the church's electric bill and prompted the metropolitan Chicago synod to establish a revolving loan fund for other churches that want to take similar energy-saving measures.
Dr. Jean Sindab, the director of environmental and economic justice for the National Council of Churches, an umbrella group of mainline Protestant churches, said it was sometimes difficult to get people to look beyond the immediate benefits of ecologically minded approaches. Recycling, for example, has profound spiritual ramifications, she said.
"We need to get to a deeper understanding of why there is so much waste in this country," she said. "Then people have to think about materialism and consumerism. Do we as religious people need to consume so much to achieve happiness?"
The Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan literally welcomes the natural world into sacred spaces with its St. Francis Day blessing of the animals, a ceremony that celebrated its 10th anniversary on Oct. 2. The Very Rev. James Parks Morton, the dean of the cathedral, said the tradition was more than a spectacular procession of pets, pachyderms and pests.
"All of that is the human responsibility for preserving and conserving," said Dean Morton, whose cathedral has been active in environmental issues for decades. "This really hits very deep levels."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 9, 1994, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption in some editions on Sunday about religious leaders' turn to environmentalism misidentified the clergyman shown blessing an elephant during the feast of St. Francis at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City. He was Bishop Craig Anderson, the Dean of the General Theological Seminary in New York. The caption also referred incorrectly to the Dean of the cathedral, whose name erroneously appeared. He is the Very Rev. James Parks Morton.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL STUDY;
The Quadrangle Becomes a Globe

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
In the late 1860's, when well-to-do American college students began to spend their junior year abroad and Europe also played host to struggling American artists, wandering expatriates and well-heeled sightseers on the grand tour, the novelist Henry James, who probably understood these footloose Americans better than anyone before or since, was asked to describe them.
 "There is but one word to use -- vulgar, vulgar, vulgar!" he rumbled, explaining that he could not abide their ignorance and "perpetual reference of all things to some American standard or precedent."
 James's novels took a kinder view, frequently emphasizing a noble quality in American character, but his ill-tempered putdown of his countrymen living abroad (reported by his brother) has echoed down through the decades.
 Today, a growing number of American educators believe that the world is too small, too competititve and too dangerous to tolerate the sort of ignorant chauvinism that so provoked James. The cure, they say, is not small, easy or cheap: American higher education needs to go global.
 That does not mean lightheartedly dispatching students to sample cultural bonbons in exotic lands. To serious-minded American educators, globalization means such things as the presence of large numbers of foreign students and professors on campuses in the United States, so that this fall at New York University's Washington Square campus, for example, more than 30 different languages are being spoken.
 It means tens, ultimately hundrends of thousands of American students resident in foreign countries, mastering the local language and culture and -- as with present-day University of California students -- taking a full load of rigorous, faculty-screened courses taught in the native tongue at one of 100 institutions in 32 different countries.
 It means internationalizing the curriculum, as in a course in accounting at the University of Michigan School of Business that now includes the study of Japanese regulations permitting the depreciation of assets at many times the rate allowed in the United States.
 It means using the latest technology so that sudents at Ramapo College, a small, publicly supported institution in Mahwah, N.J., join in discussions with other students, scholars, artists and officials around the world in 120 teleconferences every year.
 "International education is not a new idea, but the times have now conjoined to make it dominant," said L. Jay Oliva, the president of New York University, who has taken a leading role in the movement.
 "What's happening here," he continued, "is comparable to what happened in the 19th century when Johns Hopkins University adopted the philosophy of the great German research universities and set the pattern for Harvard, Yale and the others."
 The number of American student studying abroad has grown steadily over the last five years and is now at a record high of 72,000, according to the Institute of International Education, the nation's leading educational exchange organization. This figure is small in comparison with the number of foreign students studying in the United States (438,000, or six times as many), but -- significantly -- the profile of these itinerant American students has changed.
 "Typically, they used to be affluent women in their junior year at one of the elite Seven Sisters colleges and they would be studying architecture and French language in Paris," said Richard M. Krasno, president of the institute. "But today more of them tend to be male, they are less likely to be affluent, they may be interested in business or industry and there's a slight shift away from Europe as their destination."
 One conspicuous sign of the growth of international studies is the number of study-abroad programs now being offered. Ranging from a business and economics course at the university of Hungary in Pecs to another concentrating on language and culture at the leading university in Hanoi, Vietnam, these programs have virtually doubled over the last decade, from 1,857 to 3,701.
 Students are eagerly responding. At an elite institution like Harvard University, 51 percent of the undergraduates participate in at least one work or study program abroad. At Kalamazoo College, a small, selective liberal arts school in Kalamazoo, Mich., 85 percent of the students study overseas thanks to a private gift of more than $5 million that subsidizes travel and on-site living expenses.
 A few American colleges and universities have not been satisfied with merely offering study-abroad programs but have adopted globalism as a fundamental objective for the entire institution. Speaking for N.Y.U., Mr. Oliva recently declared: "We plan to enter the next century as the quintessential global university. We will extend to every undergraduate the opportunity to study abroad as part of his or her N.Y.U. education, and we will become a center for global faculty inquiry and a center for worldwide conferences of university leaders."
 Robert A. Scott, president of Ramapo College in New Jersey, said his institution aspired to be "a global college" for more practical reasons. "We believe," he said, "that our graduates likely will either supervise or be supervised by someone of another race, ethnicity or nationality, and that their careers and lives as citizens will be affected by international and intercultural life."
 Several American colleges and universities have established campuses in foreign countries so that students may spend extended periods abroad and earn credits readily accepted by employers and graduate schools in the United States. Webster University in St. Louis operates wholly owned branches in Geneva, London, Vienna and the Dutch city of Leiden.
 Emerson College, a small liberal arts school in Boston, has established a branch in Maastricht, the Netherlands, where students study subjects such as global marketing, communications and advertising.
 Some of these branches fare better than others; Japan, for example, has proved especially tricky for American institutions to penetrate. Of the more than 20 American branches established in Japan in recent years, at least 9 have failed, most recently a Texas A & M branch in Koriyama. All are said to have been victims of the economic recession in Japan and the unexpected difficulty of recruiting Japanese students.
 But if it has not always been easy to attract foreign students to American compuses overseas, foreign students have for years flocked to attend colleges and universities in the United States. In fact, according to the Department of Commerce, the 438,000 foreign students currently resident in the United States, while only a small fraction of the total enrollment of 14.5 million, have fed a major and all-but-hidden export industry bringing some $6 billion annual to the American economy.
 The cohort of foreign students has kept growing steadily at the rate of about 4.5 percent a year for the past two decades. Quite often, these students become leaders in their societies at home. Chang-Lin Tien, chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, said he recently attended a state reception in Seoul, South Korea, at which no fewer than seven Cabinet ministers introduced themselves to him as Berkeley graduates.
 "That's typical," Chancellor Tien remarked. "I get the same greetings in Indonesia and Singapore."
 The reasons for all of this activity are many. The first and most important is the rise of the global economy. Alert, job-oriented students have come to realize that as the world shrinks, many of the best jobs are going to go to college graduates who possess international skills. For example, after graduating from Wellesley College in 1987, Cynthia Jeffers taught English for two years in Japan under a program run by the Ministry of Education. She then returned to the United States, entered the Harvard Business School and upon her graduation last June landed a job as an associate in the corporate finance department of Goldman, Sachs & Company, one of the major brokerage firms on Wall Street. Her experience in Japan, she said, greatly increased her prospects in the job market.
Another stimulus for globalization is that most financial aid for students has recently become "portable," as college officials like to say. In the past, vaguely worded Federal statutes authorizing financial aid for college students -- Pell grants, Stafford loans and the like -- made many student advisers hesitant to recommend the use of these grants overseas.
Stephen Cooper, the director of academic programs abroad at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, said that he and a group of associates successfully lobbied Congress to make every form of Federal aid for students applicable for study overseas. The new explicit language appears in the Higher Education Act of 1992.
"Judging from the number of inquiries I've received from around the country, this is having a big impact," said Professor Cooper.
Still another spur is the development and prevalence of new communications technology that allows educators to leap oceans and cross borders with impunity. B. Joseph White, dean of the University of Michigan Business School and a pioneer in the field educators now call "distance learning," has taken the new technology a step further. Last year Dean White set up a program sponsored by Cathay Pacific, the national airline of Hong Kong, that employs interactive television to link M.B.A. candidates in Hong Kong with professors at Ann Arbor.
"It's actually a complex teaching system because we don't believe we can provide the quality we want with interactive TV alone," said Dean White. "Consequently, we send our faculty to Hong Kong and bring their students here for face-to-face meetings."
"It's the future," he continued. "Our pilot project for Cathay Pacific carries with it a vast productivity potential."
Another reason for the growth of interest in globalization is that travel abroad, like hit shows on Broadway, has good word of mouth. "It's a cliche, but over and over you hear students saying 'It changed my life!' " said Dr. Krasno.
It is a point confirmed by Corbin Smith, the director of Stanford University's Overseas Study Office. "When we surveyed the senior class here over the last few years," Mr. Smith said, "asking what was the most meaningful experience during their undergraduate years, more than 87 percent of those who participated in a Stanford study-abroad program gave that the highest rating."
Not everyone is so enthusiastic. Roger Kimball, the neoconservative author of "Tenured Radicals," which takes a skeptical look at academia, observes that colleges are "making out like bandits" by collecting full tuition from students and "placing them at a fraction of that cost at overseas institutions."
It is true that the ranks of foreign students in the United States have been swollen not only by the quality of colleges here but also by sharp-eyed admissions officials who have successfully recruited well-heeled foreign students when they were unable to fill their campuses with enough American students able to pay the ever-rising tuition costs.
In fact, unregulated overseas recruitment proved so easy -- and profitable -- that a few years ago unscrupulous hucksters began to recruit foreign students for small community colleges in the United States with misleading promises that after a year or two the student could transfer into Harvard or M.I.T. Today, some professional organizations have adopted generally effective guidelines and codes of ethics to substantially reduce such misrepresentations.
And some critics, like Mr. Kimball, say there is a great

 deal of wishful thinking in the notion that "a semester abroad is going to make one into an internationalist."
Holly M. Carter, dean of the office of educational opportunity programs at Northeastern University, argues that the belief that today's college students are more culturally aware than their predecessors is a comforting myth that ignores "the increase in hate crimes, blatant bigotry and racism on the campuses."
But educational leaders like Mr. Oliva of N.Y.U. argue that a global perspective is vital to the international community. "There are at least three factors driving the globalization of education today," he said. "The first is purely serendipitous: We're on the cusp of a new wave of immigration." (About a million immigrants have come to New York over the past decade, many of whom have attended N.Y.U.)
"Second," he continued, "people realize that the more different environments you move into, the more you learn. Conversely, the more you study with people just like yourself, the less you learn.
"I realize in my own life that I never learned more than when I was overseas for a year and a half. Everything became very vivid. There was no moment when I could let my mind relax. And gradually, I discovered that I could master change."
"And third," Mr. Oliva said, "the demise of the Soviet Union has made Americans more international than ever. It made us realize that the Soviet Union had been a major force in policing ethnic rivalries. The world got capped under big cloaks. We used to think of the division between Northern and Southern Ireland, and what's happening in Yemen, as anomalies. Now we see them as the rule.
"In the future," he continued, "we probably face 30 to 40 years of instability and border wars like the 19th century, but with one frightening difference -- small nations possessing immensely destructive weapons. So our job in international education is to help provide a global environment in which these ethnic disputes can be handled on the basis of intellectual discourse and debate, not war."
John Markham, director of the University of California's Education Abroad Program, says, "The question I like to ask is: Should the University of California have a foreign policy?"
Most educators acknowledge that the vast majority of American faculty and students are still relatively insular, but they are optimistic that economic forces will prevail.
"The sea change will occur," Dr. Krasno said, "when the global economy drives corporate leaders to say they want to hire people with foreign language skills and knowledge of foreign cultures, and that all things being equal they will hire them first. That's when the rush will begin."

HEADLINE: NO TUITION;
The High Price of Free Excellence

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
THE poster-crammed bulleting boards, grubily clad undergraduates mingling in clumps and scent of old dust mixed with fresh paint bring to mind any of a hundred urban campuses.
 But this isn't just any campus. The students, a potpourri of races and ethnic groups, are among the most talented in America, and the curriculum is among the most demanding. More striking, the only barrier to entry is the fierce competition for places in the freshman class. For this is Cooper Union, a specialized college of art, architecture and engineering in Greenwich Village and the only private American college of its caliber that charges no tuition. 
 How does it provide the best and remain free? Can it keep ondoing it? More subtly, should it keep doing it for those students whose families can afford to pay?
 The economics of Cooper Union, like its curriculum, are unique. But the problems of keeping the college accessible to everyone with brains and motivation parallel those of other ambitious colleges that must increasingly rely on big donors to write checks.
 Henry Cobb, former ean of Harvard's School of Archictrure and senior partner in the firm of Pei, Cobb & Fried, calls the school "the hidden gem of New York." It is the legacy of Peter Cooper (not only the designer of the first American inventor of Jell-O), whose 1859 endowment specified that the school should be "as free as air and water."
 The founding tradition of accessibility still has echoes in a half-dozen Cooper Union community outreach programs in science and art. But the primary focus of the institution is the undergraduate college, with an enrollment just topping 1,000.
 Its engineering school consistently ranks near the top in the nation among specialized undergraduate programs. And no wonder: Three-quarters of the freshmen admitted in 1993 had math S.A.T. scores above 700, out of a possible 800, in the top 2 percent in the country.
 Cooper Union's architecture program, with a reputation for nurturing creativity whild still teaching the nuts and bolts, was called "perhaps the most important architecture school in the world" by Domus, the architecture journal. And while the Art School is arguably the least sparkling of Cooper Union's jewels, it still can boast of a higher selectivity rate than Harvard's -plus a long lst of distinguished graduates including George Segal, Alex Katz, Eva Hesse, Tom Wesselman, Milton Glaser, Lee Krasner, Joel-Peter Witkin, Edward Sorel andMark Alan Stamaty.
 What makes Cooper Union's standards all the more remarkable is its diversity. One-quarter of the students are Asian and 17 percent black or Hispanic. Almost half the freshmen last year were born outside the United States. Perhaps most striking, 30 percent of the engineering students are women - "twice the average for comparable school," reports Eleanor Baum, dean of engineering.
 Cooper Union does not aggressively recruit minorities, notes John Jay Iselin, the president, because it need not. He attributes this to the college's emphasis on teaching marketable skills, plus its non-threatening atmosphere for the urban poor.
 In part, Cooper Union manages free tuition the old-fashioned way: with pots and pots of endowment money. This year, roughly $15,000 per student will come from leases on college-owned real estate and income from securities. Gifts form alumni and friends will add about $2,000 per student. A grab-bag of other sources, including state aid, dormitory charges and recreation fees, will generate another $2,000.
 That income is no more than flows into a dozen other well-endowed schools that nonetheless charge more than $20,000 a year.
 What makes it possible for Cooper Union to deliver an exceptional product for roughly 40 percent less than the Haverfords, Williamses and Princetons of the world?
 For starters, frugality reigns. Space is barely adequate: the aisles between architects' drawing boards and engineers' work stations are as narrow as economy class on a Boeing 747. And vice president Robert Hawks reports that Cooper Union runs with a "very lean" support staff. Mr. Hawks, the college's chief financial officer, serves as the rental agent for the half-dozen retail spaces in Cooper Union's campus buildings.
 The school provides virtually none of the amenities of elite liberal arts colleges. Princeton Review's annual survey of students scored Cooper Union the most unsightly college in the nation. There is no communal dining hall, and the sole dormitory has space for just on student in six. While many freshmen live on campus, sophomores are strongly encouraged to find their own apartments or live at home.
 There are no athletic facilities other than nearby city-owned public tennis courts and pools. Nor is there much of library; Cooper Union maintains a specialized collection, contracting with New York University for access to its research resources. Indeed, there is a pattern here: Cooper Union makes do with far less because it uses New York City's assets so effectively. The campus is set amid a paradise of galleries, theaters, concert halls and ethnic restaurants.
 And, while faculty salaries are competitive nationally (full professors average $72,000 annually, assistant profs $47,000), an astonishing half the classes are taught by inexpensive part-time faculty without sacrificing instructional quality. This is possible because New York is brimming with successful architects, artists and engineers eager to mingle with and sometimes hire gifted students.
 It would be nice to conclude that the endowment and ongoing generosity of alumni would be sufficient support. But that is not the case. Whild Cooper Union's management remains indefatigably optimistic, the school is spending more than it can count on earning, and bigger troubles loom.
 Of Cooper Union's $15.2 million income form the endowment this year, four-fifths comes from a single source: the land beneath the Chrysler Building. This prime property generated a bonanza during New York's real estate boom; lease payments have risen sixfold since 1973, permitting the school to invest in a residence hall and raise salaries of then-underpaid, militant faculty. But under the terms of the Chrysler lease, concedes vice president Hawks, there is little reason to believe that the income will even keep pace with the cost of living for the foreseeable future.
 Mr. Hawks thinks more cash can be squeezed from the college's commercial holdings near the campus. And some administrators are floating the idea of charging those students who do not complete their degrees in four years. But this income would amount to peanuts, on a budget pushing $25 million.
 One plausible solution would be cutting enrollment and staff - Cooper Union is already educating 100 more students than it officially wants. But William Bowen, an economist who is president of the Mellon Foundation, notes that "downsizing almost never makes sense in higher education" because so much of its cost is embedded in plant and equipment.
 Downsizing is particularly problematic for Cooper Union because any meaningful cut would require a showdown with the unionized permanent faculty. Paring part-timers who now work for bargain rates would save very little. Besides, it would sabotage Cooper Union's valuable relationship with the art and architecture elites of New York.
 What's left? David Breneman, an economist at Harvard's School of Education, wonders whether it really makes sense to hold the line on charges. "They're giving the wealthy kids a windfall," he points out. Economists would find it tempting to set tuition at some very substantial sum, and then give discountsj as great as 100 percent according to need.
 But tuition remains a four-letter word at Cooper Union. For one thing, argues President Iselin, the potential revenue from tuition is more modest than might be expected because Cooper Unikon families are poorer than their elite college counterparts.
 For another, argues Andy Rabinbach, a professor of history at the school, tuition would undermine its image, creating psychological barriers for minorities and immigrants who now feel at home in this egalitarian setting. Last, the tuition option would open questions of whether current employees are adequately paid.
 That leaves donors in general and mega-donors in particular as Cooper Union's main chance for closing a budget gap that Mr. Hawks fears will reach crisis proportions within five years. A relatively high percentage of alumni do contribute, but as Dean Baum complains only half-jokingly, "Our engineers become professors instead of entrepreneurs."
 In the end, then, Cooper Union's financial problems and solution have an all to familiar ring. "The name of the game in higher education these days," says Mr. Bowen, the economist, "is muddling through."
 The difference - and perhaps advantage - is that Cooper Union's survival means so much to New York's (and America's) dream of mobility through education.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Living It Up in Later Years

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
IT is a happy time at Stage II of the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven where four actors -- Jim Dale, Brian Murray, Martin Rayner and Tom Beckett -- are playing more than 20 parts, including the eccentric dowager extraordinaire, Augusta Bertram. The occasion is Graham Greene's "Travels With My Aunt," which has been adapted for the stage. Sort of.
Graham Greene, who died at the age of 86 in 1991, is best known for his novels -- "Brighton Rock," "The Power and the Glory," "The Heart of the Matter" and "The Third Man" -- 24 in all. The political and the theological were his dominant themes (Greene called himself "a Catholic atheist") but he was as acknowledged for what he termed "entertainments" -- works of suspense and intrigue -- as for his concerns with conscience and spirituality. 
 But crime and intrigue are the only characteristic Greene elements to find their way into "Travels With My Aunt," and only lightheartedly. A dash of amorality leavens what Greene declared as "the only book I have written for the fun of it." And the Long Wharf production, the American premiere of an adaptation by Giles Havergal, of the Citizens Theater in Glasgow, is more fun than the 1972 film version in which Maggie Smith played Augusta.
In its theatrical incarnation, Greene's panoramic story is more than a staged reading, less than a play. Call it an elegant salon entertainment. Indeed, after entering, the actors sit at separate tables, taking tea. Meticulous attention has been paid to decor -- pennants, streamers and balloons variously descending, potted flowers on the floor and flower petals strewn all over, time and evershifting place flashed, like supertitles, in neon -- and to acting so impeccable and refined that the assumption by men of half a dozen women's roles, in addition to Aunt Augusta, appears as natural as in the recent, acclaimed all-male production of "As You Like It" by the British company Cheek By Jowl.
Except that the men here are dressed as men in suits, conservative gray at the start, then flashy white to denote the freeing of the pent-up Henry Pulling, Augusta Bertram's 55-year-old nephew.
All the actors -- interchangeably, equivalently, seamlessly -- play Henry in a narrative that flows gracefully, allowing no time or space for self-conscious role switching.
But only Mr. Dale plays the lustful Aunt Augusta. Without condescending into camp or caricature -- none of the actors do -- Mr. Dale is blissfully and believably lithe (Augusta is 75). In a virtuouso performance that matches economy of gesture and power of suggestion, Mr. Dale, with a tilt of the chin, a brush of the hand, a precise inflection, is conducting a master class in performing art. In the actor's personification, Augusta has panache. And in a breath, Mr. Dale segues to Augusta's nephew, who is himself transformed during various stages of a most peculiar odyssey.
"Age may modify emotions, Henry; it does not destroy them," observes Augusta, who wafts into her nephew's life at the crematorium after the death of his mother. Existing "as a tourist in my aunt's world," as Augusta travels from one lover, Wordsworth, a middle-aged West African (Mr. Rayner) who turns Henry's mother's ashes into hashish, to Mr. Visconte, an Italian criminal (also Mr. Rayner).
"I have always been very fond of travel," says Augusta and on go the red neon lights: Southwood, Istanbul (via the Orient Express), Boulogne, Buenos Aires, Formosa. And then a hurried move to Paraguay.
Coming on as a retiring, retired bank manager in the demeanor of a clerk, Henry has but one obsession, the cultivation of dahlias. Although Augusta never planned anything illegal, never having read the laws, Henry is pulled into a rondelay of schemes, winding up with the smuggling of a fake Leonardo sketch and a fling with Yolanda, the police chief's 14-year-old daughter.
Temperate or besotted, with correspondent high wit, Mr. Murray is a blustering C.I.A. agent -- and he is Yolanda as well. He can be as shocking and imposing as shocked or imposed upon, the very picture of propriety or outrageousness. And don't forget Mr. Beckett, a one-man animated comic strip, flattened out (as a wolf), sprung to life (as a bodyguard).
In the end, there is less levity than greets the ear in Augusta's travels. Tellingly, Greene chose not to use the appellation "entertainment" for this singular work. Wanting only "untouchable men," Augusta had no need to be needed. She suffered the "deep incurable egotism of passion." But does Augusta's consorting with shady characters matter less than Henry's uneventful 25 years at the bank?
Although this hybrid piece of theatricalized literature is bogged down with a surfeit of details, characters (granting that some are omitted) and labored humor, Augusta's mission, to stop time, is clear. And so are her means: to go on dancing.
"Travels With My Aunt," at Stage II of the Long Wharf Theater, 222 Sargent Drive, New Haven (Exit 46 from Interstate 95). Box office 787-4282. Performances through Nov. 20.

HEADLINE: Belford Commuter Ferry Proposal Becomes an Election Issue

BYLINE: By ARTHUR Z. KAMIN 

DATELINE: BELFORD

 BODY:
A MONMOUTH COUNTY proposal for a New York-bound commuter ferry service out of this tiny Middletown Township fishing community, struggling to preserve its historic and residential identities, is now dead. But the outcome of the Sixth District Congressional race could determine if the proposal will ever be resurrected.
And in an unusual election spinoff, a key county freeholder race and another for a seat on the Middletown governing body are focusing on the ferry development plan as well, the first time within memory that a single issue has figured so prominently in three hard-fought campaigns in the county. 
 The $16.5 million ferry proposal would include a terminal, a 1,200-car parking lot and other buildings constructed on a 40-acre tract.
Representative Frank J. Pallone Jr. of Long Branch, the Democrat who is seeking his fourth term in a predominantly blue-collar district in Middlesex and Monmouth municipalities, strongly opposes the plan. The all-Republican Board of Freeholders is sponsoring ferry project.
Mr. Pallone said the project was not critical to efforts to revitalize the region along Raritan and Sandy Hook Bays. He questioned whether the project would provide a boost for the proposed $150 million Seaport Associates mixed-use development and marina in neighboring Port Monmouth, which has been having difficulty moving ahead. One major builder, Calton Homes Inc. of Manalapan, has just pulled out of the plan's 140 town-house construction component.
"The people of Belford do not want a Mystic Seaport environment in their backyards," Mr. Pallone said. "Frankly, I don't blame them."
He said he would block in Congress the $5 million in Federal funds the county would like for the project. Belford is a section of Middletown Township and has about 4,500 residents.
Michael H. Herson of Middletown, Mr. Pallone's Republican challenger, and several Republican officeholders have criticized Mr. Pallone for what they called his display of "raw political power." They charged him with "political grandstanding" and "capitalizing on an emotional issue" as Election Day draws near.
"Frank Pallone should be ashamed of himself on the way he has behaved on this issue," said Mr. Herson, a lawyer seeking his first elective office. "He's playing politics, pure politics, with the county's sincere efforts to help a distressed area."
Assemblyman Joseph Azzolina, Republican of Middletown, said: "Put Frank Pallone in front of an audience, and he'll tell them whatever they want to hear. This is a local issue and he should have the good sense to stay out of it." Mr. Azzolina ran for Congress against Mr. Pallone and lost.
Mr. Pallone said: "This is a grass-roots effort by genuine, hard-working people who want help from their Congressmen. I have been helping my constituents on this problem for the last two years. It appears that the Republicans are sticking together. They are the ones who are playing partisan politics. How sad."
Patricia Cusick, a spokeswoman for the 230-member Belford Citizens Association, formed to oppose the ferry, said her group had no political agenda. "We are backing the candidates who have pledged to help us," she said. "I begged and pleaded with both parties to listen and help. Congressman Pallone was with us from the beginning. He has become our savior."
Andrew J. Willner, who keeps an eye on Raritan Bay as the baykeeper for the American Littoral Society's harbor estuary program at Sandy Hook, said Mr. Pallone's stance was "consistent with his environmental record," and added, "I just wish the other politicians had equal courage."
Mr. Pallone said the plan would bring at least four commuter ferries that would brush up against the commercial fishing boats in the Compton's Creek harbor.
Fishermen in the area who belong to the Belford Seafood Cooperative Assocation generate about $4 million in sales yearly, including revenue from a small retail store here. The co-op provides about 300 jobs and brings about $10 million into the local economy, fishermen said. About 70 of the vessels operate out of the creek.
Richard T. Isaksen, a member of the co-op board, a past president and a third-generation fisherman, said the issue was "one of survival" for the fishermen.
County officials argue that the ferry service would produce about 900 jobs, aid the local economy and actually save -- and not destroy -- the fragile fishing industry.
Mr. Pallone countered that the Belford project is costly and not in keeping with present national efforts to reduce the cost of government operations. He said it would appeal only to a small, elite group of out-of-towners and duplicate existing ferry runs in nearby Atlantic Highlands and Highlands, two municipalities struggling to revitalize their downtown business areas.
For a while, the ferry plan was moving swiftly along with State Department of Environmental Protection approvals in hand, granted in the waning days of the Florio administration in September 1993. Belford residents complained they had no voice in that process.
Mr. Pallone then called for a public hearing by the Army Corps of Engineers on required Federal permits for filling wetlands, dredging and bulkheading.
At a late September hearing, one speaker after another criticized the project.
In the freeholder race, the Democratic challenger, Lawrence W. Dooley of Spring Lake Heights, a teacher and lawyer, cited the "arrogance" of the freeholders in continuing to push the Belford ferry "while nobody wants it."
The incumbent Republican, Theodore J. Narozanick, running for his fourth term, did not return telephone calls. In a previous interview, he said he could compromise on the plan.
And, at the local level, a Republican Township Committee member, Rosemarie D. Peters, a Rutgers University law student seeking a third term, said that she was not surprised by the concerns of the Belford residents and that she predicted the problems years ago. She said she was disappointed that the Belford Citizens Group was backing her Democratic rival, Sal LaSpata Jr., an engineering manager.
Mr. LaSpata said, "The time has come for the Township Committee to stand up to the freeholders."
The Township Committee is all Republican.

HEADLINE: Hospitals Lose A Vital Sign: Job Security

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
KERRY MORTH of Waterford started working as a laboratory technician at Lawrence and Memorial Hospital in New London 19 years ago, as a teen-ager just out of high school. Her husband, Larry, became an engineer and worked at military contracting companies.
"For 8 to 10 years we've lived with the threat of his being unemployed," Mrs. Morth said. "He always told me, 'Thank God you're in health care, at least you're secure.' " 
 But Mrs. Morth lost her supervisory job last month, as Lawrence and Memorial eliminated 30 management positions, the first step in cutting back its labor force by more than 13 percent, 200 jobs. So far this year, all but 6 of Connecticut's 34 general hospitals have announced cutbacks, eliminating more than 2,000 jobs through layoffs, early retirement or attrition.
Some of the cuts were relatively small: 34 layoffs at Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington, 20 management and physician positions at New Britain General Hospital and 46 positions at Manchester Memorial.
Others seemed shocking, especially in an industry that was growing at a record pace only a few years ago. Bridgeport Hospital laid off 130 people and froze 70 positions because its business was off 10 percent, while Hartford Hospital cut 348 positions and Middlesex Memorial in Middletown 282.
Other cost-cutting steps are being taken. Stamford Hospital is closing its laundry and will subcontract the service instead; Winsted Hospital and Sharon Hospital have signed a joint operating agreement; Gaylord Hospital in Wallingford closed its in-patient stroke unit; Hartford Hospital will merge its pediatrics unit into Newington Children's Hospital's new $90 million 138-bed building on Washington Street in Hartford.
Hospitals say they are responding to changes in the health care environment, at the national and state level. More government and private insurance companies are demanding discounts, and more efficient health care delivery. Competition is springing up in the form of sub-acute care centers (between hospitals and nursing homes in care level), walk-in clinics and agencies that provide care for people at home. More work is being done on an outpatient basis, so that admissions are down 2 percent to 10 percent this year at most hospitals.
The result is that jobs in health care once seen as the most secure are suddenly evaporating.
"Our utilization is down, and the work force has to come down to reflect that," said William T. Christopher, president of Lawrence and Memorial. "It's a difficult job, no question about it. When you're talking to people one on one, it is very difficult. What sustains us is that if we don't do this we're putting even more jobs at risk, we're potentially putting the survival of the hospital at risk."
Proponents of some of the changes say it is simply a matter of the marketplace forcing the type of health care reform that Congress failed to.
"There are some very significant changes taking place in health care," said Patricia S. Sears, a vice president at Middlesex. "The challenge for us is to look at these changes as opportunities to improve health care."
Medical professionals worry that cost-cutting changes might lower the quality of care.
"I'm sure physicians will become concerned about the level of staffing at these hospitals as the effects of some of these layoffs are felt," said Timothy Norbeck, director of the Connecticut State Medical Society. "The hospitals themselves are very concerned about the effects of the cuts, but they have to make them."
Barbara E. Pokorny, president of the Connecticut Nurses Association, added that "We're guardedly optimistic that it's possible to meet the financial constraints of health care without compromising quality. But we're monitoring it very carefully."
Much of the sudden flurry of activity is driven by the state's decision to deregulate hospitals this year. Previously, the hospitals had to charge a rate set by the state's Commission on Hospitals and Health Care, but they were also guaranteed a certain return; today they set their own rates and have to worry about what the hospital two towns over is charging.
"In any deregulated environment, what you see is an increase in competition, a reduction of prices, and then consolidations," said James E. Sok, president of Sharon and Winsted hospitals. "We've seen it in airlines, and in banking, and now we're seeing it in health care."
Winsted Hospital announced early this year that it was seeking a partner in an effort to keep its doors open. Sharon Hospital had its own problems -- it laid off 35 employees, gave 24 early retirement and eliminated 11 jobs through attrition between April and June, when it affiliated with Winsted. Those moves cut its budget $3 million, to $28 million, a break-even point for Sharon.
The two hospitals are studying ways to merge some departments in an effort to achieve efficiencies. And a report due by Oct. 1, 1996, could outline a full merger of the two hospitals.
Managed care is also driving some of the change. Years ago people went into the hospital, stayed as long as their doctors told them to stay, and the insurance company picked up the bill. Today, the patient has to have pre-admission certification from the insurance company, and the company tells the hospital how long the patient can stay.
Hospitals are also the victims of their own advances, which allow them to get people ready to leave much more quickly. Open-heart surgery used to require weeks in a hospital bed; today the patient might be out in three days.
"There's talk of one-day baby deliveries -- in and out in less than 24 hours," said James Battaglio, a spokesman for Hartford Hospital. "When I started in the hospital, if you came in for cataract surgery you were in the hospital for 10 days; today you're home in time for dinner."
While that's good for the patient, and avoids hundreds of dollars a day in charges, it also cuts into hospital revenue.
All three hospitals in Hartford have cut back their staff and closed patient units in an effort to control costs. Hartford Hospital cut its budget to $336 million from $350 million, and eliminated 314 positions, 6.6 percent of its work force.
Mr. Battaglio said the announcement came as a particular surprise since it would include at least 100 layoffs that for Hartford Hospital, as with most of the hospitals, are the first in its history.
"When you know it's coming, everyone braces themselves, they're asking when it will begin and when it will all be over," Mr. Battaglio said. "We're trying to expedite this as much as possible to eliminate that tension. But that's a facet of any downsizing."
Mr. Christopher said that at Lawrence and Memorial the average daily census was 344 patients in 1991, dropping to 336 in 1992, 317 in 1993 and 303 this year. It is expected to drop further, to 296, in 1995, a loss of more than 17,000 patient days over four years.
The hospital renegotiated some of its leases, reduced the use of overtime, refinanced some debt and kept some positions open for longer periods of time, saving about $9.5 million, Mr. Christopher said, but it could no longer ignore that its ratio of full-time employees to average daily census was 5.04, much higher than the national average of 4.5.
The hospital calculated it would have to eliminate 200 positions to get down to the national average, so it announced layoffs in September, starting with 30 upper and middle management jobs.
"What I've been stressing all along is that there's nothing sacred, it's got to be top to bottom," Mr. Christopher said. "It can't be everybody except the vice presidents."
"It also means you can't get some things done that you used to, but it forces you to ask the question: Does this really need to be done?"
Some of the hospitals are engaging in what has become known as "workplace redesign." Middlesex eliminated 282 positions after a restructuring in August, but some of those laid off have been rehired in new jobs.
"We redesigned the work that the hospital does," Ms. Sears said.
For instance, under the old system a patient might see a dozen nurses or technicians in the first 24 hours -- one to draw blood, another to set up a neurology test, another for an electrocardiogram, another for respiratory treatments, and so forth. But entering a hospital is such a stressful time, the hospital reasoned, people would be more comfortable if they had just one person to guide them through the process. Now, one multi-skilled nurse takes care of all the tasks.
"We are creating a much more efficient, patient-centered approach," Ms. Sears said. "It's remarkable how many different people can ask you the same set of questions during the first 24 hours you're in a hospital. Those are the kinds of things we tried to eliminate."
And while it might seem puzzling, many hospitals are also reacting to the pressures by spending money on renovations. Those costs are amortized over a long period, but they can bring down operating costs immensely, said Frank A. Corvino, president of Greenwich Hospital, which will break ground by the end of next year on a $60 million building.
Mr. Corvino said the new hospital would be three stories instead of six in the present location, 160 beds instead of 296, and 330,000 square feet, down from 450,000. It will be more orderly -- all diagnostic work on the first floor, all surgery on the second, medicine and obstetrics on the third -- than the current building, where departments have been placed wherever there is room.
"We haven't put any money into the physical plant here for 10 or 15 years, and the buildings are more than 40 years old," Mr. Corvino said. "It doesn't make sense to deliver 1994 care in a 1951 building."
For instance, when the current building was designed in the 1940's, there was no such thing as one-day surgery. Today, 55 percent of surgery patients leave the hospital the same day, and that proportion is expected to climb to 65 or 70 percent in a few years. Technology and changes in the way people use hospitals, have forced hospital planners to change the way hospitals are designed, Mr. Corvino said.
"In those days you always had 300 patients in the hospital. When you needed a week of intravenous antibiotics you came to the hospital for a week," Mr. Corvino said. "Now we have an in-home intravenous system, you never even have to leave your living room."
He said the hospital estimates it can eliminate $5 million to $7 million a year from its current $83 million budget with some of the efficiencies that will be incorporated into the new building, and, he noted, the savings would increase with the inflation rate.
"I don't care what comes out of Washington, health care reform is already here," Mr. Corvino said.
"And what's happening in Connecticut hospitals is a reflection of that."

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
Making a Difference With Hollywood Might

BYLINE: By Anne Thompson; Anne Thompson is a Los Angeles-based writer.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
"KATHLEEN BROWN will win on Nov. 8 with the help of the women in this room," declared Hillary Rodham Clinton at a Hollywood Women's Political Committee fund-raising luncheon just over a week ago as campaigns nationwide entered their final furious stretch.
The First Lady knows where her party's bread is buttered; she had hopped a 20-hour flight from the Middle East to take the podium at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Oct. 28 because the women in that room would be some of Hollywood's richest and most powerful. 
 There were, of course, the star draws. Whoopi Goldberg introduced Mrs. Clinton as "very cool" at the gathering of 980 people who had paid from $125 to $1,000 each to also hear a speech by Barbra Streisand, a long-time member of the committee. But also in the audience were Lisa Henson, president of Columbia Pictures; Laura Ziskin, president of a new movie division at 20th Century Fox; Marilyn Bergman, the Oscar-winning lyricist and an advocate for artists' rights; Susan Grode, an entertainment lawyer; Lili Fini Zanuck, a producer and director; Anthea Sylbert, who runs the Hawn-Sylbert Movie Company, and others whose dollars and dedication to goals like economic equality for women and abortion rights have helped shape the political landscape.
"The H.W.P.C. gives Hollywood's women executives a way to interact with Washington," said Mark Gill, a public relations executive and president of the Show Coalition, a nonpartisan political organization that tries to give the entertainment industry access to candidates. "And it's a way for Washington to connect with the money and influence of Hollywood. The H.W.P.C. is good at mobilizing celebrity clout. They do a spectacular job using their two resources: the dollars they bring in and their members' visibility."
Standing amid the hubbub at the luncheon was Margery Tabankin, the organization's departing executive director, who has brought Washington skills -- from her years overseeing philanthropies and heading the Vista program during the Carter Administration -- to running the committee for the last five years. She smiled as Phil Angelides, the Democratic candidate for California State Treasurer, stepped over to shake her hand ("We gave him $15,000," she said), and then she posed for a photograph with United States Senator Barbara Boxer, whose successful 1992 campaign was bolstered by the committee's support.
Clearly hoping for some of the same stardust, Ms. Brown, California's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, worked the crowd. Ms. Tabankin said committee members had already written checks totaling $400,000 for the Brown campaign, while the committee had given $50,000. This luncheon, for Congressional races, raised $200,000 for 40 "progressive" candidates, she said.
The group, a political action committee, was founded a decade ago by 15 high-powered Hollywood women, including Paula Weinstein, Rosilyn Heller, Nancy Hardin and Barbara Boyle, all production executives turned producers; Pat Tourk Lee, a TV producer; Joan Hyler, an agent, and Ms. Bergman, Ms. Sylbert and Ms. Grode.
"Most of us," Ms. Heller said, "had been in groups with men where women were relegated to a back position. The feeling was that we finally had the power, which is money."
Ms. Grode, now a partner with Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hayes & Handler, said the Republican agenda of the early 80's "left no room for any women's voices. We wanted to help elect those representatives who could speak to those points of view."
Ms. Hardin says the group's strength has always come from a core of women willing to play hardball. "They are not afraid to say, 'if you don't buy a table, so-and-so may not make their next movie with you.' "
Ms. Sylbert added, "We knew how to raise money, just as we knew how to raise money for movies."
Since its founding, the committee has raised $5.2 million to back candidates. Two events alone, featuring Ms. Streisand, raised $1.2 million for the Clinton Presidential campaign in 1992 and the same total for six Senate candidates in 1986. It now has 225 members from the entertainment industry, who pay dues of $1,500 a year (that's "one less Armani jacket," Ms. Sylbert said).
But some significant Hollywood women have opted to make their own political way.
Pat Kingsley, a powerful press agent, has long worked apart from the committee with her star clients to support candidates including Michael Dukakis in his 1988 presidential bid against George Bush. The committee's strength, she said, is its "access to the celebrities, Streisand especially."
Dawn Steel, a former chairman of Columbia Pictures who is now an independent producer, credits the organization with "helping me get conscious." But she left it in 1992 when the policy committee refused to support Mel Levine in his Democratic primary campaign against Ms. Boxer for the Senate seat. "I'm far more conservative than they are," she said of the committee.
But Ms. Steel continues to back Democrats on her own, throwing events for President Clinton and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California that have yielded hundreds of thousands of dollars. "The money I raised allowed me to have my own voice," she said. "It's arduous, but it's not brain surgery.
"What makes you a powerful person," she said, drawing the same conclusion as the committee, "is when you raise money." All you need, she added, "is a good Rolodex."

MONTY
The Lonely Leader, 1944-1945.
By Alistair Horne with David Montgomery.
Illustrated. 381 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers. $25. 
THIS is a remarkable book, because in it the present Viscount Montgomery of Alamein has collaborated in producing as balanced a biography of his controversial father as we are ever likely to get. The cruel isolation to which Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery consigned his son, David, through much of his boyhood somehow produced a capacity for dispassionate assessment that has eluded most other observers.
Yet the assessment remains tempered by love and respect. "Monty: The Lonely Leader, 1944-1945" grew from Lord Montgomery's decision to make a pilgrimage to the 28 sites occupied by his father's 21st Army Group Tactical Headquarters, from England to Germany. To chronicle the pilgrimage and transform the chronicle into a larger remembrance of Britain's premier military commander of World War II, he chose the historian Alistair Horne. He gave Mr. Horne freedom to set forth his own judgments and conclusions, including harsh ones about the field marshal as a parent; but he also helped make available much of the necessary information, and his influence on the judgments seems evident. Because of the way in which the book took shape, it deals mainly with Field Marshal Montgomery as military commander in northwest Europe in 1944-45, though it briefly summarizes and analyzes his earlier career.
The balance of presentation in "Monty" is particularly evident in what it says about Montgomery and the American generals. It reminds us of a circumstance that we are likely to forget, accustomed as we are to more than half a century of British-American military cooperation: British soldiers of the 1920's and 30's had practically no acquaintance whatever with their American peers.
To the British, long accustomed to the European military scene, the generals who arrived from the New World during World War II might as well have come from a new planet. Naturally the British regarded the Americans' nearly total inexperience with European war as cause for condescension -- although the authors of this book implicitly acknowledge the American counterjudgment that recent British military experience consisted largely of adjustment to failure. They believe that British soldiers, and Montgomery in particular, might profitably have curbed their displays of condescension. On the other hand, they suggest that the Americans might have been more charitable toward the war-weariness and fundamental military weakness of the British.
Montgomery's ability to restrain excessively candid expressions of disdain for the inexperienced Americans, as well as for other lesser beings, was further limited, the authors concede, by a self-satisfaction that at war's end had grown enormous. Not only did the field marshal isolate himself from his own son, he cut himself off also from almost any influences that might have tempered the pleasure he took from contemplating the wonders of his own generalship.
While he maintained exceptionally good communications forward from his headquarters, keeping in touch with the front through young liaison officers in a system that American commanders might usefully have emulated, he minimized communications backward to his equals and superiors in rank who might have diluted his smugness or warned him of its effects on his country's allies. In time he drove even the patient Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower to exasperation.
The authors' balance is displayed again in their ability to combine dismay at the field marshal's inflated ego with a sound perception of why he had good reason for a certain self-satisfaction. He was, of course, a superb builder of morale, to a surprising degree among American troops as well as British. In the 20's and 30's he had contributed much to making the British Army an effective enough instrument to fight World War II with eventual success. All through the interwar years he struggled to advance the army's standards of professionalism and training.
While he remained primarily an infantry officer, he emphasized early the necessity for combined-arms exercises and doctrine, and he was foremost among British ground commanders in developing coordination with tactical air support. Above all, he was a successful leader in war, and especially in the Normandy battles that form the centerpiece of the book, the battles in which Montgomery acted as ground commander over all the Allied armies.
Mr. Horne and Lord Montgomery tie their ultimately high estimate of Field Marshal Montgomery as military commander to the measure of his achievement in relation to the decided flaws plaguing the weapons he had to work with. Despite prewar reforms, the British Army of World War II was a painfully faulty instrument, and the United States Army in Europe was not without limitations; yet in Normandy Montgomery led these forces to victory in a knock-down, drag-out slugging match against one of the most formidable war machines of all time.
Concerning the flaws, the authors are correctly scathing -- for example, in their condemnation of British Government and industry for failing to provide tanks worthy of appearing on the same battlefield with those of the Germans. American tanks, they emphasize, came off little better than the British.
And with their customary candor the authors allot some of the blame for the deficiencies of British armor to Montgomery himself; notwithstanding his concern for combined-arms warfare, he never paid sufficient attention to tank quality. Just as damaging to British military effectiveness was the absence of armored personnel carriers to transport the infantry.
A YET more serious flaw was insufficient manpower. With the British, the shortage of men could not be helped; their population base was too small, and Montgomery's acute awareness of that fact goes far toward explaining his fabled caution. With the Americans, the shortage of men and divisions in northwest Europe might have been prevented by a better allocation of resources. But as it was, not until almost the end did the Allies possess the classic 3-to-2 numerical superiority that attackers should have over defenders, and American divisions were always too few to permit rotating them properly out of the lines for rest and refitting. Mr. Horne and Lord Montgomery are not as critical of this American shortcoming as they might have been; but at least they recognize it, while we Americans too often ignore it in favor of praising the supposed marvels of our economic mobilization.
The authors' central argument, then, is that Field Marshal Montgomery's greatness as a military leader was in direct proportion to his ability as a commander to close the gap between the faults of his forces and the Allies' need for decisive battlefield victories, particularly in Normandy. Probably they make too much of the idea that the flaws were so crippling that the cross-Channel invasion could not have succeeded without Montgomery. But this argument should not be rejected without reading their admirably fair-minded and therefore persuasive book.

HEADLINE: Guardians of Castro's Cuba Have Fallen on Hard Times

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
On a night black enough to give the most timid conspirator some courage, guardians of the Cuban Revolution were nowhere to be found on Oquendo Street.
"La vigilancia?" a young man named Jorge asked, smiling at a stranger's question and looking around for the neighborhood watch patrol from the beach chair that was his seat during a friend's sidewalk party. 
 With long-haired guests, contraband liquor and American rock-and-roll, the party was the sort of vaguely countercultural gathering that Cubans were once careful to hold indoors. But as Jorge scanned the desolate block of row houses, the smirk on his face got bigger.
"It would seem," he said, "that the revolutionaries have gone to sleep."
In what President Fidel Castro has called the darkest moment of his 35-year rule, the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, the vast network of cells that are supposed to guard against Communism's enemies on every block and every farm, have fallen on hard times.
Officials acknowledge that participation in nightly "vigilance" patrols, block political meetings and other activities have fallen sharply since the Cuban economy began to collapse five years ago along with the Soviet bloc. For absences that were once inexcusable, the standard excuse now is about having to spend hours waiting for buses or scrounging for food.
As Cubans have grown more openly critical of the Government and its handling of the economic crisis, fewer people seem willing to report on their neighbors for the sort of mundane dissent and black-market dealings that once qualified as "counterrevolutionary" behavior. And rather than stiffen its line against the growing apathy, the Government recently replaced the aging, hard-line army general who headed the committees and started a campaign to soften their image.
"We have to struggle against everything that is contrary to the Revolution," said the new, 33-year-old head of the organization, Juan Contino. But he added that on Mr. Castro's orders, "the C.D.R.s have to adapt the methods we apply and our style of work to the current conditions."
To some analysts of Cuban politics, the shift is proof of the elasticity of the mechanisms that continue to suppress any organized challenge to the Communist Party. But others also predict that the erosion of what has long been a first line of Government defense against internal opponents could also bring a wider role for civilian shock troops like the so-called Rapid Response Brigades created in 1991 and sometimes used to harass dissidents.
"The vitality, the genuine participation has diminished enormously," one Western diplomat said of the committees. "The hard-core apparatchiks are still very tough. But you have fewer and fewer control mechanisms along the way. That makes violence more and more likely."
Political tensions in Havana have ebbed palpably after a summer marked by the hijacking of several Government boats, the violent sinking of one of them in which 37 people were reported drowned, an anti-Government riot and the flight of more than 30,000 refugees.
But the line of tolerance has not moved for the dozens of tiny political and human rights groups that are openly dissident and formally banned under Cuban law.
After several thousand angry Cubans were drawn to a spontaneous riot against the security forces that broke out near the Havana seawall on Aug. 5, at least 30 members of political and human rights groups were briefly jailed, according to a list compiled by human rights groups and American diplomats.
Most were released within 72 hours. But several others were held for about two weeks, and at least two were badly beaten while in custody, a report by the New York-based group Human Rights Watch/Americas said.
Some dissidents say they have also continued to receive threatening anonymous telephone calls and warnings from security officials to stay out of public view before a scheduled visit to Cuba in mid-November by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Jose Ayala Lasso.
As Mr. Castro established them in 1960, while anti-Communist guerrillas were still expanding their operations in the central Escambray mountains, the committees were meant to keep such opposition from ever taking shape.
Under the supervision of block captains whose disapproval of a neighbor might mean a black mark with the security services or the denial of a good job, members were supposed to report any unusual people or activity, and to keep tabs on any neighbors seen as critical of the Government.
By the 1980's, the organization was said officially to include more than 80 percent of all Cubans, forming at least on paper a security network more extensive than any in the Soviet bloc.
The makeover of the committees as a family-oriented organization began before the economy began to crumble. Members were recruited to help with vaccination campaigns, neighborhood clean-ups, recycling drives. Until 1991, almost all Cubans had to perform four days of "voluntary" work every month.
The community-group image survives in some parts of the country, particularly in rural areas.
In the farming village of Baire, in the eastern province of Santiago de Cuba, the commemoration of the committees' 34th anniversary on Sept. 28 looked strikingly like the celebration of a local patron saint in any other Latin American country.
Committee members gathered talking by a small shrine that included images of revolutionary heroes like Mr. Castro and Ernesto (Che) Guevara. A scarecrow-type doll made of old clothes sat in a chair doing "vigilance."
The local committee chief, Edilio Avila, 42, acknowledged that there had not been much counterrevolutionary activity to guard against in Baire. One night in December, a strange Ford had parked along the highway at night, but it turned out to be a man waiting for his girlfriend. The summer before that, two young men were caught trying to steal a pig.
"We all know one another here, but you can find out that people are not what you thought they were," said Mr. Avila, the manager of a local soap factory, referring to the pig incident. "We have to protect ourselves against those people."
The images that trouble Communist Party officials are more like those of the recent hit film "Strawberry and Chocolate," by the director Tomas Gutierrez Alea. In the tenement in which one of the story's protagonists lives, the head of the block committee is an irreverent, fast-talking woman who survives by selling imported clothes on the black market.
"We used to do vigilance from 12 at night until 3 in the morning, and then from 3 until 6," said a Cuban journalist who is a Communist Party member, recounting his local committee's history on the condition that he not be identified. "Then it was from 11 at night until 2 in the morning, watching to see that there were no counterrevolutionary activities.
"But my C.D.R. hasn't had a watch now for a year and a half," he went on. "It just doesn't work anymore, because there's not enough food, there are problems with transportation. And people here do whatever they want now, and they see that not a damn thing happens to them."
Miguel Marrero Sosa, the chief of the committees in central Villa Clara province, acknowledged nearly as much.
"If a guy has to go out and get firewood to cook with, he cannot do the vigilance," he said, alluding to shortages of cooking fuel and electricity.
To fight rising crime, Mr. Marrero said, his local watchmen were focusing more on possible targets like warehouses and less on empty streets.
"The vigilance is a fundamental issue that has to be reviewed," the national leader, Mr. Contino, said in an interview. But he added that in a country where newsprint is scarce and blackouts often cut the electricity to run television sets, the committees would begin focusing more on neighborhood politicking to combat American propaganda transmitted to the island.
"It is true that more people are listening to Radio Marti," he said of the anti-Castro station. "The ideological war against us is more intense than it was even in the first years of the revolution."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: THE HOUSE;
G.O.P. APPEARS SET TO MAKE BIG GAINS IN RACE FOR HOUSE

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Republicans are poised to win more seats in the House of Representatives than they have held since Dwight D. Eisenhower was President. Indeed, after a strong campaign they could end 40 years of Democratic control in the House, history's longest period of one-party dominance there.
Democratic leaders, who worked hard this weekend to stir interest among their core voters, said they expected Republicans to gain at least 25 House seats in Tuesday's elections. That would take the minority from the 178 seats it now holds to 203. 
 But Republicans are counting on more.
It would take a gain of 40 seats for the Republicans to reach a majority of 218 and make Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia the first Republican Speaker of the House since Joseph W. Martin Jr. of Massachusetts gave up the gavel in 1955.
Mr. Gingrich all but claimed that sort of victory in an interview on Friday. He predicted a gain of at least 30 seats and as many as 75, adding, "You have to really squeeze to get below 35."
Campaigning in Seattle today, President Clinton said in a CNN television interview that he believed that the Democrats would retain control of both the Senate and the House. But he acknowledged that they would probably lose a substantial number of seats in both houses. [Page B9.]
Whether or not they win a majority in the House, the Republicans will have greatly increased power there.
With more than 200 seats for the first time since 1959, they would be able to block almost any legislation proposed by the President, given the help of a handful of conservative Democrats.
And if they attained a majority, they could set a legislative agenda of their own and scramble committee chairmanships, structures and staffing to a degree never seen in earlier shake-ups of smaller, cozier Congressional establishments.
While the magnitude of their gain is still uncertain, a Republican trend based on economic uncertainty, fear of crime and a sense of national disarray exemplified by Congress itself has been evident for weeks.
More than a quarter of the 435 seats in the House still appeared to be up for grabs this weekend after a season of "remarkably late-breaking races," as Representative Vic Fazio, the California Democrat who heads his party's House campaign committee, put it.
But of the 124 seats identified by party officials, pollsters and political analysts as still in reach of either party, 89 were being defended by Democrats, only 34 by Republicans. The one other such seat is held by Representative Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who usually votes with Democrats and faces a tough Republican opponent.
Even with the financial advantages of incumbency, those numbers make Republican gains all but certain among members running for re-election. The mood of anti-incumbency, which hurt both parties in 1990 and mainly Republicans in 1992, is now trained squarely on the Democrats.
Of the 64 Democratic incumbents in close races, 17 are in contests that appear to be tossups, a group that includes such venerable leaders as House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington State and Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Worse yet for the Democrats, 11 others are trailing their Republican opponents.
In contrast, of 19 Republican incumbents in tough contests, only one seems to be trailing and two are in tossups. Republicans say it is possible that none of their incumbents will lose.
The open seats present another happy picture for the Republicans. In 25 close races for seats vacated by retiring Democrats, 8 Republicans hold strong leads and 10 hold narrower leads; 6 of those races are rated tossups, with only 1 leaning Democratic. In those contests, Republicans are profiting from delayed effects of the 1992 redistricting; some well-known Democrats held on that year for one last term but have now retired from districts made more hospitable to Republicans.
Of 15 Republican open seats, in contrast, 5 are leaning Republican, 6 are tossups, and 3 are modestly tilting Democratic. The Democrats have a strong edge only in Rhode Island's First Congressional District, where Patrick Kennedy seeks to join his father, Edward, the Senator from Massachusetts, to form the third father-and-son team in Congressional history.
If every seat went the way it appeared to lean this weekend, and if the incumbent party won two-thirds of the tossups, the Republicans would gain 35 seats.
Attention is now focused on turnout. If a greater proportion of the nation's Republicans than of its Democrats go to the polls, Mr. Gingrich's hopes could be fulfilled.
The President's last-minute campaigning, along with a nationwide blitz by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, were two major efforts by the Democrats to excite their faithful. Tony Coelho, the former Congressman who is advising the White House on the campaign, said Saturday: "Our biggest concern had been that Republicans succeeded in persuading people that the election was over. We are close. We are not going to lose the House, and we are not going to lose the Senate if people come out to vote."
But one leading Congressional scholar, Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution, said that "all of the energy is on the Republican side."
Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, said, "The people who are fired up by this are our coalition." He said he saw "a resolve to the Republican coalition that I haven't seen since 1982."
And Curtis Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, agreed, saying Democrats "are not mobilized and may not be mobilizable."
Republicans based much of their push for major gains on the notion that the Democrats, who in 1992 won control of the White House while retaining the Senate and the House, had since disappointed the voters. That made it possible, Mr. Gingrich said, to put out "one clear message from Washington," which could not be done in the 1980's, when control of the White House and Congress was divided between the parties.
Mr. McInturff, the Republican pollster, said that after 1992, voters had expected, at a minimum, "a cleanup of Congress." He said the election "should be read as a referendum on Clinton."
For his part, Mr. Gingrich said the public was generally moving toward the right and was dismayed at evidence of a tattered social fabric, such as the case of the South Carolina woman arrested in the killing of her two sons.
Mr. Foley, who has waged his own arduous campaign to convince voters in eastern Washington that they have something to gain from his continuing as Speaker of the House, typifies the uphill road many Democrats confront. He sees unfairness in Republicans' stalling legislation on lobbyists and campaign spending before Congress adjourned and then profiting from Congress's inaction.
"I find it a bit frustrating that the people who mugged the legislative proposals then get credit for having mugged them, and some of the public is angry that they were mugged," he said in an interview on Wednesday. "I mean, who is the victim and who is the mugger here?"
But the fact is that most Democrats have not felt safe campaigning on the accomplishments of the 103d Congress. While they may boast of money they brought home to their districts, they do not claim much credit for the tough deficit-reduction votes cast in 1993. Instead, they have sought to portray themselves as just as antagonistic to their institution as are the candidates running against them.
Democrats did, however, spend more of their energy firing back at the Republicans, accusing them of threatening Social Security and abortion rights in particular.
Both accusations stem from the "Contract With America" that Mr. Gingrich and his allies drew up and got more than 300 House Republican candidates to sign. It pledges a balanced budget without new taxes -- which Democrats say imperils Social Security and Medicare -- and promises to restore the Bush Administration's prohibition on abortion counseling in federally financed family planning clinics.
The season's tone was almost wholly negative. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania, a leading student of political commercials, said, "You can find whole states in which there are no self-promotional ads for a candidate."
But the campaign was also characterized by the Republicans' best organizational efforts in many years. Martin Wattenberg, a professor of political science at the University of California at Irvine, attributes the likelihood of their gains to their having recruited an "amazing" number of strong candidates.

HEADLINE: From the Andes, Indians Spread the Word: They're Argentine and Proud of It

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO DE LOS COBRES, Argentina

 BODY:
Some 12,300 feet above sea level in the Andes Mountains, Coya Indians were laughing, waving, pointing and jumping for joy the other day as a tourist train pulled into the station of this isolated mining village.
The Indians, whose ancestors established the village more than 300 years ago to escape Spanish domination, come to the train station every Saturday to sell their handicrafts, receive donations of food and clothing, and read old newspapers that have been left on the train. 
 But they also come for what they say is a more important reason: to pledge allegiance to the Republic of Argentina, an act their ancestors would probably find appalling since they migrated to this high desert plateau to live and worship free of Spanish influence.
When the so-called Train to the Clouds arrives each week, the Indians stand at attention and proudly belt out the national anthem as train tour guides raise the blue and white striped Argentine flag.
"We are proud of our heritage and our culture as Coya Indians, but we are also proud to be Argentine," said Isabel del Isuasa, who wore traditional long black braids and a colorful multilayered skirt and had her baby daughter strapped to her back. "It means so much to us that our fellow countrymen haven't forgotten us and acknowledge that we are part of the same nation."
Several Indian women and children cried openly as they sang "Let us live crowned by glory, or sentenced to die for glory," the music to the national anthem ringing slightly behind the voices because of weak batteries in a boom box.
Perhaps the Indians were sentimental because this tourist train was the last to pass through San Antonio de Los Cobres until March, when mudslides caused by heavy rain are no longer a danger. While cargo trains regularly pass through on the way to Chile, visitors rarely call except when the Train to the Clouds is running.
Tour guides say they began the flag-raising ceremony this year to give the Indians a sense of connection with the rest of Argentina and to expose Argentines, who are almost exclusively of European descent, to the indigenous people. The tourists and the Indians stand side by side singing the national anthem, equal citizens, at least for the moment.
"Most people who take this train are from Buenos Aires and other big, sophisticated cities, so we stop here in San Antonio de los Cobres to show them that they have countrymen who have a different culture and live under different conditions," said Martin Yaguado, a tour guide.
Village officials are hoping that rising interest in trips through Argentina's Andean region into Chile will bring money and jobs to San Antonio de Los Cobres. Private investors plan to open a small hotel in the village next year and there is talk of developing the area's hot springs into an attraction.
Government estimates of the number of Indians in Argentina's population of 33 million range from 100,000 to 300,000; human rights groups and Indian groups say the number is 750,000. Before the Spanish conquest, millions of Indians are believed to have lived in what is now Argentina, especially in the pampas. The Indians there were virtually wiped out, and in other areas Indians have faced discrimination, seeing much of their culture, language and religion disappear.
Located in Salta Province, about 1,100 miles northwest of Buenos Aires, San Antonio de Los Cobres is an ugly mining village set on a bleak high desert. Most of the village's 4,000 people live in stone huts, few of which have electricity and running water.
The town's main source of income has been the copper, zinc, lead and silver mines and train maintenance, but recent privatizations and consolidations of these businesses have brought steep unemployment.
"We don't mind so much being isolated because we enjoy our customs and traditions, but we really need jobs now to feed our children," said Mario Perez, a teacher at the secondary school.
Because this was the last tourist train of the season, schoolchildren had decorated the station with exhibits celebrating Coya cultural and religious heritage.
The people of San Antonio de los Cobres have retained many traditions. They revere Pacha Mama, or Mother Earth, who they believe provides them with food and copper from the mines. Despite their conversion to Catholicism, they perform traditional dances of praise to Pacha Mama.
The Coya Indians are Incas whose ancestors are believed to have fled the Spanish colonization in the lowlands after they were forced to change their way of life and religion. "Coya" is an Inca word meaning eminence that was reserved for royalty. All Coyas eventually adopted the word for themselves because they considered themselves divine compared with their conquerors.
The unspoiled landscape of the region shifts radically from lush, verdant mountainside to desert plateaus. Brilliant colors of lead, silver, manganese and iron periodically coat the mountain slopes, and cacti and other desert plants are everywhere.
"We have a different way of life up here," said Mr. Perez, the schoolteacher, "but please don't forget that we are Coya-Argentine and we would like to share that with the rest of our country."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: CONNECTICUT;
The 4 Possible Governors On a Final Weekend Tour

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Nov. 6

 BODY:
John G. Rowland toured western Connecticut with busloads of supporters today, rallying Republicans in the part of the state that nearly elected him Governor in 1990. The final poll before the election showed him holding on to a statistically insignificant lead in the four-way governor's race.
Comptroller William E. Curry Jr., the Democrat, who has generally held second place in the polls, spoke at churches and rallies in the New Haven area, while Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark of A Connecticut Party, third in polls but gaining, spent the day contesting Mr. Rowland in Fairfield County. 
 With no one favored by even a third of the respondents in any recent survey, and with anywhere from 15 percent to 20 percent undecided in recent polls, the candidates appealed to their core supporters with familiar messages while trying to woo voters who were wavering.
Casting himself as an underdog although he has been leading in polls throughout the race, Mr. Rowland urged supporters here to call their friends before the election, even those leaning to "a third- or fourth-party candidate," a reference to the race's two former Republicans, Mrs. Groark, and Tom Scott, an independent pledged to repeal the state's income tax. "Tell someone who's leaning toward a third- or fourth-party candidate that perhaps their vote will help elect someone they don't want to be Governor," he said.
In a new television advertisement, Mr. Curry uses the prospect of a Rowland victory against Mrs. Groark. "Groark?" a narrator says. "Hmm. Same stuff as Weicker. And is she strong enough to stop Rowland? I don't want Rowland."
Mrs. Groark, gaining in polls as Mr. Rowland and Mr. Curry attack each other, is trying to keep supporters from defecting. "My opponents want you to believe I can't win," she says in an ad. "But if that's the only reason you're voting for one of them, aren't you wasting your vote?"
The final Courant/Connecticut poll, published today, showed both Mr. Rowland and Mr. Curry slipping, while Mrs. Groark and Mr. Scott gained. Mr. Rowland still led, with 30 percent, followed by Mr. Curry with 25 percent. The margin of sampling error was four percentage points, making the lead inconclusive.
Mrs. Groark was third with 18 percent, a 10-point gain in the last month, while Mr. Scott had 11 percent, a 6-point gain. Fifteen percent of the 1,085 people surveyed from Monday to Saturday said they were undecided.
On the trail today, Mr. Rowland spoke at Congressional district rallies in Stamford, Torrington and Waterbury, where he received 60 percent of his votes in 1990.
Mr. Rowland's base is in Waterbury, where he represented the Fifth District from 1984 to 1990. Lower Fairfield County, the Fourth District, is the traditional mother lode of Republican votes and funds.
He entered the final weekend with a large advantage here, where most people watch New York rather than Connecticut television: with $500,000 of his $3.3 million war chest still on hand, he is the only candidate able to afford the New York stations.
"We're feeling fine with the five-point lead," said John Chapin, Mr. Rowland's press secretary, as supporters on streets around the Stamford Government Center waved signs and asked motorists to honk their support. "If we win by five points, we'll all be happy campers."
A handful of Curry volunteers scored a tactical victory when they paraded by with a large banner, drawing many of the Rowland people away from the curb. But anger flashed when the volunteers disrupted Mr. Rowland's speech inside the building by rapping on windows.
Looking a bit tired from it all, Mr. Rowland tried to turn the commotion against Mr. Curry, whom he has attacked as a liberal throughout the campaign. The protesters, he said, were just like "the liberals up in Hartford who want to control our lives."
Mr. Curry spent much of the day looking for support in cities. On a Windsor radio station and at African-American congregations in New Haven, he pushed his proposals for a billion-dollar cut in local property taxes, which would help Connecticut's cities, and for school-loan and small-business-loan programs.
He also portrayed the race as between himself and Mr. Rowland, ignoring Mrs. Groark, who is drawing some Democrats to her. At this point, he said, he is only as far behind in polls as he was just before the Democratic primary, which he won as the challenger.
"I thought what he had to say made sense," said Carol F. Moore, a member of the United Church of Christ on Dixwell Avenue in New Haven. "But see, they all talk a good game. It's when it comes down to the goosing that tells."
Mrs. Groark began her day on the East Side of Bridgeport, one of Fairfield County's poorest neighborhoods, handing out literature printed in both English and Spanish. Then she moved on to Fairfield, a well-off suburb, where more people recognized her, sometimes to her advantage and sometimes not.
"She's honest and she's not slick," said Patricia Nelson, a young Fairfield woman who promised Mrs. Groark her vote. But an older man stopped to complain that Mrs. Groark and Mr. Weicker were costing him $37 a week because of the income tax they pushed through in 1991 to end a fiscal crisis.
Mrs. Groark has pledged to continue the fiscal policies of the Weicker administration, which she says have started Connecticut back to economic health, while the other candidates are promising tax cuts. But she has campaigned largely without Mr. Weicker, who today was in Washington at a football game.
"I had to stand on my own," she said. "If I was too close to Weicker, I would be eclipsed. I'm running on my own, and I called the shots."
At Mr. Scott's headquarters, the usual weekend tag sale to raise money for the bare-bones campaign was under way as he left in a motorcade to greet shoppers at supermarkets. With him was his mother, Dorothy Scott, who was wearing a sweatshirt that said, "I'm Tom's Mom."
Mr. Scott, a former state senator and talk-show host whose opposition to the income tax pushed Mr. Rowland to pledge for its repeal, said the polls understated his strength because of his "notorious factor." Many people, he said, are embarrassed to admit they support him.

HEADLINE: As Bosnian War Intensifies, Debate Grows Over Partition Plan

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Nov. 6

 BODY:
In the Sarajevo office of Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, a map that divides Bosnia and Herzegovina under an American-backed peace plan hangs on a wall. Gazing at it recently, an aide to the general scornfully said, "If you were a Serb, would you accept that?"
The map, prepared by the United States and four other countries as part of a peace agreement, is regarded by General Rose and the British officers who surround him as unrealistic, ill-conceived and unfair to the Bosnian Serbs. 
 Offering 51 percent of Bosnia to the Muslim-led Government in alliance with the Bosnian Croats and 49 percent to the Bosnian Serbs, the map has now been on the table for almost four months, rejected by the Bosnian Serbs but accepted by the Bosnian Government. It has now become a subject of heated debate because the quest for peace is in limbo as the war escalates.
The military tension was evident today and on Saturday in fierce fighting around the northwestern town of Bosanska Krupa, where the Bosnian Army has recently advanced, and in sharp artillery exchanges between Bosnian Serb and Muslim-led Government forces in the western suburbs of Sarajevo that only died down when NATO planes passed overhead.
Faced with that deterioration, officials from the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia met here this weekend. Central to their discussion was the map, people close to the talks said.
Referring to General Rose, the commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, one official said: "He thinks there was not enough consultation with the Serbs on the map. And when he goes up to see them he seems to convey these reservations, and the Serbs get the idea the West is about to change the plan."
Col. Tim Spicer, General Rose's spokesman, denied that the general had had anything more than vague discussions about changing the map with the Bosnian Serbs' leader, Radovan Karadzic, and his commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic.
The American view is that the map cannot be changed because this would undercut the way it was presented -- as a take it or leave it proposal -- and would probably also lead the Bosnian Government to reconsider its acceptance of the plan. Rather, the Clinton Administration argues that military and economic pressure must be maintained on the Bosnian Serbs, while indicating some flexibility to Mr. Karadzic.
"The fact is that the Bosnian Serbs misunderstood the plan," one official said. "Once they say yes, everything is negotiable. The map is a starting point."
This was the view that Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, also tried to impress on the Bosnian Serbs before they rejected it. Mr. Milosevic then imposed a blockade that has contributed to the current problems of the Bosnian Serbs.
Mr. Karadzic has insisted that the map divides territory held by Bosnian Serbs into four dislocated parts and denies them cities, economic resources and access to the sea.
Recent military successes by the Bosnian Government suggest that the war may grow far worse. "There is a danger that the Bosnians could well say we don't need the contact group any longer," one official said, referring to the five-nation alliance. "Or that the Croats decide the Serbs are on the run and their moment has come to attack in Croatia. Or that the Yugoslav Army reacts to either of these scenarios by getting involved itself."

HEADLINE: U.S. Oil and Gas Companies Test Waters in Brazil, Again

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov. 6

 BODY:
Oil and gas companies from the United States are returning to Brazil, their first major effort since 1953, after being effectively excluded for four decades by the country's old nationalist and protectionist policies.
American oil-service companies, sometimes called the pilot fish of the big international producers, turned out in force last month at the Brazilian Petroleum Congress. Competing for an annual market estimated at $1 billion in sales and contracts, 47 American oil-service companies mounted stands here. 
"Until 18 months ago, the door was basically shut in our faces," said Bob Greenwood, a salesman with Bestolife, a Dallas company that makes drilling-pipe sealant. "You could ship the product down here, but it would sit on the dock and rot."
Now that Brazil is discarding tariffs and protectionist quotas, American companies have won about half the oil-service market, a survey by the United States Consulate here indicated. Other opportunities await production and pipeline companies.
By the end of the 1990's, Latin America is expected to pass the United States and Canada and become the world's second-largest oil-producing region, after the Middle East. Brazil is Latin America's third-largest oil producer, after Venezuela and Mexico, extracting about two-thirds of its oil from wells offshore Rio de Janeiro state.
"With the new Government, there is going to be an explosion of this sector," said Etienne Kvassay, a Brazilian trade economist who prepared the consulate's survey. "This market should grow at the rate of 30 percent in the next three years."
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who will become President on Jan. 1, pledged during the campaign to relax the monopoly that Brazil's state oil monopoly, Petrobras, has enjoyed for 41 years over oil exploration, production and refining.
Mr. Cardoso's campaign platform called for the establishment of partnerships and joint ventures between Petrobras and private business.
The President-elect went further in a recent interview with Brasil Energy, an oil and gas monthly. "Petrobras is already a sufficiently mature business to open itself up to partnerships or to competition with private companies," he said.
In Petrobras's largest joint venture to date, two United States energy companies, Tenneco and Enron, both of Houston, signed contracts in August to participate as minority partners in the construction next year of a $1.8 billion, 1,400-mile pipeline linking gas fields in eastern Bolivia with the industrial heartland of southern Brazil. The project is regarded as a prototype for future joint ventures valued at $2 billion.
Antonio Luiz de Menezes, Petrobras's project manager for the Bolivia-Brazil gas line, said United States companies had also been invited to bid next year on a second Brazilian gas line projected to run 375 miles within the Amazon basin.
Oil exploration may be on the horizon. Betting that Brazilian legislators would approve a constitutional amendment next year to allow foreign joint ventures, executives and geologists from Amoco, Occidental Petroleum and Pennzoil traveled here for the petroleum congress.
"I'm here to make contacts, to build up relationships," said Don B. Felio, director of new Latin American ventures for the Amoco Overseas Exploration Company. "But there's a lot of competition for oil investment in South America. If Brazil decides it wants foreign investment, it will have to compete."
Steven Hopper, general manager of Pecten do Brasil, expressed optimism that exploration and production would be opened to foreign companies. "There is not any doubt that the industry as a whole looks on Brazil as one of the plums in the world tree, up there alongside Russia," said Mr. Hopper, whose company operates a gas concession.
Foreign companies are also benefiting from Brazilians' dissatisfaction with Petrobras's long monopoly. Of the seven countries where oil production is treated as a state monopoly, Brazil is the only importer, buying almost half its oil abroad.
And with the nation's economy expected to grow 5 percent annually through the rest of the decade, Petrobras has no hope of making Brazil self-sufficient in the near future. Because offshore deposits make production expensive, Brazil would have to invest $13 billion a year to attain self-sufficiency by 2010. But with an exploration and new production budget of $3 billion this year, the company has been forced to shelve 270 expansion projects.
Although Petrobras's international arm has operations in dozens of other countries, the company has a history of fighting foreign investment at home. And as Brazil's largest company, it can marshal immense resources -- 50,000 employees and annual revenue of $21 billion.
In 1975, when Brazil briefly allowed foreign exploration contracts, Petrobras geologists allocated some of the least promising areas to the foreigners. After 35 companies had wasted millions of dollars drilling dry holes, Petrobras cried victory, claiming a 35 percent success rate in its own drilling operations.
Last spring, when the Brazilian Congress was considering a proposal to allow exploration by foreign oil concerns, Petrobras responded by announcing four major discoveries of its own, flying legislators to its offshore platforms and spending an estimated $20 million to advertise itself as "a Brazilian success story."
"Petrobras extorts money from the citizen, and then with this same money, convinces him that he should continue to be extorted," asserted Antonio Delfim Netto, a conservative Congressman from Sao Paulo.
But with even sections of the left-wing Workers Party supporting relaxation of the oil monopoly, Petrobras's lobbying appears to have failed. Veja, Brazil's most influential news weekly, recently published a 10-page article attacking the company under the headline: "Petrobras Is Afraid of Competition."
Representatives of United States companies that were hurt by contracts between 1975 and 1986 stressed that Brazil must now create more competitive conditions. The assignment of exploration acreage, they say, should be taken away from Petrobras, and joint ventures should allow foreign companies to work as operating partners, not limit them to financing operations for Petrobras.
"It all depends on the geology and on the contracts," said the representative of an American company that lost millions in Brazilian dry holes in the early 1980's. "There are a lot of other places in the world to invest in."

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: VOTERS;
Last-Ditch Efforts Begin To Get People to Polls

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES 

 BODY:
He is a bridge inspector by trade. But yesterday at an intersection in Forest Hills, Queens, Tom Murphy sat at a table in the driving rain and with his "Cuomo '94" hat turned backward, played the role of carnival barker.
"Vote for Cuomo!" his booming voice yelled to passersby. "If you value your children, Vote for Cuomo. Re-elect Mario Cuomo." 
 Often they ignored him, rushing to get out of the rain -- or maybe just away from him. But Mr. Murphy, a veteran volunteer, said that he didn't mind the indifference because there was a chance that his loud refrain might echo in their heads on Election Day. "I realize when they go into that poll booth that if my voice can go with them, my influence can help," he said.
This weekend, the final effort to turn out the vote on Election Day began in earnest. Thousands of volunteers from Buffalo to Staten Island staffed phone banks, hung posters and stuffed mailboxes in the hope that one more reminder could inspire the party faithful, sway the undecided and excite the apathetic come Tuesday.
With the tightest Governor's race in more than a decade and an anti-government fervor feeding voter apathy and anger, both Democrats and Republicans say these last days may make the difference between victory and defeat. Politicians and poll takers say that if 55 percent of the state's registered voters actually vote, it will be a heavy turnout.
And so after months in which millions of dollars have been spent on television advertising, the final result hinges on translating potential support into votes. And so party officials, partisan clubs, unions and special interest groups have banded together to support their candidates -- and discourage those who would support their opponents.
On Sunday, while volunteers for the Democratic Party fanned out to intersections and neighborhoods, workers for the Christian Coalition of New York distributed voter guides at 2,000 churches, focusing on how candidates stood on certain issues.
On Saturday, a caravan of 20 cars led by a flatbed truck honked its way through the streets of the Bronx, blasting music and a message to support the Democratic slate. On Friday, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League of New York State kicked off a "Broadway for Choice" campaign by passing out 62-page voter guides to theater patrons. They planned to do the same at Manhattan subway stations through Election Day.
"I see a close race," said the Staten Island Borough President, Guy V. Molinari, who is in charge of State Sen. George E. Pataki's campaign in New York City. "And I think the side that works harder and more effectively in the last few days is the one that's going to win."
While the emphasis is being placed on personal phone calls to supporters, mass mailings and face-to-face appeals, there is also some negative campaigning taking place.
Mr. Murphy in Queens links the election of Mr. Cuomo to the survival of New York's children. A postcard showing a woman behind bars says that the Republican candidate for Comptroller, Herbert London, wants women prosecuted for choosing to have abortions. (Mr. London has favored fining women who get abortions, rather than jailing them.)
A brightly colored leaflet with a picture of Pat Robertson offers "four frightening statements every New York woman should read." It includes quotations from Mr. Robertson under the headings "Women Are Not Equal," "Feminism Is Witchcraft" and "George Pataki Is My Favorite State Senator." Among the pictures are those of women wearing dunce caps and witch's hats. (Mr. Pataki himself has not taken such positions, but the literature is linked to high ratings he has received from Mr. Robertson's Christian Coalition based on his votes, including those against increases in taxes and spending and Medicaid payments for abortions.)
Whatever the message, there are many messengers. The Republicans have enlisted a statewide volunteer force in the tens of thousands to distribute millions of pieces of literature in the final days, said John Sweeney, executive director and counsel of the New York Republican State Committee. One leaflet, from the National Republican Congressional Committee, says a candidate is interested in Asian affairs just because he likes the food.
On Long Island, a critical battleground in the race for Governor, roughly 500,000 pieces of literature are to be distributed in Suffolk County alone and dozens of volunteers plan to make calls right through election day, said Howard C. DeMartini, chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Committee.
Meanwhile, the Democrats were to distribute 10 million pieces of literature between Friday and Tuesday using legions of volunteers, said Joel Benenson, a spokesman for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's campaign. One flier from the State Democratic Committee looks like the cover of a tabloid newspaper. "Pataki to City: Drop Dead," it says.
In all, 25,000 volunteers statewide were expected to make four million phone calls to identified Democratic supporters in the last five days of the campaign, Mr. Benenson said.
Unions like the Communication Workers of America and the United Federation of Teachers have also been critical components of the Democrats' get-out-the-vote effort.
In the northeast Bronx, a primarily black community where there was an 80 percent turnout in last year's mayoral election, the logistics of getting out the vote have been honed to a science. Volunteers often leaflet their own blocks, placing cards under doors rather than thrusting them rudely into people's hands. Different pieces of literature are given to people in different economic groups.
For residents of the community's housing projects, the leaflets evoke images from black history and speak of apartheid's fall in South Africa as ways to inspire a disillusioned voter to get involved.
One leaflet has pictures of Nelson Mandela and Mayor David N. Dinkins next to a photo of State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who, if elected, will be the first statewide black elected official. "Breaking Down Barriers," the cover says, "Making History for Our Community." Another black-and-white leaflet displays an X on its cover to remind the voter of Malcolm X. But in this case it represents the mark on a ballot.
"A lot of people need to be motivated because of Dinkins's loss of the election," said Oliver Seabrook, who is coordinating the Northeast Bronx Democratic Community Club's campaign efforts.
Other areas also use personal messages to voters. Mr. Molinari sent 100,000 letters to constituents, signed by either himself or his daughter, Congresswoman Susan Molinari, blasting Mr. Cuomo's record and praising Mr. Pataki.
Last week, volunteers waded through traffic jams on the streets leading to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to hand the letter to motorists, Mr. Molinari said. And they may do the same today and tomorrow, while continuing to distribute leaflets at ferry points and train stations around the island.
Upstate, Babbidean Huber, a member of the Amherst Republican Committee, spent Saturday carefully attaching rolled leaflets to the handles of storm doors. She never dropped one in front of a door or walked on a lawn, because, she said, "I don't want to create a negative impression."
She has been involved in politics for 10 years, and believes that whether or not her efforts gain the G.O.P. any ground, at least they help insure none is lost. "Even if it doesn't do anything, you've got to just keep it even-steven. You don't want the other side to have one up on you."

HEADLINE: China's Power Needs Exceed Investor Tolerance

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 6

 BODY:
As China's supply of electrical power falls more and more behind its surging demand, the nation's Communist Party leadership is paralyzed by an ideological struggle over how much profit foreign investors should be allowed to make from the power industry.
With economic growth of nearly 12 percent predicted this year, China is failing to meet its goals for adding power generation. Blackouts are plaguing the largest industrial centers like Shanghai, and shortages are cutting deeply into productivity nationwide. 
 But instead of accelerating a program to build power plants with foreign financing, the Chinese leadership has refused to approve a single joint-venture power plant since late in 1992, when Gordon Y. S. Wu, a prominent Hong Kong developer, signed an agreement for his last power project, in Guangdong province in the south.
Nearly 50 projects involving foreign partners are now on hold in China, power-industry officials say. Large American companies like Mission Energy, Wing International, Entergy and General Electric have been negotiating joint-venture deals for months to build power stations, but the local authorities have not been able to get approval from the central Government in Beijing.
"Without power, without roads, without transport, the rest of China's development is not going to happen," said Rigdon Boykin, a Hong Kong-based lawyer whose firm represents two dozen clients seeking to enter China's power market. "These are the building blocks of industry."
China is the world's fourth-largest power producer. But the average Chinese consumes less than 650 kilowatt hours, barely enough to burn a 75-watt light bulb year round. And about 120 million rural Chinese -- one-tenth of this enormous country's population -- live without electricity in their houses or villages, China's Minister of Electric Power, Shi Da-zhen, said.
The internal debate over foreign profit has pitted reform-minded bureaucrats and province leaders hungry for electricity against central planners who are distrustful of foreign ownership and suspicious of financial arrangements that would provide competitive rates of return on invested capital.
Mr. Wu complained that the Government under Prime Minister Li Peng issued orders last fall to limit profit margins on power projects to about 12 percent -- well below the 18 or 20 percent obtainable elsewhere in Asia.
"I think some of the Chinese leaders have decided that if foreign investors are making money, it's at the expense of the Chinese," said Mr. Wu, who has built the only large, foreign-financed power stations in this country.
Constructing a modern electrical-supply system for 1.2 billion Chinese is critical to sustaining economic growth and to maintaining political stability, Chinese and Western economic experts say. But the demand for electricity from thousands of new factories, office towers and shopping centers is outpacing China's current generating capacity by 30 percent in the fastest-growing coastal provinces and by 20 percent nationwide.
Mr. Shi recently said that China's energy crisis was already here, adding, "Without the necessary supply of power, the entire economy will be bottlenecked."
Where Western power grids build a 25 percent-surplus generating capacity into their systems to meet peak demand and allow down time for maintenance, officials say that China's power grid is running every piece of equipment it has.
And because China's economic growth is surging nearly 12 percent, after two years of 13 percent growth, the demand for electricity is enormous. In the last 12 months, officials managed to bring only 6,400 megawatts of new power on line, which is hardly enough.
The Power Ministry says China needs to add 15,000 to 17,000 megawatts of generating capacity each year for more than a decade. That is the equivalent each year of duplicating all of Southern California Edison's plants, which supply Southern and Central California.
Communist Party officials have said that an investment of $80 billion over the next five years would nearly double the current national generating capacity -- from 175,000 megawatts to 300,000 megawatts, which is still well short of the country's power needs.
Chinese banks and government agencies can finance 70 percent of this total requirement, officials say, leaving the remaining 30 percent, or about $45 billion worth, to come from foreign investors.
Some negotiations are making progress, and there are indications that Chinese authorities may authorize a handful of large projects to go forward on an experimental basis in the next few months under face-saving formulas that would yield rates of return in excess of 15 percent.
One power consortium. which includes the Los Angeles-based Mission Energy, Bechtel Enterprises and the Lippo group of Hong Kong, is said to have received preliminary approval from the State Planning Commission to build a 700-megawatt power station in southern Fujian province, facing the Taiwan Strait. But a Mission executive said China's top political authorities had not signed off on the deal and that it also had not yet been presented to the bankers.
Even the influential leaders of Shanghai, the nation's industrial giant, have not been able to wring approval from Beijing for a joint venture with General Electric to build a 400-megawatt oil-fired plant that would provide their city with an infusion of electrical power.
Some provinces, desperate to circumvent the policy gridlock in Beijing, are making small-scale deals to purchase oil-fired turbines to produce enough power to run a single industrial park or a real estate development.
Mr. Wu's company and a number of other foreign concerns have staged what they hope will be a temporary walkout from the Chinese market, leaving behind letters of intent Mr. Wu negotiated with province authorities to build 12 additional power stations across central and southern China.
"If some investors want to withdraw, they are free to make their choice," said Jiang Shaojun, a spokesman for the Power Ministry, "but some others will come to replace them."
But while the demand for power has mounted, billions of dollars in capital has flowed elsewhere in Asia.
"Basically, I think what the Chinese are trying to do is control the cost of capital, and they are not succeeding, and so something is going to have to give," an international banking official said.
J. P. Morgan's senior economist for Asia, Guocang Huan, added, "They have to offer a better deal; otherwise, I just cannot imagine where the money will come from."
Mr. Wu took the $1.8 billion he raised for his China projects and has signed deals in Indonesia and the Philippines.
An American utility executive who is negotiating with the Chinese to supply several large power plants said Western banks had assigned a risk rating to China that required higher rates of return. Chinese officials are trying to squeeze better terms by withholding approval.
"They are disputing our risk credit rating," the executive said, "and they are setting themselves apart from the rest of the world."
Power plants are huge, capital-intensive projects that pay out over decades. Evaluating political risk means guessing whether the Communist Party can guarantee enough stability over, perhaps, 20 years so that the electrical output of a power plant will be purchased on an uninterrupted basis.
"What some investors are worried about is whether China will change" after the death of Deng Xiaoping, China's 90-year-old paramount leader, Mr. Jiang at the Power Ministry remarked. "But there is no risk as far as this question is concerned."
Still, China's thirst for capital to finance infrastructure projects has not abated, but a clear strategy to reassure investors has yet to emerge.
"China's needs are huge and its growth targets are ambitious," said James Thompson, Mission Energy's negotiator in this country, "so Beijing cannot afford indefinite paralysis. If they turn out to be shortsighted on their policies about capital, what could be coming in the future is scarcity."

HEADLINE: Scientology and Its German Foes: A Bitter Conflict

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAMBURG, Germany

 BODY:
It would take something like an invasion of space aliens -- maybe something out of an L. Ron Hubbard science fiction novel -- to match the climate of fear and mutual suspicion that prevails between the Church of Scientology that Mr. Hubbard created and its frightened opponents in Germany.
"Fear is part of their system -- it's a totalitarian organization that seeks to control everybody else, a dictatorship," said Ursula Caberta y Diaz, who heads the four-member working group that was set up four years ago by the Hamburg government to combat the Scientology movement and that has tried to get the courts to declare it a criminal conspiracy. 
 "This couldn't happen anywhere else in the world," said Franz Riedl, the church's spokesman in this country. "Our members have been subject to systematic persecution, arson, threats of violence, and dismissals, and children have been thrown out of kindergartens simply because their parents were Scientologists. The situation has become unbearable."
The church, the high fees it charges members for services and rites that are similar to psychological counseling sessions, and its open involvement in business and marketing have provoked strong reactions all over Germany since it first turned up here in the 1970's.
The Church of Scientology, with headquarters in Los Angeles, was founded in 1954 on the basis of what Mr. Hubbard, an American writer of science fiction who died in 1986, had set down in a book called "Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health."
The church's goal, according to its literature, is "to bring an individual to an understanding of himself and his life as a spiritual being." Global membership is estimated variously from 50,000 to eight million.
The latest scare here is that Scientologists are using the high-priced Hamburg real estate market to amass huge profits for more nefarious purposes.
"They have been buying rental residential properties and turning them overnight into cooperatives, using disreputable methods to frighten and coerce the renters into buying them back at high prices," said Peter Landmann, chairman of the Hamburg branch of the German real-estate agents' association.
Mr. Landmann said companies controlled by the church and companies run by church members were involved. He declined to identify any, but said that as much as a third of the cooperative apartment market in Hamburg might have fallen under their influence.
Mr. Riedl said there might be some real-estate agents who were members of the church, but denied that it was in the business to make money.
According to Mr. Riedl, the church has 30,000 members in Germany, mainly concentrated around Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and Baden-Wurttemberg. But in his view, it is the state and its political institutions that are out of control.
Mrs. Caberta's Social Democratic Party organization in Hamburg fears subversion, and bars church members from joining. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its Government coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, bar them countrywide.
Renate Rennebach, a Social Democratic member of Parliament in Bonn, has called on the Government to ban the church outright, a step that seems unlikely unless somebody can prove in court that it actually practices the extortion, blackmail and subversion it is so often accused of.
"Scientology, despite official denials, is pursuing an expansion strategy that strives for nothing less than global domination," Mrs. Rennebach warned.
Other German politicians have charged that what the church wants is political and economic power -- Germany today, tomorrow the world. "It is a psycho-sect that makes people financially dependent on it and then squeezes them like lemons," said Stefan Schwarz, a Christian Democratic youth leader in Bonn.
But he said that too often the church's opponents did not back up their charges with the facts needed to take action in court.
The banners hanging on the church's five-story glass-walled headquarters in Hamburg say it is being persecuted. Scientology has tax-exempt status in the United States, Canada, Australia and Russia, the signs say -- why not in Germany?
The church and 150 of its related corporations won that status from the United States Internal Revenue Service a year ago, after 39 years of legal battles. Here, there has been no definitive court ruling yet that the church is a nonprofit organization.
But in August, a Hamburg administrative court ruling forbade Mrs. Caberta's office from distributing a pamphlet charging that "Scientology amounts to this: A sick person has succeeded in selling his own madness, in the form of courses, for a great deal of money to mankind as a desirable goal."
The court also ordered the excision of passages accusing the church of "brainwashing" and racism. The city has appealed the decision.
The church gets a uniformly bad press here, and its building has had to be evacuated several times because of bomb threats. "I've been threatened and sprayed with tear gas for distributing church literature," said Karl-Otto Clausen, a 44-year-old church worker.
Mr. Riedl said the church charged 30,000 marks, about $20,000, for the services -- including counseling and questioning sessions -- required to reach the level of "clear," which Mr. Hubbard's teachings define as "a new state for the individual in which he is no longer adversely affected by his past and is capable of living a rational existence."
But according to some former church members, "clear" is just the beginning of a cycle of financial indebtedness the church uses to ensnare adherents. Gunther Trager, a public relations agent in Frankfurt, said he paid six-figure amounts to reach higher levels before he left in 1991.
"They didn't do anything for three-quarters of a year," he said. "Then I gave an interview to a news magazine, and they started threatening me."
The established churches and Government authorities here say they are often asked for help by relatives of members who accuse the Church of Scientology of trapping them in a web of financial and psychological dependence.
Early this year, interior ministers of the 16 German states accused the church of combining "elements of business crime and psychological terror against its own members with economic activities," but stopped short of taking any action. In June, prosecutors in Hamburg dropped a three-year investigation of the church on grounds of "lack of sufficient evidence of the existence of a criminal conspiracy."
The church then began a publicity counteroffensive in the United States suggesting that history was repeating itself here. "It is simply appalling to compare what's happening to them in Germany today with what happened to the Jews under the Nazis," said Professor Fritz Stern, a leading American expert on Germany at Columbia University.
The church recently called attention to its problems here with a series of full-page advertisements in The New York Times and The Washington Post. The advertisements place the measures against the church in the context of widespread racist violence against foreign immigrants and asylum-seekers here, suggesting that the authorities condone the attacks and persecute the church the way the Nazis persecuted the Jews.
The German authorities have denounced the comparison, and the advertising campaign, as being highly misleading. They have banned neo-Nazi groups for inciting violence, not encouraged them.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN;
Guide to New York Elections for Congressional and State Offices

 BODY:
Candidatess are listed in the order they appear on the ballot.
 
GOVERNOR
 
CANDIDATES
MARIO M. CUOMO , 62, Democrat, Governor since 1983. A native of Queens who ran for lieutenant governor in 1978 and has not lost an election since. During his three terms as Governor became a major figure in national Democratic politics but turned down opportunities to run for President and to sit on the Supreme Court. If he wins, he has said, his fourth term will be his last. 
 GEORGE E. PATAKI , 49, Republican State Senator from Putnam County. A native of Peekskill who became its Mayor in 1981 and was elected to the State Assembly in 1985. Elected to the State Senate in 1991 and chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee. Mr. Pataki was little known until he won the Republican nomination in September with the backing of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato.
B. THOMAS GOLISANO , 52, Independence Fusion Party candidate. Mr. Golisano, whose personal worth is estimated at $150 million, is founder of Paychex Inc., a payroll-processing company based in his hometown of Rochester. A political novice who is spending up to $10 million of his own money on the campaign, he says he never voted until 1992, when he supported Ross Perot.
ROBERT T. WALSH Sr. , Right to Life Party
LAWRENCE A. LANE , Socialist Workers Party
BOB SCHULZ , Libertarian Party
 
THE ISSUES
Mr. Cuomo's long tenure in office at a time when the state's fortunes are seen to be declining has been the key issue in the race. Most of Mr. Pataki's campaign has been directed against Mr. Cuomo, blaming him for high crime and taxes. Mr. Pataki has promised to cut taxes substantially and to enact the death penalty. Mr. Cuomo has said that the state is on the economic rebound and that the death penalty will do nothing to lower crime rates. He has said Mr. Pataki's tax cut plan would be ruinous to New York City and force many localities to raise property taxes. Mr. Golisano's positions are similar to Mr. Pataki's, but he has proposed a deeper tax cut and is calling for electoral reform that would eliminate the influence of political action committees, which contribute heavily to both of the major-party candidates.
 
ANALYSIS
Mr. Pataki and Mr. Cuomo have each spent the last week claiming to be the underdog, but the label now appears to apply mostly to the Republican. Bolstered by an endorsement and strong campaigning assistance from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Governor has surged in recent polls, particularly in the city and suburbs. Many voters say they still don't know enough about Mr. Pataki and his plans. He has also been hurt by Mr. Golisano's strong independent candidacy, fueled by heavy advertising and a late endorsement from Mr. Perot. But many voters continue to express dissatisfaction with Mr. Cuomo, and the race remains close.
 
OTHER STATE RACES
(X denotes incumbents)
 LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR Stan Lundine, Democrat and Liberal (X); Elizabeth McCaughey, Republican, Conservative and Tax Cut Now; Dominick A. Fusco, Independence Fusion Party; Virginia E. Sutton, Right to Life; Mary Nell Bockman, Socialist Workers Party, and Stanley H. Dworkin, Libertarian Party
 
ATTORNEY GENERAL
 
CANDIDATES
KAREN S. BURSTEIN , 52, Democrat and Liberal. Resigned in April as a judge in Brooklyn Family Court, a position she held since 1990. Elected State Senator in 1972, representing Long Island and southeastern Queens. Has been executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, president of the State Civil Service Commission and Auditor General of the City of New York.
DENNIS C. VACCO , 42, Republican and Conservative. United States Attorney for the Western District in Buffalo from 1988 to 1993; assistant district attorney in Erie County from 1978 to 1988, including six years as chief of the grand jury bureau for that office.
ALFRED J. SKIDMORE , Right to Life Party
DANIEL A. CONTI Jr. , Tax Cut Now Party
NANCY H. ROSENSTOCK , Socialist Workers Party
JAMES M. HARTMAN , Independence Fusion Party
 
THE ISSUES
The differences between the two leading contenders for the job, Ms. Burstein and Mr. Vacco, are clearly delineated. Ms. Burstein, a liberal Democrat, says she wants to use her wide-ranging experience as a judge, legislator and state commissioner to emphasize the traditional duties of the office of attorney general, which are to defend state agencies, consumers, the environment and civil rights. Mr. Vacco, a conservative Republican and a career prosecutor, has said he wants to expand the office's role by lobbying for harsher penalties against street crime, over which the office now has no jurisdiction, and he is unlikely to achieve that unless the Legislature makes significant changes. Mr. Vacco has stressed his support for the death penalty -- and her opposition to it -- and has accused his opponent, a lesbian, of trying to promote a "homosexual agenda."
 
ANALYSIS
Ms. Burstein has maintained a double-digit lead throughout the campaign. If that margin holds up on Election Day, she will be the first woman elected to a state office in 20 years.
 
COMPTROLLER
 
CANDIDATES
H. CARL McCALL , 58, Democrat-Liberal. Ordained minister, United Church of Christ. State Senator from Manhattan, 1975-1979. Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations, 1979-81. Citibank vice president, 1985-1993. New York City Board of Education President, 1991-93. Appointed by Legislature as Comptroller, 1993.
HERBERT LONDON , 55, Republican-Conservative-Right to Life. John M. Olin Professor of Humanities at New York University, where he founded the Gallatin Division and served as its dean for 20 years. Conservative Party candidate for New York mayor, 1989. Conservative candidate for governor, 1990.
RICHARD L. GEYER , Libertarian Party
BROCK SATTER , Socialist Workers Party
LAUREEN A. OLIVER , Independence Fusion Party
 
THE ISSUES
Few differences have emerged in how Mr. London and Mr. McCall would perform the duties of the comptroller, who invests the $60 billion pension fund, audits state and local government and signs all the state's checks. Rather, the race has focused on bitter personal attacks. Mr. London has questioned Mr. McCall's independence, has charged that he politicized the office and suggested that he has anti-Semitic associations. Mr. McCall has also questioned Mr. London's independence, accused him of using racist tactics and attacked him for opposing abortion rights. Each man has pledged to be an independent voice in Albany, a responsible investor and a force for lower taxes and on-time state budgets.
 
ANALYSIS
This has shaped up to be a close race. Conventional political wisdom says Mr. McCall should have the advantage: he is a Democrat who holds the office he is seeking, has five times more money, and has qualifications more directly related to the office's fiscal duties. Mr. London, by contrast, has never held public office. He has, however, focused intently on economic issues, especially tax cuts, which have particular appeal this year. Analysts also wonder whether some voters will resist Mr. McCall because of his race. (If he wins, Mr. McCall will be the first black candidate elected to statewide office.) But other factors argue against the interpretation that race is at issue; for example, Mr. London seems to have higher name recognition, and some polls show that even many black voters do not know Mr. McCall is black. Indeed, few voters seem to know much about either candidate or the office they are seeking.
 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 
FIRST DISTRICT CANDIDATES
GEORGE J. HOCHBRUECKNER , 56, Democratic incumbent. A Navy veteran and engineer from Coram, he served in the New York Assembly for a decade before running for Congress in 1984; he lost that race but won two years later. A member of the Armed Services Committee and a strong supporter of the defense industry.
MICHAEL P. FORBES , 41, Republican from Quogue. Raised in Westhampton Beach and a former aide to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, he is currently on leave from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. He won a three-way primary race.
MICHAEL STRONG , Fed Up Party
 
THE DISTRICT
The First District in eastern Suffolk County, running east from Smithtown on the North Shore to Patchogue on the South Shore, includes both the Hamptons and the defense plants that have been the area's economic center. Politically conservative, the district is 2-to-1 Republican.
 
THE ISSUES
Mr. Forbes says the major issues in the race are taxes, jobs, crime and incumbency, in that order. Mr. Hochbrueckner has made an issue of Mr. Forbes's anti-abortion position and opposition to gun control. He has also accused him of "carpetbagging," because Mr. Forbes, who grew up in the area, has spent most of his adult life in Albany and Washington.
 
ANALYSIS
With the district's demographics, Mr. Hochbrueckner always has a tough race, and never more so than this year, when voters are dissatisfied with both Congress and the economy. Republicans are counting on him to pay the price for anti-incumbent sentiment and take the fall for the decline of the area's defense industry. The incumbent says that as a member of the Armed Services Committee, he is in a better position to help push for retraining than would a newcomer. But Mr. Forbes, who has never held elective office, is pointing to his outsider status as an advantage. This is one of the hottest races in the state, too close to call.
 
FOURTH DISTRICT CANDIDATES
PHILIP M. SCHILIRO , 38, Democrat. An environmental lawyer and chief of staff for Representative Henry A. Waxman of California. Narrowly lost to Mr. Levy in 1992 general election.
DANIEL FRISA , 39, a State Assemblyman from Westbury. After losing to Mr. Levy in 1992 G.O.P. primary, squeaked by this year in race that left the party divided.
DAVID A. LEVY , 40, a freshman Representative from Baldwin. Lost in the Republican primary by just 54 votes but remains in race on Conservative line.
VINCENT P. GARBITELLI , Right to Life Party
ROBERT S. BERKOWITZ , Liberal Party
 
THE DISTRICT
 Running across Nassau County's South Shore, this is mostly Republican territory, although the heavily Jewish Five Towns and largely black and Hispanic Roosevelt in Hempstead tend to favor Democrats.
 
THE ISSUES
 Mr. Frisa is running as a fiscal conservative and an environmentalist who has portrayed Mr. Schiliro as an outsider who returns only to run for Congress. Mr. Schiliro, who is credited with writing the legislation for Mr. Waxman that led to a Federal study of possible environmental links to breast cancer on Long Island, has made an issue of gun control, which he favors, and tried to paint Mr. Frisa an "extremist on guns" with high marks from the National Rifle Association.
 
ANALYSIS
 Mr. Schiliro is counting on the deep divisions in the district's Republican Party to hand him a victory and hoping that Mr. Levy will siphon support from Mr. Frisa. But Mr. Frisa, who is considered an exceptional campaigner, cannot be counted out in this longtime Republican stronghold.
 
14TH DISTRICT CANDIDATES
CAROLYN B. MALONEY , 46, first-term Democratic incumbent who is also running as an independent. A Manhattan resident, she served 10 years on the City Council; best known for pushing through a system that improved oversight of city contracts.
CHARLES MILLARD , 37, Republican and Liberal Party. Manhattan resident, lawyer and former VISTA volunteer. As a City Council member, he is best known for advocating quality-of-life measures to restrict sex businesses in residential areas and fine cyclists for riding on the sidewalk.
THOMAS CALEB WHITFORD , Conservative Party
THOMAS K. LEIGHTON , T.B.A. Green Party
 
THE DISTRICT
The old Silk Stocking district on Manhattan's East Side, which sent John Lindsay and Edward Koch to Congress, was redrawn two years ago to include heavily Democratic Astoria in Queens, Greenpoint in Brooklyn, Roosevelt Island and a finger of the West Side, increasing the Democrats' traditional advantage to more than 2 to 1. The district has the highest average household income in the country.
 
THE ISSUES
Ms. Maloney says the only real issue is experience, and she has much more of it. Mr. Millard, a fiscal conservative and social liberal, is running against tax increases and has taken exception to the incumbent's opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 
ANALYSIS
Two years ago Ms. Maloney barely defeated Bill Green, a popular Republican moderate and seven-term incumbent. In that race she had help from Bill Clinton's coattails plus the Liberal Party endorsement, which went to Mr. Millard this year. But the demographics of the district still work against a Republican challenger, and though Mr. Millard is well liked here, the conventional wisdom says he has not made the case for dumping the incumbent.
 
19TH DISTRICT CANDIDATES
HAMILTON FISH Jr. , 43, running as a Democrat for the open seat being vacated by his father, Hamilton Fish, a 13-term Republican. Adviser to Human Rights Watch, a worldwide monitoring group, and former publisher of The Nation, the liberal opinion magazine.
SUE W. KELLY , 57, Republican and longtime party worker. Businesswoman and former hospital-patient advocate from Katonah.
JOSEPH J. DIOGUARDI , 53, Conservative and Right to Life Party. A former Republican Congressman from the neighboring 20th District who was defeated by Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat, four years ago. A retired accountant, he lives in Scarsdale.
CATHERINE PORTMAN-LAUX , Independent
 
THE DISTRICT
The 19th, covering much of the lower Hudson Valley, stretches from Poughkeepsie to North White Plains, including parts of Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess and Orange counties. It was once a Republican stronghold, but since 1990 redistricting is more diverse, with some 113,000 Republicans, 91,000 Democrats and 87,000 independents.
 
THE ISSUES
 All candidates say the main issue is jobs, with major employers like I.B.M. laying off thousands of workers and General Motors scheduled to close its assembly plant in North Tarrytown in 1996. Mrs. Kelly has tried to make an issue of the political differences between the incumbent and his son. Mr. Fish, meanwhile, criticized Mrs. Kelly for running against Washington and then, soon after the primary, traveling there to sign the Republican Contract With America, which he attacks as unrealistic in promising tax cuts, increased military spending and a Constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
 
ANALYSIS
 There has been a Hamilton Fish in Congress since the current candidate's grandfather was first elected in 1922. But anything could happen in this nontraditional race.
 
26th DISTRICT CANDIDATES
 MAURICE D. HINCHEY , 56, the Democratic incumbent, also on Liberal line. A Saugerties resident who, as a member of the State Assembly, concentrated on environmental concerns and had more than 600 bills passed.
BOB MOPPERT , 52, Republican and Conservative Party. A civic leader and former Broome County legislator who owns a moving company in Binghamton.
THOMAS F. KOVACH , Right to Life Party
 
THE DISTRICT
This rural district stretches from the Catskills to Binghamton and north to Ithaca. Its major employer is I.B.M., which has laid off thousands of employees in recent years.
 
THE ISSUES
Mr. Hinchey says the race will come down to intangibles like reliability and integrity. He takes credit for saving more than 1,000 local jobs at Martin Marietta in Westover by intervening in Congress and with the Pentagon to transfer the title of the plant to Broome County's local development agency. Mr. Moppert also says jobs are a major issue -- and promises to turn things around so that his company won't have so much business from people moving out of the area because they have lost their jobs.
 
ANALYSIS
The freshman incumbent is facing an uphill race against a challenger who came within three percentage points of beating him two years ago, even without the support of national Republicans, which he now enjoys. Newt Gingrich, the minority whip, has campaigned for Mr. Moppert, while the all-star lineup pitching for Mr. Hinchey has included Vice President Al Gore, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit, and Gloria Steinem. With both national parties focusing on the race, it remains a toss-up.

CANDIDATES
 DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN , 67, Senator since 1977, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Cabinet or subcabinet member for four Presidents, from Kennedy to Ford; Ambassador to India; professor at Harvard; author or editor of more than a dozen books. Has raised more than $3 million.
 BERNADETTE CASTRO , 50, a former executive of her family's convertible sofa business who was previously known for appearing in television commercials for the business, beginning at the age of 4; has long been a fund-raiser for Republican candidates, and is running for elective office for the first time. Has raised about $500,000 and has estimated that she will also spend about $1.2 million of her own money.
HENRY F. HEWES , Right to Life Party
NORMA SEGAL , Tax Cut Now Party
NAOMI L. CRAINE , Socialist Workers Party
ISMAEL BETANCOURT Jr. , Independence Fusion Party.
 
THE ISSUES
 Mr. Moynihan, who is running for a fourth term, has confounded the conventional wisdom that incumbents are particularly vulnerable this year. Despite his penchant for bluntness, he remains the state's most popular politician. Polls show him leading Ms. Castro by as many as 30 percentage points. Ms. Castro describes herself as a "Christine Todd Whitman Republican," someone who is fiscally conservative and socially moderate. She has tried to portray Mr. Moynihan as far more liberal and free-spending than she would be as a senator, but in fact the two candidates do not disagree significantly on major issues, except for the death penalty, which Ms. Castro supports.
 
ANALYSIS
 Ms. Castro has had an uphill fight against Mr. Moynihan, a Democrat who is difficult to categorize politically and who has often done well among Republican voters upstate. Ms. Castro has had difficulty raising money to challenge the well-financed Senator, in part because even some Republicans have viewed her as a neophyte with a limited chance of success. Ms. Castro has accused a fellow Republican, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, of telling potential backers not to contribute to her campaign and to support the top of the Republican ticket instead. But even without the internal party squabbling, Ms. Castro is a long shot.

THE LAST SHOT
City Streets, Basketball Dreams
By Darcy Frey
231 pages. A Richard Todd Book/Houghton Mifflin. $19.95.
 
 "People, they come down to Coney Island and they look at the boardwalk and all the rides and they say, 'Isn't that nice?' And then they see all those buildings behind them and they say, 'Gee, do people live back there?' Yeah, well, we live back here. There are people back here. There are lives going on here. Just because we're black doesn't mean we're stupid."
So speaks Joyce Thomas, the mother of one of the high-school basketball players whom Darcy Frey writes about so perceptively in "The Last Shot: City Streets, Basketball Dreams," a 1990's version of such 1970's factual reports as "The City Game: Basketball in New York" by Pete Axthelm and "Heaven Is a Playground" by Rick Telander. 
 Mrs. Thomas is no doubt justified in her anger at the obscurity of the Coney Island housing projects. As Mr. Frey describes it, the area has undergone a steep decline since a young Richard Feynman began to think about physics while gazing at the ocean and wondering about the movement of the waves. "During the urban-renewal years" of the 1950's, "Coney Island became a dumping ground, the terminus of forced migrations for hundreds of black families who were pushed to the sea."
And Abraham Lincoln High School, once among the top academic schools in New York City, has deteriorated so much that it is the last place the academically ambitious want to go. Mr. Frey writes, "Just about the only students who enroll at Lincoln now as their predecessors once did -- with the conviction that it will serve their future well -- are its athletes."
For most young residents, the prospect is a nasty, brutish existence of drug dealing and machine-gun fire. The only ticket out is to be a basketball star. "Basketball is all we got," says one playground coach whom Mr. Frey describes. "There ain't nothing else to do in Coney Island."
Yet Mrs. Thomas can no longer complain about being completely ignored. For in writing "The Last Shot," Mr. Frey has shone a brilliant light on the community and sharply revealed four of its brightest basketball stars: Tchaka Shipp, a majestic-looking, 6-foot-7-inch 17-year-old; Russell Thomas, Mrs. Thomas's high-strung son, who is a talented scorer and defensive player; Corey Johnson, whose skill on the court is surpassed only by his interest in girls, and Stephon Marbury, at the time of the book's writing perhaps the most gifted freshman point guard in the country.
On basketball talent alone, these four would unquestionably make it all the way to an athletic scholarship at a Division I college and on to a multi-million-dollar contract in the National Basketball Association. But the young men must surmount a hurdle put up by the National Collegiate Athletic Association in 1986 called Proposition 48, which is supposed to show the organization's commitment to education by requiring student athletes to score at least 700 out of a possible 1,600 on the combined Scholastic Aptitude Tests.
Unfortunately, to accomplish this, Mr. Frey reports, most inner-city athletes are found to require a triangular foundation of family, neighborhood and schooling. "The rule is that a player can triumph over one weak point in that triangle, maybe two, but almost never three," he writes. Failure to score 700 means attending junior college instead of a Division I basketball power, and, all too often, an eventual return to the ghetto. For the young men in Mr. Frey's story, all three corners of the foundation are crumbling.
In his sensitive job of reporting, Mr. Frey, who is white, wins the trust and friendship of his four basketball stars, and draws revealing close-ups of their struggles to overcome. He describes following the older ones to basketball camps, where they compete for the notice of coaches and sneaker manufacturers. He recounts sitting in on interviews with unctuous college recruiters who, he says, wheedle prospective players for commitments the recruiters themselves do not intend to honor. He waxes indignant over what he sees as the hypocrisy of a system that demands academic integrity from participants in a game that is purely for profit. After finishing "The Last Shot," a reader finds it difficult not to sympathize with athletes for being greedy.
Happily, Mr. Frey's narrative keeps coming back to the game of basketball itself, and in the book's best passages, the athletes perform. "It's past midnight now," begins a description of a pickup game on a Coney Island playground, "and the ambient glow of Manhattan's remote skyscrapers has turned the sky a metallic blue. Standing courtside, we can see only the darkened outlines of the projects, looming in every direction, and the shirtless players streaking back and forth, drenched in orange light.
"Now and then the ref steps out from the darkness onto center court and his official stripes glow incongruously beneath the court lights as the Doppler wail of police sirens drifts in from the nearby streets. Corey, sprinting down court, calls out, 'Homeboy! Homeboy!' Standing under his own basket, Stephon lets fly with a long, improbable pass that Corey, running full speed, somehow manages to catch and dunk in one balletic leap. The game is called on account of total pandemonium. . . . Stephon laughs and points to the rim, still shuddering from its run-in with Corey's fists. 'Yo, cuz!' he yells. 'Make it bleed!' Then he raises his arms jubilantly and dances a little jig, rendered momentarily insane by the sheer, giddy pleasure of playing this game to perfection."

HEADLINE: NEW YORK CITY MARATHON;
They Come From Afar Just to Feel at Home

BYLINE: By GRACE LICHTENSTEIN 

 BODY:
They came to run but they stayed to shop, to go to museums, to eat bagels, to see shows and to party.
For about 11,700 foreigners who made up more than 40 percent of the runners in the New York City Marathon, yesterday's race was only one part of what amounted to a mini-Olympic festival and an adventure vacation. 
 "Un marathon formidable," -- a terrific marathon -- declared Jean-Yves Perron of Nevers, France, as he walked toward the reunion area to find his wife on the Great Lawn of Central Park after finishing in under three hours.
"The road surface was very hard, there was a lot of wind, but the crowd was wonderful," the 36-year-old runner added, echoing the sentiments of many non-American first-timers here.
Perron was one of 2,200 members of the French contingent, the largest among foreign groups. Germans were the second-largest group with 1,661 entrants, the Netherlands third with 1,165.
Although West Europeans dominated the foreign entrants, there were representatives from 99 countries, according to the New York Road Runners Club.
The runners, the overwhelming majority of them men, came from as far away as Japan, India, Malaysia, Cambodia and Ukraine, as well as from Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.
New York, they said, has become the marathon of choice for recreational runners.
"It is the only big one with such an international flavor," said Jorge Carrido, a Mexican member of the Naucalli Club, as he strolled into Central Park on Saturday with five of his cohorts.
Along with thousands of other non-Americans who attended the Saturday "Breakfast Run," which ends at Tavern on the Green, they showed up to munch on muffins and to trade T-shirts and other souvenirs with runners from other countries.
One young Mexican boy proudly wore a giant foam rubber hat in the shape of a wooden shoe, which he got from a Dutch runner in exchange for a sombrero.
In Europe, the New York City Marathon is famous for its friendly crowds, said Grete Waitz, a nine-time champion of the race. She said New Yorkers will stop runners who are staggering back to their hotels after the race to pat them on the back and congratulate them simply for finishing, whereas in Europe, passers-by say, "What was your time?"
"We are not used to that kind of admiration," Waitz said.
Many Europeans came to the race on four- to seven-day package tours bought from travel agents who secure in advance the crucial official entry numbers, which are very difficult for people overseas to obtain any other way. The packages, which include air fare, lodging, bus transport around town and in many cases a Broadway show and sightseeing trips, are priced in the neighborhood of $1,200 to $1,400.
One Dutch group, sponsored by a radio station that provided the athletes with handsome black-and-red jogging suits, filled all the economy seats of a Boeing 747.
Among the 175 runners and 125 of their supporters were Paul Vierboom, a 36-year-old schoolteacher, and Ruud Wolff, a 29-year-old sign maker. A surprise greeted them as they stepped off the plane: Ruud's wife, Gwendoline, who was supposed to be in Paris, and a friend of hers were at the airport with a big sign that read, "Rudd and Paul -- the girls are already here!"
The four got into the Gotham spirit by donning green Statue of Liberty foam rubber crowns before the race.
By Sunday, the Dutch visitors had taken the Circle Line boat around Manhattan, bought as many pairs of Levi 501 jeans as they could stuff into an extra suitcase (they are much cheaper in New York than in Rotterdam), gone to museums and visited the Empire State Building.
Not everyone came in clusters, however. Dana Seetahal, an assistant solicitor general for civil affairs in Trinidad, came all by herself, arranging to stay at the home of a friend in Brooklyn. A veteran of several marathons in her own country, she said she did not tell her colleagues at home that she was about to run the New York Marathon, because "you don't want people to give you goat mouth," a Trinidadian expression for bad luck.
The 39-year-old lawyer was astonished by the helpfulness of New Yorkers, one Herman's Sporting Goods salesman in particular. Upon her arrival, she discovered that an air bubble in her single pair of Nike running shoes had burst. She could not find a pair of the same shoes at the Marathon Expo, a bazaar of equipment booths, but someone directed her to a Herman's store.
The shoes were not in stock there either, but John Flynn, a salesman, not only phoned another store to find a pair for her, he gave her money for a taxi to get there.
"He probably thought I was a waif, but he was the nicest person I have met," Seetahal said. "I'll never forget him. And he was nice looking, too."

Commuting

 BODY:
Continuing a trend that began last winter, ridership is up on the region's commuter railroads and bus lines while vehicle traffic into Manhattan is down. Transit officials largely credited last winter's harsh weather with enticing commuters out of their cars and onto trains and buses. But aggressive marketing campaigns, the improving economy and improved service are also factors in reversing years of declining ridership. Traffic at toll bridges and tunnels into Manhattan was down about 4 percent in the first eight months of 1994 from the first eight months of 1993. The figure does not include statistics for the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, which had abnormally low volume in 1993 because of the World Trade Center bombing.

HEADLINE: Tilting East

 BODY:
President Clinton's theme of putting the economy first takes him this week to Indonesia for the second annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting. APEC is an 18-member group of Pacific Rim countries that includes China and Japan. On the agenda is a proposal to create by 2020 the world's largest free-trade and investment zone -- a dramatic symbol of America's tilt toward soaring opportunities in Asia and away from the enervated economies of Western Europe.
Mr. Clinton pushed Nafta, the accord with Mexico and Canada, through Congress over the opposition of important Democratic constituencies. He also signed, along with more than 100 trading partners, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- which Congress will vote on after the elections. An APEC accord is an enticing next step. APEC members account for about half of the world's economic output; yet the U.S. share of trade and investment in the group is falling. A trade agreement would guarantee fair access, a key to U.S. growth. 
 An APEC trade accord could boost economies everywhere along the Pacific Rim. It could also nudge countries outside the region toward more open trade and investment agreements: after the U.S. embraced Nafta, Western Europe got serious about negotiating GATT. And by tying Asia and the U.S. closer together, an APEC trade agreement would help to defuse political tensions.
Yet for all its promise, an APEC accord, like other regional trade pacts, could be worrisome. By granting preferential market access to members, it would discriminate against exports from non-members. The proponents of an APEC accord propose to mitigate the threat in two ways: by knocking down trade and investment barriers left standing by GATT and by offering APEC trade benefits to non-members willing to live by the same rules.
An unresolved issue is how quickly to proceed. Paula Stern and Robert Manning, two former U.S. trade officials affiliated with a Democratic think tank, call for an incremental approach. Free trade among countries at different states of economic development would be difficult to define, let alone achieve. Ms. Stern and Mr. Manning want to select a few modest goals over the next couple of years. For example, APEC could start immediately to formulate protections for foreign investors, adopt common customs procedures and open access to telecommunications markets.
A few quick victories could undermine protectionist opposition in Congress. That is important because Congress has so far blocked Mr. Clinton's request for "fast track" status for future trade negotiations -- the procedure by which Congress agrees to vote on a trade proposal quickly and without amendment. Mr. Clinton needs "fast track" if he is to secure the trade agreements called for in his economic strategy.
Not everyone in APEC is thrilled by the prospect of free trade. Some, like Malaysia, are afraid of close involvement with the U.S., partly because they fear the squabbles over human rights and other issues that have marked U.S. relations with Japan and China. China has threatened to fight the proposal, perhaps as a way to bargain for early admission to the new World Trade Organization that will oversee international trade rules.
The U.S. and other supporters of free trade will have to fight hard to get APEC to move toward free trade. But the U.S. imports more from Asia than from the rest of the world combined. It sells more than 30 percent of its exports to Asia. Mr. Clinton is headed in the right direction.

HEADLINE: American Cites Intimidation by Singapore Over Article He Wrote

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Nov. 6

 BODY:
An American economist who left Singapore last month said today that he would not return here because he was fearful of being imprisoned over a newspaper opinion article published in Singapore in which he criticized "intolerant regimes" in Asia.
The State Department has protested the treatment of the economist, Christopher Lingle, who was interrogated by the Singapore police twice last month as a result the article, which appeared in The International Herald Tribune on Oct. 7. 
 In an interview from his family home in Atlanta, Mr. Lingle, who had taught for the last year at the National University of Singapore, said he would not return to this authoritarian city-state because "these people weren't playing games -- if I had stayed, I would have faced the prospect of imprisonment or a heavy fine." The Singapore police, he said, "intimidated the hell out of me."
In the article, Mr. Lingle wrote of the clash of Western and Asian values and said authoritarian governments in Asia were "ingenious at suppressing dissent." He referred to the tendency of Asian leaders to rely "on a compliant judiciary to bankrupt opposition politicians." He did not name any particular nation.
In a statement issued in Washington, the State Department said it "was disappointed at this apparent attempt by Singaporean authorities to intimidate Professor Lingle."
"We continue to believe that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression," it said.
The State Department has repeatedly protested to Singapore this year over the treatment of American citizens here, most notably an American teen-ager, Michael P. Fay, who was flogged in May after he pleaded guilty to spray-painting cars.
The Singapore Government, which has denied allegations from Americans living here that they are being singled out for harassment as part of a Government crusade against American values, expressed surprise over the State Department's defense of Mr. Lingle.
"If anybody impugns the Government's integrity and it amounts to defamation, the Government will take action," Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said.
Ten days after the article was published, Mr. Lingle said, two police officers appeared at his office at the university, where he was a senior fellow in the European studies, and questioned him for nearly two hours. He said he had been told by the officers that the investigation centered on "criminal defamation and contempt of court, and the contempt of court was based upon an inferred criticism of their judiciary system."
Two days later, he was questioned again for two hours at the university, and policemen went to his home, requesting the research material on which he had based his article. He said he had given them a collection of news magazines. The Herald Tribune, which is owned by The New York Times Company and the Washington Post Company, prints a regional edition in Singapore.
After the interrogations, Mr. Lingle, who is 46, left Singapore on a leave of absence to visit his ailing father in Atlanta. He has since resigned from the university.
"Dr. Lingle has written the article in his personal capacity, and this has nothing to do with the university," said Ng Suan Eng, deputy director of the university liaison office. "Our staff are allowed to raise their voices on any issues and are personally responsible for their own views."
Last month, though, the four editors of the university's alumni magazine resigned in protest after the alumni association canceled publication of its latest issue, which focused on cultural freedom.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 8, 1994, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about intimidation of the press by the Government of Singapore referred incorrectly in some copies to an article written by an American economist and published in The International Herald Tribune. The article criticized "intolerant regimes" in Asia, but did not single out any country.

HEADLINE: Italy's Big Banks on a Merger Spree

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 6

 BODY:
For decades, Italy's sclerotic banking system was the ward of politicians, with overstaffed and grossly inefficient banks providing jobs and patronage and successive governments providing the money to keep the system oiled.
Now, with the Government trying to get out of the business of running the economy, and some of the biggest banks formerly owned by the state sold to private shareholders, the banks are loosening their limbs. 
 Last Wednesday, Credito Italiano, Italy's eighth-largest bank, announced expansion plans, proposing a $1.3 billion takeover of Credito Romagnolo in Bologna. Credito Italiano is looking for size, to compete in a changed banking environment where governments have less to say and the barriers between national markets are falling.
To fend off Credito Italiano's bid, Credito Romagnolo announced instead a merger with the Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna, which would create Italy's 10th-largest bank.
A day later, Banca Commerciale Italiana announced plans to acquire control of Banco Ambrosiano Veneto for $1.13 billion, which would create Italy's largest totally private bank.
Such dealing is a consequence of the privatization of Banca Commerciale and Credito Italiano this year, when their shareholder voting rights were acquired by the powerful Milan investment bank Mediobanca.
The appetite for acquisitions looks likely to continue. Antonio Maccanico, a former Mediobanca president, identified two other big banks likely to go shopping next. Banca di Roma, which became Italy's second-largest in 1992 after two smaller bank companies merged, is eyeing Banca Nazionale di Agricoltura. And the Turin-based Instituto Bancario San Paolo wants the Banca Nazionale delle Comunicazioni.
"Italy's big banks, in the European context, are small in size," explained Mario Noera, the chief economist at Deutsche Bank's Italian unit. "For global business, they need critical mass."
Deutsche Bank itself illustrates the threat from abroad. In 1986, it acquired control of Banca d'America e Italia from BankAmerica, giving it 160 branches throughout Italy.
Indeed, with investing habits that have tended toward Government securities because of chronically high interest rates and an anemic stock market, Italy has been a prime target for major investment banks, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman, Sachs and Salomon Brothers.
The downside of the present concentration, some bankers say, is the powerful role of Mediobanca and its secretive 86-year-old chairman, Enrico Cuccia. Through a complex web of shareholdings, an investor club led by Mr. Cuccia's bank took control of Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale when they went public this year.
"What some people evidently fear," Mr. Noera said, "is that this concentration will mean less transparency in regions of greatest economic interest."
Concern is heightened by the significance of the latest banks that are takeover targets. Ambrosiano Veneto and Credito Romagnolo are in business centers in the Veneto region of northeastern Italy and the Emilia-Romagna regions of central Italy, respectively. Both areas have concentrations of the small, aggressively export-oriented companies that form the profitable backbone of Italy's economy.
Lamberto Dini, the Treasury Minister and former deputy head of the Bank of Italy, the central bank, asked whether he saw Mediobanca's hand behind the new wave of takeover attempts, as some analysts do, replied: "I don't know what hand they're talking about. I only see banking companies pursuing determined objectives and strategies."
The consolidations should move ahead, Mr. Dini said, "so that we can have institutions that are competitive with the large European banks."
To compete internationally, banking analysts say, the Italian banks need to resolve problems of internal organization and lagging technology. They have come under pressure from many directions. Falling interest rates have reduced their spread -- the difference between what they must pay for money and what they can charge their customers -- and tighter central bank operating rules have forced commercial banks to tie down larger amounts of capital than used to be required.
Coming as the economy struggles out of recession, these have squeezed bank profits and in some cases generated immense losses. Major banks like the Banco di Napoli and Banco di Sicilia avoided bankruptcy only through rescue operations carried out by more profitable banks at the behest of the central bank.
The acquisition bids of Banca Commerciale and Credito Italiano still face hurdles.
For Banca Commerciale, the obstacles are mainly financial. In a bold stroke, the bank offered $4.67 a share for Ambrosiano Veneto, fully 80 percent above the going price on Oct. 26, before speculation about the expected takeover drove it up 50 percent. By doing so, Banca Commerciale effectively sought to block another international player, France's Credit Agricole, which has a 15 percent stake in Ambrosiano Veneto.
"Credit Agricole must either sell, or bid," if the French bank wants to fight the takeover, said Flavio Cereda, who follows Italian banking at Barclays de Zoete Wedd International in London.
Credito Italiano's bid, by contrast, affords a test for measuring the degree to which Italian banking has shed old political ties.
Under the old partitioning of the banking system among the political parties, Credito Romagnolo was a fief of the former Christian Democrats, who were swept from power this year. Moreover, the bank is based in Bologna, the traditional heartland of the powerful Party of the Democratic Left, as the former Communist Party now calls itself, and its labor union allies. They view with disapproval the inroads of the big banks of Milan.
In the end, banking analysts give Credito Italiano's takeover bid good chances for success, if for the first time the decision is based on profit rather than politics.
While Credito Italiano's offer involves paying shareholders $12.40 a share, Credito Romagnolo's proposed merger with the Cassa di Risparmio means essentially a share swap.
"In the end, shareholders have a choice between cash and paper," Mr. Cereda said.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 14, 1994, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day last Monday about proposed mergers in Italian banking referred incorrectly to the financial condition of one bank. Banco di Napoli is not threatened by bankruptcy and was not bailed out by other Italian banks at the behest of the central bank.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: NEW YORK GOVERNOR;
Cuomo and Pataki End Bitter, Costly Race

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
Mario M. Cuomo and George E. Pataki ended the most expensive -- and arguably the most negative -- gubernatorial campaign in state history yesterday with passionate entreaties for unity and bold predictions of victory, leaving 8.8 million New York registered voters to choose whether to end or extend 20 years of Democratic rule in Albany.
In casting their ballots today, voters also will determine whether New York will elect a black official to statewide office for the first time and whether it will become the first state in the country to elect an openly homosexual candidate to statewide office. The results are likely to leave their imprint on the state's politics for years and could have a lasting impact on the careers not only of the candidates but also of their leading surrogates, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the state's Republican Senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato. 
 On the last day of what he has suggested will be the last campaign of his 20-year political career, Governor Cuomo cast today's election as a race that will send a national message and warned that his Republican opponents "will go wherever the political winds blow."
"How do you know where they'll be tomorrow?" he shouted to a crowd of several hundred frenzied supporters at a V.F.W. hall in Syracuse. "How do you know where they'll be on you tomorrow? How do you know how they'll feel about women tomorrow? How do you know how they'll feel about Italians tomorrow, about blacks, about union people, about Syracuse, about upstate, about downstate? When they shift to meet the political winds, there's nothing but chaos."
Mr. Pataki, a state senator, made a final appeal to New Yorkers from all regions to unite around his candidacy, or at least to unite against Mr. Cuomo's, a pointed rebuttal to the Governor's charge that the Republicans are trying to divide the state.
"It's not just the Republicans and Conservatives," Mr. Pataki said at an airport rally in Rochester. "It's the independents and the Democrats. It's the city dwellers, it's the rural people, it's the farmers, it's the people of Bedford-Stuyvesant, that understand that regardless of where they live in this state, their future has been hurt by the spending and tax increases of Mario Cuomo."
The campaign has been notable for its high stakes, its dramatic moments, its bitter tone and its unprecedented expense. While individual gubernatorial candidates in the past -- most notably Nelson A. Rockefeller, who won four terms, and Lewis E. Lehrman, the businessman who ran against Mr. Cuomo in 1982 -- have spent sums rivaling those spent by this year's contenders, the total spent this year is the highest ever.
Including the $9 million that B. Thomas Golisano is expected to spend out of his own pocket on his third-party candidacy, the race is expected to cost about $31 million, according to campaign officials.
Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Pataki seemed loose and confident as they campaigned yesterday, clearly moved and energized by the cheers of their supporters.
"We're going to win this thing and we're going to win comfortably," Mr. Cuomo said in Syracuse, though he later urged his volunteers to work as if they were behind.
Mr. Pataki said his campaign's polling "shows consistent strong movement in our favor and away from Mario Cuomo up to and through" Sunday night. He added that he believed that if the election was held Sunday night, "we would have won."
But just in case, Mr. Pataki told reporters that he plans to indulge his superstition of not polishing his dusty black shoes or changing their frayed laces until after the results are in.
After spending the morning in Syracuse, Mr. Cuomo took a symbolic ride by high-speed ferry from La Guardia Airport down the East River and up the Hudson to Battery Park City, where he received a warm hug from his wife, Matilda, and wild applause from a crowd on a swaying, floating pier. He was greeted there by Mayor Giuliani, former Mayor David N. Dinkins and a number of local Democratic officials. Last night, the Governor participated in a televised debate with Mr. Golisano and other minor-party candidates but without Mr. Pataki, who was being interviewed at the same time on WCBS-TV.
On the boat trip, Mr. Cuomo donned a red-and-white "Cuomo '94" baseball cap and stood on a bench on the upper deck. As the ferry cruised past the United Nations, he suggested -- without pledging -- that this campaign would be his last. "I think I should be able to get my work done over the next four years," the 62-year-old Governor told reporters.
In Syracuse, Mr. Cuomo also made one final effort to cement in voters' minds the ties between Mr. Pataki and Mr. D'Amato.
"I speak with one voice and it's my voice," he said. "Nobody speaks for me. Every once in a while I'll make a mistake, but you can believe I speak for myself."
Mr. Pataki, 49, hopscotched around the state, touching down in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany and Manhattan before finishing with a rally in his hometown, Peekskill.
Mr. Pataki called the election the most important in 20 years. "This will decide the future of New York over the next four years and, more important, it will decide whether we can again become the engine of opportunity, become No. 1 in new jobs and economic growth instead of No. 1 in lost jobs and the rate of taxation in America," he said.
In purely political terms, today's voting will determine whether Mr. Cuomo, a larger-than-life figure who has lost popularity in his own state, will be returned to Albany for a fourth four-year term. But it also could have a profound effect on the state's policy toward taxation, welfare and the death penalty, which Mr. Pataki has promised to enact early in his term. Mr. Cuomo has vetoed death-penalty bills passed by the Legislature in each of his 12 years in office.
Strategists in both campaigns said they expected between four million and five million New Yorkers to vote today. Little rain was expected except in the far northern reaches of the state.
Both campaigns spent much of the day on get-out-the-vote efforts. Mr. Cuomo's workers, for instance, started to distribute thousands of fliers in minority neighborhoods with pictures of South African voters lined up at the polls last spring. The caption: "They walked miles. You can go a few blocks to vote."
Other candidates also had busy campaign days. State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, who hopes to become the first black official elected statewide in New York, joined Karen S. Burstein, the attorney-general candidate, and Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine in flying around the state. Mr. McCall's Republican opponent is Herbert London, a New York University professor who ran for governor in 1990.
Ms. Burstein, who is a lesbian, said the key question in the election is whether New Yorkers will "pick competence and achievement and diversity over people who have made pleas for everybody in this state to be fearful, to be homophobic, to be racist, to be sexist."
Her Republican opponent, Dennis C. Vacco, said on the steps of City Hall that "my opponent continues to talk about issues that are not at all related to law enforcement."
Also on the ballot today, United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan faces Bernadette Castro, and New Yorkers must elect 31 members of Congress and 211 members of the State Legislature.

HEADLINE: Appeal of 'Direct-to-Video' Grows Among Film Studios

BYLINE: By SALLIE HOFMEISTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 7

 BODY:
Alongside advertisements for "Interview with the Vampire" in newspaper movie sections this week are those for "Texas." But don't look for any theater listings in the promotions; this film is available only on video.
"Texas," based on the James A. Michener novel, has never played in theaters or on television. And unlike low-budget kung-fu, horror and sex thrillers -- so-called grade B titles -- which typically cost less than $500,000 to make, "Texas" cost $12 million and signals a sea change in movie-making economics, raising the stature of video stores as showcases for programming. 
 "The video market is doing what theaters did for movie studios 20 or 30 years ago," said Jeffrey Fink, senior vice president of sales and distribution for the Live Entertainment Corporation in Van Nuys, Calif., one of many independent film companies making movies for video. "Video stores are becoming like Home Box Office or cable -- another outlet for original programming."
Virtually every major studio is trying the "direct-to-video" approach, though most are focusing on the lucrative children's sector, where videos are priced to sell rather than to rent. For instance, "The Return of Jafar," the sequel to "Aladdin" that is the Walt Disney Company's first direct-to-video release, is already one of the top 10 grossing videos of all time, having sold 10 million copies since April.
The Sony Corporation and MCA Inc. are also chasing the children's made-for-video market this year with releases to cash in on the consumer trend toward building home video libraries.
The leading studios, however, have been slower to venture into the made-for-video market for adults, leaving a few independent film makers to blaze the trail. Republic Pictures, the producer of "Texas," says more than half of the 36 movies it plans for next year will be direct-to-video releases, and, unlike its past production, will feature well-known actors and budgets of several million dollars each. This year, Republic released only five direct-to-video movies, of which "Texas," which is scheduled for release on Wednesday, was the most expensive to make.
The approach is less risky for Republic than for other studios in part because its parent company, Spelling Entertainment, is owned by Viacom Inc., which also owns Blockbuster Entertainment, the leading video store chain. The Blockbuster connection guarantees Republic a strong distribution outlet, and telegraphs to skeptics the synergistic powers of the Viacom-Blockbuster-Spelling combination.
With the video-first release of "Texas," Republic built a financial backstop for itself should the video sales prove disappointing by also selling the television rights. ABC will broadcast it as a two-part mini-series this spring, and got a bargain price on the program.
"A mini-series normally costs a network about $2.5 million an hour," said E. Duke Vincent, the executive producer of "Texas." "But we are giving it to them for half that price in exchange for a 90-day video window."
In addition, Mr. Vincent figures, ABC benefits from Republic's marketing of the video, with little loss in TV viewership. "Say one million people see the video," he said. "That won't hurt ABC's ratings much. Maybe 13 million people will watch it on TV instead of 14 million."
In the early 1990's, the demand by video retailers for exclusive products to distinguish their stores gave rise to a whole new genre of movies known as the erotic thriller, like "Tales From the Dark Side" and "Beastmaster II," with unknown actors and modest budgets. Direct to video was something of an industry joke, implying inferior goods.
Still, video rental stores typically bought 5 of these titles for every 20 major films because of their cult following, longer shelf life and profitability. "A retailer might buy 100 copies of 'Jurassic Park' and in six months, everyone has seen it, leaving a big inventory of little value," said Thomas K. Arnold, executive editor of Video Store magazine in Cleveland. "But they'll buy only two copies of 'Dark Side,' which will still be renting after six months, with little inventory risk."
Yet the competitive landscape has changed in the last year or so, forcing independent studios that made erotic thrillers, like Prism Entertainment, Full Moon Entertainment and Live Entertainment, to turn out higher-caliber films.
Now, instead of buying B-movies, more retailers are now purchasing more video games and they have more Hollywood titles from which to choose.
Heartened by consumers' return to the theaters as the recession has lifted, and by two banner years at the box office, Hollywood is producing movies in record numbers. What is more, the studios' purchase of independent film makers, like Disney's acquisition of Miramax, means that even more product has filled the pipeline.
That means B-movie makers must move up market or out. Live Entertainment has created a line exclusively for movie videos starring actors from the big screen. (The first of the series, introduced in September, is called "The Young Americans," with Harvey Keitel.) And Full Moon has switched its emphasis from R-rated cult thrillers to PG-rated science fiction fantasies.
The attraction of these family films is the opportunity to cash in on the market's biggest growth trend: consumer spending on video libraries. In 1988, of the $6.7 billion spent on videos, just $1.5 billion was to buy them. Last year, consumers spent $5.2 billion to buy videos, almost as much as the $7.6 billion to rent them, according to Video Store magazine.
Disney, on the heels of its success with "The Return of Jafar," introduced the "Muppet Classic Theater" in late October, and will release other sequels directly to video. Instead of spending $40 million -- and two years -- on the "Jafar" sequel, Disney invested an estimated $5 million, at most, and made an estimated $120 million from video sales.
Those economics, no doubt, are drawing other studios into the direct-to-video children's market. Through its Sony Wonder arm, which plans to concentrate on children's films, Sony has three direct-to-video titles this year and seven planned for 1995. Like Disney, it recreates the classics, with the release of its version of "Snow White" close to Disney's own video release this fall of its 1937 movie, perhaps benefiting from Disney's promotion.
Similarly, after Christmas, MCA Home Video is releasing a direct-to-video sequel to the animated 1988 feature, "The Land Before Time." MCA Home Video will have 10 more children's titles made for video next year.
"Children's is a bigger opportunity because of the added merchandising, television, theme park and book possibilities," Louis Feola, president of MCA Home Video, said.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR;
The 4 Major Candidates Debate Tax Cut to the End

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Nov. 7

 BODY:
From the beginning of the race for governor of Connecticut, the four major candidates have been debating tax cuts, and today, the final day of the campaign, was no different.
Once again, John G. Rowland, the Republican candidate, and Tom Scott, an independent candidate, talked about repealing the income tax, which constitutes about one-third of the state's revenues. William E. Curry Jr., the Democrat, said that the focus should be on a 25 percent cut in the property tax, which he believes weighs more heavily on working people. 
 And Eunice S. Groark, the candidate of A Connecticut Party, said that any talk of a tax cut was an empty promise, given the state's precarious financial position.
With all this talk about taxes, only one thing seemed to be clear about tomorrow's election: a majority of the voters will cast their ballots against the victor. All of which means that no matter whom the people of Connecticut elect as governor, that person is not likely to have much of a mandate to follow through on dramatic promises to cut taxes or to maintain the status quo.
While almost all the polls have shown Mr. Rowland as the leader and Mr. Curry a close second, Mrs. Groark could still overtake them if most of the undecided voters break her way.
"I would guess that the winner would not get more than 35 percent of the vote and that's unprecedented in this state," said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat, on a radio call-in show on Thursday.
Candidates today talked optimistically about their ability to implement their plans, and dismissed concerns about the lack of a mandate, noting that Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., of A Connecticut Party, was elected with 40 percent and still managed to push through an income tax.
At a campaign stop in Hartford, Mr. Rowland was asked whether he would deliver an income tax cut, and he responded quickly: "You better believe it. We'll cut it by one-third my first two years in office."
Elsewhere, Mr. Curry, the State Comptroller, told voters that Mr. Rowland was cutting the wrong tax. "We raise more money from the property tax than we do from the income tax and sales tax combined," he said.
In New Haven, Mrs. Groark, the Lieutenant Governor, argued that the present administration had saved the state from a $1 billion deficit by imposing an income tax in 1991 and that it would reappear with massive cuts, whether in property taxes or income taxes.
"Our future is bright," she said. "But we must not embrace the free-lunch theory of government proposed by my opponents."
And Mr. Scott, a conservative Republican who abandoned his party to run as an independent, continued to lambaste Mrs. Groark and GovernorWeicker for "pouring fuel on a fire" by imposing an income tax during a recession in 1991. He insisted that he was the only candidate truly committed to repealing it, and that Mr. Rowland had not detailed a serious plan.
Over the last month, the debate over taxes has been somewhat eclipsed by questions about Mr. Rowland's character, and the controversy over a domestic dispute between Mr. Rowland and his former wife, Deborah, may well be a deciding factor.
Mr. Rowland has said that he and his ex-wife had an argument at her home in Middlebury on April 10, but he successfully fought in court to block the release of the police report about the incident.
Mr. Rowland has argued that making the report public would harm his three children, a point his ex-wife disputes.
In recent weeks, polls have shown Mr. Rowland losing support among women of both parties.
Today, as Mr. Rowland shook hands with voters, he would smile brightly every time a woman said she planned to vote for him, and on at least one occasion he mentioned the "negative and slanderous campaign" that had been waged against him.
Mr. Curry tried to cast the race as a two-person contest between him and Mr. Rowland, and said that a vote for Mrs. Groark was a vote for Mr. Rowland.
"It is appropriate for people to ask if their vote makes not just a statement, but a difference," he said. "Because of the configuration of the race, John Rowland might eke out a one-point win that he hasn't earned and that the vast majority of people in this state don't want him to have."
But Mrs. Groark dismissed Mr. Curry's argument at a news conference this afternoon. "As we wind down the campaign, we are surging, and with such a high percentage of undecided voters, obviously they are going to decide the outcome," she said.
With these starkly different positions, pollsters say that Connecticut voters are confused about what to do, with as much as one-fifth of the electorate still undecided.
Betsey Todt, director of the Quinnipiac College Poll, said: "It's the only race I've been associated with since I've been doing polls where any poll you've been reading up 'til now is not a predictor of what's going to happen on Tuesday. Even though we had Rowland ahead in our last poll, it is still very much up for grabs."

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Rises for the 22d Month

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
American consumers took on substantially more debt in September, the Federal Reserve said today, marking the 22d straight month that such borrowing has grown as the economy has strengthened.
The Fed said that everything from credit card to auto debt to bank consumer loans grew by some $10.57 billion, or at a 14.6 percent annual rate, following a staggering $15.16 billion increase in August -- an annualized jump of 21.3 percent. 
 Growth in auto loans was especially strong. Auto credit outstanding rose in September to $5.59 billion, at a 21.7 percent annual rate, after rising by $4.53 billion, or at a 17.8 percent annual rate, in August.
The Fed said the overall August increase in consumer borrowing, a sharp revision from the previously reported $11.20 billion rise, was the largest rise since January 1989, when it grew $16.33 billion.
The increases have fueled concern that consumers may pull back from their spending spree, undermining the vitality of the economy.
The Fed, on the other hand, has seemed more worried that the strong demand in the malls and auto dealerships will give sustenance to its avowed enemy -- inflation.
For this reason, it is generally expected that Fed policy makers will vote to increase interest rates for the sixth time when they meet to map out policy next Tuesday.
Revolving, or credit-card, debt in September rose by $2.29 billion, at an 8.6 percent annual rate, compared with a $7.77 billion August advance, at a 29.7 percent annual rate, the latter the largest rise since June 1984, when it rose 31 percent.
Other credit, which includes consumer bank loans but not real estate mortgages, rose by $2.68 billion, at a 13.5 percent annual rate, slower than the $2.86 billion, or 14.5 percent, August increase, the Fed said.
Before seasonal adjustment, the total outstanding consumer credit in September was $880.2 billion, up from $869.6 billion in August and $772.2 billion in September 1993.

HEADLINE: South Korea to Lift Curbs On Business Ties to North

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 7

 BODY:
South Korea said today that it would begin lifting restrictions on business dealings with North Korea, clearing the way for economic cooperation between the two countries still divided by the legacy of the cold war.
In short North Korea, one of the world's most isolated nations and a last bastion of Stalinism, looks open for business. 
 The announcement today by President Kim Young Sam of South Korea effectively fires the starter's gun for a race by South Korean companies to establish factories and build resorts in North Korea. Such plans had been announced two to three years ago, but were frozen last year as a crisis developed over the Communist nation's suspected nuclear weapons program.
"It is true that in the past, intra-Korean relations were bogged down over the nuclear issue and went through a difficult phase," President Kim said in a speech today to a group of businessmen in Seoul. "However, we have reached the point when we should seriously re-examine this topic and start pushing for a policy of economic cooperation with North Korea."
Mr. Kim said he would take "step-by-step measures" to create an atmosphere conducive to cooperation by encouraging joint industrial projects between North and South Korea.
Little is known about the workings of North Korea, a reclusive Communist state, so its worth as an emerging market is hard to calculate. Yet the prospect of opening one of the world's last closed economies seems bound to pique the kind of international business interest that has been whetted by China and, to a lesser degree, Vietnam.
Until now, direct trade between North and South Korea has been prohibited. But indirect trade, through Hong Kong or other third parties, has grown to about $200 million a year. Much of the trade consists of North Korean exports of raw materials and clothing.
South Korea's huge conglomerates, known as chaebol, began staking out their turf in North Korea well before the latest nuclear crisis.
The Hyundai Group, for instance, has expressed interest in developing a resort near Mount Kumgang, a scenic spot north of the eastern end of the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas. And another conglomerate, Daewoo, reached an agreement with North Korea to run factories in Nampo, a port near Pyongyang, the capital, to produce shirts, underwear, eating utensils and other light products.
American, European and Asian companies are also quietly exploring opportunities in North Korea. But the American companies are generally quiet about their plans because Washington has not yet lifted restrictions barring them from doing any business with North Korea.
"There's no reason to go beyond the borderline at the moment," said an executive of AT&T in Seoul. The company, which would like to connect North Korea to its telephone service and sell it telecommunications equipment, has been talking to people at the North Korean mission at the United Nations.
Businessmen in Seoul say other American companies interested in at least looking at North Korea include Coca-Cola, Bechtel and Hewlett-Packard.
Shell Oil and the ING Bank of the Netherlands are two European-based companies whose officials have visited North Korea, but say they have not yet decided whether to invest.
Kim Jong Il, who took over as North Korean leader in the aftermath of the death of his father, President Kim Il Sung, in July, seems to be looking for foreign investment to shore up a tottering economy. The North Korean economy has been contracting at a rate of 5 percent a year and is beset by severe fuel shortages. The country's gross national product has been estimated at well below $1,000 per capita in a population of about 22 million.
The Communist Government is soliciting foreign companies to set up operations in a free trade zone in the far northeast corner of the country, near the Tumen River and the borders with China and Russia. This especially isolated area was believed to have been selected, in part, to prevent Western and capitalist ideas from loosening the Pyongyang leadership's hold over the population.
In foreign economic terms, what North Korea is believed to offer is an obedient, low-wage work force and a location near the attractive markets of China, South Korea and Japan. The country is also rich in some metal ores.
But roads and telecommunications are extremely poor. The potential market of 22 million is small by Asian standards, and the nation lacks a convertible currency.
Prospective investors will also wonder whether North Korea, with no history of private enterprise, will respect private property and profit.
"We don't even know how much water costs there," Yi Hyo Keun, senior researcher at the Daewoo Research Institute, said in an interview in Seoul, the South Korean capital, last week.
As a result there is a lot of information-gathering, but foreign companies have not yet committed themselves to an economic or business role. "Everyone seems to be waiting for someone to make the first leap," said Michael Breen, a Seoul-based consultant on North Korea.
Tony Michell, president of the Euro-Asian Business Consultancy, which offers to help set up shop in North Korea, said his company had been approached by 42 companies -- 10 American, 10 Asian and 22 European. But only five of those companies are serious about investing in North Korea, he said. He did not identify them.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, which is based in Seoul, is trying to arrange an information-gathering trip to North Korea. Some executives are concerned that American companies will be left behind if Washington does not move rapidly to lift restrictions.
American businessmen are allowed to visit North Korea and pay for their hotel, food and transportation. But United States laws forbid them to open a bank account, hire a North Korean employee, enter into a contract or transact just about any other business.
The companies most interested in North Korea are South Korean. The common language and culture and proximity to home compensate for the possibility that the North's wages may not be as low as in Vietnam or China.
South Korean companies have expressed fear that Japanese competitors might beat them to set up factories in North Korea. But Japanese companies are expected to go slow, partly because of a history of poor relations between Japan and Korea resulting from World War II.
Moreover, profit is not the only motive for South Korean companies. Another is to bolster North Korea's economy in expectation of eventual reunification on the Korean peninsula.
"I'd like to see that North Korea can be built," said Kim Young Chull, who escaped from North Korea as a boy with his family in 1946. Mr. Kim is now vice chairman of the Jindo Corporation, which makes fur coats and shipping containers.
The Kolon International Corporation, a manufacturer of clothing, sporting goods and other products, has been sending fabrics to North Korea to be sewn into school bags and backpacks since 1989, when Seoul first loosened some restrictions on business with the North.
But Kolon officials have never been able to visit the company's factories in the North or even to talk directly to the factory managers, Instead, they work through middlemen in Hong Kong or Beijing. With restrictions now likely to be lifted on business travel, a Kolon manager said, the company can produce more finished goods, like fashionable clothing, in North Korea.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.S. Backs Seoul Move
 ELMENDORF AIR FORCE BASE, Alaska, Nov. 7 (Special to The New York Times) -- In another sign that the barriers to dealing with North Korea are crumbling, the United States will support the Communist country's entry into the 18-member forum for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation and will encourage North Korean economic ties with South Korea and the rest of Asia.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced the Administration's position today as he embraced remarks by President Kim of South Korea that Seoul would lift its ban on business contacts with the North.
Speaking to reporters on the way to Seoul, where he will meet with South Korean leaders, Mr. Christopher heaped praise on the policy shift by the south and credited the Administration's recent nuclear accord with North Korea for making it possible.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends the Day Mixed In Advance of U.S. Elections

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed in cautious trading yesterday amid uncertainty over United States monetary policy on the eve of elections.
"People view the election as important, but they don't know what it's supposed to mean for the dollar," said William Dudley, currency analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. 
 In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar slipped to 97.35 Japanese yen from 97.45 yen on Friday. The dollar also fell to 1.5170 German marks, from 1.5147 marks on Friday. The British pound fell to $1.6145 from $1.6160.
After two days of dollar-buying by the United States last week, traders continued to be on guard for further interventions, which helped support the value of the dollar yesterday. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which acts as the United States Treasury's agent in the foreign-exchange market, bought an estimated $2 billion for Japanese yen and German marks on Wednesday and Thursday.
"People still would like to go short on the dollar but they don't want to get burned," said Siobhan Lackey, assistant vice president at Bank Julius Baer & Company in New York. To short dollars, a trader sells them for another currency, hoping to buy them back later at a lower rate.
The Clinton Administration will be under pressure to order further interventions to support the dollar after today's elections, regardless of the outcome, Mr. Dudley of Goldman, Sachs said.
"There are questions about whether the intervention was primarily motivated by the elections," he said. "The Clinton Administration will probably want to continue to intervene for that reason. If the dollar weakens and we don't see action, that would reinforce pressure on the downside."
Uncertainty about the timing and size of the next increase in United States interest rates also discouraged currency dealers from taking new positions.
Analysts expect the Fed to raise its benchmark for short-term rates at least half a percentage point to 5.25 percent after its policy-making committee meets next Tuesday.
Higher rates in theory should help strengthen the dollar by attracting more funds into dollar-denominated deposits. But the Fed's five increases in short-term interest rates have failed to calm inflation fears in the bond market, dragging down Treasury prices and the dollar.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: GOVERNORS;
As Democrats Struggle, G.O.P.'s Gubernatorial Stars Seem to Lead Their Races

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

 BODY:
While many of the country's most prominent Democratic governors are in close races for re-election, the best-known Republican governors seem to be comfortably ahead of their challengers.
Democrats whose futures are in doubt include Mario M. Cuomo of New York, Ann W. Richards of Texas, Lawton Chiles of Florida and Zell Miller of Georgia. 
 As for Republicans, Pete Wilson of California and William F. Weld of Massachusetts are among the well-known governors who seem to be safe bets for re-election. If they win second terms, they will doubtless rise on their party's list of prospects for the national ticket in 1996.
Other Republican governors who are expected to win handily today include several from the Middle West: Jim Edgar of Illinois, John M. Engler of Michigan, Arne Carlson of Minnesota, George V. Voinovich of Ohio and Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin.
Democratic strategists have been frustrated all fall that so many of the party's stars were unable to pull away once the campaign began in earnest. "What's maddening," said Doug Richardson, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, "is that the ones that seemed to be close are still close and don't seem to be breaking away."
As matters now stand, 29 states have Democratic governors, 20 have Republicans and one, Connecticut, an independent. Of the 35 states other than Connecticut where there is a gubernatorial election today, Democrats are now in office in 21, Republicans in 13.
At least a dozen of those races were still up for grabs on the eve of the election, including the ones in Texas and Florida, where two of former President George Bush's sons are challenging prominent Democrats. In addition to the large states where Democratic incumbents are threatened, the party is fighting in several states to retain seats where the Democratic incumbent retired or lost in the primary.
Such states include Hawaii, Idaho, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Wyoming. Democrats seem to have fallen behind in Kansas and Oklahoma, both of which have Democratic Governors who are leaving office.
Only one Republican Governor, J. Fife Symington of Arizona, seems to be in serious trouble. He has been accused of financial improprieties connected to a savings and loan failure. But a double-digit lead once held by his Democratic challenger, Eddie Basha, the owner of a chain of supermarkets, has faded, and Governor Symington could still be re-elected.
For a time, Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, trying for a fourth term, seemed to be the one Middle Western Republican Governor whose re-election was not secure. But the most recent polls show him ahead of the Democratic Attorney General, Bonnie J. Campbell.
The only Democratic Governors who seem safe are Howard Dean of Vermont, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Roy Romer of Colorado.
If Republicans win a big enough share of the races that seem to be close, the party could end up holding a majority of the governorships for the first time since 1970.
Some of the races could turn on local issues like immigration in California and ethics in Alabama, where Gov. Guy Hunt, a Republican, was removed from office last year after he was convicted of pocketing $200,000 from a special fund to pay for his inauguration.
But much more than usual, the races for governor in the large states this year are following a similar pattern. As a rule, the Republicans, whether incumbents or not, are running hard-edged conservative campaigns in which they advocate lowering taxes, restricting welfare and cracking down on crime and accuse the Democratic incumbents of being tax-and-spend liberals who are soft on criminals.
Governor Engler of Michigan has become the archetypal Republican Governor, and many of the Republican challengers are trying to copy his success. In his first term, Governor Engler moved well to the right of any of his postwar predecessors. He cut property taxes, raised sales taxes, abolished general assistance welfare programs and cut money for the mentally ill and cultural programs. Most important, he changed the way public schools are financed and began providing state money to some private schools.
The Michigan economy is now thriving, and Mr. Engler is one of the most popular governors in the country. "We're bringing this state back," he said in a debate last month with his Democratic challenger, former Representative Howard Wolpe.
Chris Henick, executive director of the Republican Governors Association, said that the issues Governor Engler has emphasized have been nourishing for Republican candidates across the country.
"The whole more government vs. less government environment is one in which our candidates have thrived," he said.
Among the Republican challengers who are taking the conservative tack are Jeb Bush, 41, and George W. Bush, 48, neither of whom has ever held elected office.
Jeb Bush, who is challenging Governor Chiles in Florida, said in Fort Myers yesterday, "When you cut to the chase, Lawton Chiles is a liberal who thinks government is the answer to our problems. On the other hand, I'm a conservative that believes in limited government."
Jeb Bush had a lead for weeks this fall. But the most recent polls show Mr. Chiles narrowly ahead.
In Texas, George W. Bush has hammered away at Ms. Richards, saying she has coddled criminals and welfare recipients. As has been the case in other races in the South this fall, President Clinton has been a drag on the Richards candidacy.
A statewide poll, the results of which were published over the weekend by The Dallas Morning News and The Houston Chronicle, showed that 55 percent of Texans had a favorable view of Ms. Richards but that only 38 percent had such an opinion of Mr. Clinton. It is rare for a candidate with an approval rating as high as Ms. Richards's to lose, but the polls show this race to be dead even.

HEADLINE: Urban Crime Rates Falling This Year

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
The number of incidents of murder, robbery and assault has declined in almost all the nation's largest cities, most markedly in the West, according to a survey by the New York City Police Department.
Twenty of the 22 police departments that were surveyed said there were fewer felonies in the first six months of this year than there were in the same period last year. The cities showing the greatest declines in felonies were San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, El Paso and San Antonio, in descending order. San Francisco reported a 25.2 percent decrease in total felonies, with better than 20 percent decreases each in murder, rape, robbery, burglary, larceny theft and motor vehicle theft. 
 New York City ranked sixth in the survey, with a decrease of 9.7 percent in total felonies from the same six-month period last year. Homicide in the city fell by 10.9 percent; robbery by 12 percent and auto theft by 14.5 percent. The numbers fell particularly fast during the summer in New York and in many other cities, compared with the summer before, according to police officials.
Unlike most of the other cities, where the reported decreases followed years of rising crime rates, New York saw a downward trend continue; it had already recorded three straight years of modest declines.
The only reported increases in felonies were in Phoenix (11 percent) and Baltimore (3.2 percent), the survey said.
Mark Moore, a criminologist at Harvard University, said the survey was "probably good news," but he noted that "it doesn't capture the fear that is out there."
Indeed, a single set of new statistics, no matter how encouraging, is unlikely to allay the fears of a country that saw crime rates soar after crack came to the cities in the mid-1980's. Many experts say it will take years of declines in crime rates for this pervasive anxiety to recede.
While the survey results were based on preliminary police data, and though as much as 50 percent of violent crimes go unreported, criminologists and police officials said the new numbers nevertheless suggested at least a short-term downward trend in crime. But the experts differed widely on whether the apparent improvement in urban safety was related to improvements in the economy, the cold winter, demographic trends or changes in police tactics and law-enforcement policies.
Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said the results partly reflected demographic shifts, because the number of teen-agers -- those most likely to commit crimes -- had declined over the last decade. Experts expect that trend to reverse, as more children of the baby-boom generation become teen-agers over the next 5 to 10 years.
Explaining the national downturn, Deputy Police Inspector Joseph E. Lovelock of New York City credited the "building boom" of new prisons nationwide, tougher local and national gun-control regulations and a national trend in law enforcement toward community policing -- taking officers out of patrol cars and putting them on city streets, where they can come to know a neighborhood and its problems, and the neighborhood can come to know them.
The national survey was carried out by New York City police officers, who collected the data by telephone, mail and fax machine at the request of Police Commissioner William J. Bratton. Police officials said Mr. Bratton wanted to compare the results of his crime strategies to the records of other police departments. The statistics will be released by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the next few months.
James Alan Fox, dean of the College of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University in Boston, said the declines reported in the survey might reflect little more than a natural leveling off from the high crime levels after the introduction of crack in the mid 1980's. Indeed, the number of violent crimes rose by 5.6 percent in 1993 from the year before, to 10.9 million incidents, according to the annual National Crime Victimization Survey by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, an arm of the Justice Department.
"Crime rates fluctuate much like the stock market," Mr. Fox said. "Good years are generally followed by bad."
San Francisco saw a 28.7 percent increase in homicides from 1990 to 1993, reaching a total of 130 that year, before declining by 23.8 percent in the first six months of this year, compared with the same period the year before. Similarly, aggravated assault increased by 10 percent from 1992 to 1993, reaching 4,396, before dropping 18.1 percent during the first six months of 1994 compared with the same period in 1993.
Mayor Frank Jordan of San Francisco said better police work explained the decline in crime.
"We're setting standards of behavior," Mayor Jordan said in an interview yesterday. He said the city's police department had hired 200 more officers since he took office in January 1992, bringing the total to 1,900; stepped up security in parks and public transportation stations, and begun an offensive against nuisance crimes like panhandling and graffiti vandalism.
Seven of the 12 cities with the largest reductions are in California and Texas.
San Antonio, for instance, reported a 25.4 percent decline in homicides for the first six months in the year. That decline roughly brings the annual homicide rate this year in line with the 168 committed in 1989.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trying New Tactic With Zaire

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 7

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration, hoping to avert economic and political disintegration in Zaire, has adopted a new strategy that seeks to strengthen that country's Prime Minister and isolate its longtime President.
But many Africa experts and Zairians say the Administration's tentative embrace of Prime Minister Leon Kengo wa Dondo will do the opposite of what it intends: rehabilitate Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's dictator, whom the Administration has shunned in recent years because of his human-rights abuses and large-scale corruption. 
 The Administration's Africa strategists say they are working to support Mr. Kengo so he can develop a power base independent of Mr. Mobutu. That would enable him to prepare Zaire for free elections and stabilize its out-of-control economy, which suffered inflation of more than 10,000 percent last year.
To buttress Mr. Kengo, who some officials say is a sincere reformer, the Administration received him in Washington in early October, and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott visited Zaire two weeks ago. Mr. Talbott hinted that Washington would work to resume loans from the International Monetary Fund and would send a new Ambassador, after having withdrawn its Ambassador last year because of dismay with Mr. Mobutu.
Critics of the Administration's policy say the strategy of backing Mr. Kengo and hinting at economic aid will strengthen Mr. Mobutu's hand because the longtime ruler can point to it as a sign of acceptance by Washington. These critics also argue that embracing Mr. Kengo is misguided because he is at worst a puppet of Mr. Mobutu and at best largely dependent on him.
"The United States is deceiving itself if it thinks Kengo is anything more than a puppet of Mobutu," Lambert Mende Omalanga, an opposition member in Parliament, said in an interview. "He cannot do anything without Mobutu's go-ahead."
Before joining an opposition party, Mr. Kengo served as a Prime Minister under Mr. Mobutu from 1982 to 1985 and from 1988 to 1990. Like Mr. Mobutu, he has often been accused of human-rights abuses and of siphoning off Government funds.
Critics of Washington's policy also fear that in pushing Mr. Kengo to prepare for elections, the Administration is paving the way toward legitimizing Mr. Mobutu, because many view him, thanks to his money and clout, as the likely winner.
"I think there is a rehabilitation of Mobutu going on," said Peter Rosenblum, an Africa expert with the International Human Rights Law Group, based in Washington. "The Administration's view seems to be, he is an actor and we have to deal with him."
For most of Mr. Mobutu's 28 years in power, successive Administrations backed him as a helpful, strategically located client during the cold war. But with the collapse of Communism, the Administration has stopped supporting him.
Nonetheless, State Department officials say they want to help pull the mineral-rich nation of 41 million back from the brink of political disintegration and economic disaster, fearing that it can spin out of control into a Rwanda-like civil war.
In the three years before Mr. Kengo was elected last June, there was a political impasse in which Mr. Mobutu and Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi sought to block each move taken by the other.
When a reconstituted Parliament elected Mr. Kengo last June, the United States -- joined by France and Belgium, two former colonial powers in central Africa -- saw an opportunity to push Zaire toward democracy and economic stability.
The Administration lauds Mr. Kengo for allowing opposition leaders to debate Government officials on television, something Mr. Mobutu never permitted. They also praise him for seizing 30 tons of counterfeit currency that was flown into Zaire as part of a scheme that American officials say was intended to enrich Mr. Mobutu and his entourage.
Some Administration officials acknowledge that they are not convinced that Mr. Kengo is independent of Mr. Mobutu. For example, Mr. Mobuto blocked the Prime Minister from replacing the head of Zaire's central bank.
Still, diplomats say Mr. Kengo has gotten the Zairian President to give him some freedom by threatening to quit, something Mr. Mobutu apparently fears because it would bring him more international opprobrium.
Under current law, the Administration is barred from providing aid to Zaire because it is behind in repaying its $800 million debt to the United States. The Administration is providing $12 million this year to relief organizations in Zaire.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
30-Second TV Spot: The Chicken Pox of Politics

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Television watchers, whatever their political leanings, ought to be able to join today in celebration: the campaign of 1994 is over.
For weeks there has been lamentation on all channels about the nastiness of the advertising on all channels. Except for the professionals who turn out the stuff (and for whom every negative is a positive on their balance sheets), campaign commentators have chorused their disgust at charges and countercharges that have little to do either with truth or with issues that really touch voters' lives. 
 But they also agree that the voters, in this sour season, did not seem to know or care much about candidates' experience or policies or about the consequences of, say, cutting taxes. The commentators were especially incensed by 30-second television spots that explained nothing. Money buys time and time buys votes and attack ads breed attack ads.
So what is to be done, except for preparing ourselves for even worse in 1996? By now, eyes glaze at the mention of campaign reform, yet without restrictions on contributions and expenditures and serious Federal financing, our political arrangements will remain in thrall to the fat cats and their hired media manipulators. Unfortunately, with so many Senators and Representatives reluctant to give up the largesse, campaign reform is not around the corner.
So the burden falls on television itself. For reasons of self-interest and concern for freedom of speech, networks and stations cannot be expected to bar those invidious 30-second spots or to deny candidates other opportunities to slander their rivals. And the polluters are not going to stop the dumping in an outbreak of guilty conscience. Still, perhaps their products can be subjected to public examination without violating anyone's liberties. At least, the possibility demands discussion.
Network news departments have lately been making efforts to sort out truth from fiction, relevance from irrelevance in the din. Good, but that is not nearly enough to stem the effluvia poisoning the political environment. Here, then, is a short, not overly ambitious wish list:
*Any advertisement that attacks a rival's character should be delivered personally by the candidate who is making it, not by some anonymous voice. Say anything you want, sir or madam, but say it openly on screen. And every respectable news department should feel an obligation to give the target an opportunity to respond, again in person.
*Any advertisement that attacks a candidate's record should be followed with all deliberate speed by a news-department accounting of its accuracy and its method of delivery. The analysis should come while the advertisement is still fresh in mind. If this discourages the 30-second spots, so much the better. (This suggestion could be usefully applied to so-called positive advertising, too, which is often positively misleading.)
*Considerably more of prime time should be given to interviews with the candidates, conducted not by blank local-news anchors but by real reporters, well supplied with background material and not shy about pressing for comprehensible answers. Debate formats should be aimed at enlightenment, not at agitation, more in the spirit of "The MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour" than of "Crossfire." Some programs and personalities contribute to the brainless brawling even while decrying it.
These proposals (which, I confess, would not do much to reduce the demagogy and lunacy of talk radio) are not original and probably not enforceable; they involve technical and economic as well as legal problems. So if other approaches serve better, fine. The object is simply to add more accurate information to the campaign commotion and reduce the vicious nonsense.
Whether many voters will be more moved by the facts than by the attacks is a separate matter. Asking for more enlightening television campaigns is like asking for more intelligent television dramas; audience preferences may lie in another direction. But that's show business.
Happy Election Day.

HEADLINE: More Than Decoration, Songbirds Are Essential to Forests' Health

BYLINE: By CAROL KAESUK YOON 

 BODY:
THE migrating songbirds that brighten North America's forests each spring with dazzling colors and melodious strains have been regarded by many scientists as mere decorative frills that play a limited role, if any, in the functioning of their ecosystems. But a new study provides what researchers say is the first evidence that these birds, some of which are in decline, play a crucial role in maintaining the health and productivity of forest trees.
In the study, in the current issue of the journal Ecology, two researchers have shown that these voracious predators can protect trees by eating the bugs that chew the leaves. As a result, scientists are predicting that the decline of these birds could eventually threaten the productivity of forests in the United States as well as in the birds' wintering grounds in the tropical forests of Central and South America. 
 "It's really a spectacular result," said Dr. Donald R. Strong, an ecologist at the University of California at Davis, "and it's got to be generally true. The conservation importance and forest management importance is profound. We see that in order to protect our forests we've got to have these birds, some of which are becoming quite rare."
Dr. Richard T. Holmes, a bird ecologist at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., said: "It's a very exciting paper. It's the first time that there have been data to show that birds feeding on insects have an impact on trees."
Working in the forest at the Tyson Research Center, a reserve near Eureka, Mo., the researchers enclosed white oak trees in netting cages. The cages were built with holes big enough to admit all the insects that might attack the trees but small enough to keep out the birds that would eat the insects.
For two years biologists monitored the insects flying in and out of the cages. Most were moths and butterflies laying eggs that would hatch into leaf-devouring caterpillars, the major insect enemies of these economically important timber trees.
What they found was that the plants that were caged to keep out birds were plagued by twice as many insects and had twice as much of their leafy green foliage eaten as uncaged plants. As a result, the damaged plants produced fewer leaves in following years than those trees cleaned of their pests by birds.
"There's been a lot of argument and controversy about the role that birds have in ecosystems," said Dr. Robert J. Marquis, a plant ecologist at the University of Missouri in St. Louis who was an author of the study. "Some say they do no more than provide weekend activity for bird-watchers. We've shown that the birds can have an effect."
Conservationists welcome the work as the first piece of evidence that the colorful dickey birds of spring do have a significant ecological and economic importance.
Dr. Tom Hinckley, Bloedel Professor of Forestry at the University of Washington in Seattle, said: "These birds in a sense enrich our environment, whether it's urban or rural, but it's sometimes difficult to put a value on them other than enrichment. Now here's a case where their value can perhaps be translated to a clear economic value."
Dr. Christopher J. Whelan, who holds the Emily Rodgers Davis Chair in Ecology at the Morton Arboretum in Lisle, Ill., and was the other author of the paper, said the migrants made up more than two-thirds of the nesting bird species in the forests.
During spring migration at the study site in the Ozarks, 40 to 50 bird species arrive to eat the insects on the fresh white oak leaves. Dr. Whelan said, some 30 of those species stay on to nest, including red-eyed vireos, American robins and scarlet tanagers. All appear to help the white oak.
Though many researchers agree that several species of these migrant songbirds are decreasing, the reasons remain controversial. Researchers have attributed the decline to forest destruction and other disruptive forces here and in their wintering grounds.
In addition to documenting beneficial effects for plants, researchers say the new study may provide clues to the birds' decline. Dr. Scott Robinson, an ornithologist with the Illinois Natural History Survey in Champaign, said that the migrant birds' ability to depress insect numbers so greatly on white oak suggests that competition for insect prey on breeding grounds in North America may be important to the birds' survival and reproduction, as well as a factor limiting their numbers.
Based on the new study, ecologists predict trouble ahead for forests, but they caution that for the moment such predictions are speculative. Whether any trees besides white oak will actually suffer remains to be seen.
Researchers say that even if there is an important effect on trees, the damage due to loss of birds may be difficult or impossible to tease out from that due to other causes. Although they cannot point to specific damage resulting from the loss of birds, some researchers say they fear damage to trees may be under way.
"My feeling is that it's going on as we speak," Dr. Whelan said. "In some of the small forest fragments that have very few birds in them, this may very well be happening right now."
Ecologists have known for some time that trickle-down effects along a food chain can be very important in aquatic systems. In these so-called trophic cascades, top-level predators, like fish that eat smaller fish, radically increase or decrease the numbers of creatures at the bottom of the cascade by eating more or fewer of those that act as predators further down the line. But scientists had remained skeptical about whether the terrestrial equivalent of these cascades -- involving birds, insects and plants -- were of much importance. Birds, it was supposed, would not be powerful enough predators to have an effect all the way down to the plants.
"The really exciting thing about this paper is, now we can believe that the birds are playing a big role, having a hand in this," said Dr. Strong.
The authors even propose that the birds constitute an ecologically correct form of pest management.
"Some people say insecticides are the way to go," said Dr. Whelan, "but, actually, what we show is that birds were as effective as insecticide. So if you have the birds, you don't need insecticide." Many ecologists say that anyone who is interested in reducing pests in forest tracts and increasing forest productivity should protect the beneficial birds.
Many options for increasing bird numbers are already well known. For example, many of the birds declining most quickly prefer forest interiors. One way to protect them is simply to prevent the fragmentation of forest tracts. Researchers say such fragmentation not only decreases the stretches of protected interior forest but provides habitat for species that like edges, like raccoons and blue jays, which often prey on the eggs and young of the declining bird species.
The researchers will continue their work by examining the effects of these migrant insect-eaters on tropical forest trees in their wintering grounds in Costa Rica.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: IN THEIR OWN WORDS;
The Candidates Debate

 BODY:

Mario M. Cuomo -- Democrat, on a fourth term
One person's lame duck is the other person's liberated executive. If you assumed it was my last year, that could make me stronger a whole lot of ways because it frees you from any necessity to cater to any political influence. You can go in there and swing with both hands. I think the Senate Republican majority, and I'm assuming it's going to continue to be a Senate Republican majority, may be easier for me to handle next year if I do what I've proposed to do and that is to go directly to the Senate members. 

George E. Pataki, Republican, on whether he would have trouble working with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
Absolutely not. First, on the personal side. Think back to 1982. There was a pretty difficult primary for governor between two guys from New York City, one named Ed Koch and one named Mario Cuomo. Now, Cuomo won, became the governor, Koch was still the mayor. It worked. They worked well. They worked together because you have to for the future of this city and state. The same thing with Mayor Giuliani. I think he's done a tremendous job in trying to close a very difficult budget gap without raising taxes but by cutting spending. I think his emphasis on law and order and having the police make arrests is exactly the right thing.
 
Robert T. Walsh Sr., Right to Life, on Mr. Pataki's abortion stance.
 I have to tell you that everywhere I've gone on the campaign trail, from one end of the state to the other, the voters have told me they feel betrayed by George Pataki. After voting consistently over the years against Medicaid funding of abortion, he flip-flopped and now tells us that he's pro-choice. No one really knows where George stands on this issue. It's difficult to know whether he is pro-life or pro-choice. I find with great pride that I am the only pro-life candidate running in this election and you know something? I'm not for sale. You were speaking just before about whether or not we're spoilers. I hope that I'm a spoiler for all the other candidates. A recent independent poll showed that 70 percent of all voters in this state profess to have a pro-life philosophy and if they vote for what they believe in, especially being betrayed by the Republicans and the Conservatives, well then, you're looking at the next Governor of New York. [At this point, Mr. Walsh pulls out a rubber chicken.] In all fairness, we've got to ask George how he feels about this issue. [Mr. Walsh puts the beak of the chicken to his ear, as if it is whispering to him.] George says he has to ask Alfonse what to say. You can go back into hiding now George.
 
Lawrence A. Lane, Socialist Workers, on why he is running
My campaign is part of the growing resistance of workers and youth to the consequences of the deep economic crisis of this rotten capitalist system: downsizing, speed-ups, cutbacks, growing instability, right-wing solutions, fascism and war. All my opponents see that this for-profit system isn't working but they place the blame elsewhere.
 
B. Thomas Golisano, Independence Fusion, on being a third party candidate
When you go to vote tomorrow, you have some options: One of them is Mario Cuomo. I ask you the question: Do you think you are better off today than you were 12 years ago? He's gotten us here. I think he blames everyone and everything but himself and now he wants four more years. George Pataki and the Republicans -- In 1986 they offered Lew Lehrman, all of his money and they failed. 1990: Pierre Rinfret. He was lucky he got 25 percent of the vote. In 1994 they offer George Pataki -- no C.E.O. experience, a Mayor, a legislator with a modest record. The Mayor of the largest city in the state did not endorse him. An Al D'Amato-puppet reputation.
 
Bob Shultz, Libertarian on what he wants to accomplish
I think the primary objective of mine is to see that the back-door borrowing ends. I firmly believe that we must, we have a constitution that prohibits borrowing by the state without voter approval. If we can those in government to abide by this constitutional constraint then government will have no choice but to begin to focus on issues of efficiency in government and productivity and accountability.

HEADLINE: Clean Up Reactors In East Europe Too

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"East Europe Still Choking on Air of the Past" (news article, Nov. 3) provides a compelling description of the difficulties facing Eastern European countries in abandoning the dreadfully polluting plants and practices of their Communist past. 
 However, your discussion overlooks Western investments in unsafe Soviet-designed reactors, which may in fact divert investment capital from industrial modernization and environmental cleanup.
The decisions to complete the Temelin plant in the Czech Republic and the Mochovce plant in Slovakia will have important implications for development of the energy sector throughout the former Eastern bloc.
While Westinghouse is at work at Temelin, the future of the plant is uncertain. A Congressional committee is investigating the United States Export-Import Bank's move to provide loan guarantees for the project. Over the summer, the existence of approximately $200 million in cost overruns was disclosed. Czech officials have also committed themselves to a Western-style licensing proceeding where the safety of this untested hybrid will be challenged by local opponents.
The United States-supported European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has been asked to finance the completion of two units at Mochovce. The project will receive intense scrutiny in the coming months as the bank releases a least-cost study and an environmental assessment for public review, the first ever for a Soviet reactor.
There is still an opportunity to avoid additional investment in unsafe, uneconomical nuclear power. The countries of Central and Eastern Europe should adopt, instead, a flexible energy strategy, one that incorporates increased efficiency with smaller supply-side projects to capitalize on the drive of industries to modernize and compete in global markets.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: THE OVERVIEW;
G.O.P. WINS CONTROL OF SENATE AND MAKES BIG GAINS IN HOUSE; PATAKI DENIES CUOMO 4TH TERM

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

 BODY:
The Republican Party seized control of the Senate and moved within a few seats of capturing the House yesterday, winning eight Democratic seats in the Senate and at least 38 in the House. The gains were the Republicans' strongest in decades and put them in position to thwart President Clinton and his legislative proposals for the next two years.
The Republican tide also extended to the races for governor in several important states that will be critical to Mr. Clinton's hopes for re-election in 1996, including New York, Pennsylvania, Texas and California. 
 One after another, once unassailable Democrats like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Chicago and Senators James Sasser of Tennessee and Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania fell to little-known Republican challengers.
But Republicans, who have held the Senate in only 6 of the last 40 years, were particularly overjoyed that they had picked up Democratic Senate seats in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Michigan and Maine. Mr. Clinton had criss-crossed most of those states in a frenetic eight-day campaign swing, but it did no good. The Republicans ended the night with at least a 52-to-48 majority in the Senate.
"I've never known a better night in electoral politics for the Republican Party, and the best is yet to come," a beaming Bob Dole declared to an overflow crowd at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington. Mr. Dole, who will become the majority leader, studiously avoided saying whether he would focus on that job or on running for President in 1996, but the crowd was excited about the party's prospects, chanting, " '96! '96!, '96!"
The Democrats were not completely shut out. Senator Charles S. Robb, a Democrat, defeated Oliver L. North in one of the most closely watched races in a particularly volatile election season, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts hung on to his seat after the biggest scare of his political life.
In metropolitan area races, two Democratic Senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut coasted to victory.
Despite those victories for Democrats, after a campaign season notable for restive voters, vituperative candidates and an astonishing amount of mudslinging, the Republicans enjoyed their best mid-term elections in decades. The last time the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress was in the early years of Dwight D. Eisenhower's first term.
Last night's results will leave the Senate, and potentially the House, in control of an entirely new lineup of committee chairman who will have the power to decide what legislation reaches the floor. The elections also immediately raised the stakes on the Republicans' battle for the 1996 Presidential nomination.
In one of the most stunning upsets of the evening, Mr. Rostenkowski, who faces 17 counts of fraud and other improprieties, was defeated by Michael Patrick Flanagan, a little-known 31-year-old lawyer in Chicago.
In another significant upset, George W. Bush, the former President's son and part owner of the Texas Rangers, defeated Ms. Richards. It was a particularly welcome victory for the Bush family, for it was Ms. Richards who ridiculed the elder Bush at her party's 1988 national convention as being "born with a silver foot in his mouth."
Another Bush son was not as successful. Though the race was close, Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida defeated an aggressive challenge from Jeb Bush. Mr. Chiles was the only Democrat incumbent governor from a major state who won re-election.
But mostly, as the polls closed from East to West last night, there was predominantly bad news for the Democrats.
The Democrats suffered a triple blow in Tennessee, losing both Senate seats to political newcomers as well as the governor's office. Fred D. Thompson, a lawyer, lobbyist and sometime movie actor defeated Representative Jim Cooper, a six-term House member who drew national attention for proposing a moderate alternative to Mr. Clinton's health care program. He won the seat that was once held by Vice President Al Gore, whose intense campaigning in Tennessee proved of no effect.
Many Democrats were more surprised that Senator Sasser, a three-term veteran and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee who was in line to become majority leader, could not beat back a challenge from William Frist, a millionaire heart surgeon.
While White House officials insisted that the elections were not a referendum on Mr. Clinton or his policies, many of the victorious Republicans had campaigned aggressively against the President, and espoused far more conservative views.
It was a despondent night for Democrats, as a parade of White House officials, rather than giving grudging congratulations to the Republicans, challenged them to be more constructive than they have been in Congress this year.
"This was not a vote against the lower deficit, lower Federal spending and smaller Federal bureaucracy as provided in the Clinton economic plan. The mission remains the same," said the President's senior adviser, George Stephanopoulos. "I think there's no question that in the front of voters' minds is making sure the system works again."
Mr. Stephanopoulos said the White House would work with leaders in both parties "in a nonpartisan way" to pass a legislative program. But he declined to say how, and on what issues.
The reversal of fortunes for the Republicans was stunning, coming only two years after the party lost the White House. The sudden shift in power and in the mood of the party was dramatized in Pennsylvania, where Representative Rick Santorum defeated Mr. Wofford. Only two years ago, Mr. Wofford's upset election, in which he made health care a centerpiece of his campaign, put that issue on the legislative map and was widely taken as a signal of the Democrats' power.
In Ohio, Lieut. Gov. Michael DeWine became the state's first Republican Senator in nearly two decades, defeating Joel Hyatt, who owns a chain of legal service stores.
In Michigan, Spencer Abraham, a former Republican state party chairman, defeated Representative Bob Carr, a nine-term House veteran, for the seat of retiring Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr.
In Oklahoma, Representative James M. Inhofe, a Republican, defeated Representative Dave McCurdy in a bitter contest for the seat of Senator David L. Boren, who resigned two years before his term expired.
In Maine, Representative Olympia Snowe, a Republican, defeated Representative Thomas Andrews, a Democrat, for the seat vacated by Senator George J. Mitchell, the Democratic leader.
And in Delaware, Senator William V. Roth Jr., a Republican, beat back an aggressive challenge from the state's Attorney General, Charles Oberly. Mr. Oberly had been one of his party's best hopes for winning a Republican seat.
Republicans also held on to the seat in Missouri of retiring Senator John C. Danforth. Former Gov. John Ashcroft easily defeated Representative Alan Wheat.
Though discouraged by the parade of defeats, Democrats were exuberant over Mr. Robb's re-election. The Senator, ebullient before a spirited crowd last night, compared his comeback to George Foreman's 10th round knockout on Saturday night, giving him the heavyweight title back after 20 years. "George Foreman is indeed an inspiration," he declared.
Moments later, at his Richmond headquarters, Mr. North thanked his supporters. "You have successfully redefined political debate in this land," he said. "We will elect candidates of principle who deem the next generation as more important than the next election."
Two incumbent Democratic Senators who never appeared in danger, Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Lieberman, kept their seats. Mr. Moynihan was opposed by Bernadette Castro, a former sofa bed company executive, and Mr. Lieberman was challenged by a former state senator, Gerald Labriola.
Another Democrat, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, won a seventh term, easily defeating his long-shot Republican challenger, Stan Klos, who is in the real estate business. Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland beat back a challenge from William Brock, a former Republican Senator from Tennessee.
Several Republican Senators who had seemed secure throughout the campaign easily beat back their challengers. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the senior Republican on the Agriculture Committee, defeated former Representative Jim Jontz. Others Republicans who easily won re-election were Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas and Trent Lott of Mississippi.
In Florida, Senator Connie Mack of Florida defeated Hugh Rodham, the brother of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was making his first bid for public office.
Two incumbent Republican Governors, William F. Weld of Massachusetts and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, coasted to easy victories.
Haley Barbour, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, called it a great day for his party and sought to make the returns a referendum on the President. "What the American people did tonight is they rejected President Clinton's policies," he said.
One bad sign for Democrats for the future is that their voters tended to be much older than the voters who cast their ballots for Republicans.
The preliminary results of a nationwide poll of voters as they left polling places showed that voters over 50 were slightly more likely to have voted for Democratic candidates. But voters aged 25 to 40 were much more likely to have cast their ballots for Republicans.
The poll found that about a third of the respondents said their votes for House candidates had nothing to do with their views of President Clinton. Of the remainder, slightly more said their opposition to Mr. Clinton affected their vote yesterday than those who said their support for him was a factor in their vote.
Given the throw-the-bums-out climate that pervaded the election campaigns, voters said by a majority of more than 2 to 1 that they preferred an experienced candidate to a new face, and a clear majority said they preferred having Congress and the Presidency controlled by the same party.
Protestants and Catholics alike were more likely to have voted Republican than Democratic. Jews voted heavily Democratic as did respondents who said they were not particularly religious.
In the poll, 2,600 voters were questioned at selected precincts in every state.

HEADLINE: THE 1994 ELECTIONS: THE OVERVIEW;
New York Voters End a Democratic Era

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
George Elmer Pataki, a lanky lawyer-legislator from the Hudson Valley who has promised to slash income taxes and restore the death penalty, was elected the 53d Governor of New York yesterday, ending 20 years of Democratic rule in Albany and toppling Mario M. Cuomo, a legendary figure in state and national politics.
In other New York races, H. Carl McCall became the first black New Yorker to win statewide elected office, defeating Herbert London in the race for state comptroller. Mr. McCall, a former State Senator, investment banker and president of the New York City Board of Education, was appointed Comptroller by the Legislature last year to fill a vacancy left by the midterm retirement of Edward V. Regan. 
 In the race for attorney general, the Republican, Dennis C. Vacco, a former United States Attorney from Buffalo, won a narrow victory over Karen S. Burstein, a former Family Court judge in Brooklyn.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, easily dispatched his Republican opponent, Bernadette Castro, to win a fourth term. But he lost the chairmanship of the Finance Committee to Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon when the Senate went Republican.
Mr. Pataki, a 49-year-old State Senator, won by drawing a strong turnout in upstate New York counties where Republicans traditionally fare well, by taking narrow majorities in the suburbs surrounding New York City, by winning Staten Island and by faring well in Erie County.
B. Thomas Golisano, a millionaire businessman from Rochester who was the gubernatorial candidate of the Independence Fusion Party, proved less of a factor than some had anticipated in siphoning anti-Cuomo votes from Mr. Pataki.
With 97 percent of the precincts reporting, the results were:
Pataki . . . 2,405,631 (49%)
Cuomo . . . 2,223,567 (45%)
Golisano . . . 196,327 (4%)
Mr. Pataki's election represents a political triumph for his patron, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, and a potentially devastating defeat for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who alienated the state's Republican leadership by crossing party lines to endorse Mr. Cuomo.
About 12:30 this morning, the Governor-elect, calling himself "a mailman's kid from Peekskill," declared victory in a ballroom at the New York Hilton and asserted that New Yorkers had voted for change. "If there's one thing this campaign has stood for day in and day out," he said, "it's about again restoring people's confidence in the future of this state, again restoring their belief that the best of this state is ahead of us."
And in an impish nod to Mr. D'Amato, whose relationship with the candidate was mocked in Cuomo television commercials, Mr. Pataki said, "Let me just say, you can call me, Al."
Earlier, Mr. Cuomo had appeared at the Sheraton New York to congratulate Mr. Pataki, whom he said he had been unable to reach by telephone. Removing his eyeglasses and speaking with a strong voice that occasionally cracked with emotion, the Governor thanked his aides and supporters and said: "I'm sorry to have let you down because you deserved another four years."
He added: "I've surely made mistakes as Governor, but I'm as proud as I can be of what we have accomplished together. I'm absolutely convinced that there's an enormous amount more that we can do."
As Mr. Cuomo left the stage, the first person to embrace him was former Mayor David N. Dinkins, who had to give a similar concession speech a year ago.
Republicans cast Mr. Pataki's election as a revolution in the state's politics that mirrored national results on a dismal day for Democrats. But a survey of voters leaving the polls showed that Mr. Pataki won on the strength of the public's weariness with Mr. Cuomo rather than on enthusiastic support for the Republican or his policies.
The poll showed that fewer than half of Mr. Pataki's voters said they were voting for him, while more than half said they were voting against Mr. Cuomo. The Governor retained only 6 in 10 of the voters who supported him in 1990, when he faced lackluster opposition.
As such, the results suggested something far less than a mandate, particularly given that polls at the end showed that most New Yorkers had little sense of Mr. Pataki as they drew the curtains in their voting booths. Instead, the election seemed to reflect the anger and frustration of a surly electorate that felt increasingly squeezed by taxes, intimidated by the randomness of crime, and perhaps tired of Mr. Cuomo's combative and pedantic style.
The poll of voters showed a substantial difference by sexes, with Mr. Pataki winning 6 in 10 of the men and fewer than half of the women. Mr. Pataki was favored by 6 in 10 of the white voters, fewer than one-tenth of the black voters and about one-sixth of the Hispanic voters.
Two of Mr. Cuomo's top strategists, Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal Party leader, and David Garth, the media consultant, said in interviews that Mr. Giuliani's endorsement of Mr. Cuomo had allowed Mr. Pataki to play on upstate-downstate divisions, which may have stimulated the large turnout upstate.
Mr. Pataki has served for one term as a member of the State Senate's Republican majority and eight years in the Assembly minority. His record in the Legislature is unremarkable except for his decision to break ranks with his Republican colleagues in the Senate to vote against tax increases, a move widely regarded as a calculated precursor to his gubernatorial candidacy.
The Governor-elect's only executive experience came as the two-term Mayor of Peekskill, a city of 20,000 in northern Westchester County, where Mr. Pataki grew up on a family farm. Mr. Pataki now lives in nearby Garrison, in Putnam County. He will be the first Governor from outside New York City, and the first Republican since Gov. Malcolm Wilson left office in 1974.
For the 62-year-old Mr. Cuomo, the loss caps a public career that includes almost two decades in Albany, as Secretary of State and Lieutenant Governor under Gov. Hugh L. Carey, and then as Governor.
While he remained the darling of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party nationally, his popularity at home began to plummet in his third term, when a deep recession led to a loss of more than 500,000 jobs in New York. As budget gaps widened, Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature raised taxes and cut the state work force.
The Governor argued during the campaign that the state's economy was turning around, largely because of his handling of the recession, and that a Republican administration would undercut the state's commitment to the poor. But the voters yesterday showed that they had little patience left for Mr. Cuomo and that they preferred the uncertainty of change to the certainty of a fourth Cuomo term.
While there will be fresh blood in the Executive Mansion, where Mr. Pataki will live with his wife, Libby, and their four children, the new Governor will arrive in Albany to face the same divided Legislature that so often frustrated Mr. Cuomo. With only a few alterations, the Democrats retained their overwhelming majority in the Assembly and the Republicans maintained control of the Senate, insuring the continuation of a long history of polarization along partisan and geographic lines.
One notable exception may be the death penalty. Under Mr. Carey and then Mr. Cuomo, death-penalty measures have been vetoed every year since 1977, and the Legislature never succeeded in overriding their vetoes. Mr. Pataki has promised to sign death-penalty legislation early in his term, a move that would restore it as the ultimate punishment for murder in the first degree for the first time since 1965. New York, which last electrocuted a convict in 1963, is one of 14 states without the death penalty.
Mr. Pataki has also proposed to cut the income tax rates by 25 percent over the four years of his term, a reduction of $5.6 billion in a general fund budget that totaled $34 billion this year. Mr. Cuomo and other Democrats ridiculed Mr. Pataki's plan throughout the campaign, charging that it would require huge cuts in state programs and aid to local governments and would force steep increases in property taxes.
Mr. Pataki was little known statewide when Senator D'Amato anointed Mr. Pataki as the candidate of the Republican hierarchy. The Senator helped him raise enough money to outspend Mr. Cuomo and contributed many of his top political aides to the Pataki campaign. The Governor tried to make Mr. D'Amato's role a major liability for Mr. Pataki, and Mr. Pataki's ability to overcome it should bolster Mr. D'Amato's influence in the Republican Party both in New York and nationally.
