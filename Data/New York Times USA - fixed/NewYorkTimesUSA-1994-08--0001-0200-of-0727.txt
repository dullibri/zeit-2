HEADLINE: G.E. Succeeded With Hungary Venture

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"G.E. Finds Tough Going in Hungary" (Business Day, July 25), which describes the birth pains when General Electric bought Tungsram, Hungary's largest industrial company, in 1989 after the Iron Curtain fell, does not reflect today's Tungsram. 
 Certainly, there were problems in teaching basic concepts of accounting, marketing, sales and profitability to employees who had known only a planned Communist economy. Every American company that invested in a former Eastern Bloc country faced the same issues.
Today Tungsram is one of the great success stories of Eastern Europe. Its employees have developed dozens of leading-edge lighting products for world markets; its market share has increased; it's profitable and it's hiring production workers for the first time in five years. Your article should have been titled "Success Story in Hungary."

HEADLINE: U.N. AUTHORIZES INVASION OF HAITI TO BE LED BY U.S.

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 31

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council voted today to authorize a United States invasion and occupation of Haiti if sanctions fail to remove its military Government.
The approval, by a vote of 12 to 0 with abstentions from China and Brazil, and with Rwanda absent, opens the way for American forces, now stationed just north of Haiti, to move in to restore democracy there. 
 In Washington, officials said a decision on whether to use force is still weeks away. [Page A6.]
The resolution authorizing the United States action contains no date or deadline for carrying out any such invasion, unlike the resolution adopted before the United States-led action that drove Iraq's invasion forces out of Kuwait.
The United States' chief delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, hailed the vote and said that it helps "lay the diplomatic groundwork" to give President Clinton a choice of options for dealing with Haiti that is wider than just the choice of an invasion.
She added that the vote sent a signal to the members of the military junta in Haiti that "you can depart voluntarily and soon, or you can depart involuntarily and soon."
During the three-hour meeting of the Security Council, representatives of Brazil, China, Mexico, Uruguay and Cuba expressed reservations about any military operation in Haiti, which would be the first invasion in the Western Hemisphere that would have United Nations support.
Brazil and China abstained from voting, with the delegate from Beijing, Li Zhaoxing, stating that his country considered that the resolution set "a dangerous precedent." The other countries that objected, whose representatives spoke at the meeting with permission of the Security Council, are not currently members of the Council. In addition to Brazil and the United States, Argentina -- which supported the measure -- is the only Western Hemisphere country now on the Council.
Speakers from Britain and Argentina cited accounts of terrorism and human rights violations in Haiti, saying that it was the right and duty of the United Nations to stop them. Hundreds of people were killed in Haiti in the aftermath of the overthrow of the elected Government on Sept. 30, 1991.
The delegate from Spain, Juan Antonio Yanez-Barnuevo, said the world "could not close its eyes to the horrors" in Haiti.
The resolution would divide an invasion and occupation operation into two stages. In the first, a multinational force led by the United States of as many as 15,000 members would invade Haiti, disarm its armed forces, unseat its military junta, take control of the country and start training a new Haitian army and police force.
The United States supports the restoration of the democratically elected president of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted in the 1991 coup and went into exile.
The first phase would be roughly patterned after the Persian Gulf war operation, with the United States in command of what might be an international force, although it is not clear what other countries would contribute troops or how much the operation might cost.
After the vote, Ms. Albright said the United States had obtained commitments from other countries to join the first phase of any operation, although she declined to name those nations.
 
Participants Pay
 The resolution says that "the cost of implementing this temporary operation will be borne by the participating states," language that had been omitted from the first draft. Money is a delicate issue in the United Nations, which is strapped for cash largely because of its many peacekeeping operations.
The United States already has 2,400 troops and 14 warships near the Turks and Caicos Islands, just north of Haiti.
In the second phase, a smaller force of perhaps 6,000 militia and police reporting to the United Nations would take over and would work to bring about political stability while giving further training to the new army and police force.
The United States views the dissolution of the present Haitian Army and its reconstitution as one of the most important elements in restructuring the country, and some supporters of the resolution contend that this objective could be achieved only through an invasion and occupation.
A United Nations observer force of as many as 60 members would accompany an invasion force "to carry out the monitoring of the operations of the multinational force" and to prepare for the arrival of the participants in the second stage.
The resolution states that any invasion force will terminate its mission "when a secure and stable environment has been established."
 
Latin Hesitation
 A letter sent by Mr. Aristide to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali helped clear the way for passage of the resolution. In the letter, Mr. Aristide called for the international community "to take swift and determined action," but he did not specifically address the issue of a possible invasion.
While the letter reiterated Mr. Aristide's pleas for help it also placated some United Nations members who were uncomfortable with the idea of yet another invasion in Latin America or the Caribbean.
Argentina and Venezuela insisted on the letter, in which Mr. Aristide cited what he considered to be the compelling and unique political and circumstances affecting Haiti that required United Nations help.
The resolution that was adopted by the Security Council said that "the goal of the international community remains the restoration of democracy in Haiti and the prompt return of the legitimately elected President." It added that "the situation in Haiti continues to constitute a threat to the peace and security in the region."
The military rulers in Haiti have come under heavy economic and political sanctions. The sanctions have increased since the junta blocked the arrival in Haiti earlier this year of a United Nations mission.
A year ago on Governors Island in New York, both President Aristide and the leader of the military, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, signed an accord brokered by the United Nations that would have restored Mr. Aristide to power. It stipulated that his return was to take place by Oct. 30, but General Cedras reneged on the agreement and remained in power. During the resulting impasse, thousands of Haitians fled the country, many to the United States.
 
'We Want Them Out'
 After today's vote, Haiti's delegate to the United Nations, Fritz Longchamp, who represents the Aristide Government, said that he was "disappointed that it has taken so long to act."
"We are not looking for a military operation, but we want them out," he said, referring to the military rulers.
Jamsheed Marker of Pakistan, the Security Council president for July, said the resolution -- which went through many drafts -- was "very carefully written" and that there had been "immense difficulties" in putting together the final version.
In the end, the Clinton Administration got what it said it wanted: international approval to mount a coalition operation against the junta and then turn control over to the United Nations. The goal of relinquishing control might yet be a problem; some diplomats here pointed to the enormous difficulties that resulted a year ago in Somalia during the switch from United States to United Nations command.

HEADLINE: U.S. Move on Haiti May Be Weeks Away

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
Despite the Security Council's authorization of an invasion to oust Haiti's military rulers, a decision on American military action there is still weeks away, Administration officials said today.
The White House hopes that United Nations endorsement of the use of force will give credibility to the months of American threats, which Haitian military leaders have appeared to belittle. Some American officials say a combination of tighter economic sanctions and a strong show of international resolve may still force the leaders to quit. 
 The White House chief of staff, Leon Panetta, warned Haiti's military rulers today that they must leave soon to avoid a United Nations-sanctioned invasion. "I think that it is sufficient to say 'soon,' " Mr. Panetta said on CNN's "Late Edition." "And they better get that signal: soon."
But American intelligence analysts here and in Haiti predict that the Haitian military will defy Washington right to the end.
Before President Clinton would order any invasion -- which his advisers say he is trying to avoid -- the Administration would still need to muster support in Congress, among allies in the Caribbean and with the American public. Opposition to an invasion is running high in all three groups.
With the flow of Haitian boat people dwindling to a trickle, there are no immediate reasons to push Haiti to the crowded front burner of national security and domestic issues, at least for the moment, Administration officials say.
The United States is increasing its military involvement in the relief operation in and around Rwanda and is preparing for stiffer measures against the Bosnian Serbs, who have rejected an American-backed peace plan in the Balkans.
On the domestic front, the Administration faces important votes in the House and Senate on health-care legislation in the next two weeks.
"Wait and see what happens in Rwanda," said a senior military planner. "If that situation settles down in the next couple of weeks, the focus could turn back to Haiti."
Senior Administration officials have said a decision on using force in Haiti could wait until late August at least, barring some unforeseen provocation, like harassment of the 3,000 Americans in Haiti, widespread attacks on Haitian civilians or a new surge of refugees taking to the seas.
Meanwhile, Administration officials are still lining up support among countries in the Caribbean and elsewhere for a force that would follow the initial troops, mainly Americans, into Haiti after the military rulers step down voluntarily or are forced out. The first force would restore order in the country and reinstall the exiled Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The second force would help maintain security after the Americans leave.
United States naval forces finished four days of war exercises near Puerto Rico on Saturday and steamed toward Haiti to resume patrols off the coast.

HEADLINE: A Suburban Eden Where the Right Rules

SERIES: New South And Old: Second of four articles.

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MARIETTA, Ga.

 BODY:
It is a long way culturally and politically from Roslyn, L.I., to conservative Cobb County. But Mitchell Kaye, who two years ago became the first Jewish Republican in Georgia history ever elected to the State Legislature, seems to have made the transition.
"Every year they release two liberal Democrats in the wild here so they don't become an endangered species," said Mr. Kaye, a 36-year-old, first-term State Representative who grew up on Long Island and moved to Georgia after going to college in Florida. "If Bill Clinton came into the district, he probably would not see the light of day again." 
 The South of myth and fable still lives in Carolina mill towns, where the kudzu snakes over crumbling bricks. It lives on in the juke joints and the shotgun shacks of the Mississippi Delta. But to really understand the South today, it makes sense to visit Cobb County, a suburban Atlanta sprawl of glistening new malls, shady green subdivisions, lush golf courses and Chevrolet Suburbans bearing Christian fish symbols and "Rush Is Right" bumper stickers.
Rather than being precisely typical, Cobb is the booming suburban South in bold caricature. It is at the heart of the Republican surge in the South, a party that went from holding about 10 percent of the South's 106 seats in the House of Representatives in 1964 to about 38 percent of its 125 seats now. Not just prosperous, Cobb has been one of America's growth leaders for a quarter century, surging to more than 500,000 people today from 196,793 in 1970, according to the Census Bureau.
Not merely conservative, it was represented in Congress by the former head of the John Birch Society, Larry McDonald, until his death in 1983. It continues to make national news because of a resolution passed by the county commission condemning "the gay life style" as incompatible with community standards. The resolution set off a furor that on Friday led Atlanta Olympics organizers to pull Olympic volleyball out of the county.
Newt Gingrich, who represents 70 percent of the county in Congress, is not just one of the growing cadre of Southern Republicans who are accounting for much of the party's growth, he is in line to be the next House minority leader and, should the party gain control of the House, perhaps the first Republican Speaker since Joseph W. Martin Jr. of Massachusetts in 1955.
The phrase New South, vaguely denoting a reasonably tolerant place where people wear shoes and don't support segregation, has become enough of an empty cliche that the novelist Walker Percy once groused, "My definition of a new South would be a South in which it never occurred to anybody to mention the New South."
Cobb is not what the South was, but it isn't the idealized New South either. It's the South of the easy-listening saxophonist Kenny G, not the gritty wails of Hank Williams; of the pugnacious sound bites of Newt Gingrich, not the peanut country drawl of Jimmy Carter; of white wine, not bourbon and branch water; of tidy air-conditioned suburban churches, not hard-shell backwoods ones. Oddly, it's a new suburban South where blacks and whites don't have the proximity to one another that defined the South even during segregation.
It's the fastest growing part of America, and what goes on there says as much about the nation as it does about the South.
 
The Good Life
'Great Place To Raise Kids'
 As he watches the East Side All-Stars go through their paces under the tutelage of a small army of Little League dads, David Smith sounds like an advertisement for the Southern good life.
"I came here in 1973," Mr. Smith said, sitting in the metal bleachers at Fuller's Park, watching his 9-year-old son, Quincy, play on a manicured diamond. "I had a friend who said: 'You've got to come down here. If you don't like it, I'll pay your way back.' It was paradise. It was vibrant, growing. Detroit was stagnant. You can travel around the whole world and not find a better place to live than this."
In a county that doubled in population in the 1980's, that is a familiar refrain.
It was echoed by Steve Delaney, a lawyer. "When my father came to visit me from New York when I was in law school in Atlanta in 1978," Mr. Delaney recalled, "he said: 'Stay here. This is the next New York.' What he meant was the old New York, the New York of the 40's, a great place to live and raise kids. He was right. Being here, I feel I've died and gone to heaven."
 
Friendliness and Manners
 Barbara Wolfe, a 36-year-old mother of two, was so appalled by the anti-gay resolution that she joined the Cobb Citizens Coalition, a group organized to oppose it. But when she talks about life in Cobb County, she has mostly good things to say. She loves the hills and trees, the friendliness of the people, the good schools, the affordability of housing, even to a point the Sunday-school manners and well-scrubbed sensibilities.
"I like that people are more down to earth, more polite, that you don't have to walk around screaming and yelling and being rude -- you know, the whole New York thing," said Mrs. Wolfe, a native New Yorker who formerly lived in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. "It seems crazy listening to myself say this, but sometimes I think that there are a lot of the characteristics that come from some of this fundamentalist religious stuff that I hate that also cause it to be so pleasant here. If they didn't make it political it might be perfect. But it's not."
Median household income in Cobb, which is about 90 percent white, is $41,297, compared with a national average of $30,056. Two-thirds of the housing units are single-family homes, and the rest are apartments and condominiums. There are plenty of high-end $300,000 and $400,000 houses. But most houses range from $70,000, which brings an older three-bedroom ranch house in the blue-collar towns of south and west Cobb, to $225,000, which can buy a new two-story four-bedroom house, in the more affluent areas of East Cobb.
More than 72 percent of the work force is in white-collar jobs, most of them in expanding areas of the economy like insurance, electronics and computers, and trade. The largest employer is Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company, a division of the Lockheed Corporation, which depending on its contracts employs about 12,000 people and is designing the Air Force's F-22 advanced tactical fighter while also producing two other military aircraft.
In a region that has been in the forefront of attracting foreign investment, Cobb has drawn a considerable share of it; 200 international companies have set up operations here in the past decade.
In a nation worried about crime and the economy, Cobb and places like it offer -- particularly to whites -- a sense of prosperity and safety, conservative Southern values and a relaxed, friendly way of life.
 
'Norman Rockwell World'
 "These people want safety, and they believe big cities have failed and are controlled by people who are incapable of delivering goods and services," said Mr. Gingrich, who narrowly survived the Republican primary two years ago when he first ran in Cobb after Georgia legislators redistricted the state. He easily won the party primary this month and is heavily favored to be re-elected.
"What they find here," Mr. Gingrich added, "is a sort of Norman Rockwell world with fiber optic computers and jet airplanes. But the values that would have been The Saturday Evening Post of the mid-50's are the values of most of these people now."
Mr. Gingrich talks up Cobb's work ethic and entrepreneurial values, but the anti-government conservatives in Cobb have done extraordinarily well with the Federal Government.
A 1993 study in Common Cause Magazine found that Cobb took in $3.4 billion in Federal money in 1992. Only two suburban counties in the nation, Arlington, Va., outside Washington, and Brevard County, Fla., home of the Kennedy Space Center, took in more.
Still, if a skeptical eye is going to be cast on Cobb, it is likely to come from the outside.
"The only liberal voices we've got in Cobb County," Ric Cross, a computer operator, said as he drank coffee recently at a local Waffle House, "are in the early editions of The Atlanta Journal and Constitution."
 
Intolerance
Serious Instances Of Inhospitality
 Beneath the suburban idyll is a more troubling history.
It was a group of citizens from Marietta, the county seat, who in 1915 abducted from a state prison and lynched Leo Frank, the Jewish factory owner wrongly convicted of a 1913 murder in what became one of the most infamous instances of anti-Semitism in Southern history.
With integration that began in the 1960's, Cobb became the favored destination for whites fleeing Atlanta. Linked by Interstate 75, Cobb was an easily accessible suburb about 20 miles from downtown Atlanta and a place with a history of inhospitality toward blacks.
"They love that river down there," Joe Mack Wilson, a State Representative who later became the Mayor of Marietta, said in 1975 of the Chattahoochee River, which separates Cobb County from Atlanta, now 70 percent black. "They want to keep it as a moat. They wish they could build forts across there to keep people from coming up here."
Marietta had trolley service to Atlanta as far back as 1905, but in recent years has repeatedly refused to join the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority and re-establish a rail link. Mr. Wilson said it would take a "complete breakdown" of public transportation in Cobb before the county's whites would increase ties to Atlanta. A former Cobb Commissioner, Emmett Burton, said he "would stock the Chattahoochee with piranha" to keep rapid transit out.
Blacks make up a slim fraction of Cobb's population, and those who have been attracted to the area, Mr. Gingrich said, "don't want to be black in the unity convention, N.A.A.C.P. sense."
"They want to be Americans, integrated, assimilated, living in neighborhoods that are safe," he said.
But when asked what Cobb should do to foster that integration and assimilation, particularly for the black poor, Mr. Gingrich raises the specter of crime and collapsing schools brought on by people "with no middle class values." Instead of opening up places like Cobb to the black poor, "what makes sense is to replace the culture of poverty," he said.
Many blacks in Cobb say the pluses of the suburban life style are countered by a sense of not quite fitting in. Joe Shifalo, executive director of Metro Fair Housing, which monitors housing discrimination in the Atlanta area, said two-thirds of blacks seeking housing in the county received different information and got different treatment than white applicants.
"If it was still legal to pass a referendum against black folks, Cobb County might do it," Mr. Shifalo said.
Over the years Cobb has attracted a striking number of figures from the fringes of the right -- people like Ed Fields, one of the nation's most active white supremacists and anti-Semites who disseminates his views in a newspaper he publishes, "The Truth at Last," or J. B. Stoner, a convicted church bomber and former Ku Klux Klansman.
Next to the friendly little Shanty House restaurant in the little town of Kennesaw, at the northern end of the county, sits Dent Myers's Civil War curios shop, where the wares includes Klan and white-power T-shirts, hate-group literature and bumper stickers reading: "Fight Crime. Deport Niggers."
A recent report by an Atlanta organization, Neighbors Network, which studies extremist groups, said that the homosexual resolution was largely driven by groups at the fringe of the Christian right. John Greaves, a gay resident who became a spokesman for opponents of the county, left Cobb after living there for four years, he said, because of harassment and threatening phone calls.
"We got a lot of calls of support," said Mr. Greaves, a 36-year-old credit analyst, "but we also had people call and say things like, 'I'm going to drag you outside and slit your throat and watch your queer blood run in the street.'
"You can't live that way. I got exhausted by it."
No one thinks that religious or racial extremists make up more than a tiny percentage of the population of Cobb County, and many people are quick to rebut the notion that there is something odious in anyone, white or black, wanting to flee crime and poverty.
"I find that criticism to be almost amusing," said Whit Ayers, a Republican poll taker and political consultant. "Somehow you are criticizing someone for not wanting to have their kids' lunch money extorted in their school. Somehow they're selfish because they don't want to be mugged when they go out for a walk with their dog."
 
Upset by Bigotry
 Many residents, perhaps most of them, are horrified by the political uproar over the anti-gay resolution and the notion that Cobb is a hotbed of intolerant zealots.
"I've been involved in this community for over 20 years and found it to be a very loving, wonderful place to live, and I'm just startled by this," Tucker McQueen said. Her daughter Kate spoke out against the resolution in her speech as the valedictorian of Marietta High School this year. "It makes us look like a bunch of bigoted jackasses," Mrs. McQueen said. "It just startles me, and it upsets me tremendously."
Mr. Greaves said the problem was that in a political spectrum that ranges from center right to extremist right, those at the fringe could play a disproportionate role in political life.
"Cobb County is like a boat where all the people have run to the right side," he said. "You get enough people on the right side, eventually the boat just tips over."
 
The Suburban Outlook
Conservative Life, Conservative Soul
 Cobb's growth has parallels in Western and Rocky Mountain states, which have also benefited from people seeking simpler values and an easier life. Cobb is in some ways less Southern than it is purely suburban, with politics not much different from that of Orange County, Calif., which also has an aerospace economy and conservative politics.
The difference is that rather than a right-wing node, Cobb reflects the conservative heart of a conservative region, like a fragrance distilled through an alembic.
Mr. Gingrich is not the only one to argue that Cobb represents a fundamental divide in American life between the values that dominate the media and the cultural capitals like New York and Los Angeles and the broader values that for now seem to be driving politics and demography. He and others say the media, by viewing the South almost solely through the prism of the civil rights era, miss more of it than they capture.
"An awful lot of reporters were civil rights Southerners," Mr. Gingrich said. "How much they hated segregation and how much they had a disdain for the Old South blocks them from seeing the new. They refuse to try to walk in the shoes of the people who created a Cobb County. They're more willing to try to understand Indians in India than they are to understand Americans outside their own prejudices."
Many people in Cobb think the uproar caused by the anti-gay resolution has been such an embarrassment that it will help bring the county back more toward the political center.
"This is not Christianity that I know, that I've been raised to believe in," Mrs. McQueen said, "and I think there is a silent majority that knows it."
It's a sentiment that mirrors the worries of national Republican strategists that divisive social issues like the ones that have played out here have the potential to cut the party in two and turn off precisely the kind of corporate conservatives who are flocking to places like Cobb.
But it is not at all clear that Cobb's excesses are as repugnant to its residents -- even the moderate ones -- as they are to some outsiders. And there is nothing on the horizon to indicate that the growth of the South's Cobb Counties is likely to slow anytime soon.
"This is a trend," Mr. Ayers said, "that has a long way to run."
Next: Selma, Ala., where racial divisions and poverty live on three decades after it became a battleground of the civil rights era.

HEADLINE: Dollar Plunges, Then Steadies Against Yen

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Aug. 1

 BODY:
The failure of the United States and Japan to resolve a longstanding trade dispute sent a jolt of disappointment through the foreign exchange market today, putting the dollar into a temporary freefall against the yen and dashing any optimism that its long slide would end soon.
After a plunge as the market opened, the dollar leveled off at 98.55 yen in early trading here then rose slightly to 98.78 yen, well below the rate in New York late Friday of 100.1 yen but still a way from its historic low of 96.60 yen. An earlier decline had put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as a means of bolstering the dollar, pressure that may be renewed once again. 
 But there were signs that the failure of the talks did not mark a complete breakdown in the increasingly strained relations between two of the world's greatest trading powers. Japan's Foreign Ministry had said two weeks ago that the Government would consider retaliating for any American move toward sanctions by formally cutting off further talks.
This morning a senior Foreign Ministry official here said that the Government had decided not to move toward such a breach.
"We are not exercising our right to break things off," the official said, who spoke on condition that he not be further identified. "We'll take some time for reflection, and then will have some informal talks later."
He added a warning, though, apparently with the reaction of the markets in mind. "Perhaps they would do well not to just kick out the chair and leave the table," the official said, referring to the American negotiators.
Kozo Igarashi, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, said today that if the United States did eventually enact sanctions, Japan would retaliate by cutting off any further talks on the government procurement issue or other trade topics.
Yukuo Takahashi, the chief foreign exchange trader here for Chemical Bank, said the currency market activity was relatively light and that the dollar had suffered the losses in one brief plunge in the day's early hours.
The bad news, he added, was that the breakdown of the trade talks, which took place in Washington over the weekend, had pushed most of the optimists who had purchased dollars last week out of the market, at least for the time being.
"The majority feel now that we're going to see further declines" in the dollar's value, Mr. Takahashi said.
Jorn Simonson, a trader with the Chase Manhattan Bank, observed: "The only thing people had been looking for was something on trade. The feeling was about 50/50 on the talks. When it didn't come out people were all ready to sell. But we may level off here for a while."
The United States has fought with Japan for more than a year on opening five Japanese markets: autos, auto parts, insurance, and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment.
The Clinton Administration had twice postponed a deadline on concluding the talks on government procurement of telecommunications and medical gear, but insisted it would stand by the latest date, July 31.
Japan's overall trade surplus and its surplus with the United States have been running at record levels for the last two years -- a key reason that the dollar has been sinking. The soaring value of the yen has put enormous pressure on Japanese manufacturers, whose products are now far more expensive for foreign buyers.
The pressure has also slowed the Japanese economy and taken a big bite out of corporate profits, but it has not been enough pressure to force the Government to agree to Washington's terms -- a guarantee of increased purchases of foreign telecommunications and medical equipment by government entities.
"At this point, I'm not really optimistic, but we still have hope," the Foreign Ministry official said.

HEADLINE: Report Expresses Concern on Pentagon Budget

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
Congressional investigators and some senior military planners are expressing growing concern that the Pentagon cannot afford its ambitious long-term strategy of being prepared to fight two regional wars at the same time.
The General Accounting Office says in a report to be issued on Monday that the Defense Department may have overstated savings and underestimated costs by more than $150 billion in its $1.2 trillion budget for 1995 to 1999. 
 That figure is substantially higher than the estimate figured by the Senate Armed Services Committee in June. Figuring the gap at $60 billion, the panel declared itself "seriously concerned" that the Pentagon would be unable to finance the strategy.
Defense Secretary William J. Perry has repeatedly assured Congress that the Pentagon can deliver on its plan. The Pentagon said last December that the deficit was about $50 billion over five years. That gap shrank to $11 billion to $20 billion after more optimistic inflation estimates were calculated and after President Clinton agreed to give the armed forces more money to offset a decision by Congress to increase military salaries.
 
Estimates on Overruns
 In their defense, Pentagon officials also cite a March report by the Congressional Budget Office, a frequent critic of the Defense Department, calling the Pentagon's budget sufficient to pay for the military's future force structure. The budget office, however, said the Pentagon might have underestimated potential cost overruns on new weapons and overstated expected savings from closing military installations.
Since last year, when Les Aspin, then Defense Secretary, unveiled the Pentagon's long-range war-fighting strategy and the budget to pay for it, the Defense Department's plan has fallen under two main criticisms.
Some lawmakers and senior officers say that the number of troops, tanks, ships and aircraft in the plan is not adequate to carry out the two-war scenario. Even if they were, the critics complain, the Pentagon cannot afford the force it wants with the budget it has.
The analysis by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said that in addition to whatever inflation costs were counted, the Pentagon might have overestimated $32 billion in savings from closing bases and more efficient business practices. The report also says the Pentagon understated as much as $112 billion in extra costs associated with new weapons systems, military pay increases, environmental cleanup and peacekeeping operations.
Senior Pentagon officials expressed amazement at the accounting office's findings, with a senior Defense Department official calling the analysis "superficial and transparent."
The accounting office's analysis was requested by Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican; Senator William V. Roth Jr., a Delaware Republican; Representative John Conyers Jr., a Michigan Democrat, and Representative John R. Kasich, an Ohio Republican. All four lawmakers are longtime critics of Pentagon spending.

HEADLINE: Bosnians Urge Tougher Response to Serb Rejection of Accord

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzego vina, July 31

 BODY:
Bosnian Government leaders today criticized the United States and four other major powers for failing to take decisive action against the Bosnian Serbs for rejecting a peace plan.
In Belgrade, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia recommended that Bosnian Serb leaders reverse their rejection of the peace proposal, which would require the Serbs to acknowledge Bosnia's sovereignty, at least temporarily, and hand back a third of the territory they have captured and "ethnically cleansed." 
 At a meeting in Geneva on Saturday, the foreign ministers from the so-called "contact group" countries -- the United States, Germany, France, Great Britain and Russia -- warned that they would, among other things, press the United Nations Security Council to tighten spottily enforced economic sanctions against Serbia because of the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of the peace plan. But the five countries avoided tougher measures like a renewed threat of air strikes.
 
U.N. Review Scheduled
 The Security Council is expected to consider the foreign ministers' recommendation in about a week.
At a news conference today, members of Bosnia's Muslim-led Government used words like "disappointing" and "indecisive" to describe the contact group's response to the Serbs' rejection of the plan.
"We are disappointed at the lack of an effective response," President Alija Izetbegovic said, adding that the foreign ministers' recommendation "doesn't mention military retaliation if the plan is not implemented."
"Economic sanctions are by their very nature uncertain and long-term," he said. "The deadline for the Serbs to accept has also been pushed back twice, indicating a dangerous indecisiveness on the part of the international community."
 
The Price of Unity
 Bosnia's Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, said the Geneva meeting showed a lack of consensus by the members of the contact group on more energetic punitive measures against the Serbs, including the lifting of a United Nations arms embargo that has left Bosnia's legal Government at a decided disadvantage against the better-armed Serbs since the beginning of the war.
The ministers' response, Mr. Silajdzic said, "is probably the price for the unity of the contact group."
Mr. Silajdzic was clearly referring to a refusal by Russia to agree to sharper punitive measures against the Serbs. Russia has long had strong ties with the Serbs, sharing an Eastern Orthodox religious tradition.
Mr. Milosevic waited until after the foreign ministers threatened to tighten sanctions against Serbia to make his first public statement on the peace proposal, in which he urged the Bosnian Serbs to accept the deal.
The Bosnian Serbs have received military and economic support from Serbia. But the Serbian Government has consistently denied providing such aid and has called repeatedly for the lifting of the punitive United Nations economic sanctions -- the most effective provisions of which are the freezing of Serbian assets abroad, the cutting of Serbia's ties with the international banking community and the closing of Belgrade Airport to international air traffic. Trade sanctions against Serbia have largely been ignored, especially by Russia, Greece and Macedonia.
"Commitment to peace is in the interest of the entire Serbian nation," Mr. Milosevic said in a statement released to Serbia's main press agency. "This means that the international community's proposal must be accepted, enabling a continuation of the peace process.
"A compromise is necessary. Giving one half of the territory to the Bosnian Serb republic and the other half to the Muslim-Croat federation cannot be called 'anti-Serb.' "
The Bosnian Serbs' leadership, which is strongly under the influence of ultranationalist military commanders loath to abandon their dream for the creation of a greater Serbian state, has been at odds with Mr. Milosevic since before the Serbs began the war in Bosnia in April 1992.
Last year, the commander of the Bosnian Serbs' militia, Gen. Ratko Mladic, singlehandedly engineered the defeat of a similar international peace plan that would have required Serbian military pullbacks. It is highly unlikely that Mr. Milosevic's appeal will carry any more weight this time.
More powerful, and popular, than any other Serbian political leader, Mr. Milosevic has recently begun a campaign to present himself as a peacemaker and a defender of Serbia's interests. Protecting "endangered" Serbs outside his republic formed the heart and soul of the nationalist oratory that brought the Serbian President to power.
Mr. Milosevic's statement said acceptance of the peace plan, which would lead to a lifting of the economic sanctions against Serbia, was the least the Bosnian Serbs could do to repay the Serbs in Serbia for their sacrifices on the Bosnian Serbs' behalf.
Sarajevo's battlefront went relatively quiet after Bosnian Army and Bosnian Serb militia forces squared off in the heaviest firefight in months on Saturday evening.
Three women and a 5-year-old girl were wounded today when Serbian militiamen launched two rocket-propelled grenades into the Sarajevo suburb of Dobrinja.
Fighting was also reported today near the towns of Teslic, Bihac and Gorazde.

HEADLINE: U.S. Moves Against Japanese

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
After another collapse in their long-running trade talks, the Clinton Administration today formally accused Japan of discriminating against American companies in awarding Government contracts there for medical equipment and telecommunications gear.
The legal move could lead to a retaliatory ban later this year on Japanese bids for certain Federal contracts here. 
 While the maneuvering over Government contracts is unlikely to have any immediate impact on the countries' $155 billion a year in two-way trade, it could drive down the dollar's value in international currency markets. Many currency traders said that if trade talks did not succeed, the United States might try to drive down the value of the dollar so as to make American goods cheaper in the Japanese market and give them a larger market share there than negotiations have produced.
 
 
Denial by Administration
 Administration officials have denied any such intention and called in recent weeks for a stronger dollar. Private economists have pointed out that the dollar's 10.3 percent decline against the yen already this year should be enough to have an effect eventually on trade flows, even without further Administration action.
[The failure of the talks jolted the foreign exchange market in Tokyo Monday morning, putting the dollar into a short free fall against the yen before rebounding. Page D4.]
The dollar rose above 100 yen last week for the first time in a month after rumors swept currency markets that a deal in the Government contract dispute might be pending, contrary to the conventional wisdom here and in Tokyo.
 
 
Two Months of Talks
 Today's announcement starts a two-month period of talks between the two countries. If no settlement is reached by the end of September, the Administration would have the option of notifying Congress of possible bidding restrictions, and could impose those restrictions 30 days later.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, played down the possibility of retaliation in a statement today announcing the formal accusation of unfairness by Japan. "The time has come to use our trade laws to, first, proceed with the period of consultation and negotiation, and then, if necessary, to address the question of continued discrimination against U.S. companies," he said.
Japanese officials nonetheless responded indignantly. The section of American law invoked today by Mr. Kantor "is purely a question of U.S. domestic law and is not relevant to the Government of Japan," said a Japanese Embassy official here who insisted on anonymity.
[On Monday in Tokyo, Japanese officials said the Government would not take countermeasures now. But Kozo Igarashi, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, said that if the United States actually enacted sanctions, Japan would break off talks entirely.]
In making today's accusation after the talks broke down on Saturday evening, the Administration showed a willingness to continue confronting Japan despite possible damage to diplomatic relations and despite the continuing political turmoil there. Japan has had four Prime Ministers in a little more than a year.
American and Japanese trade officials have said the lack of strong political leadership makes it more difficult to strike deals on Government procurement issues. The Prime Minister's office has traditionally played the role of forcing greater openness in trade on Government ministries with strong ties to the industries they regulate, according to trade experts.
 
 
'No Japanese Government'
 "Part of the problem is there is no Japanese Government, there's a collection of ministries," said Joseph A. Massey, the assistant United States trade representative for Japan and China during most of the Bush Administration. "Just trying to get a decision out of that process is like punching a marshmallow."
The Administration is accusing the Japanese Government of "persistent and discriminatory practices" in the awarding of contracts for medical and telecommunications equipment. Under a 1988 law, the President can bar bids for certain Federal contracts from countries that do not let American companies compete for Government contracts on an equal footing with domestic companies.
But the legislation bars broader trade sanctions. The United States and Japan are also members of an international pact affiliated with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that prevents countries from imposing restrictions on all but the smallest contracts involving goods.
When the Clinton Administration invoked the Government procurement law last year to issue a list of bidding restrictions on companies from the European Union, the proposed restrictions mostly involved contracts for services, like construction, the dredging of harbors and the operation of cafeterias in Federal buildings. A handful of these restrictions are still in effect on bidders from some European Union nations.
 
 
Technical Merits
 Mr. Kantor accused the Japanese Government today of ignoring the technical merits of American bids, giving little warning of upcoming procurements and using technical standards that appear tailored to Japanese companies' products. But according to Japanese officials, the Administration has spent most of its energy seeking numerical standards for measuring success, like requiring that American companies win a rising percentage of contracts in each quarter in the coming years.
The Japanese Government has resisted numerical standards, fearing that if such standards are not met they will become the basis for American trade sanctions.
Japan issued a plan four months ago to revise its procurement procedures for telecommunications and medical equipment, but Mr. Kantor today dismissed these changes as inadequate. The plan "is not sufficient to address the persistent pattern of discrimination in the telecommunications and medical technology sectors faced by American firms, which are global leaders in their industries," he said in a statement.
Imports, mostly from the United States, occupy only 5 percent of the Government and private markets in Japan for telecommunications equipment, compared with 25 percent of the overall market in other industrialized countries, according to figures released by Mr. Kantor's office today. American businesses hold less than 20 percent of the Japanese medical equipment market, compared with nearly 40 percent of the European Union market, the figures indicate.
 
 
Europe's Neutral Battleground
 The Japanese Embassy official said imports accounted for even less of Government procurement in the United States than in Japan. American officials have rejected similar arguments in the past, saying that American companies should fare better because they have outperformed Japanese rivals in the European market, which they describe as a neutral commercial battleground.
The current trade talks revolve around American efforts to make Japanese procurement procedures less secretive and to set some criteria for measuring whether American bids are becoming more successful.
One mystery about the currency markets in recent days is why so many traders apparently believed a deal would be struck, when Japanese newspapers, which follow in great detail even the slightest twist and turn in trade talks, have been predicting imminent failure.
Mr. Massey, the former assistant United States trade representative, said currency traders have long done a poor job of following trade conflicts. "They don't understand this is a step-by-step process during which for a day or two things will seem better and for a day or two things will seem worse," he said.
Also today, American and Canadian officials continued talks by telephone over Canadian wheat exports to the United States. Congressional officials and American farming representatives consulted in the talks said that the two sides were close to a deal but would not rule out the possibility of American sanctions against Canada on Monday.

HEADLINE: Despite 3 Primaries on Tuesday, Michigan Voters Go Fishing

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HAMTRAMCK, Mich., July 31

 BODY:
On the eve of this state's Democratic primary for the United States Senate, Representative Bob Carr is leading his five opponents in the polls.
But at the Clock Restaurant in this working-class town, which is surrounded by Detroit, customers who peered over their apple waffles had trouble this morning placing the Congressman, who could pass for Dick Van Dyke's younger brother. 
 One diner asked Mr. Carr if he was running for governor. At a corner booth nearby, Irene Karas knew better than to ask that. Her question: "You're a Republican, right?"
The early expectations were that the three statewide primaries here would make for the liveliest that Michigan has seen in decades. For the Senate seat that Donald W. Riegle Jr. is leaving, there are a six-way Democratic race and a two-way Republican contest, and for the right to challenge Gov. John Engler, a Republican, a four-way Democratic fight.
 
Voters Stay Silent
 But despite the interest from candidates, voters do not seem to be paying attention, and those who do seem confused by the large number of candidates. Forecasters are predicting record-low turnouts on Tuesday. Among people who do expect to vote, polls indicate that many are just now starting to make up their minds. In a state where many residents devote their summer leisure time to fishing up north, there is no contest: fishing triumphs over politics.
Part of the problem seems to be a lack of compelling candidates, or compelling issues to drive their campaigns. Though Mr. Carr is enjoying a slight lead in the Senate race, voters hardly seem enthusiastic about him. The top contenders in both the Republican Senate primary and the Democratic race for governor are neck-in-neck in the latest polls.
There has been no lightning-rod issue. The candidates do not have the economy because Michigan is rebounding with the lowest unemployment rate in two decades. The health care debate has barely been mentioned. That has left the candidates struggling to make the most out of the issue at the top of the polls: crime.
"It has been an almost issueless, completely vapid campaign," said William Ballenger, the editor of a newsletter, Inside Michigan Politics. "It has been one of the most soporific Senate campaigns in Michigan history. People are barely aware that it even has a pulse."
Ronna Romney, a former radio talk show host who is seeking the Republican Senate nomination, did not disagree. "Quite frankly," she said, "I don't think we ever got to substantive issues in this campaign."
Yet, the importance of the outcomes on Tuesday cannot be underestimated: Michigan is one of the pivotal swing states in the Presidential elections, and the Republican have made Mr. Riegle's seat one of the top targets in their uphill, yet not impossible, drive for control of the Senate. Mr. Riegle, a Democrat, is retiring in the aftermath of his involvement with the former savings-and-loan operator Charles Keating. And Mr. Engler's campaign will be viewed as a test of the success of his program to reduce the welfare rolls and to stop using property taxes for schools.
The most interest in the closing days of the campaign has been in the Republican Senate primary, where Ms. Romney's lead over Spencer Abraham, a former state Republican chairman, seemed to be eroding. Ms. Romney, who benefited as the former daughter-in-law of a former Governor, George W. Romney, led Mr. Abraham throughout most of the campaign. But a poll published today by The Detroit News put the two, who have similar conservative views, in a virtual tie.
Mr. Abraham, who was a deputy chief of staff to former Vice President Dan Quayle, has sought to turn his lack of charisma into a virtue by portraying himself as more substantive. In a stinging new television commercial from the Abraham campaign, Ms. Romney is described derisively as a socialite. The tag line about her: "Glitz, not guts."
While he attacked her as shallow, Mr. Abraham also argued that it was disingenuous for Ms. Romney to deny her long involvement in party politics. "She's been in every smoke-filled room in the Michigan Republican Party for 16 years," said Mike Murphy, the media consultant for Mr. Abraham and Mr. Engler. "I've seen her there."
But Ms. Romney, who is smooth on the stump, presented herself as an outsider who would have a better chance of winning in November. "No. 1 is the electability factor," she said, adding that Mr. Abraham was the consummate insider. The tag line for Ms. Romney's commercial: "Spence Abraham. Just another double-talking politician."
On the Democratic side, Mr. Carr has hung on to a bare lead by continually reminding voters that he has steered resources to Michigan during his 18 years as a Congressman from East Lansing. Mr. Carr, who has become increasingly moderate to mirror his district's accelerating shift to the right, portrayed himself as "the only candidate with a moderate mainstream message."
Close behind is Lana Pollack, a State Senator from Ann Arbor who has run an aggressive campaign and is seen as having a lock on liberal voters. Joel Ferguson, a wealthy businessman from Lansing, also seemed to be gaining support in the closing days of the campaign. He helped engineer Jesse Jackson's upset victory in Michigan's 1988 Presidential primary, but has emphasized his moderate positions.
Also running is William M. Brodhead, once a popular Congressman who has struggled to recapture his political base in the Detroit suburbs since retiring from the House in 1982. Carl Marlinga, the Macomb County prosecutor, has been unable to convince many voters that he can move beyond crime issues. And there is John Kelly, a State Senator, who is bright but dismissed by many as a gadfly.
Only in the last week or so has the race for governor turned nasty, with the leading contenders unleashing attack advertisements. Perhaps the early politeness held because the candidates were friends. At the wedding last year of one candidate, former Representative Howard Wolpe, another contender, Lynn Jondahl, an ordained minister and State Representative, conducted the ceremony. A third candidate, State Senator Debbie Stabenow, was a guest.
A fourth candidate, Larry Owen, is a former Mayor of East Lansing. He was not at the wedding. but he, too, has known the other candidates. His best asset in the race is an endorsement from the powerful Michigan Education Association, which wants to punish Mr. Engler and Ms. Stabenow for backing a school-financing proposal that it strongly opposed.
The battle has largely been between Mr. Wolpe, who has gained from an endorsement from the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. but is viewed by some as too liberal to beat Mr. Engler, and Ms. Stabenow, who has sought to distinguish herself as the only woman in the race. The latest polls show the race going either way.

Friday's Wall Street Rally May Be Less Than It Seems

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
After Friday's impressive rally in the stock market and sensational increases in the bond market, Wall Street traders may be tempted to pinch themselves to see if they are dreaming.
If they do, they will find that they are, say those who have studied the Government's report on second-quarter economic growth that prompted Friday's buying of stocks and bonds. The lean months are yet to pass and the fat ones in the financial markets are not yet here, these analysts say. 
 Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, may look at the figures in the report on the gross domestic product that cheered Wall Street and do the opposite of what the markets expect and raise interest rates, they say. Indeed, he implied as much in his recent Congressional testimony.
A fifth increase in interest rates would be sure to slow the economy further, perhaps bolstering bonds and strengthening the dollar. But it would also weaken corporate profits and thus hurt stocks, at least for the short run.
Wall Street economists had expected that economic growth in the second quarter would come in at 3.9 percent or more, a worrisome pace that could tempt the Fed to raise rates. But the figure came in at 3.7 percent. More important, inventories rose sharply while consumer spending was weak and many traders and investors seemed to conclude that this combination would discourage the Fed from lifting rates.
"It was one of those positives that was really a non-negative," said Christine A. Callies, equity market analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman & Company.
Whatever the case, on Friday the Dow Jones industrial average jumped almost 34 points, to 3,764.50, and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond plummeted to 7.39 percent from 7.54 percent.
But the likelihood is that the financial markets are not at the beginning of a sustained rally, but merely heading into the happy end of some wide trading ranges, analysts say. For stocks, that trading range may be 3,600 to 3,800 for the Dow. For bonds, it may be 7.62 percent to 7.25 percent on the long bond.
A yield below 7 percent, a level not seen since March and one that would prompt a torrid rally in stocks, seems highly unlikely, analysts say.
And what of the summer rally and the dream long ago (in January) of a Dow soaring to 4,000?
 
 
'Predisposed to Find Inflation'
 "Getting to 4,000 would presume that Alan Greenspan is no longer worried about inflation," said Neal M. Soss, a former Wall Street economist who recently co-founded Soss & Cotton Enterprises, a hedge fund and economic consultant. "And we know that he is predisposed to find inflation" and thus raise rates.
There are many other reasons for caution, analysts say. In the short run, the Government's release of July employment figures this Friday could move the markets in a nasty way if they turn out to be surprisingly strong.
The week after that, the Government plans its quarterly sale of debt, the auction of some $40 billion in new 3-year and 10-year Treasury notes that can make the bond market stumble.
And there is continuing trade friction between Japan and the United States. The nations broke off trade talks Saturday, a move certain to prompt currency speculators to act.
"The only wild card is the dollar," said Glen T. Insley, who is otherwise optimistic about the course of stocks and bonds. "The hot-money boys could take another run at it." Mr. Insley is director of fixed-income investments at the First Union Corporation and helps manage $14 billion in fixed-income assets.
But perhaps the biggest reason for wariness is in the second-quarter gross domestic product figures, the proximate cause of Friday's rally in stocks and bonds.
True, inventories of unsold goods rose sharply, perhaps indicating that consumers and businesses were buying less and thus a sign of a slowing economy. Indeed, when the inventory increase, about $28.6 billion, is factored out, second-quarter growth would have been an even weaker 3.16 percent, good news for those concerned about inflation.
 In his written testimony submitted on July 20 to the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan acknowledged that accumulating inventories could signal a weakening economy. "Conversely," he said, "the inventory accumulation may reflect pressures on firms who had brought inventories down to suboptimal levels and now need to replenish them."
If so, he said, "stock-building may continue at an above-normal rate, supporting production for quite some time." In other words, inflationary pressures. Moreover, "the improving economic conditions of our trading partners should add impetus to aggregate demand from the external sector." In other words, inflationary pressures.
"The fact of the matter is, we went into this quarter with awfully, awfully low inventories," said Jan Terbrueggen, a portfolio manager with Flagship Financial who helps manage more than $5 billion in fixed-income assets. And that may mean that while inventories surged in the second quarter, they may not be high enough to force the cutback in production in the months ahead that some analysts were suggesting Friday.
Thus Mr. Greenspan, looking at the same statistics that convinced Wall Street that he would not raise interest rates as soon as expected, might raise them anyway.

HEADLINE: Ex-Mayor Barry Rises From Ashes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
At first glance they seem the most improbable of scenes: crowds hailing Marion S. Barry Jr. as a savior of the city, cheering him on as he seeks a fourth term as mayor.
After all, this is the same man whose third term effectively ended four years ago when Federal agents videotaped him smoking crack. He was convicted on a misdemeanor charge of cocaine possession and served six months in prison. 
 But in the strange brew of local politics in Washington, Mr. Barry is marching through rehabilitation and redemption.
In the most recent independent poll of District of Columbia voters, conducted in late June by The Washington Post, 38 percent said they would vote for Mr. Barry, compared with 26 percent for John Ray, a member of the City Council, and 16 percent for the current Mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly, whose political troubles have left a political opening for Mr. Barry. All of the candidates are black. The survey had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
 
Talents as a Politician
 "I call him the 'It' politician," Terry Lynch, executive director of the Downtown Cluster of Congregations, a local alliance of 29 churches, said of Mr. Barry. "Like the 'It Girl,' he's got it. He has innate political abilities, a talent cultivated to a fine expertise. And unlike Mayor Kelly, he has the ability to reach out."
Mr. Barry's rise from political ruin began when he left prison and moved into the city's poorest ward, where he was elected two years ago to the City Council. If the next step, a leap to City Hall, might seem ambitious, Mr. Barry's appeal to lower-income blacks makes it easier to understand. This is a city in which blacks constitute 70 percent of the population, and only a plurality is required to win the Democratic primary in September, with the winner virtually assured of victory in November. Democrats in Washington outnumber Republicans by more than 10 to 1.
Mr. Barry was a longtime civil rights worker before he was first elected mayor, in 1978, and he still draws strong support from many of the same groups he served after he arrived in Washington in 1965: middle- and lower-income blacks, especially the elderly, the young, the unemployed and others who feel a sense of alienation from the system. But it is less certain that he retains as much support from business leaders and middle-class blacks, whose backing was important in his first two terms.
To many of his supporters, his fall and ascent parallel their own struggles and have a ring of Biblical triumph akin to those they celebrate every Sunday in church. "You should not be penalized because you have made a mistake," said the Rev. Charlene Monk, pastor of a Methodist church in a black middle-class neighborhood. "If a Christian cannot find repentance, then something is wrong."
Also, said Dr. Lorenzo Morris, a professor of political science at Howard University in Washington, many black voters are more willing to forgive personal transgressions than political ones.
"Blacks," Dr. Morris said, "would not forgive President Nixon."
It is clear in campaigning that Mr. Barry has measured the political risks of discussing the past. Mindful of the opportunity created by Mrs. Kelly's sagging fortunes and sensitive to the willingness of many voters to forgive, he openly acknowledges the "difficult times of my valley experience" and spins them into a resume that portrays him as a better prospect for mayor because of his rehabilitation, which he continues for drug and alcohol abuse, and personal redemption.
"People are beginning to examine what I would do as mayor," he said before a brief ceremony last week with a handful of police officers endorsing him. "My programs are becoming the issue, not my problems. It's about there with a lot of people. It'll happen with more."
At the ceremony, he alluded to his arrest, saying, "When you have been on the other side, you see things firsthand and you know the criminal justice system needs to be fine-tuned."
 
Weakened Competitors
 But Mr. Barry's popularity with some voters is also a result of a growing feeling that his successor, Mrs. Kelly, has botched her chance to govern well and that Mr. Ray, who lost in three previous bids for mayor, is not strong enough to lead. Never mind that Mrs. Kelly inherited some problems from Mr. Barry, including a bloated city government and budget deficits, or that Mr. Ray has served more than a decade as a City Council member.
Their problems have only energized Mr. Barry's campaign, making his return to power that much more conceivable, even with most white voters firmly opposed to him. The Post survey said that 50 percent of white voters favored Mr. Ray, 27 percent favored Mrs. Kelly and just 1 percent preferred Mr. Barry. Campaigning at a Fourth of July parade in the city's most affluent district, Ward 3, which is mostly white, Mr. Barry was booed and derided.
Yet many blacks and lower-income voters support Mr. Barry because of what he once meant to their communities by creating jobs, especially since Mrs. Kelly has been forced to eliminate thousands of government jobs.
"This is not all an issue of race," said Jamin B. Raskin, associate dean of the American University Law School in Washington. "A lot of working-class people in Washington remember Marion Barry and the 'fat days' in Washington. Under Barry, the government swelled but the job force grew, and he made concerted efforts to give business to black entrepreneurs."
"Keep in mind," Mr. Raskin added, "black Washington and white Washington have diametrically opposed expectations of local government. Whites want lower taxes and a shrinking government. The black community looks at the D.C. government not as a burden but as an employer, a safety net. The black community wants local government strong, vibrant and active in their lives. Mayor Kelly brags about making the tough decisions to cut back jobs. But that is a direct slap for working-class blacks who count on the D.C. government for their livelihoods."
 
Modest Promises
 With Congress expected to cut the District's budget by at least $100 million for the next fiscal year, Mr. Barry has avoided promising a return to the flush days, which led to corruption scandals in his second term.
But he has campaigned on the issues that affect the quality of life in the city, especially for many people in the less affluent sections, issues like the high crime rate, deterioration of schools and decline in services, as well as the need to expand the District's tax base by attracting more businesses through property tax exemptions and by requiring city employees to live in Washington.
He has also promised to put more uniformed police officers on the streets and focus investigative efforts on "the most violent criminals." He promised the police officers that "the No. 1 plank on my program is to get the guns off the streets."
To his detractors, and to many undecided voters, Mr. Barry, while perhaps still the champion of the poor, also remains a shrewd opportunist. It remains unclear whether Mr. Barry can expand his base deeper into the black middle class, voters he will need if Mr. Ray finds a way to revamp his own campaign or if Mrs. Kelly makes what would be widely considered to be a miraculous recovery.
"There is a lot of ambiguity in this race," Dr. Lorenzo said. "Everything is so divided. Any single event could change things, any faux pas by Barry or a good performance by Ray. Right now, I would have no predictions."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Reinsdorf Sounds Hopeful, But Then He Adds the 'But'

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
An owner who usually sounds and acts like a hard-liner made a remarkable admission yesterday. With players prepared to strike in 11 days if they don't have a new labor agreement, Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox said he was prepared to continue playing baseball under the existing economic system.
But, he cautioned, he is in the minority among the owners, so his position can't be viewed as potentially instrumental in averting a strike. 
 Throughout negotiations with the players union, Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, has emphasized that the clubs need a new economic system that would give them "cost certainty." He has proposed a salary cap as a way of achieving that end, but the players have rejected it, saying they prefer the existing system.
Reinsdorf, who often is seen as but denies he is the most influential owner in baseball, said yesterday that he didn't want a strike to interrupt and possibly end the season, explaining that whatever the White Sox would save with a salary cap they would lose in the owners' new revenue-sharing formula.
"I have nothing to gain by a work stoppage," he said by telephone from his suite at Comiskey Park during the White Sox's game with Seattle. "I can survive under the system. I don't like it, but I can survive. We're a big market and we have a good ball park and a good lease. I can't speak for anybody else, but I would surmise there are a handful of teams in the position we are, making some money, and can survive under the system. Obviously, it's not in their interest to have a work stoppage."
 
But There's a But
 If anyone had been looking for signals in the plodding negotiations, the radar would have latched instantly onto those comments. If Reinsdorf, who in the past has talked of taking a strike for a year or two if necessary, was saying that he and others could live without change, could a settlement be far behind?
But then he expressed the "but."
"But," he said, "there's a whole bunch of other teams that can't or don't think they can survive under the current system so there's no chance that our side would accept it. Since you have 19 teams losing money, they're not going to accept the current system. I don't think there are any of the 19 that are willing to live with the current system."
Fifteen clubs would have to vote for a new agreement for it to take effect, and Reinsdorf said he doesn't think there are 15 clubs that would vote for the existing system. The problem would be compounded once a strike started, he noted, because the owners then would need 21 votes, or three-fourths, to approve a settlement.

HEADLINE: Iraq Sanctions Cannot Be Forever

 BODY:
Every two months, sanctions against Iraq are reviewed by the United Nations Security Council. Baghdad has begun scrupulously living up to its U.N. arms control obligations, which -- according to the terms laid down by the U.N. -- should entitle it to relief from the international embargo on its oil sales sometime next spring.
But the United States and Britain are refusing to acknowledge Saddam Hussein's compliance with the U.N.'s stated terms for lifting sanctions. They insist that other infractions -- such as persecution of the Kurds -- demand that Mr. Hussein continue to be punished. In effect, Britain and the U.S. are changing the rules. 
 Iraq paid a heavy price for defying a series of Security Council resolutions after it invaded Kuwait four years ago tomorrow. A U.S.-led coalition forcibly evicted its troops after pummeling its infrastructure. The U.N. imposed devastating economic sanctions, which remain in effect to this day.
Last November, after years of obstructionism, Baghdad abruptly began cooperating with U.N. arms inspectors. It is now close to meeting the Security Council's requirement that it destroy its stocks of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and accept long-term international monitoring.
Rolf Ekeus, who heads the U.N. inspection commission, recently reported that the destruction of prohibited weapons will be complete in a few more weeks and an effective monitoring system will be functioning by fall. Six months later, if all goes smoothly, the commission could declare that Iraq has met all its arms control obligations under the U.N.'s cease-fire resolution. According to the terms of that resolution, the Security Council would then be expected to lift the oil embargo.
France, Russia and China, all permanent members of the Security Council, are eager to resume trading with Iraq. In the last review sessions, they wanted to acknowledge Baghdad's constructive behavior, while rightly demanding that Iraq formally acknowledge Kuwait's sovereignty and borders before they vote to lift oil sanctions.
The U.S., along with Britain, opposed any acknowledgment of progress. The Clinton Administration, which insists on retaining sanctions as long as Mr. Hussein remains in power, has been reduced to strained reinterpretations of the cease-fire resolution's clear language that Washington helped draft. The Administration's position is misguided, putting domestic political posturing ahead of the problem of containing Iraq's military power most effectively.
The resolution's direct linkage between arms control and oil sanctions is not simply a technicality. The U.N.'s main goal after the war with Iraq was to insure dismantling of its mass-destruction weapons. That required giving Iraq an incentive to cooperate. Sanctions require time to work, but also require clearly defined and limited goals. When designed to force specific actions, they can be quite effective. Indefinite, symbolic sanctions -- punishing a regime simply for being loathsome -- tend to lose their meaning and effectiveness over time.
Experts believe that U.N. monitoring can permanently deny Iraq mass-destruction weapons. The cash it earns from resumed oil sales would have to be used for other purposes, including reparations, U.N. administrative costs, humanitarian needs in Iraq and economic development.
Saddam Hussein will be a bloody dictator and a troublesome neighbor as long as he remains in power. But the U.S. has no serious plans to oust him, nor is there any obvious alternative. A military coup would not end repression. Civilian dissidents are divided. Fragmentation into Kurdish, Sunni and Shiite regions would invite Iranian, Turkish and Syrian meddling.
Washington's most realistic policy toward Iraq under these circumstances is containment. The best instrument for that is U.N. arms monitoring, not endlessly prolonging sanctions that have nearly done their work and will soon lose their meaning.

HEADLINE: Ex-Guard for Serbs Tells Of Grisly 'Cleansing' Camp

SERIES: The Secrets of Susica: How Muslims Died in Bosnia -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: VLASENICA, Bosnia and Herzegovina

 BODY:
There were, according to the 1991 Yugoslav census, 18,699 Muslims living in and around this eastern Bosnian mining town. Dead now, or dispersed, they have all gone.
Their fate was determined by a Serbian concentration camp that lay concealed in a pine-clad valley about a mile from the city center. A former military depot surrounded by barbed wire, it is called Susica. 
 Although the camp is closed, the road to it is still barred and guarded, and a sign at the entrance to Vlasenica says, "Any loitering by foreigners is forbidden." The reason is simple: Susica hides terrible secrets about the Serbian slaughter and eviction of Muslims in Bosnia.
But now a Bosnian Serb, who was a guard at the camp and eventually fled Vlasenica, has provided for the first time an insider's detailed account of the process of eviction and slaughter that "cleansed" Vlasenica of its Muslims.
The guard, Pero Popovic, 36, was interviewed three times by The New York Times and clearly recognized snapshots of former Muslim prisoners of Susica. Later, he was interrogated by investigators preparing for Yugoslav war-crimes trials in The Hague. Convinced of his credibility, they have recommended that he be granted political asylum in the United States.
In addition, Mr. Popovic's account was corroborated by the convergent recollections of dozens of Susica survivors who now live as refugees and who provided the photos Mr. Popovic later viewed.
Mr. Popovic estimated that on the basis of individual and mass executions he personally witnessed, close to 3,000 Muslims from around Vlasenica (pronounced vlah-sen-EET-sah) lost their lives at Susica after the Bosnian war began in April 1992. "In all, about 3,000 were killed," he said. Those that survived lost their homes and possessions.
The existence of the camps -- including Susica (pronounced sue-SEE-chah) -- has been known since August 1992, when, four months after the war began, the Omarska and Kereterm camps near Prijedor and Banja Luka were uncovered. Yet doubts have remained over the extent of mass executions of Muslims -- particularly in the less-accessible eastern part of Bosnia -- over the degree of central decision-making in the operation and over the reliability of often anonymous and exclusively Muslim witnesses.
Serbs have insisted that the camps were detention centers for prisoners of war -- that is, combatants rather than civilians -- and that the term "death camp" is entirely misplaced. But the accounts of camp survivors and Mr. Popovic -- who is prepared to testify at war-crimes trials -- tell a different story and establish these points:
*The intimidation and confinement of Vlasenica's Muslim civilians were instigated by a unit of the Yugoslav Army, based in the northern Serbian town of Novi Sad. Moreover, ultimate command of the Susica camp rested throughout with Maj. Mile Jacimovic, an officer in the Yugoslav Army who is now stationed in the town of Pljevlja in the Sandzak area of the rump Yugoslav state, Mr. Popovic said. The role suggests the degree to which the "ethnic cleansing" of Bosnia's Muslims was coordinated by the Yugoslav Army and the Serbian authorities in Belgrade, contradicting Belgrade's repeated claims that the Bosnian war has been an affair solely of the Bosnian Serbs.
*From the time Susica opened on June 2, 1992, until it closed four months later, groups of Muslims were executed every night at the command of Dragan Nikolic, a man who now works for the Bosnian Serb secret police and was in charge of the day-to-day running of the camp, Mr. Popovic and Muslim survivors said. Nearly all those executed were civilians taken from their homes. On at least one occasion, a group of more than 100 people was executed.
*Muslim men, women and children in Vlasenica were rounded up with equal brutality and subjected to the same abject conditions in Susica. Susica was generally a transit camp for women and children, but some were executed.
*Many Muslim men from Vlasenica who were not executed were eventually transferred to the Batkovic camp near Bijeljina, about 60 miles to the north. At Batkovic, the Serbs presented these civilians to the Red Cross authorities as "prisoners of war" rather than what they were, arbitrarily arrested civilians.
Mr. Popovic, who was a sergeant in the Yugoslav Army in the late 1970's and joined the Bosnia Serb forces when the Bosnian war broke out, explained his decision to talk as an attempt to assuage his conscience.
He admitted having beaten Muslim prisoners, but says he never killed any. Increasingly troubled after Susica closed, he said he deserted the Bosnian Serb army and fled Vlasencia on Jan. 1, 1993, abandoning a timber business and his home there.
"The worst part of it was knowing the prisoners," he said, tugging nervously at his beard. "I had grown up with these Muslims, as had all the guards. And yet we beat them with pieces of timber and iron rods. How could anyone imagine such things before they started?"
"There is no question that the orders came from the highest level," said Mr. Popovic, who is now out of the former Yugoslavia. "Our army had a strict chain of command from the outset, and Major Jacimovic received orders from above."
Beatings and executions of civilians have not only been the work of Serbs in Bosnia. Both Croats and Muslims have also operated camps during the Bosnian war, and the Muslims' Tarcin camp near Sarajevo is a prison where the international authorities believe that Serbs have been widely abused.
Serbian civilians have been brutally evicted by Muslims from many towns in central Bosnia, including Zenica.
Asked about events in eastern Bosnia and Vlasenica, Budimir Kosiutic, the head of a war crimes commission established by the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Government, argued that Serbs had been imprisoned in many camps by the Muslims. He insisted that Muslims "initiated whatever happened in Vlasenica by provoking and attacking the Serbs in the first three months of 1992 in several villages in eastern Bosnia."
It is certain that the rise of the Muslim-nationalist Party for Democratic Action of the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic, gave Serbs throughout Bosnia cause for concern over their future. But Western diplomats have found little evidence of attacks on Serbs before the war began.
Neither Major Jacimovic, identified by Mr. Popovic as the overall commander of Susica and of the "cleansing" of Vlasenica, nor Mr. Nikolic, whom survivors of the camp and Mr. Popovic identified as the man with day-to-day control of the camp, could be reached. The Bosnian Serbs severely restrict the movement of journalists, and do not hesitate to arrest them when they stray from officially permitted themes or itineraries.
Vlasenica today still bears the scars of this terror. Its mosque is gone, replaced by a dismal little square, and its bullet-scarred Muslim homes are empty or occupied by Serbian refugees from Government-held territory.
"The Muslim families of Vlasenica ran away of their own accord when the Bosnian war broke out," Mikajlo Bajagic, the Serbian president of the town council, said in an interview. "But, for a period of time, there were some who were imprisoned, there were some who were confined."
What, Mr. Bajagic was asked, happened to these Muslims who were imprisoned or confined? "They were exchanged," he said, "against Serbian prisoners." Then, as he seemed to sense that he had said too much and mild panic spread across his face, he added:
"But what I say may not be completely accurate. It is probably not accurate at all. I did not have this job at the start of the war. I really have no idea what was going on."
 
Two Sons
A Mother Can Get No Information
 It was May 31, 1992, when three Serbs drove up in a Volkswagen Golf to the Vlasenica home of Hiba Mehmedovic, a 50-year-old widow. She knew one of them, whom she identified in an interview as Dragan Basta, but the others were unknown to her. All the men had automatic weapons.
The Serbs came into her house and arrested her two sons, Kemal Mehmedovic, a 27-year-old driver, and Nedzad Mehmedovic, a 25-year-old mechanic.
"Why are you taking my boys?" Mrs. Mehmedovic asked. The men replied that the arrests amounted to no more than an administrative procedure and that her sons would return shortly after reports had been filed.
Mrs. Mehmedovic never saw her sons again.
That day, she tried to get information from the police, the Mayor and a prominent Serbian doctor in Vlasenica. To no avail. Returning in tears to her home that night she met her neighbor, a Serb named Obrad Kovacevic. As Mrs. Mehmedovic recalled it, the following conversation ensued:
"What happened?" Mr. Kovacevic asked.
"They took my boys."
"Oh, don't worry, they'll just beat them a bit."
"What?" Mrs. Mehmedovic exclaimed.
"And by the way," said her neighbor, "why don't you come over for a coffee? My wife is in Belgrade."
Such humiliation from Serbs had become routine since the Bosnian war broke out. It was a time, according to several accounts of survivors, when neighbors suddenly became strangers, when old friends became enemies and when Serbs were abruptly endowed with the power to demean and terrorize the Muslims with whom they had lived.
After her boys' arrest, Mrs. Mehmedovic said, she survived seven more weeks in Vlasenica, before being forced onto a bus on July 18 and taken to a village near the Muslim-held town of Kladanj, about 20 miles to the west.
For the last two years she has lived with other Vlasenica refugees in the classroom of a kindergarten in Kladanj, obliged to use toilets built for 4-year-olds and to sleep on a thin mattress on the floor beneath which she keeps two faded black-and-white photographs of her sons.
"Like any mother," she said, tears abruptly filling her eyes, "I have to believe my boys are alive."
Mr. Popovic, the Serb who was one of the 15 guards at Susica camp, said Mrs. Mehmedovic hopes in vain. "The two Mehmedovic boys were executed in June 1992, after being taken to the Susica camp," he said.
 
One Town
Nationalism, Then Slaughter
 The story of the Mehmedovic family typifies the horror that engulfed Vlasenica. Before the war, the town was like many others in Bosnia in its ethnic make-up. The town and surrounding area, including outlying villages, had 30,498 inhabitants, about 60 percent of whom were Muslim.
The town's economy was based on nearby bauxite mines and a substantial timber business. Relations between Serbs and Muslims gave little hint, on the surface, of the potential for the kind of violence that took place. But there were a few worrying signs.
Ibro Memisevic, a former Caterpillar representative in Vlasenica who fled the town on April 11, 1992, and now lives in Tuzla, recalled that after the Croatian war broke out in 1991, Yugoslav Army maneuvers were held in the nearby Bosnian town of Han Pijesak.
"But," he said, "only the Serbs of Vlasenica were invited to take part, while Muslims were excluded. The atmosphere was being prepared." At this time, both Bosnian Serbs and Muslims were still citizens of the former Yugoslavia, so it was abnormal that only the ethnic Serbs were called up for the Yugoslav Army.
Serbs, for their part, appear to have been worried by the sharp rise in the Muslim population of the Vlasenica area -- 22 percent in the 1981-91 decade -- and by their increasing domination of local politics through Mr. Izetbegovic's Muslim-nationalist party.
"In the 1990-92 period, nothing proposed by Serbs could pass in the town council," said Mr. Bajagic, the current council president.
Mr. Popovic recalled groups of Muslims throwing stones at Serbs.
"Economic stagnation fueled the rise of the nationalist parties," the former Susica guard said. "So many people of 25 had never had a job. The Muslim nationalists and the Serbs offered these people 100 marks and could do what they liked with them. You could feel the war coming."
After the European Community recognized the independence of Croatia and Slovenia from Yugoslavia in early 1992, Vlasenica, like other Bosnian towns, became rapidly polarized over the issue of the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Serbs, almost one third of the prewar Bosnian population, boycotted a referendum on independence on Feb. 29, 1992, while Bosnia's Muslims and Croats voted in favor. Serbs then proposed the division of the country into three ethnic cantons, but this was rejected by Mr. Izetbegovic.
Ignoring all the danger signals, and the precedent of the Croatian war, the United States and the European Community recognized Bosnian independence in early April. Predictably, the Serbs went to war.
While Serbian shells started to fall on Sarajevo from April 6, the Serbian assault in Vlasenica was initially less blunt.
Muslims from Vlasenica recalled Serbs from outlying villages coming into the town, getting drunk, firing shots in the air and warning the Muslims that they would have to leave. But some joint Muslim-Serbian police patrols continued at least until April 10.
"My own decision to leave only came when I saw a military vehicle stop in front of a Serb's home on April 10, and deliver some automatic weapons," Mr. Memisevic said. "The message was clear."
Mr. Memisevic was one of the lucky few with the foresight to get away. On April 21, according to Mr. Popovic and several Muslim refugees, soldiers from the Novi Sad Corps of the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Army arrived and surrounded Vlasenica. Tanks were installed in key positions. It became impossible for Muslims to leave.
"Once the Novi Sad Corps came, there was no way out," said Fikra Atalov, another Vlasenica refugee living on the floor in the Kladanj kindergarten. "One had to have a special permission, and the bus station was patrolled by the Serbs."
The Yugoslav Army soldiers pulled out of Vlasenica and the rest of Bosnia in early May, leaving the bulk of their weapons and transferring some 80,000 troops to the local Serbs.
Mr. Popovic, who joined the Bosnian Serb army at the beginning of April, said there was a steady influx of "gangsters and criminals from Serbia, and others who saw a chance to make money."
"With a mass of unemployed people under 25, you can do what you like," Mr. Popovic added. "These people were longing for action and a chance to loot Muslims."
While conditions for Muslims in Vlasenica were terrible throughout May 1992 -- the refugees said beatings, random arrests and reprisal killings were commonplace -- their systematic eviction and slaughter did not start until the beginning of June.
First, a camp for this purpose had to be prepared, and in a former military depot called Susica the Serbs found the ideal spot. Mr. Popovic said that at the beginning of May he was told by his commander, Capt. Boban Kukic, to prepare to work in a prison camp.
During May, Mr. Popovic said, a large hangar was emptied and the camp surrounded with thick coils of barbed wire. "Fifteen of us were chosen as guards," he said. "We were all over 30; they wanted people with some experience. The alternative was to be shot, or sent to the front line."
Tugging his beard, he added, "I still did not believe there would be massacres of civilians."
 
The Camp
Beating and Killing Amid the Squalor
 Zijad Zemic was one of the first men to enter Susica as a prisoner on June 2, 1992. He stayed in the camp until July 1. Now 19, he speaks with a stutter and fear haunts his pale eyes. He is a refugee in Tuzla.
"Two armed Serbs -- I only know their first names, Milan and Miso -- came to my house on June 2, 1992," he said. "They told me to put my arms behind my head and come with them. It was raining, and I wanted to get a coat, but I was not allowed to."
Mr. Zemic was thrust into a group of about 200 Muslim men being rounded up in the surrounding Vlasenica streets and led down to the Susica camp. There, he said, he was searched, and all his documents were taken. Then he was pushed into the hangar.
"The place was full of other civilians," he said. "Some were wounded, some very dirty. There was a concrete floor, and virtually nowhere to sit."
Conditions, according to more than 20 convergent accounts, were appalling. At least 600 people -- men, women and children -- were generally inside the hangar, which was about 40 yards long and 20 wide. They were not allowed to wash; in the mid-summer heat, the smell was sometimes overwhelming.
Twice a day, prisoners were allowed to file out of the hangar to get a bowl of thin soup and use a toilet. No talking was permitted at any time, nor were any blankets to cushion the concrete floor. Men were regularly stripped to the waist and beaten.
One of the men beaten with metal rods by Serbian guards was Amir Berbic, a locksmith who is now a refugee in Tuzla. He, too, was arrested and taken to Susica camp on June 2, where he remained for a month before being taken to Batkovic camp near Bijeljina and ultimately exchanged for Serbian prisoners of war. His left ear is still deformed from beatings, and his arms and legs are scarred.
"I was beaten inside and outside the hangar, sometimes three or four times a day, and slashed with knives," Mr. Berbic said. "They were shouting about how all the Muslims would disappear and calling us 'Balija' and forcing us to sing Serbian songs." "Balija" is a racial insult for Muslims.
Sometimes prisoners were beaten to death. One such victim was Durmo Handzic, a Muslim who used to work in the telephone company in Vlasenica. Several witnesses said he was killed inside the hangar on or about June 15, 1992. Another older man, Asim Zildic, was beaten to death shortly afterward, Mr. Berbic said.
"It's true that Durmo Handzic was beaten to death," said Mr. Popovic, the guard. "It was believed that he had weapons. Another man beaten to death was Redzo Hatunic."
Mr. Popovic described broadly how the selection process at the camp worked: Men suspected of having some political influence or trafficking in arms were not taken for exchange and were generally executed; other men who seemed more innocuous were often transported to Batkovic camp for eventual exchange. Women and children were taken up to the front line a few miles to the west and forced to walk to Kladanj.
But in many cases, the process seems to have been very random. Harudin Meric, for instance, was arrested with his wife and three children and taken to Susica on June 2. Two days later, his wife and children were allowed to go to Kladanj. He was later taken to Batkovic camp and exchanged, and now lives as a refugee in Tuzla.
But his older bother, Muharem, a 44-year-old carpenter, remained in Susica camp.
"I have never heard anything about my brother again, although I wrote repeated letters," Mr. Meric said.
Mr. Popovic said Muharem Meric had been executed.
NEXT: The pace of killing accelerates.
 "The existence of the camps -- including Susica (pronounced sue-SEE-chah) -- has been known since August 1992, when, four months after the war began, the Omarska and Kereterm camps near Prijedor and Banja Luka were uncovered."

'In all, about 3,000 were killed,' he said. Those that survived lost their homes and possessions.

HEADLINE: >2 Towns Hoping Woodstock '94 Is a Revival for Them, Too

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAUGERTIES, N.Y., July 27

 BODY:
Saugerties, a largely blue-collar river community, doesn't seem temperamentally suited for a rock festival. Neither does Bethel, little more than a spot on the map west of Monticello, in a rural, hilly region noted for its poultry and game and its summer bungalow colonies for Orthodox Jews.
But so what. In a perverse spirit of commercialism and convenience, the two towns, 60 or so miles apart with the Catskill Mountains between them like the filling of a hearty sandwich, will each play host to a 25th anniversary version of the famous Woodstock concert the weekend after next. And if there's both nervousness and curiosity afoot, with residents hoping the festivals will bring economic windfall and not riotous discord, well, the places themselves are of the type that are used to hardship, if not uproar. 
 As Paul Brazier, the Saugerties town assessor, said: "It couldn't be any worse than this winter, when we had three feet of snow and a state of emergency."
With a population of about 20,000, Saugerties is the larger of the two towns and is holding the larger festival, which has won the rights to the sacred name Woodstock '94 and is hoping to attract 250,000 people.
 
Name From the Past
 The concert site, off the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway, is owned by Frank Schaller of Schaller & Weber's, the meat emporium on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, whose father turned down the promoters of the original festival in 1969. (The first Woodstock ended up in Bethel after another town, Wallkill, also turned down the promoters and a Bethel dairy farmer, Max Yasgur, offered his property.)
Saugerties, 100 miles up the Hudson, has attracted a growing community of artists, outdoors enthusiasts and second-home buyers from the city. But unlike the actual town of Woodstock 12 miles to the west, a kind of boutique-y shrine to the history of rock-and-roll, where actual hippies still walk the streets, Saugerties has never been a mecca for outsiders.
Its town board once rejected a proposal that a community college build a campus on what is to be the concert site, and at the moment there is a campaign against a county proposal to turn it into a landfill. Many local residents approve of the rock-and-roll show only because they hope it will cause the dump project to be abandoned, opening the door for an annual concert or perhaps even a permanent performing arts center.
"The town is politically conservative; you could say that," said Kevin Drescher, the town's deputy chief of police. "Voting to go ahead with this Woodstock thing is about the most liberal thing I can remember."
 
A Dutch Overlay
 Saugerties was founded by the Dutch in the late 17th century (the name was derived from the Dutch word for sawyer), and Dutch names proliferate in the area today. It's the kind of place where families date back generations in the same house (and the most persistent police concern is domestic violence), where the movie theater still hasn't gone multiplex and where there's a restaurant on Main Street called the Main Street Restaurant.
There's little diversity here; it's almost all white. In better days, before I.B.M. in nearby Kingston began laying off workers 16 months ago, Saugerties was a bedroom community, as Deputy Chief Drescher describes it.
This isn't a tiny town, though. The commercial district, weatherbeaten but not ramshackle, consists of two intersecting streets of two- and three-story buildings, most of them dating from the 19th century (and all of them, it seems, hawking Woodstock '94 T-shirts in the storefront windows). And though it's quiet after dark, it doesn't shut down. There's a bar with throbbing rock music, a pizza parlor with a big-screen television, and a new restaurant, Cafe Tamayo, with high culinary aspirations.
"I'm for the concert," said Rickie Tamayo, who owns it with her husband, the chef. "It'll certainly bring in more advertising than the town could pay for in a million years."
The Tamayos moved to town full time from Manhattan seven years ago, after spending many summer vacations there.
 
That Hometown Flavor
 "For us, Saugerties was architecturally and esthetically like Rhinebeck," she said, referring to the more fashionable Manhattanite retreat across the Hudson, "but it was still my idea of a hometown."
Bethel is a tougher community to divine, mainly because it's harder to find. The Bethel Country Store, on the main highway, has the post office in it, but the monument to town veterans is several miles away, across the road from the Kauneonga Lake post office. And whether the actual concert site, on the same ground on which the 1969 concert took place, is in Bethel or White Lake is debatable.
"Bethel is White Lake, White Lake is Bethel," said Norman Karp, a Woodstock memorabilia dealer who lives about a mile away from what used to be Max Yasgur's farm. (Yasgur died in 1973; the land is now owned by a Brooklyn woman, June Gelish.)
The rolling fields that dominate the region -- which is in Sullivan County, near the Pennsylvania border -- are a deep green right now. From the tops of hills you can see for miles, and there is a sense of vastness. Not too many people around. Of course, it's never been exactly crowded, but in the last few years the tourist business in the Catskills has hit hard times, some of the big hotels have foundered -- Grossinger's went bankrupt in 1986 -- and the region's economy has soured with them.
"We need something here; people are moving away," said Karri Theis, a clerk in the Bethel Country Store, which sells videos and children's sneakers as well as groceries, not to mention the inevitable T-shirts and commemorative Woodstock soda cans.
She said she wasn't going to go to the concert herself, however. She didn't go in 1969, either.
"My parents brought me over afterward," she said. "To see the garbage."
Moshe Stein, who owns the Shor Yoshuv bungalows, a summer colony for Orthodox Jews just a few miles up the road from the concert site, said that though none of the colony residents would attend, he hopes the festival will be a success.
"I hope it brings business in," he said. "The town is broke, the county's broke."
The promoters of the anniversary festival, Bethel '94, are expecting about 50,000 people, about a 10th the size of the crowd that overran the region 25 years ago. They are bringing back several acts from the original show, including Country Joe and the Fish and John Sebastian, and gearing it to an older crowd.
That's probably smart, since people, many a bit too long in the tooth to pass for fans of, say, Porno for Pyros, show up at Yasgur's field all the time anyway, acknowledging the place as a shrine. A stone monument with the names of the performers engraved on it and the famous festival logo (a dove perched on a guitar neck) in relief was placed there in 1984 by a sculptor, Wayne Saward, and a few days ago he was there touching it up in advance of the anniversary festival. A number of people pulled up in their cars to watch.
"I go by here every day on my route, and I don't think a day goes by I don't see anybody," said Jim Davis, an auto parts salesman who had a video camera trained on Mr. Saward.
 
Local Hero
 Perhaps no one is more nostalgic about the first Woodstock event than Art Vassmer. Mr. Vassmer and his brother Fred, who own Vassmer's, a grocery, were heroes to the legions of young people who showed up in 1969 for their accommodating nature and for the fact that they didn't raise their prices.
"We were about the third largest city in the state for those three days," said Mr. Vassmer, now 68. "They were the greatest fun-loving bunch, and they had a lot of it, too. I remember the beards looking at you. Some had teeth. Some not."
Mr. Vassmer marveled at the changes in the world since then, but only briefly. A couple of elderly women who speak only Russian came in and he spoke to them (in English) about the price of a loaf of bread as if they all understood one another.
"I know them all," he said, referring to the many Russian immigrants new to the area. "I don't know their names because I can't pronounce them. But once we got to know each other, we got to like each other."
Asked about the forthcoming festival, he responded with the same attitude. He's got an open mind at the start of anything, but in the end he's a wait-and-see guy. Sensible, all in all.
"We were always for Woodstock; still are," he said. "Maybe after this one we won't be."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
A pledge of low prices by the troubled Vons supermarkets does not convince everybody.

BYLINE: By Andrea Adelson 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
'FINALLY, a store that works," was once the proud boast of Bill Davila, the television pitchman and president emeritus of the Vons Companies, the largest supermarket chain in Southern California.
It hasn't been working for a while. So far, neither is Vons Values, the regional chain's new low-price merchandising strategy that is aimed at halting eroding profits and sales -- and touted in a vigorous print and broadcast advertising campaign. Vons is struggling to lure customers back to its stores without giving up service and selection, which analysts said had made the chain a step above most rivals. 
 The sages who said supermarkets were recession resistant were wrong in the case of Vons. Since 1992, the 330-store company, based in Arcadia, Calif., has seen its sales fall by 12 percent. That amounted to a stunning $500 million decline in revenues last year.
It seems an astonishing turnabout. Vons built a reputation as an innovative food retailer for its knack of sizing up customers and creating formats to appeal to them. Some Vons stores had drive-up windows. Its Tianguis stores in Hispanic neighborhoods offered sheep's heads, hand-made tortillas and sausage prepared Oaxaca-style. Sushi counters and designer housewares were available at the Pavilions markets. Crisp produce and sparkling stores gave regular Vons stores a stamp of quality.
Only Pavilions, with its well-heeled customers, survived the recession.
Forced to reposition itself to shore up its declining customer base, Vons is resorting to a value-pricing strategy, one that has been embraced by many recession-pinched retailers, including fast-food chains. It also borrows from Vons rivals, particularly Lucky's, which bills itself as the "everyday low price leader."
In January, Vons aggressively began promoting an assertion that it had permanently cut prices, and therefore its margins, on 10,000 items. One analyst figured that prices declined an average of 5 percent on about one-third of all the items on store shelves. Vons expanded price cuts in May to 17,700 items, a number that includes goods reduced because of manufacturers' specials and weekly advertised promotions.
Vons said that it doubled its television and radio ad spending, although the company would not disclose figures.
The company's second-quarter profits, released earlier last month, declined 75 percent, to $4.5 million from the corresponding period last year, far below analysts' expectations. Sales fell 1.3 percent, to $1.16 billion, sales at stores open at least one year dropped 3.2 percent and gross margins fell to 23.1 percent, below the industry average of 24.8 percent.
"From the results, it looks like a disaster," said Douglas Christopher, an analyst at Crowell, Weedon & Company of Los Angeles.
One executive from a rival store doubted that Vons could fulfill its pricing pledge. "You can't discount one-third of the items in the store," the executive said.'
Others doubt the honesty of Vons advertising claims.
"Vons wants customers to think they have everyday low pricing," said Debra J. Levin, an analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company. But she described Vons's advertising message as murky because the company did not lower prices across the aisles and continues to double the value of manufacturers' coupons. Consumers, she said, believe that double-coupon payouts are made up elsewhere in the store.
Price cutting has successfully pushed up sales and profits at other chains, she said, citing Smith's Food and Drug Centers Inc. in Salt Lake City, but the process can be painfully slow.
Vons says it is gradually winning customers back and has slowed sales declines. "But changing perceptions takes time," a company spokeswoman, Mary M. McAboy, said. "This is not a promotional program. We're not planning on inching them back up."
Profits should start improving in the second half of this year and in 1995 as efforts to lower operating costs offset price cuts, analysts said.
The company dismissed 500 people, 30 percent of its nonstore work force, which will save an estimated $45 million. Vons will try to increase the sales proportion of higher-margin private-label goods to 16 percent from 13 percent by introducing 130 new items. The company will seek lower-cost producers for some goods and eliminate slow-moving inventory.
"The key is knowing these guys are taking costs out of the system," Mr. Christopher of Crowell, Weedon said. "This is the worst quarter you are going to see."

HEADLINE: China Human-Rights Tactic Spreads

BYLINE: By KEN BROWN 

 BODY:
After years of trying unsuccessfully to quiet criticism of human-rights records, Asian nations have found powerful allies: American businesses eager to invest in their growing markets and the Clinton Administration, with its emphasis on economic interests in post-cold-war foreign policy.
The Clinton Administration's spring decision to continue China's favorable trade status gave some of the largest and fastest growing countries new confidence that their influence is now strong enough to have an effect on American policy. And from India and Indonesia to smaller nations like Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia, they are showing it. 
 "It seems to me the message is loud and clear: if American business gets strongly involved in a country, human rights takes second place or even less than that," Ashutosh Varshney, an India expert at Harvard University, said of the China decision.
For decades India, a socialist country, closed itself to trade and foreign investment. But now the world's second most populous country has been quick to seize its newly liberalized and quickly growing market as the key to muting criticism on its use of child labor and its crackdowns on unrest in Kashmir and Punjab.
The India Interest Group, an organization of large American companies that do business with the country, was founded last fall and is actively promoting the promise of an economy with 850 million potential customers.
"What we have been doing is sitting down and briefing the key Administration officials that are negotiating with the Indians and really identifying for them what U.S. business is doing in India and what we'd like to see happen there to improve the environment for U.S. exports and U.S. investment there," said R. Michael Gadbaw, the vice president for international law and policy at General Electric and a founder of the group, whose members include Ford, AT&T, Coca-Cola, I.B.M. and Polaroid.
The members' investments vary widely. What they share is a belief that they are looking at another China, a huge untapped market poised on the edge of a boom. General Electric, which has been in India since 1902, recently set up joint ventures to make home appliances and light bulbs, and opened a subsidiary of GE Capital. The company and its affiliates now employ more than 6,300 people in India.
Ford's investment is limited to a plant that makes radiators, yet it hopes one day to build millions of cars for the Indian market.
The India Interest Group helped arrange Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao's visit to the United States in May -- an unusual trip for two reasons. For the first time, a top Indian political leader traveled to the United States with a group of Indian business leaders, and for the first time, an Indian leader refused to meet with human rights groups.
The India Interest Group did discuss human rights with Mr. Rao, and does support Washington's basic objectives in promoting human rights. "But we also want to make sure that the issues that are raised are put into the context of our relationship with India and what's going on there and recognizing this is a very large country," Mr. Gadbaw said.
The Administration's China decision was also closely watched by Indonesia, which is in the middle of the latest trade case brought against it by American labor unions. The case comes under the Guaranteed System of Preferences, which was created to help developing countries, and will be decided by the United States trade representative. Under the preferences program, Indonesia can export $650 million worth of goods duty free to the United States.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. is protesting what it says is Indonesia's quashing of its labor movement. A ruling is due this month, but there is a growing feeling in Indonesia that the battle is already won.
 
Trade Group Confident
 "I think the Indonesians are resting a little easier that the decision won't go against them," said Wayne J. Forrest, the executive director of the American Indonesian Chamber of Commerce, a group founded in 1949, whose members include Mobil, Texaco and several other large oil and mining companies as well as some small businesses.
A month after the Clinton Administration's May 26 decision to continue China's most-favored-nation status with virtually no conditions, despite its spotty record on human rights, the Indonesian Government shut three of the country's most influential magazines and broke up a protest in Jakarta over the closings. Amnesty International said 56 people were beaten and arrested. In mid-April, more than 100 workers and labor campaigners were arrested after strikes and demonstrations.
Meanwhile, human rights groups say that abuses continue in the disputed territory of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony invaded and annexed by Indonesia in 1976.
An Indonesian Embassy official in Washington, who insisted on anonymity, said Indonesia had followed China's lead and enlisted American oil and mining companies that do business in Indonesia to stress the country's economic importance to the United States. Nearly 800 big American companies wrote to President Clinton supporting China, a tactic crucial to China's success in the trade decision.
 
Chinese Called Lax on Data
 Asian nations have long emphasized their own human-rights philosophy, stressing stability and economic growth rather than individual liberties, and the Indonesian official said the closing of the magazines was done in the name of "unity and national stability."
Human-rights advocates, who applauded Mr. Clinton's strong stand on their issue during his election campaign, concede that it is impossible to connect specific human rights cases with trade policy.
But in a report issued last week, Human Rights Watch/Asia said that since the trade decision, China has begun trials of labor and human rights campaigners that had been postponed for nearly a year and has started holding leading dissidents incommunicado, in some cases not even acknowledging their arrests. "In the absence of international pressure, China has steadily tightened the noose on all forms of dissident activity," said the group, which opposed the Clinton decision.
Supporters of the China decision, however, argue that the Administration's approach will improve human rights in the long run.
 
Sunglasses and Culture
 "Before this there was a lockout, they said it was a cultural difference, you can't talk to us about it," said Representative Gary Ackerman, a New York Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. "Now people who want brand- name sunglasses for their children don't talk about cultural differences."
Human-rights advocates see a certain irony in the United States' new trade logic. For decades, they point out, human-rights questions were subsumed beneath cold war tensions: a dictator who may have been nasty at least was our dictator. Now, they say, the rationale is the need to get into an emerging market before the Japanese or Germans do.
The latest round in the new-markets war is being fought in Vietnam, where both human rights groups and the State Department have been sharply critical of Vietnam's disregard of Western perspectives on human rights. The Clinton Administration ended the United States trade embargo in Vietnam in February.
The Vietnam-American Chamber of Commerce, which was founded in 1992 and includes dozens of American corporations, is lobbying Congress to remove the remaining restrictions on trade. "Certainly if we can trade with China and other countries in Asia where there are human rights problems there is no reason to single out Vietnam," Irwin Jay Robinson, the group's president, said.

HEADLINE: Bosnian Serbs Reject Peace Plan for 3d Time, Defying Russia

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzego vina, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Nationalist Serbian leaders today rejected an international plan to settle the war in Bosnia, despite a fresh warning from Russia that refusal might lead to a serious increase in the fighting. It was the third time the Serbs had rejected the peace plan.
After meeting with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia on Sunday, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia said today that a final rejection of the peace plan by the Bosnian Serbs could result in "an escalation of the war, a huge confrontation and the possibility of air strikes." 
 "We will not take part in such a war," Mr. Kozyrev said, indicating that Russia would not intervene militarily on the Bosnian Serbs' behalf.
 
Traditional Ally of Serbs
 The Russians have for centuries been allies of the Serbs, who share their Eastern Orthodox religious tradition. Moscow has given the Serbs diplomatic support throughout the Bosnian conflict, and Russian businessmen have been among the most energetic in breaking the United Nations economic sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro for backing the Bosnian Serbs' carve-up of Bosnia.
The peace plan, developed by diplomats from the "contact group" countries -- the United States, Germany, France, Britain and Russia -- would give the Serbs control of 49 percent of Bosnia's territory and would force them to recognize the country's sovereignty, at least temporarily.
The Muslim-led Bosnian Government accepted the peace proposal even though the plan would give the nationalist Serb rebels control of many Muslim-majority towns whose residents had been forced from their homes or killed by Serbian gunmen since the Serbs began the war in April 1992.
The Bosnian Serbs' self-styled presidency again rejected the contact group's proposal this afternoon, saying eventual acceptance would require adjusting the plan to grant the Bosnian Serbs additional territory and provide for recognition of their "sovereignty."
 
Bosnia's Response
 The President of Bosnia, Alija Izetbegovic, has warned the contact group that the Bosnian Government would reverse its acceptance of the plan if the Serbs were granted sovereignty over the lands they had seized by force with weapons supplied by the Yugoslav Army.
"The Bosnians are not interested in renegotiating anything," said a Western diplomat, adding that the Sarajevo Government feared that the contact group might abandon its insistence that the Bosnian Serbs accept the plan as is. "The Bosnians are being very smart about this," said the diplomat, who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
The foreign ministers of the contact-group countries met in Geneva on Saturday. Backing off from earlier statements about punitive military measures against the Serbs, they warned that they would recommend that the United Nations Security Council tighten the economic sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro because the Bosnian Serbs had rejected the plan.
The United Nations trade embargo with Serbia has to a great extent broken down for lack of enforcement. But an international freezing of Serbia's assets, the country's isolation from the world banking organizations and the closing of the Belgrade airport have hurt the Serbian economy.
 
Blockade of Sarajevo
 Clearly angry at the diplomatic pressure from the contact-group countries, the Bosnian Serbs have effectively blockaded the land routes into Sarajevo, intensified sniping attacks on pedestrians on the streets of the Bosnian capital and forced the cutoff of international relief flights into the city by targeting aid planes with gunfire.
The Bosnian Serbs have again stepped up the expulsion of minority Muslims from towns that would fall to the Serbs under the peace proposal, United Nations officials said today.
Serbian gunmen expelled 37 Muslims -- including 22 women and 9 children -- from the Bosnian town of Bijeljina on Sunday, said the Sarajevo spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Peter Kessler.
The refugees who arrived in the Bosnian Government-controlled city of Tuzla said the Serbian gunmen had taken 17 Muslim men to a labor camp near the village of Lopare.
The Serbs have not let representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross into the Lopare camp. "The Serbs are saying that the men being held there are 'suspected terrorists,' " said a Red Cross spokeswoman in Sarajevo.
The Serbian gunmen, under the command of Volkan Djurkovic, an underworld figure who runs a local "population exchange agency," have expelled some 225 Muslims from Bijeljina in the last two weeks. "This is premature, tendentious application of the peace plan," said the Western diplomat, referring to the Bosnian Serbs' "ethnic cleansing" in Bijeljina and other recent forced departures of Muslims from the northwestern Bosnian city of Banja Luka.
This bout of "ethnic cleansing" in Bijeljina is the latest episode in a grim saga that began in April 1992 when a criminal gang from Belgrade with close connections to Serbia's secret police killed hundreds of Muslims and expelled thousands more from the town.

HEADLINE: In Warsaw, Former Enemies Commemorate 1944 Uprising

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WARSAW, Aug. 1

 BODY:
More than 200,000 victims of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against Nazi occupation were honored today as Poland commemorated the 50th anniversary of the uprising, one of the most bitter ordeals of World War II.
Today's ceremonies, attended by Vice President Al Gore, represented not only a tribute to fallen heroes, but also a gesture of reconciliation to former foes. Unlike the D-Day commemorations, which excluded Germans and Russians, officials from both those countries stood at the side of President Lech Walesa today. 
 Sirens sounded at 5 P.M. to commemorate the opening shots of the uprising. For 63 days, the Polish partisans tried to drive the Nazis from the capital. By the time the rebellion was finally crushed, 90 percent of Warsaw had been reduced to rubble and 200,000 Poles were dead.
"I ask for forgiveness for what Germans did to you," Germany's President, Roman Herzog, said at the Uprising monument today. "What we need is trust and understanding, and that can only grow when our peoples put the dark aspects of their recent history completely into the open."
Mr. Walesa said that for the sake of future generations the time had come "to stop being guided by the past."
But Poles remained divided over whether they were willing to forgive. The presence of German and Russian leaders angered many Poles because of Nazi brutality toward civilians during the uprising, and the failure of the Soviet Army to aid the insurgents.
Mr. Herzog said he understood the anger, but that his turning down the offer would have been "a grave sin against all of Europe and the fate Polish and German children."
"Only history divides us now," Mr. Herzog said, alluding to the fact that Germany is one of Poland's largest trading partners and the most vocal supporter for early NATO and European Union membership for Poland.
The Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, who sent an aide, was criticized here for putting domestic politics before European reconciliation. Officials in Moscow told the Polish press that Mr. Yeltsin did not attend because he feared that yet another apology for Soviet actions would draw fire from Russian nationalists.
His absence was seen as a signal that Polish-Russian relations, which have been strained because of Moscow's opposition to Polish NATO membership, would remain cool.
At a luncheon for foreign leaders, Mr. Walesa pressed for the expansion of Western economic and security structures, saying: "The order that has prevailed for half a century has been spent. It has been replaced by a better one, one that will allow us to live as one family."
In the past, Communist authorities here banned gatherings of the insurgents.
Today, 6,500 uprising veterans wore their medals openly.

HEADLINE: Altman's Double Life as a Politician Brings Him to the Edge of Scandal

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The Congressional hearings on Whitewater that will delve into the handling of Whitewater matters by Roger C. Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, had opened last Tuesday morning. And there he was that night, lanky and amiable, chatting with the Clintons at a black-tie State Department reception for the leaders of Jordan and Israel. The powerful of Washington were gathered there, and to some, Mr. Altman's appearance seemed to proclaim, "I am one of you, and I am staying."
Certainly Mr. Altman, a quietly intense man, holds a high public office, which has been his goal since the 1960's, when, as a graduate student in business, he first tasted politics, taking time off to campaign for Robert F. Kennedy. Until Whitewater washed over him, Mr. Altman seemed on track to succeed Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. He remains a member of the inner circle of President Clinton's economic advisers, and his colleagues have rallied to him, hoping for a vindication that would be the Administration's as well. 
 "Roger is one of the six or seven people who is always consulted on any significant economic position," said Gene Sperling, a deputy to the President on economic policy. "That continues right now."
But Mr. Altman's juggling of roles on Whitewater has brought the sort of criticism he would not have received in his other life, as an investment banker -- and he is as much an investment banker as he is a politician.
Except for a stint in the Carter Administration, Mr. Altman, who is 48, spent the 70's and 80's on Wall Street, growing very wealthy. Investment bankers often glide between Wall Street and Washington, of course. But while the juggling of roles that are at odds works on Wall Street, and even is applauded there, it can leave an investment banker who goes into politics vulnerable, particularly in a tricky case like Whitewater.
 
Strong Opinions
 "A unique thing about investment banking is that it allows for multiple roles," said Jeffrey E. Garten, an Under Secretary of Commerce who has worked on Wall Street with Mr. Altman and admires him very much. "You are not penalized in your career for taking strong public positions that may or may not be consistent with the flow of deals."
As vice chairman of the Blackstone Group, a Wall Street firm partly owned by Japanese, Mr. Altman represented Japanese companies as theyacquired American operations. But as a man deeply interested in public policy, he became concerned that Corporate America was losing out competitively to Corporate Japan. And Mr. Altman said so in bylined op-ed articles, even as he helped Japanese companies make more deals.
Mr. Altman was a co-author of a 1987 article that argued against letting Japanese companies dominate the semiconductor industry. "We are witnessing a staggering decline in American electronics," the article said. "Such a prospect is anathema to our economic future."
Mr. Altman's Treasury job forced on him a similar juggling of roles, but under harsher scrutiny. Early in his tenure, he took on an additional task: acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which administers insolvent savings and loan associations. As Deputy Treasury Secretary, Mr. Altman was forced to take the second job while the President sought a permanent appointee. But as the R.T.C. chief, he became aware that the agency would recommend a criminal investigation of the failed Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, and its role in the Clintons' investment in the Whitewater real estate development.
Today, Mr. Altman will tell the Senate Banking Committee what he did with this information. He will argue that while he gave the White House some information about the pending inquiry, he never went beyond what was legal and ethical. He will undoubtedly be asked to explain why he hesitated to recuse himself from the case, in the face of his two conflicting roles: as a Clinton loyalist and as the acting chief of an agency potentially suspicious of Mr. Clinton.
 
Loyalty to the Top
 Mr. Altman hewed to a standard of behavior that on Wall Street would be acceptable but in Washington often is not. He recognized this. In a handwritten letter to the President in late February, he apologized for embarrassing Mr. Clinton and said he had finally recused himself after "it became clear that appearances of a conflict were taking hold."
To those who knew him in New York, Mr. Altman's behavior is consistent with his reputation for forging loyal ties to his boss -- his boss of the moment. His eagerness to please Mr. Clinton, and protect him, may have helped to enmesh Mr. Altman in Whitewater, some who know him say.
As a young investment banker, Mr. Altman became close to Peter G. Peterson, chairman of Lehman Brothers. But when Mr. Peterson lost control of Lehman in 1983 to Lewis L. Glucksman, the firm's chief of trading, Mr. Altman and other top partners switched allegiance, inviting criticism that they should have challenged the Glucksman coup. Mr. Peterson is not among the critics.
"Roger had a very good career ahead of him at Lehman, and I told him it was the right decision for him and the firm to cooperate enthusiastically with Lew," Mr. Peterson said. Mr. Altman did cooperate. Mr. Peterson later founded the Blackstone Group and Mr. Altman joined him again, in 1987, after Lehman had been taken over by another firm.
In politics, Mr. Altman attached himself early to Gov. Jimmy Carter, mostly as a fund raiser. In the Carter Administration, he became the Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Domestic Finance. That gave him a role in negotiating the Federal Government's $1.5 billion bailout of the Chrysler Corporation. Once back on Wall Street, Mr. Altman became Chrysler's investment banker.
During the Reagan-Bush years, he raised money for Vice President Walter F. Mondale, then Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and, finally, Gov. Bill Clinton. Locally, he forged ties to Mayor Edward I. Koch and then Mr. Koch's successor and nemesis, Mayor David N. Dinkins, advising both.
After Mr. Clinton was elected in 1992, he urged Mr. Bentsen to take Mr. Altman as his deputy. Once in the job, Mr. Altman became the favorite to succeed the 73-year-old Treasury Secretary.
But for all that is riding on today's testimony, Whitewater is not the first crisis, or the worst, in the life of Roger Charles Altman. When he was 10, his father, a Boston food broker, died. His mother brought up two sons on a Boston librarian's meager salary, not enough for college. Scholarships helped him through Georgetown University, where he met Mr. Clinton, and the University of Chicago's business school. But he also sold frozen pies or cooked for his roommates to make ends meet.
A first marriage, in his 20's, ended in divorce, and Mr. Altman did not marry again until he was 35, and he and his wife adopted three children. Then in 1992, he collapsed while jogging in Central Park in Manhattan, the victim of an irregular heartbeat. An emergency crew got his heart going again, but it was weeks before "he got his life back," as a friend put it, and also returned to jogging.
Mr. Altman takes medicine now to control his heart arrhythmia and he wears medical alert "dog tags" that explain his ailment. Most mornings he jogs in the Georgetown neighborhood where he rents a home. During those runs he invariably stops at a Roman Catholic church to pray for a few minutes.
 
Driven to Succeed
 The hardship that kept Mr. Altman so poor as a youth pushed him onto Wall Street, in search of a good living. He joined Lehman Brothers in 1969, weeks after receiving his M.B.A.; by 1974, at the age of 28, he was a partner, the youngest in the firm's history. That says something about his skill.
"He has this touch with clients, in being able to put himself in their shoes and figure out how they see the world; he is very empathetic," said Mr. Garten, the Commerce official who was a colleague at Lehman Brothers and, later, at Blackstone. Mr. Altman was less skilled at creating the complicated securities used in merger deals, "but he could arrange the deals and explain their intricacies," Mr. Garten said, "in ways that chief executives could understand."
In Washington, Mr. Altman and Mr. Bentsen, while supportive of each other, have very different styles. The courtly Mr. Bentsen is punctual and gives full attention to each visitor. Mr. Altman, in contrast, runs late, and visits with him are invariably interrupted by phone calls and by aides entering unannounced.
"Roger has a great ability to handle multiple issues simultaneously," said Frank N. Newman, an Under Secretary of the Treasury. "He can be in the middle of a discussion with one group of people and get interrupted by a phone call on another issue, and switch to that, and, without missing a beat, go back to the original discussion."
More than anyone else, the busy Mr. Altman represents Treasury in the daily give and take at the White House. Last weekend, he was giving advice on the dollar, said Mr. Sperling, the White House aide, even as he prepared his Whitewater testimony.

HEADLINE: In Selma, Everything and Nothing Changed

SERIES: New South and Old: Third of four articles.

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SELMA, Ala.

 BODY:
Bob Mants came to the Alabama Black Belt to work for civil rights in 1965 and still has a cattle-prod scar in his back to remind him of "Bloody Sunday," the attack on civil rights marchers here that evoked the worst of the dying empire of Jim Crow.
Mr. Mants is still here working as director of a hand-to-mouth economic development agency, trying to bring jobs to desperately poor Lowndes County. But his dream that he would see an old order steadily giving way to a new and better one died long ago. 
 "I thought back then, if there was any place I wanted to raise my kids, it would be here, because they could see black people moving forward, advancing ourselves as a race," said Mr. Mants, 51, who on that fateful Sunday stood second in line behind John Lewis, now a United States Representative from Georgia, as mounted sheriff's deputies attacked and sprayed tear gas on marchers advocating voting rights. "I was naive. People may even be poorer now than when I came here in 1965. The progress hasn't taken place."
No one can say the old Alabama cotton country is the same place it was during the 1960's, when civil rights workers -- blacks like Jimmie Lee Jackson and whites like the Rev. James Reeb and Viola Liuzzo -- were killed trying to get blacks the right to vote; when the Black Panther Party was formed in Lowndes County, and when Bloody Sunday and the Selma-to-Montgomery march led to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Today, in a region where they were long denied the right to vote, blacks hold as much political power as any other place in America, controlling most of the local and county governments in this southwest corner of the state.
But instead of a place transformed, the Black Belt, so named for the color of its soil, not the bulk of its population, is a reminder that though the civil rights movement ended one world, it did not create another.
The schools here are generally still segregated, with the old white public schools virtually all black and the whites -- working class as well as wealthy -- in private academies. The racial violence of the past is largely gone, replaced by a flood of drug-related, black-on-black crime that dwarfs the violence of Jim Crow. The civil rights leaders of the 1960's are now the entrenched political class, but the state-mandated tax code still protects the interests of the white landowners who preceded them. The median family income of $18,349 is about half the national average and $10,000 below the state average, in a state that is one of the poorest.
Perhaps worst of all, it is a place where blacks and whites, like punch-drunk boxers, are still fighting the same old battles of race.
"If the swords had been laid down long ago, things could have progressed further," said James E. Ware, who is black and who now heads the Dallas County welfare department in Selma. "Here we are the cradle of the civil rights movement, the mecca of the Voting Rights Act. You'd think that with all the sacrifices that were made and the lives lost, we could have found a way to capitalize on it. What saddens me most is that we've never done that."

 The rich black humus of the Black Belt was built up over millions of years from the remains of the tiny shelled organisms in what was once a shallow marine sea.
The black soil begat cotton, and cotton begat a flourishing economy based on slavery. And just as millions of years of geologic history determined the Black Belt's economic destiny, the economics of the past have shaped the identity of the Black Belt today, a place that is 66 percent black and one of the poorest parts of the United States.
With its enduring landscape of white-columned antebellum houses and weathered shotgun shacks, its social ritual of cordiality masking dense layers of turmoil, the Black Belt defines the South of William Faulkner, where the past is inseparable from the present, where the dead still walk, and where everything has changed and nothing has.
The past is alive in the ledger dating to 1928, proudly displayed in the Old Beechwood Grocery near Hayneville, with its rolling pine floors, dusty canned foods and a 1937 Chevy and a 1940 Packard rusting outside. It is alive in the 19th-century portraits of the founders of the J. B. Hain Company, a cotton and agricultural firm that operates from the back of the Old Sardis Store south of Selma. It is alive in the countless Old South and Civil War and civil rights and Bloody Sunday observances with which blacks and whites celebrate their separate histories.
And mostly it is alive because, for all the sacrifice and triumph of the civil rights era, nothing touched the economic structure that continued to give whites control of the land, the jobs and the capital as well as the tax system that revolves around them.
 
'Our Critical Mistake'
 "When the civil rights movement ended, institutional building didn't begin," said Rose Sanders, who is black and a prominent civil rights lawyer in Selma. "People were so elated to have a victory, to have a President say, 'We Shall Overcome' and sign the Voting Rights Act, that many people thought the battle was over. That was our critical mistake. Now there are less institutions, particularly economic institutions, that meet the needs of black people than there were 30 years ago."
The statistics are dismal. Though the South led the nation in population growth in the 1980's, the 10 Black Belt counties saw their population fall by 13 percent, to 187,994, with a net migration out of 29,052 people.
More than half the blacks live in poverty, led by Wilcox County, where the black poverty rate is 60 percent. Only 10 percent of Wilcox County's whites live in poverty. In Lowndes County 5.8 percent of whites live in poverty and 50 percent of blacks do. In Selma, home to most of the Black Belt's wealth, median household income for whites is $25,580. For blacks it is $9,615.
Selma, with a population of 24,000 in a metropolitan area of 31,000, lost one of its economic underpinnings in 1978 when Craig Air Force Base closed, eliminating 2,400 jobs. The agricultural economy that supported small black and white farmers in the civil rights era has collapsed, leaving the industry to big agricultural and timber interests.
"I made loans 30 years ago of $100 secured by a mule, a wagon and a plow to put in a crop," said Richard P. Morthland, the white chairman of the People's Bank and Trust Company of Selma. "Since then, the whole system of sharecropping has fallen to pieces. Thirty years ago, a farmer who had $100,000 in his equipment was a major investor. Today, you couldn't buy one cotton picker for $100,000."
 
No Industrial Plums
 Other than the jobs no one wants, like those at the nation's largest toxic-waste dump, in Emelle, about 100 miles northwest of Selma, almost none of the industrial plums that the South has won in recent years have come to the Black Belt, the Mississippi Delta or any of the South's other largely black rural areas.
"A lot of these corporate representatives or folks in economic development will tell you that corporations are reluctant to locate in places where the black population is 35 percent or more," Mr. Mants said.
To climb out of poverty, blacks depend on some of the worst schools in the nation. Testimony in a landmark school-equity lawsuit last year described Black Belt schools as having sewage leaking onto playgrounds, library books infested with termites, fire ants roaming the concrete floors and tables supported by milk crates.
In the city of Selma, and nearly all of the surrounding counties, public schools are virtually all black, particularly once students get to high school. The one exception is in Dallas County, outside Selma, where there is still a fair degree of integration in schools that are 75 percent black. Indeed, in many of the small cities of the South, where the black population is not as dominant as it is in Selma, the city schools are largely black and most whites go to the county schools, which are usually controlled by whites.
In Alabama, the problems of poverty are compounded by a state tax code that leaves most of the wealth base off the tax rolls, making the black electoral gains in the Black Belt a hollow victory.
The tax code is a result of legislation passed in 1972 and affirmed in 1978 and 1982 giving extraordinary tax breaks to landowners; in the Black Belt that means the white owners of the timber and farm land. The legislation pegged the value of farm and forest land at an arbitrary value set in 1982 and said that value could not be increased. As a result, an acre of timberland that is taxed at $3.93 to the east, in Georgia, and more than $4 to the west, in Mississippi, is taxed at only $1 in Alabama.
"It doesn't matter what color gets elected at the city or county level," said Keith Ward, an Auburn University political scientist and an expert on Alabama's tax policies. "They have no authority to make the tax burden any more equitable than it now is."
Many blacks and whites say the problems also reflect the reality that more than improving education, black control of the schools has simply shifted the flow of patronage jobs, to blacks from whites, in an area where local government jobs are often the only jobs.
"Blacks didn't have a problem with the model of political power," said Wayne Flynt, a white professor at Auburn University who has led the state's efforts to overhaul education, often finding himself on the side opposite from educators in poor black areas. "Their only problem was that it was whites who were in control of handing out the jobs. We've gone from patronizing, condescending, self-serving white rule to patronizing, condescending, self-serving black rule."
 
The Races
Resegregating The Schools
 In the spring of 1990, just as Selma was preparing to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, something eerie happened.
Amid torrents of rain, the Alabama River crested at its highest level in 100 years. Elmwood, the city's oldest cemetery, was flooded, sending coffins bobbing to the surface.
It summed up a year's worth of turmoil that showed once again that racial division here has not died.
First came a battle between blacks and whites over who would control the commemoration of Bloody Sunday. Next came a showdown over Selma's first black school superintendent, whose contract was not renewed by the school board in a vote along racial lines. After that came a boycott and takeover of the schools by blacks led by Mrs. Sanders and her law firm. Schools were shut down for a week amid threats that blacks would shut down the city as well.
In the ultimate role reversal, the National Guard was called in to protect minority -- that is, white -- students and keep the peace. When the unrest was over, Selma was on the way to resegregating its schools. Selma High School, where 411 of the 1,200 students were white in 1989, now has only a handful of whites, most of them orphans from the city's Methodist Children's Home.
Mrs. Sanders argues that the boycott was needed to end the education policy of tracking, in which blacks were routinely steered to the slower classes, leaving the accelerated ones for whites.
"The same people that were told 100 years ago that they couldn't build businesses, that they were inferior, have an educational system that reinforces the same thing today," she said.
 
Conceding Public School System
 Blacks do not have to go back 100 years to find reasons to be suspicious. In the mid-1980's, an extensive Federal investigation of allegations of voter fraud in the Black Belt produced indictments of eight black elected officials. The prosecutions resulted in only one felony conviction, which was later overturned and one plea bargain for a guilty plea on a misdemeanor charge. Many black politicians were left convinced that whites would do anything to roll back black gains.
But though most people believe that tracking was an issue, there is much dispute about how pervasive it was. And even many who think tracking was a problem say the boycott was so divisive that it all but killed community support for the public schools.
Whites, many of whom had worked to build and maintain the interracial makeup of the public schools, were embittered. The resentment only deepened over time among working-class whites, who pay taxes to public schools they believe they cannot use and then pay for private schools they believe they cannot afford. Many believe that the real agenda of the boycott was to recreate a world that guaranteed black valedictorians, black homecoming queens and black class presidents -- a return to segregation, but with the public resources going to blacks.
"My kids went to school with black kids, they made their first communion with black kids, they competed in school with black kids, and to me that was a wonderful thing," said Alston Fitts, who is white and who works for the Edmundite Missions, a Roman Catholic organization that does health and education work in the Black Belt. "The greatest disappointment to me was how much of that was swept away by the debacle. I remember my friends telling me, in great distress, that their children were now more racist than their parents had ever been, not out of ignorance but out of bitter experience that they were generalizing and making absolute."
Even many blacks believe that the boycott was a disaster for the schools and for Selma.
"It was almost like an attempt to relive the 1960's that caused a lot more harm than good," Mr. Ware said. "Now whites have pretty much conceded the public school system to the blacks. But if you don't have the support of the community, if people with wealth don't invest in what you're doing, then what difference does it make who's in charge?"
 
Down the Road
Murky Issues Seem Daunting
 Just five years ago, Selma recorded four murders. Last year it had 16, most involving young blacks killing one another. So far this year there have been five, but no one sees that slower pace as a sign of a big downturn in drugs and violence among black youths.
"We had two young black children murdered like dogs this week, only you don't kill animals the way we're killing children," Mrs. Sanders, the lawyer, said in April. "We never had crime like this in Selma. Now it's impossible to find a community in the rural South that does not have a crack house."
Unlike the morally clear goals of the civil rights era, the issues in Selma today -- crime, drugs, jobs and education -- are as murky and daunting as they are everywhere else. And though the politics here invariably break down along racial lines, the views of ordinary people on how to address those issues often do not.
Almost as many blacks as whites are quick to bring up welfare when they talk about why the revolution of the 1960's produced such mixed results.
"Whosoever wrote the welfare bill knew exactly how to mess up a race of folk," said the Rev. Fairro J. Brown, the black pastor of the Selmont Community Baptist Church in Selma.
 
The Need for Jobs
 He sees the shortage of jobs as Selma's biggest problem, but then says that jobs alone are not the answer -- that what is also needed is a fundamental improvement in the black family.
"Most of these fellows would rather be working than to be in jail," Mr. Brown said. "Unless he's extraordinarily sorry. You know some people are so sorry they wouldn't work if you got them a job in a factory eating holes out of doughnuts."
Even among many veterans of the civil rights movement, there is a sense that the new black politicians are, well, politicians, not the exemplars of virtue they could appear to be when contrasted with the evils of segregation.
"Now that they have gotten a chance to be in office, they are doing some of the same things the white ones are doing," said Sarah Logan, a retired black teacher, who was dismissed in the 1960's for joining the civil rights movement in Lowndes County. "Just like the white people, they have their own little ring, their own friends to take care of."
Yet there are people here who are still trying to make things work. There are groups like One Selma, made up of 30 black and white professionals and business people who gather at a meeting room at a local hospital every Tuesday morning for earnest conversation about bridging the divide. There are Afro-centric cultural programs for black youths, run by Mrs. Sanders, that have won national praise.
People genuinely want to move forward. But in an area that is poor and black, where the glistening new South of corporate relocations and shopping malls seems as distant as Jupiter, people just don't know how.
 
Through It All
 At the time of Bloody Sunday, Selma's Mayor was a young segregationist named Joe Smitherman.
Today, Mr. Smitherman, still Mayor, sits in his office chain smoking amid 30 years of civic proclamations and photos, a shotgun leaning against a wall, old cigar boxes, an antique cash register, a Bear Bryant houndstooth hat.
Mr. Smitherman, who has skillfully slid toward the political center over the years, says this will probably be his last term. But he does not see Selma's inevitable election of a black mayor, either when he steps down or after that, as fundamentally changing things.
"The old Selmians, the people of wealth, they'll still be powerful people, whoever the mayor is, whether's he's black or white," Mr. Smitherman said, the cigarette smoke curling around the City of Selma seal behind him. "You can't run a city without money. You've got to deal with bankers. It won't be the South as we've known it. It won't be Selma, Ala., as we've known it. But it will still be Selma."

HEADLINE: OFFICIALS APPROVE PLANS TO REBUILD WEST SIDE ARTERY

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Rejecting more ambitious and costly proposals for a roadway that would dip under and rise over intersections, transportation officials have chosen to reconstruct the West Side Highway as an enhanced version of what is there today.
The $380 million plan is a drastically scaled-back successor to the Westway project, an Interstate highway proposed in 1974 that was to tunnel through landfill and under new real-estate development along the Hudson River shoreline of Manhattan. When the Westway project was abandoned in 1985, its cost was estimated at $2 billion. 
 Under the new proposal, the highway would be rebuilt as an "urban boulevard" for five miles, from Battery Place to 59th Street. The roadway would be at surface level, crossed by numerous intersections, divided by a tree-lined median and bordered by a walkway and bicycle path on the river side.
Perhaps the most notable change, besides the addition of pedestrians, cyclists and greenery to the dilapidated route, would be the straightening of a notorious S-curve in the highway at 23d Street and the expansion of a small triangular park there.
With its selection by state and Federal transportation agencies, the boulevard project has advanced farther in the planning process than any proposal since Westway.
Financing is in place for the first three years of what is seen as a seven-year project, said Robert J. Ronayne, executive director of the project for the State Transportation Department. The Federal Government is expected to pay 85 percent of the cost, with the rest from the state.
He said traffic would continue to flow along the West Side route during construction, which could begin in 1996, barring complications. But complications are almost guaranteed with a project of this size, in a critical location, with a contentious history and many concerned neighbors.
The endorsement of the boulevard plan by the Transportation Department and the Federal Highway Administration was widely expected.
Before contracts are signed, the final design must be completed. Then the project must clear at least one more regulatory hurdle. Also, now that it is an official choice -- rather than one of several alternatives -- the boulevard plan could be the subject of lawsuits by opponents who believe that officials have paid too little attention to the road's effect on both the natural and urban environments.
State and city officials said nonetheless that they were confident that a new roadway, known formally as Route 9A, might finally be built -- 21 years after most of the dangerously deteriorated elevated highway was closed and 20 years after the Westway was offered in its place.
 
Community Involvement
 "The likelihood is very good," said State Transportation Commissioner John C. Egan. "What distinguishes it from many other projects is the amount of deliberation that's gone into the planning and design stage, the amount of community involvement and the fact that we've built upon the input of the community.
'I hate to call it a highway. It's a boulevard. It doesn't pass through the community; it's within the community and part of the community."
Fran Reiter, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Community Relations, said the Giuliani administration supports the proposal. "I think it does stand a chance of getting built," she said. "There are a couple of pockets of disagreement, but they're the kinds of things that the State Department of Transportation can resolve."
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan said the boulevard proposal was the "best way to get cars moving and make the waterfront attractive and safe." She added: "It commits the largest amount of land west of the highway for a park and esplanade. And it provides a continuous bikeway and walkway."
 
A Fight Is Vowed
 But it is not universally welcomed. One of Westway's leading opponents, Marcy Benstock, executive director of the New York City Clean Air Campaign, said yesterday that the plan "brushes off serious transportation, economic and environmental concerns" and vowed to fight it. She said a better alternative would be to use the transportation money for mass transit and for immediate construction of a bikeway, walkway and park.
Ms. Benstock said the plan failed to anticipate potential development west of the roadway and the effects that development would have on traffic congestion and pollution. She also said it did not comply with Federal rules that require serious consideration of ways to reduce the demand for automobile traffic. Further, she said, the environmental-impact statement ignored potential threats to "an extraordinarily important habitat that is critical for the survival of fisheries up and down the Atlantic."
In contrast, Commissioner Egan said that the proposal was "very sensitive to environmental issues" and that, "if anything, this will limit development." He added that there was still room for change in the project as it went through final design.
During that design, other issues will have to be resolved. These include whether to limit access to the highway from the streets of the West Village and how to control access to the Passenger Ship Terminal from the pedestrian and bicycle paths.
Mr. Ronayne, the project director, said the single governmental approval still needed was an air-quality certificate from the State Environmental Conservation Department.
During construction, he said, almost no traffic would be diverted from the West Side corridor.
Southbound traffic would first be diverted to the area intended for the walkway and bicycle path. Then, the new southbound roadway would be constructed. Next, northbound traffic would be diverted to the new southbound lanes while the northbound segment was built. After that, traffic would be restored to the normal flow and the pathways could be finished.
 
 
Tortuous History of a Highway
 1974: After a dump truck falls through an elevated section of the West Side Highway, officials propose a $1.1 billion project to create a new superhighway and to redevelop the West Side corridor. Named Westway, the highway would run from the Battery to 42d Street and for half of its 4.2-mile route would be tunneled through landfill. Opposition arises quickly; among the opponents are Hugh L. Carey, a Congressman from Brooklyn running for governor, and Representative Edward I. Koch.
 1975: After his election, Mr. Carey joins the Westway camp, rejecting a Federal option to trade in funds set for Interstate projects for money to improve mass transit.
 1978: After his election as Mayor, Mr. Koch agrees with Governor Carey on a plan that includes a state park and state support to freeze mass-transit fares at 50 cents through 1981.
 1981: The Army Corps of Engineers issues a dredging and landfill permit for the Westway. President Reagan presents Mr. Koch with a symbolic $85 million check for the Westway right of way.
 1982: Judge Thomas P. Griesa of Federal District Court blocks the landfill permit, saying the Corps of Engineers failed to assess the landfill's impact on striped-bass hatcheries in the Hudson River.
 1983: A report commissioned by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo recommends abandoning the Westway and trading in the money for funds to benefit mass transit. The Governor rejects the recommendation.
 1984: The Army Corps of Engineers holds two days of public hearings on the Westway and its effect on the environment, especially the striped bass.
 1985: After hearings on the environmental impact, the Army Corps of Engineers issues a new permit, and the matter returns to Judge Griesa. He decides to overturn the landfill permit. But on Sept. 19, citing Congressional opposition, New York's leaders say they will abandon the Westway project and trade in the Federal commitment for $1.7 billion, which would be spent on mass transit and a scaled-down highway.
 1986: A state task force begins considering four alternative plans for what amounts to a modest riverfront boulevard. The panel chooses a half-billion-dollar, six-lane road that includes several sections that would go under or above cross streets. Planners say the proposal would improve traffic flow while also allowing safe access to the waterfront.
 1987: Mr. Koch and Mr. Cuomo endorse the plan, whose price tag has risen to $810 million.
 1988; Now known as Westway II or Son of Westway, the plan faces opposition from environmentalists and community leaders, who say it is much too ambitious. The Department of Transportation evaluates the task force's recommendations as well as other proposals.
 1994: Transportation officials reject Westway II for a street-level project eliminating service roads while adding trees, walkways and bicycle paths. Projected cost: $380 million.

HEADLINE: Yangon Journal;
She's the Junta's Friend (and That's Not in Vogue)

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: YANGON, Myanmar

 BODY:
Her two-tone Chanel pumps were not made for wading through puddles. But there was Miriam Marshall Segal, a white smock pulled over her couture-clad frame, touring her new shrimp-packing plant in a warehouse district in this most dilapidated of Asian capitals.
"Now this, this to me is human rights," Mrs. Segal said, admiring the work of her young, stern-faced Burmese workers as they cleaned and packed handfuls of the morning's catch of meaty Black Tiger shrimp. "We are giving jobs to 200 people here. These people have pride in their work. And that is what human rights is all about." 
 Remarks like those set teeth on edge among human rights campaigners, who say this Manhattan businesswoman has been doing the devil's work in Myanmar, the country formerly called Burma.
Mrs. Segal, they say, is a callous apologist for a military Government that imprisons, tortures and sometimes kills those who dare stand up to it. Nonsense, says Mrs. Segal, who might seem an unlikely candidate for a one-woman crusade to burnish the image of one of the world's most notoriously repressive Governments.
"Most of the people who claim to have great thoughts about this country have never been here," she said.
For someone who made a name for herself as an arbiter of fashion -- in the 1960's, she opened trend-setting accessories boutiques at Henri Bendel, Neiman Marcus and other expensive department stores -- Mrs. Segal could not have picked a less fashionable cause. The junta has almost no friends in the outside world.
"The criticism doesn't worry me because I know what I believe," said Mrs. Segal, whose designer clothes, long crimson fingernails and ruby-encrusted jewelry make her an unusual sight on the crumbling streets of Yangon, formerly Rangoon. She has been doing business in Myanmar for the better part of two decades, traveling here often from her home in New York.
"I am not a political person," she said. "I'm here to do business. But I think most of the reporting about this place is wrong. This country is certainly not all perfect, but it's certainly not all wrong, and we need to recognize what is right."
Mrs. Segal says Myanmar is unfairly singled out for international scorn even as larger Asian countries with equally serious human rights problems -- notably China and Indonesia -- are accorded United States trade privileges and diplomatic recognition.
Her praise for the junta puts Mrs. Segal at odds not only with human rights groups, but also with Washington. The United States has long refused to sell arms to Myanmar and, as a result of the violent crackdown on the democracy movement in the late 1980's, has refused to send an ambassador.
Although the junta has embraced the free market and welcomed foreign investment, few large American corporations do business in Myanmar.
Simon Billenness, chairman of the Coalition for Corporate Withdrawal from Burma, a Boston-based human rights group, said Mrs. Segal "has an unseemly eagerness to provide this regime with character references."
Mrs. Segal recently testified in Congress in support of American investment in Myanmar, comparing the struggles of the Burmese Army to those of the United States during the Civil War.
"Lincoln was also unwavering in establishing his priority -- national unity," she said. "Can we really blame the leadership in Myanmar for doing the same?"
That comparison struck some in the hearing room as absurd, but it clearly delighted the junta, which printed her testimony in full across two pages of the Government newspaper. A page 1 photograph showed Mrs. Segal in discussions with Lieut. Gen. Khin Nyunt, the military's intelligence chief. "A very intelligent man," she said.
With its globe-trotting rags-to-riches drama, Mrs. Segal's life story could have been dreamed up by Danielle Steele. She was born on a fishing boat off the coast of Palestine, the child of Polish Jews eager to fight to establish a Jewish state, and was raised in Australia until, at the age of 18, she made her way to the United States. There she broke into the world of high fashion in New York and made a fortune with her Port of Call boutiques. She will not disclose her age.
Mrs. Segal first came here in 1976 in search of Burmese handicrafts that she could sell as fashion accessories. Her business ties did not become an issue until after the military's crackdown on the democracy movement, in which thousands of civilians were gunned down. In 1989 the movement's leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, was placed under house arrest. She remains in detention only a few blocks from the hotel where Mrs. Segal makes her home in Yangon.
But as Myanmar was turned into a pariah state, Mrs. Segal expanded her business ventures, setting up a fishing company three years ago in a joint venture with the junta. The company is a showpiece of the Government's efforts to open up the economy to foreign investors while holding tight to political power.
Asked about the Government's brutal actions in the late 1980's, Mrs. Segal says "it was a very panicky situation -- when you are faced with a situation like that, what do you do?"
As for Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who was awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize and who is beloved by millions here for her willingness to defy the junta, Mrs. Segal offers an appraisal that is something less than flattering.
"I think she's become a prisoner of the Nobel Prize because it's an incredible thing to live up to," she said. "I don't have criticism of her, but I feel that there should be compromise on her part and on their part. You can't be defiant in a marriage. You can't be defiant in politics. You can't be defiant in business."

DATELINE: VERONA, N.Y.

 BODY:
The blackjack tables are crammed as the Indian leader enjoys a risk-laced, bountiful day, the kind of day he envisioned when he applied to Harvard Law School, the better to get inside the C.E.O. world of the white man.
"An exclusive club," said Ray Halbritter, the New York Oneida Nation's representative and chief executive, who did indeed get his Harvard law degree on top of a business degree four years ago and has gone on to operate his own exclusive club. He runs New York's first Indian gambling casino, Turning Stone, which has just begun its second year netting a sudden fortune in tribal profits and the respect of its job-depressed neighbors here, 30 miles east of Syracuse. 
 "It's about more than making money; we've created a new self-esteem for our people," stressed this 44-year-old son of poverty-steeped Indians who epitomizes the new class of chief executive officers among Indians who must juggle millions in instant riches while repairing centuries of eroded cultural tradition.
 
No Alcohol Allowed
 At least 91 tribal chiefs are spreading casino gambling across the nation among millions of reservation visitors. Only one year into it, Mr. Halbritter is one of the recognized comers, who talks easily of "maximizing our business leverage."
Even without slot machines, banned under the Oneida compact with New York State, his leadership has already made Turning Stone one of the 10 most successful Indian casinos in the nation, according to International Gaming & Wagering Business magazine. Net dollar profits are as yet undisclosed but they most likely run into the scores of millions of dollars, since the gambling action already is in the hundreds of millions.
In terms of tribal culture, Mr. Halbritter is the sort of executive who had alcoholic drinks, a mainstay of casinos, banned at Turning Stone as a poetic payback to history's ravaging of the Indian through drink. He celebrates the gambling handle for its power to send 70 young Oneidas to college and trade schools, when there were only four in 1990. And the casino profits must never be a variation on addictive Federal handouts, he vowed in shaping a housing plan that, unlike those of other tribes, would require matching funds or sweat equity from his people.
"That may sound hardhearted, but it's not," the executive said. "You have to create and not take away incentive from people.". He cited his mother's example in moving from stoop laborer to registered nurse. Thus, he was encouraged to quit the traditional tribal dangers of walking the iron on skyscraper construction and to fulfill his Harvard dreams as a key to tribal modernization.
"Ironworking had a certain level of dignity because it was dangerous and a man needs that, at least as we Indians understand work," said the Oneida leader, a natty, dark-haired figure in a tweed jacket, tailored denim jeans and a wolf-symbol amulet.
"But there's also risk and a greater deal of fulfillment in helping your people," he added, smiling upon some of the 45,000 gamblers who each week crowd the modernistic, low-key casino set on regained tribal woodlands here, just off Exit 33 of the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway.
"The risk is political," he says of the high-stakes negotiations that tribes are facing with state and Federal officials intent on reining in the unexpected prosperity that has come of court decisions bolstering Indian sovereignty. "And there's so much money involved every time you make a decision that everything you have is at risk."
Harvard was the only law school he applied to, Mr. Halbritter noted in recounting his frustration with the limits of tribal politics a decade ago when the white world always seemed to have the upper hand. "I wanted to sort of break into the key of what motivated these people and these politicians and these judges," he said. "I wanted to get the education that, in my opinion, the most powerful people in America have had."
Degree in hand, he turned down a clerkship on the state's high court and plunged back into tribal leadership where, he said, his law degree proves handy "most every day."
 
Sharing the Prosperity
 "The key is that to influence people, you have to understand what it is they want," he said. "Before, I sat at the table and understood what I wanted but not what they wanted. Now I understand the complex world we all live in."
He said he had more than 300 meetings with local officials to assure the community beyond the reservation that it would share in the casino's prosperity through jobs and budget grants.
In terms of business savvy, Mr. Halbritter goes beyond the $300,000 in support funds paid to the county government under the state compact; he voluntarily pays the master planning board an extra $100,000 to better influence the wider effects of the casino boom. He thinks deals in journeying to Manhattan each spring to teach a course on Indian law at New York University. He recently announced that the tribe might finance a new regional water and sewer system both for new reservation housing and as a neighborly boon to local communities.
"It's appropriate because the Oneida Nation was always allies with this country," Mr. Halbritter said of the tribe's position in the Revolutionary War. He took care to invite as many outside politicians as tribal elders to heft shovels together for the ground-breaking of a $25 million casino hotel in July.
"This is part of bringing history full circle," he said, in reference to the six million acres the tribe held and his plans to recoup perhaps 300,000 acres of it. "We were once very wealthy."
 
Seeking Diversity
 With a business degree from Syracuse University to complement his law degree, Mr. Halbritter wants to use the casino's healthy betting handle to diversify beyond gambling because he is convinced that Federal and state political interests will impinge once more on the tribes by legalizing more non-Indian casinos. "The Indian people can't have things too long before the white man begins coveting them," he calmly complains.
But, characteristically, he then shifts into classic Chamber of Commerce resolve to expand the tribe's nongambling business into spheres like organic farming and to create a regional "economic zone that keeps jobs and opportunities in this country, where they belong."
In this, he projected an air of business collegiality rather than triumphalist bragging before the area's impressed local politicians.
"The Indians couldn't have a better advocate than Ray Halbritter," said Michael David Hartwell, an Oneida County legislator who beamed amid the ground-breaking photo opportunity. "He's a modern C.E.O. who keeps his word and backs it tough as an attorney. The tribe's already the county's second-largest employer and they're increasing every day."
He took note of the casino's 2,000-person payroll and the estimated $30 million in local vendor and construction business engendered this year by the 1,100 Oneidas.
For the future, Mr. Halbritter talks less of gambling and more of strengthening tribal culture, particularly through its "consensual democracy" tradition of long discussions within the Oneidas' three clans aimed at practical agreement and individual self-confidence. "You've got to believe in yourself: That's what this is all about," he summarizes of the buzzing casino.
It seems a paradox that he fears that gambling prosperity may make tribes too dependent on charismatic leaders. The Oneida executive, who personally dreams of moving on to a career in writing, said he wanted to leave a system of greater consensual leadership rooted in a cultural sovereignty braced by gambling profits. "The need for political stability is one of the biggest problems that haunts Indian country nationally," he said, cautioning that "all this money can make it worse."
Far from fear, however, it is the sheer fun of the tribe's mushrooming success that occupies the outlook of this Oneida, 20 years after he first walked the iron in surveying the white man's world.
"We've never owned things!" he exulted in managing the millions. "We've never broken ground for a hotel! These are people who were bean pickers!"

HEADLINE: Pataki Unveils a Television Ad Campaign

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 1

 BODY:
In his first major advertising blitz, State Senator George E. Pataki unveiled two television advertisements today aimed at defining who he is for a public that knows little about him or his qualifications to become governor.
Mr. Pataki's campaign would not say how much he spent but called the amount "substantial." The 30-second commercials for Mr. Pataki, a Republican, will be broadcast around the state starting on Tuesday. 
 "The purpose of these spots is to introduce Senator Pataki to the voters that don't know him as well as we would like them to," said Caroline Quartararo, Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman. "We want people to have some background on Senator Pataki and what his qualifications are, what he has done."
But the commercials, by the campaign's own admission, say nothing about Mr. Pataki's plans for governing, should he defeat Gov. Mario M. Cuomo this fall. And many of the ads' assertions about the level of taxation and spending in the state are contradicted by government statistics, although the actual numbers are not especially helpful to Mr. Cuomo either.
One spot is a variation on Mr. Pataki's standard stump speech, in which he claims, "New York State is No. 1 in high taxes, No. 1 in wasteful spending and No. 1 in lost jobs."
"It's a fact," Mr. Pataki says earnestly as he walks toward the camera against a background of soft-focus trees and leaves.
But according to numbers from the Census Bureau and the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the state is not first in state taxes, overall taxes, government spending or jobs lost, except for total jobs lost during the nine-month period (July 1990 to March 1991) defined as the national recession.
Mr. Cuomo's campaign aides were quick to point out the discrepancies, as the Governor's campaign continued to portray Mr. Pataki as not trustworthy and deceptive.
"The first test of leadership is having the courage to be honest, and if you continue to abuse the facts, you're just not passing that test," Joel R. Benenson, Mr. Cuomo's campaign spokesman, said.
Aside from their content, Mr. Pataki's advertisements represent yet another step in a well-orchestrated -- and increasingly well-financed -- challenge to Mr. Cuomo and his effort to win a fourth term as Governor.
The advertisements also underscored the ties between Mr. Pataki and his political patron, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. Under the direction of Arthur Finkelstein, Mr. D'Amato's campaign guru, the advertisements' creators are Russo Marsh & Associates, of Sacramento, Calif., who produced the devastatingly negative, but also humorous, ads against former State Attorney General Robert Abrams during the 1992 Senate race.
The commercials depart from the campaign's ongoing strategy of repeatedly blaming Mr. Cuomo by name and instead seek to introduce Mr. Pataki in two ways: by his resume and for the first time in his ads, by having him speak directly to the camera. Mr. Cuomo is mentioned only once in the two ads.
One ad lists Mr. Pataki's accomplishments, from his academic scholarships to Yale and Columbia, to being the youngest Mayor of Peekskill, to his terms as a state assemblyman and state senator. Mentioning his support for the death penalty and opposition to taxes, they also include the words "husband" and "father" as the ad leads to a conclusion: "uniquely qualified to be a great governor."
Because the ads largely do not attack Mr. Cuomo, they may be helpful as Mr. Pataki runs in the Republican primary against Richard M. Rosenbaum, a former party chairman. Ms. Quartararo said, however, that the campaign -- which has been seeking to dismiss Mr. Rosenbaum as irrelevant -- did not consider him when creating the ads.
Mr. Rosenbaum is set to release a radio commercial criticizing Mr. Pataki's deduction of $9,738 on his income tax return last year by using a Federal tax loophole that applies to all of the nation's state legislators. The loophole allows lawmakers to take a specified deduction even on days when the Legislature is not in session.
"While George Pataki is choosing to ignore the fact that he has a primary on is hands, Dick Rosenbaum is not," said Lisa Linden, the Rosenbaum campaign spokeswoman.
 
 
 
The Ad Campaign -- Race for Governor: Pataki Defines Himself

 
CANDIDATE: George E. Pataki
 
PRODUCER: Russo Marsh & Associates, Sacramento, Calif., and Alexandria, Va.
 
VISUAL: The advertisement runs like a video scrapbook of Mr. Pataki's academic and political career. Against the strains of soft music, it opens with a black-and-white photo of a younger Mr. Pataki speaking at a podium, hinting that he is no newcomer to politics even if few voters know who he is. The rest of the ad rounds off his life, showing newspaper clippings, copies of his diplomas from Yale and Columbia Law School, a shot of him walking out of City Hall in Peekskill, where he served as mayor, and footage of his wife and two of his four children.
 
THE SCRIPT: "Hard work, intelligence, achievement. George Pataki. He grew up on the family farm, earned academic scholarships to Yale University and Columbia Law School. A husband. A father. George Pataki was elected the youngest mayor in his city's history. An assemblyman. A state senator. George Pataki fought for the death penalty and against Mario Cuomo's massive tax increases. George Pataki. Uniquely qualified to be a great governor."
 
ANALYSIS: Republican leaders have been convinced that voters will like Mr. Pataki as soon as they learn more about him. In this first effort to use television to define Mr. Pataki, the Republican candidate is portrayed in the most general terms: as a scholar with rural roots, as a regular family man fighting for his community. The mood is soft and light, nearly devoid of Mr. Pataki's usual attacks on Mr. Cuomo's record, as he tries to build a positive image for himself. The strategy of laying off Mr. Cuomo may be helpful because Mr. Pataki's first fight is against another Republican, Richard M. Rosenbaum, in the party's primary next month.
But as usual in his campaign, Mr. Pataki does not say specifically what he would do if elected. And the ad does not spell out why he is "uniquely qualified" to be governor, a question he will have to answer more fully as the campaign unfolds.
There are few facts to dispute in this biographical ad, aside from the question of "Mario Cuomo's massive tax increases." While some taxes have risen and others have fallen, the tax burden on New Yorkers, by a number of measures, has remained relatively constant since Mr. Cuomo's first year in office. And while Mr. Pataki has been a constant opponent of the budget, all tax increases must also be approved the legislature, including the Republican-controlled Senate. IAN FISHER

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Regain Most of Early Losses

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Interest rates were flat yesterday as Treasury prices regained most of their early losses that came after a morning spurt of data showed glimpses of economic strength.
But traders said it was the dollar's performance in the currency market that contributed to much of the bond market's weakness and later to its near comeback. Over all, the market was quiet and only mildly influenced by reports on construction spending and personal income and the National Association of Purchasing Management index. 
 The price of the 30-year bond was unchanged at 8615/32 , to yield 7.39 percent. The 10-year note was also unchanged at 1011/32 , to yield 7.10 percent. For intermediate maturities, a three-year note was unchanged to 10019/32 , to yield 6.26 percent, and a five-year issue down a tick, to 10019/32 , to yield 6.73 percent.
Traders thought much of the weakness in Treasury prices yesterday was dollar related because of the collapse of trade talks between the United States and Japan over the weekend. The dollar fell to 99.41 yen in New York trading yesterday, down from 100.10 yen on Friday. For foreign investors, a weaker dollar makes investments denominated in the currency less attractive.
 
Dollar Considered Nonevent
 But while the decline of the dollar influenced the market yesterday, Charles Roden, managing director and head of fixed-income investing for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said that in the long run the dollar would be a nonevent for bonds.
"There is a real tug of war going on in the market right now, and it will not take much to tip the balance in terms of lower rates for business or higher rates for investment," Mr. Roden said. "Investors are turning to the short maturities, but my gut feeling is that interest rates may be in their top area now."
Many expect trading of Treasury securities to waffle ahead of the Treasury's refunding announcement tomorrow and the employment report for July on Friday. The size of the next refunding is estimated at $40 billion, including 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds
With the new government securities due to be offered in the second week of August, market analysts and traders find that the tone of the market has not completely shifted despite last week's rally, which saw the yield on a 30-year issue drop 15 basis points, to 7.39 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
The data for July point to a healthier third-quarter economy, which alongside a refunding and the question of Fed intentions is likely to put upward pressure on Treasury yields over the near term.
The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index of manufacturing activity rose to 57.8 percent in July from 57.5 percent in June. The index, despite a slight weakness in the price component, was stronger than expected, traders said.
The price component remained high at 73.1 percent, down just slightly from 73.5 percent. Employment rose to 51.8 percent from 49.1 percent, a very healthy reading, while inventories fell sharply to 45.8 percent.
The association's index overshadowed June construction spending, which was weaker than expected, rising two-tenths of 1 percent. .
The Commerce Department reported that personal spending rose four-tenths of 1 percent in June after a similar four-tenths of 1 percent gain in May. Personal income rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in June, with wages and salaries remaining flat.
 
A Positive Development
 The income report was a positive development for the inflation outlook, said Marilyn Schaja, vice president and money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. She also noted that the significant sharp drop in the purchasing managers' inventories component was another indication of continued improvement in the manufacturing sector of the economy and in the overall economy as well.
At the Treasury's regularly scheduled auction of new three- and six-month bills yesterday, rates dropped to their lowest levels in two weeks. These auctions are often harbingers of where investors are betting rates are headed.
The averge discount rate for the three-month bill was 4.35 percent, down from 4.43 percent last week, while the six-month bill fell to 4.75 percent, from 4.83 percent a week earlier.
Following are the results of the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills:
 
Table: "(000 omitted in dollar figures)"

HEADLINE: Wheat Pact By Canada And U.S.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
Embracing the kind of trade restrictions it has sought to eliminate in foreign markets, the Clinton Administration today struck a deal with Ottawa to sharply reduce Canadian wheat shipments to the United States for one year.
The reduction fulfills a promise the Clinton Administration made last November to help win votes for the North American Free Trade Agreement from wheat-state lawmakers who said that Canadian imports held down wheat prices. 
 Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said today's agreement would not mean higher prices for American consumers. "We don't believe there will be any appreciable cost to consumers although the limitation of wheat imports will have a positive effect on the competitiveness of American wheat farmers," he said in a telephone conference call with reporters.
 
Voicing Criticims
 But lobbyists for the grain trade and consumer advocates criticized the deal. "Clearly this is something that is bad for consumers, and to say otherwise is to try to pull a fast one on the American people," said Bryan G. Riley, the trade policy director at Citizens for a Sound Economy, a conservative consumer group here.
American wheat farmers have contended for years that Canada subsidizes its wheat farmers with a Government marketing assistance program and low railroad freight rates.
Today's pact does not address whether any Canadian wrongdoing took place, Mr. Kantor said, but it calls for a panel of 6 to 10 American and Canadian farm experts to review the evidence and make a report a year from now. American and Canadian officials will then use the report to decide what to do next, he said.
 
Increased Shipments
 Canadian wheat exports to the United States have doubled in the last four years, reaching an estimated 2.7 million metric tons over the last 12 months, including 816,000 tons of durum wheat, used in making pasta. The shipments have slowed the rise in durum wheat prices in the United States, holding down the average price for all wheat and thereby leading to the payment of extra Federal Government subsidies to wheat farmers totaling $680 million over the last four years, according to the International Trade Commission.
Mr. Kantor refused to give the precise level of the new limits on wheat shipments, saying that the pact, negotiated by two Canadian ministers, was still subject to formal approval on Tuesday by the Cabinet in Ottawa; approval is considered likely.
An American official briefed on the deal said the United States would limit Canadian wheat shipments to 1.5 million tons, including 450,000 tons of durum wheat. The limit on durum is important because the United States depends on Canada for 40 percent of its durum wheat but only 6 percent of all wheat imports.
Any shipments beyond the limit would face a tax of $50 a ton. With Canadian wheat prices only slightly below the current United States price of $121.50 a ton, the $50 tax would price any extra shipments out of the American market.
Robert R. Petersen, the president of the Washington-based National Grain Trade Council, which represents grain processors, said that Canadian shipments had already been forecast to fall to 1.7 million tons in the coming year as American farmers recover from a bad crop. He said today's pact would add to forces pushing prices higher.
"Anything below 1.7 is a disappointment and will probably result in higher costs to consumers," he said.
 
Pasta Costs Disputed
 Jula J. Kinnaird, the president of the National Pasta Association, said that semi-processed durum wheat represented a quarter of the cost of a box of pasta, and that prices for this raw material had already almost doubled in the last year as a result of the weak American harvest.
But Karen M. Fegley, the trade director at the National Association of Wheat Growers, said the trade pact should be evaluated in terms of its effect on the price of raw wheat. The wheat in a $1.50 box of pasta costs 8 cents, she said, adding that she expected today's pact to have no effect on consumer prices.
The negotiations that produced today's pact were sometimes heated. The Clinton Administration had warned that it would impose even lower unilateral limits today on Canadian wheat if Ottawa did not strike a deal. Canadian officials had publicly threatened to limit American exports of California wine and Arkansas poultry in retaliation for any unilateral limits -- a threat calculated to win the attention of President Clinton, a former Arkansas Governor whose re-election hopes may hinge on whether he can carry California in 1996.
President Clinton and Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada discussed the wheat issue in Naples three weeks ago at the economic summit meeting of the seven leading industrial democracies. "That was helpful," Mr. Kantor said today.
Canadian officials had an incentive to make a deal today because they are in separate negotiations with American officials on how to open up their highly protected dairy and poultry industries to competition under the North American Free Trade Agreement. But Mr. Kantor said today that those negotiations were separate, suggesting that no American concessions were made in those areas to win today's wheat deal.
Reaction in Congress to today's decision varied by region. Senator Max S. Baucus, Democrat of Montana, a big wheat-growing state, praised the deal, while adding that he would have preferred even lower limits on Canadian wheat shipments.
"It should restore stability to wheat markets and allow Montana farmers to make a living," he said.
But Representative Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat who opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, was much less happy. "It's a sad day for consumers, especially those who eat a lot of pasta," he said. "It's against the spirit of Nafta and against the spirit of free trade, as were many of the side deals made."
Representatives of wheat farmers were pleased, with Ms. Fegley, the lobbyist, cooking pasta for her family tonight in celebration. "I had lost an appetite for it for a long time," she said in a telephone interview from her home as she prepared lasagna. "Things had gotten so personal."

Oil Prices Hit 17-Month High On Growing Nigerian Fears

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Oil prices surged to a 17-month high yesterday on fears that a strike by Nigerian oil workers would further disrupt Nigeria's exports of crude.
The strike by Nigeria's oil workers, which has already reduced exports of the country's rich sweet crude oil, is in its fifth week. 
 The Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which normally accounts for about half of Nigeria's output of roughly 1.6 million barrels a day, said it would not be able to deliver most of its August cargoes on schedule.
 In addition, Nigeria's striking oil unions said yesterday that they would not attend talks with the military-run Government because their demands had not been taken seriously.
 The country's main labor consortium, with some 3.5 million members, is preparing for a general strike tomorrow.
Crude oil for September delivery closed 25 cents higher at $20.55 on the New York Mercantile Exchange after surging as a high as $20.98 -- the highest level since March 1993. September unleaded gasoline rose 1.26 cents to end at 59.97 cents a gallon.
Analysts said oil prices could soar to $23 if Nigeria's exports of 1.6 million barrels a day -- mostly to the United States and Western Europe -- were eliminated. They fear that other oil producers would be unable to make up the shortfall.
Nigeria, a major producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is one of the world's main suppliers of high-quality, gasoline-rich sweet crude oils. Though Nigeria's oil exports could be replaced by higher production from other members of OPEC, analysts still believe that a loss of Nigerian production would push prices higher. Nigerian supplies are vital for American and European refiners at a time of reduced production from the North Sea because of maintenance work this month at Norwegian and British drilling platforms there.
An OPEC official said yesterday that the group was monitoring the situation but saw no reason currently to raise its production.
"Things seem to be getting worse and if the 1.6 million barrels per day is lost to the market, we could see it at $23 easily," said Tom Bentz, energy analyst at Quantum Financial Services. "It doesn't seem like an easy solution is at hand."
For the oil market, the disruption comes as world supplies and demand have been moving back into balance, recovering from 20-year lows of less than $14 a barrel in February.
On other commodity markets, coffee prices leaped after selling off last week. September coffee jumped by 8.85 cents, to 211.60 cents a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York. Traders cited fears that prolonged dry weather in southern Mexico and Central America would affect coffee crops there.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rally Despite Trading Disruption

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
It was another day of crosscurrents in the financial markets yesterday. Despite a computer mishap at Nasdaq, the stock market as a whole rallied for the third consecutive day, amid further evidence that the economy might be slowing.
Meanwhile, bond prices fell but then recovered in the afternoon to close essentially unchanged. The rebound in bonds, which started around 11 A.M., appeared to heighten and accelerate the rise in stocks. The bond surge was probably aided by European investors who appeared to buy back a dollar weakened by the latest chapter in trade friction between the United States and Japan. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 33.67 points, to 3,798.17, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 2.75 points, to 461.01. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index gained 2.69 points, to 724.85.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 258.5 million shares. That was below the year's average, which is 287 million shares, but about equal to the more cautious trading volume posted by traders since June 1, about 259 million shares.
 Trading was disrupted for at least 34 minutes, starting at 1:17 P.M., in the over-the-counter markets by a power interruption, or dip, at the United Illuminating Company, the electric utility that serves the Bridgeport and New Haven areas of Connecticut. A United Illuminating spokeswoman said a squirrel -- "an animal contact" -- may have chewed through a power line, which shut down as a precaution.
But backup power at a Nasdaq computer operation in Trumbull, Conn., did not take over computer operations, a Nasdaq spokesman acknowledged and technicians were trying to determine why. It was the second time in two months that trading was interrupted; a software installation went awry July 15.
William R. Rothe, head of Nasdaq/ OTC trading at Alex. Brown & Sons, said the trading disruption "was a considerable inconvenience that was promptly fixed; on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being major, it was a 5."
Nonetheless, the Nasdaq composite index, like the Dow and S.& P. 500, reacted favorably to reports that seemed to indicate that the economy was not overheating and was not therefore producing inflation that hurts both stocks and bonds.
 
 
Friday's Report
 The new reports followed Friday's report on second-quarter gross domestic product growth that the markets interpreted then as discouraging the Federal Reserve Board from raising interest rates soon.
But, at the same time, other analysts argued that the Friday data did not conclusively prove the economy was slowing. And they said that while the Federal Reserve could choose not to raise interest rates when its policy makers meet later this month, the central bank would still raise short-term interest rates later this year.
A Commerce Department report yesterday showed that consumer spending, the driving force behind the economy, rose a weaker-then-expected four-tenths of 1 percent in June. A National Association of Purchasing Management report indicated that backlogs of orders, a signal of future inflationary pressures, had decreased in July.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was whipsawed by trading in the currency markets. However, the long bond ended unchanged at 8615/32 , to yield 7.39 percent.
The dollar, while sharply lower in overnight trading because of the escalation in Japanese trade tensions, steadied after traders, especially those in Europe, realized there was a 60-day grace period before the harshest American trade sanctions went into effect against Japan. In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 99.41 yen, from 100.10 yen late Friday and declined to 1.5787 German marks from 1.5840 marks.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.43 points, to 254.05, with advancing stocks outnumbering declining stocks by 1,408 to 802. The American Stock Exchange market value index rose 1.93 points, to 439.62.
Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 17 rose, led by United Technologies, which gained 2 1/2, to 62 3/4, following news that it had raised its dividend.
Of the 500 stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 312 rose, led by General Motors, which gained 1 1/2, to 52 7/8.

HEADLINE: Spending and Incomes Up Modestly

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 1

 BODY:
The Commerce Department reported today that consumer spending rose four-tenths of 1 percent in June, a sign that economic growth was slowing.
An increase of just one-tenth of 1 percent in Americans' incomes in June also pointed to slower growth. In May, spending rose four-tenths of 1 percent, while incomes also gained by four-tenths of 1 percent, the Commerce Department said. 
 Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch in New York, remarked, "The U.S. economy is not overheating, but instead growing at a pace consistent with stable inflation."
Other reports today confirmed that assessment. Construction spending rose two-tenths of 1 percent in June, and a widely followed measure of business activity showed a small gain. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported that its index of manufacturing activity rose to its highest level in July since 1988 -- 57.8, up from 57.5 in June. Still, the association said that both imports and backlogs of orders, a measure of pent-up demand, slowed in July. The index is based on a survey of 300 industrial companies.
Analysts said that as higher interest rates took hold and the economy slowed further, the Federal Reserve would probably refrain from an aggressive assault on inflation, as it pursued earlier in the year. The Fed has raised rates four times since Feb. 4.
For the rest of the year, the economy is likely to grow at an annual rate of 2.5 percent to 2.75 percent, said Dana Sorrentino, an economist with Stone & McCarthy in Princeton, N.J. On Friday, the Commerce Department reported that the gross domestic product grew at a slower-than-expected annual rate of 3.7 percent during the second quarter.
The income and spending reports today showed that Americans' wages and salaries grew at a slower pace in June than in May, while Government subsidy payments to farmers continued to decline.
On the spending side, consumers committed less in June to major purchases like cars and home appliances. But their spending increased for food, clothing and services. Spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
 
Americans Save Less
 The Commerce Department also said that disposable income, the money left over after paying taxes, rose one-tenth of 1 percent in June after rising a full percentage point in May. The savings rate, meanwhile, declined to 4 percent in June from 4.3 percent in May.
In another report, the department said construction spending rose two-tenths of 1 percent in June, less than expected. The increase, the fourth in a row, pushed the seasonally adjusted annual rate to $508 billion. This spending increased 1.3 percent in May, a revision up from nine-tenths of 1 percent.
Spending on private projects increased two-tenths of 1 percent in June as outlays for golf courses and parking lots outstripped spending on housing and office buildings.
Spending on public projects also rose two-tenths of 1 percent, spurred by transit systems and outdoor recreational facilities like baseball diamonds and swimming pools.
Compared with a year earlier, total construction spending increased 10.2 percent in June. Still, housing construction is expected to slow in the months ahead amid higher mortgage rates. Starts of new homes, for example, dropped 9.8 percent in June, a previous Government report said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes With Losses As U.S.-Japan Talks Falter

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the Japanese yen and other major currencies yesterday after trade talks aimed at getting Japanese Government agencies to buy more American goods broke off during the weekend without reaching an agreement.
Even so, the dollar managed to pare its losses, rebounding more than one yen from its low in Tokyo trading. Helping the dollar to recover somewhat were reassurances from the White House that it did not favor a weaker dollar as a way to cut the trade deficit. 
 "The dollar is bottoming out," said Michael Perelstein, managing director for international investments at MacKay Shields Financial Corporation, a money management firm. "Today's trading gives me more confidence to say that. This should have been a day when the dollar tumbled."
In February, the dollar plunged as much as 5 percent against the yen when earlier trade talks collapsed.
The dollar was last quoted at 99.41 yen, down from 100.10 yen in New York late Friday. It fell as low as 98.40 yen in Tokyo trading.
The dollar also fell to 1.5787 German marks from 1.584 marks.
The discontinued negotiations on government procurement policies were part of a broader series of talks aimed at reducing Japan's $60 billion annual trade surplus with the United States.
"Traders use any glitch in the trade negotiations as a reason to sell dollars for yen," Mr. Perelstein said. The feeling in the currency market is that "the alternative to diplomacy is to have a strong yen," he said.
The dollar tumbled last year after Clinton Administration officials said a strong yen would help curb Japan's trade surplus by making Tokyo's exports more expensive.
Analysts said the dollar fared better yesterday in part because the Administration was working hard to convince traders that President Clinton and his aides did not want the dollar to weaken, even if trade negotiations failed to curb Japan's surplus.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said yesterday that the United States wanted a strong, stable dollar and that the Administration would not use the dollar as a weapon in its trade dispute with Japan.
"The U.S. has made it clear that it is not using the dollar for leverage" in talks with Japan, said Chris Widness, an economist at Chemical Bank.
Traders were also wary of selling dollars aggressively because the talks on government procurement could resume soon, analysts said.
"They haven't ruled out more talks," said Amy Smith, senior currency-market strategist at IDEA, a consulting firm.

HEADLINE: Way Off Broadway, a Theater Where Art and Celebrity Mix

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAG HARBOR, L.I.

 BODY:
As Sybil Christopher tells it, she was sitting in an outdoor cafe in this low-key tourist town on the south fork of Long Island when the idea first took hold. It was the summer of 1991. With her was Tony Walton, the scenic designer; his wife, Gen LeRoy; his daughter Emma, an actress and director, and Emma's husband, Stephen Hamilton. They were looking across the road at a warehouselike building that had recently housed a disco.
"And somebody said, 'Wouldn't that make a nice theater?' " Ms. Christopher recalled. 
 And so was hatched the Bay Street Theater Festival, with Ms. Christopher, a Welsh-born former actress and nightclub owner, and Emma Walton as co-artistic directors, and Mr. Hamilton, also a former actor, as the executive producer. The producer is Murphy Davis, a founder of the Stonehill Theater Project in Manhattan.
Now in its third season, the festival has proved to be a remarkably apt pairing of enterprise and setting, a showcase largely for new plays in a place that can support them both economically and temperamentally. And by virtue of its pleasant bay-front setting and its proximity to New York City, it's in a perfect position to attract top talent, particularly in the summer. Debra Monk, the Tony-winning actress who finished her role in "Oblivion Postponed," by Ron Nyswaner, at Bay Street a few weeks ago, said she had never been to Sag Harbor before, but she couldn't wait to come back next year, even if she wasn't in a play.
 
Comfort and Creativity
 Sag Harbor has long been known as a kind of non-Hampton Hampton, the second-home site of choice for artists and writers and such. It's affluent, but rather quaintly so, a community with clout in the arts and a fair amount of celebrity in its ranks. That, of course, includes Ms. Christopher, who was once married to Richard Burton, and Ms. Walton, whose mother, Julie Andrews, gave her second concert to benefit the theater in December.
"This town is ideal for this kind of place," said Mr. Davis, who grew up in the area. "It's a place where a lot of artists feel comfortable."
Indeed, the theater has been welcomed as a distant cousin might be. The capital expenditure necessary to make the old disco play-worthy and turn it into a 300-seat indoor amphitheater was kept to $250,000 by the donations and deferred billing of dozens of local merchants. It also helped, Ms. Walton said, exaggerating perhaps only a little, "that we did all the labor ourselves."
Two years ago, Bay Street made its debut with the premieres of "Men's Lives," an adaptation by Joe Pintauro of the Peter Matthiessen book about Long Island fishermen, a particularly fitting choice because both Mr. Pintauro and Mr. Matthiessen live in the area. Since then, at least two plays born there have gone on to productions in New York and elsewhere: "Desdemona," by Paula Vogel, and "Three Hotels," by Jon Robin Baitz.
"Mary O'Connor, the theater architect, is a good friend of Robbie's," Ms. Walton said, referring to Mr. Baitz. "And she told him about us, and he called and said, 'I love Sag Harbor," and 'Anything I can do to help?' And we said, 'Well, do you have a play?' "
 
Safe From the Critics
 The arrival of "Oblivion Postponed" was likewise serendipitous. The play, about two troubled American couples, one straight and one gay, who meet each other on vacation in Rome, is the first work for the stage by Mr. Nyswaner, a screenwriter best known for "Philadelphia." It came to Bay Street because Mr. Nyswaner had belonged to a theater group in Ulster County, N.Y., near the summer home of Mr. Davis's Stonehill group.
"When Stonehill went out of business, they gave us their chairs," Mr. Nyswaner said, adding that he knew almost no one else in the theater world. "So when I finished the play, I sent it to Murphy." Bay Street decided to give it a full production after a well-received reading at the theater last fall. By now the play has already been sought after by the owners of the Minetta Lane Theater Off Broadway, who wanted to move it in to their theater right away. Although that couldn't happen because the cast members had other obligations, the director, Nicholas Martin, said the production would probably reappear somewhere in Manhattan eventually, perhaps by the end of the year.
Meanwhile, the summer's final show opens at Bay Street on Aug. 10.
The play, "Blue Light," is more or less emblematic of the theater's method and mission: to foster new work in an artist-friendly environment without the scrutiny of the New York press. (Only local critics are invited to review the performances.) It's also a production that, like the theater itself, has attracted attention because of its celebrity quotient. "Blue Light" is also by a first-time playwright, although she happens to be 66 and she happens to be Cynthia Ozick, the novelist. It is being directed by Sidney Lumet, who has a home in East Hampton, but who has been so busy with film work that he hasn't directed for the theater in 30 years. And the stars are Mercedes Ruehl, Dianne Wiest, Stephen Pearlman and D. B. Sweeney.
Set in a Miami hotel in 1979, the play began, Ms. Ozick said, as an adaptation of her novella "The Shawl," "but I cut the umbilical cord." It focuses on two women, their memories of the Holocaust, and their encounter with a mysterious stranger.
"I have terribly rigid rules for myself," Ms. Ozick said in a telephone interview, acknowledging her reputation -- as a novelist -- for meticulousness. "I don't do drafts of books. I polish, sentence by sentence, and then go on. But here I've done 11 drafts."
Asked about the experience of entering the playwright's world, she said: "One learns that one is in another place, another art. It's as if you've never been in a museum before. To go into a theater and learn the art of theater! The actors! They are deeply serious artists. I've been learning so much. The costume designer! My god! Her drawings!"
Ms. Ozick's play, too, arrived at Bay Street through the kind of fortuitous connections that eventually make a theater's reputation. Mr. Lumet, an old friend of Ms. Christopher and a member of the Bay Street board, said he got a copy of it from the playwright Herb Gardner, a friend of Ms. Ozick. The same day, Mr. Lumet said, an independent producer, David Brown, called him and suggested he take a look at it. The coincidence made his participation irresistible.
"And I had an extraordinary personal response to it," he said. "It has everything I look for in the theater. It's about something. It seems realistic, but it isn't quite; it's an imaginative source of drama."
It seems obvious that the kind of good fortune that keeps interesting work arriving on the doorstep of Bay Street is, partly at least, generated from within. To wit: For next summer, the theater has its eye on a new musical, a revival and an evening of one-act plays, all with similar themes and settings and a like menagerie of characters, that have been commissioned from local luminaries: Terrence McNally, Lanford Wilson and Mr. Pintauro.
In the meantime, the festival's four executives are moving ahead with plans to embed the theater further in the community's consciousness. In addition to fall and spring play-reading series, its second full-scale winter production is scheduled for Christmastime. This year it's a turn-of-the-century play by James Herne called "Sag Harbor," whose story of a love triangle is set in a building that the stage directions indicate is on the same plot of ground the theater itself rests on today. The ultimate aim is that Bay Street become a full-fledged regional theater for year-round residents.
The signs are good enough that everyone is optimistic.
"We have a 19-year lease," Mr. Hamilton said.
"Which we hope to renew," Ms. Walton added.

HEADLINE: Amid Ethnic Wars, Psychiatrists Seek Roots of Conflicts

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN 

 BODY:
WHEN Vamik Volkan was growing up in a Turkish family on the island of Cyprus, he heard rumors that each knot in the local Greek priest's cincture stood for a Turkish child the priest had strangled. Young Vamik also heard, in tones of dismay, that his Greek Cypriot neighbors ate pigs, considered too dirty to eat in Islamic culture.
Now a psychiatrist at the University of Virginia, Dr. Volkan, who came to the United States in 1957, cites these Turkish Cypriot attitudes as examples of how ethnic hatreds can be kept simmering from generation to generation. Dr. Volkan proposes that a reservoir of hostile biases like these, as well as bitter memories of historical grievances, are shared by members of an ethnic group, and can set off active antagonism in times of group hardship or under the prodding of ambitious leaders. 
 Dr. Volkan's theory of the roots of ethnic conflicts is part of a concerted effort by psychiatrists, anthropologists and political scientists to find the common patterns that might help explain why ethnic identities have become ascendant in the post-cold war world, and how those identities can lead to brutal battles between neighbors.
That question is more compelling than ever at a time when Hutus battle Tutsis in Rwanda, Bosnians struggle with Serbs, Azerbaijanis fight Armenians, and new ethnic tensions seem to flare up weekly around the world.
"These conflicts have always been there -- history can document them wound by wound," said Joseph Montville, director of a conflict resolution project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "But the cold war was a containing structure. With its collapse, people are freer to act on these ancient grievances. It's as though the cops had gone home, and there's no one to answer at 911."
Ethnicity, unlike race, is less a matter of a common gene pool than of shared history, perceptions and group identity. Some of the strongest ethnic divides run between people of the same stock, whether in Bosnia or Northern Ireland, where there are telling differences in history on the two sides.
The dislike of people from other ethnic groups is a byproduct of investment in one's own ethnic identity, Dr. Volkan and others have proposed. When the difference between groups are small, that means greater importance is placed on minor distinguishing features, a phenomenon Freud called the "narcissism of minor differences."
"The closer the resemblance between neighboring groups, the greater the emotion they invest in maintaining small differences," Dr. Volkan said. Thus although on Cyprus both Turkish and Greek men wore identical black baggy pants and shirts, the Turks always wore red sashes and smoked cigarettes from a red pack, while the Greeks wore blue sashes and their cigarettes came in blue packages, a nod to the colors associated with each group.
 
Role of Collective Memory
 A potent source of a people's ethnic identity is a collective memory of their past glories and traumas, Dr. Volkan said. Passing on these memories to the next generation feeds ethnic animosity but helps keep the group's identity alive. "The Greeks remember the fall of Constantinopole to the Turks in 1453; the Jews remember the Maccabees," Dr. Volkan said.
"Past oppression by another ethnic group is remembered mythically, as though the past were the present," said Dr. Eugene Hammel, an anthropologist at the University of California at Berkeley, who specializes in the Balkans.
For the Serbs, one historical trauma that has persisted with freshness in the collective memory is the 1389 defeat of the Serbs and their Christian allies at the hands of the Muslim Turks in the Battle of Kosovo. "Every Serbian child learns about Kosovo," Dr. Hammel said. "It was the beginning of 500 years of Turkish occupation, which the Serbs remember as oppression." Likewise, the Muslims of Bosnia remember "the massacres of Muslims by Serbs in World War II, and dating back to the 19th century."
These memories persist with such power because "it's a sign of allegiance to share these hatreds of the other group," Dr. Hammel said. "If you don't share the myths that breed suspicion of the others, you're a traitor to your own group."
The bitter memory of the Battle of Kosovo was played on by Bosnian Serbs' political leaders who, early in the current conflict, disinterred the remains of King Lazar, who was killed by the Turks at the Battle of Kosovo, and took them to Serbian villages to stir resentment toward Muslims, Dr. Volkan said, "to reaffirm their shared history and identity."
"The present fight is seen by the Serbs as revenge for a 500-year-old defeat, and the Bosnian Muslims are seen as the Ottoman Turks," he said. "The shared reservoir of resentment and past hurts is like an emotional fuel that gets ignited by present problems."
 
Need for Scapegoat
 The immediate spark for ethnic conflict is typically a sudden hardship for a group, often caused by larger events like economic hard times. "When there is great external stress and a sense you are losing control over your own security, you have the urge to strike out at a scapegoat to try to assert some sense of control," Dr. Montville said.
A plunge in world coffee prices indirectly led to a slaughter of Hutus by Tutsis in 1972 in Rwanda, next to Burundi. At the time 85 percent of Rwanda's foreign exchange was from coffee exports, and the drop was calamitous for the economy, said Mr. Montville, especially for Tutsis who worked on the coffee plantations. In April of that year a group of Hutus tried to overthrow the ruling Tutsis, who were suffering much less than Hutus from the country's depression. In retaliation the Tutsis killed 100,000 Hutus, particularly those who were educated, whom they saw as a political threat.
This and several similar episodes of massacre and retaliation between Hutus and Tutsis over the last century "were certainly alive in memory in feeding the current conflict," Mr. Montville said.
"It's wrong to ascribe ethnic conflict to ancient hatreds alone," said Dr. Robert Jay Lifton, a psychiatrist at the City University of New York. "What also needs to come into play is a new political force that fans antagonisms between people who may have lived together without violence."
A group is most susceptible to such political forces "after they have suffered a major dislocation, a loss of their psychological bearings, with their old verities and meanings destroyed," Dr. Lifton said. "When I interviewed Nazi doctors, they recalled the despair of their fathers returning from World War I in abject defeat."
 
Nazi Slaughter of Serbs
 The ideology of leaders who inflame old antagonisms is typically a vision of "revitalizing" their people, who usually have suffered some grave trauma, Dr. Lifton said. "The Serbs were subject to mass slaughter by the Nazis, sometimes with Croat help, and lost half their males in World War II," he said. "Their leaders promise of a 'Greater Serbia' is a way to revitalize themselves, at the expense of other ethnic groups -- the Croats and Muslims -- who are painted as a threat to their own survival."
Once inflammatory leaders egg on ethnic antagonisms, one force that might slow the momentum toward conflict is vocal opposition within their own ethnic group. But these potential opposing forces are sometimes held in check by a psychological tendency of people to overestimate the strength among their own ethnic group of antipathy toward another. This overestimation seems to weaken the resolve of those who might otherwise speak out against ethnic prejudices.
Just how widespread these overestimations are became clear in a 1991 study in four European countries, led by Dr. James S. Jackson, a sociologist at the University of Michigan. In each of the four -- France, Britain, the Netherlands and Germany -- a random sample of citizens was asked their attitudes about working for or having a family member marry someone belonging to a foreign ethnic group. The British were polled about East Indians, Germans about Turks, the French about North Africans, and the Dutch about Surinamese.
While 54 percent of West Germans said they would not want to work for a Turkish boss, they estimated that 76 percent of West Germans held the same view. In France, 35 percent said they would not want to work for a North African, and estimated that 65 percent of French people felt the same. In Britain, 24 percent said they would object to working for an East Indian, and estimated that 53 percent of Britons held that attitude.
 
Interpretation of Findings
 While the larger estimates of bias that people gave for their countrymen could possibly signify their own prejudice in disguise, Dr. Jackson interprets it to mean that people perceive far more prejudice to exist toward ethnic groups than is actually the case. The net effect of this misperception is to suggest a stronger consensus than truly exists for actions against the ethnic group.
The reticence of people who do not hold the biased view to speak up against those who want to attack another ethnic group plays a major role in the escalation of bias to outright violence, said Dr. Ervin Staub, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who has studied the rise of groups like the Nazis.
Their silence eggs on those who speak for an ideology that promises a brighter future if the group's enemies -- another ethnic group already remembered and resented for past wrongs -- are destroyed, said Dr. Staub.
Mr. Montville said: "These historic injuries stay with us. Time does not heal all wounds."
 
Reducing Ethnic Conflict
 Ways to reduce ethnic conflicts are being explored by Dr. Montville and Dr. Volkan. Last year they organized an experimental weeklong workshop with leaders from the Baltic states and Russians living there; tensions between these groups have been high. Over the course of several days, the participants were encouraged to express frankly their grievances, fears and anger to those in the other group.
Once the resentments were expressed, the participants were able to develop a "working trust," partly because of the risk they had taken in being so open with each other, Dr. Montville said. This allowed them to suggest to members of the other group ways to deal effectively with the sensitivities of their own group, and to find confidence-building measures that build trust and overcome antagonism.
A Russian interpreter, for example, asked for a list of phrases and words that Baltic peoples found inflammatory or offensive, and offered to deliver the list to a friend who is a press spokesman for Russia's President, Boris S. Yeltsin. And a Russian academic suggested a joint commission to investigate Soviet war crimes in the Baltics so that Russia could acknowledge its moral responsibility and regret.

HEADLINE: A U.N. License to Invade Haiti

 BODY:
If it persuades Haiti's military leaders to leave on their own, then Sunday's U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing a U.S.-led invasion will have done some good. The resolution contains no deadline, and the Clinton Administration has no plans for an imminent military strike.
Perhaps only the threat of force will convince Haiti's top soldiers they should depart. They viscerally oppose the social and economic changes they believe President Jean-Bertrand Aristide would make if he returns. And they are reportedly profiting handsomely from the status quo. 
 But the threat to use force implies a willingness actually to use it if the military leaders hold fast, and an invasion of Haiti under present circumstances would be a big mistake. Meanwhile, the Administration's strained interpretation of the U.N. Charter to classify the Haitian situation as a threat to regional peace and security damages the U.N.'s legitimacy and invites trouble.
The resolution, orchestrated by Washington, envisions several countries taking part in any invasion, but the operation would remain under direct U.S. military and political control. Presumably, the Clinton Administration will heed its constitutional duty and seek previous Congressional approval, which it may not get. But even a properly authorized invasion would add to the long string of dubious U.S. military interventions in the Caribbean basin during the past century, including a 19-year occupation of Haiti itself.
Some of these actions had nobler ends than others. But very few did any lasting good and each poisoned U.S. relations with the rest of the hemisphere. Significantly, one of the two Latin American members of the Security Council, Brazil, abstained Sunday, while the non-members Mexico, Uruguay, Venezuela and Cuba all spoke out against an invasion. The other Latin member, Argentina, voted yes.
Even though President Aristide implicitly endorsed the resolution, an invasion could weaken his domestic legitimacy while diminishing Haiti's sovereignty. And despite plans to quickly hand off peacekeeping authority to a more broadly based U.N. force, an invasion would saddle the U.S. with political responsibility for controlling the violent vendettas that might erupt once the present repressive structure is disarmed.
To justify the use of U.N. force, Washington recklessly stretched the boundaries of what constitutes a threat to international peace and security under Chapter Seven of the U.N. Charter. Gen. Raoul Cedras's violation of the pledges he made in the Governors Island agreements last year is legitimately an international issue. So is the tide of refugees and systematic violation of human rights. But none of these issues now rise to the threshold necessary to justify invasion. On many of the same grounds, Cuban emigres might well lobby the Clinton Administration to seek U.N. authorization for invading Cuba.
Having taken its lumps trying to be a world police force, the U.N. has now fallen into the unhealthy habit of licensing great-power spheres of influence. In recent weeks the Security Council has commissioned France to send troops to Rwanda and endorsed Russia's "peacekeepers" in Georgia. Now the U.S. is authorized to lead an invasion of Haiti. Such crude power politics damages the U.N.'s standing as an organization valuing the sovereignty of all its member states.
Licensing big-power armies was justified in cases like the Persian Gulf war and the Korean War where the necessary level of force could only be supplied by major military powers. But it is surely not justified in Haiti, with a 7,000-man regular army and a comparable number of lightly armed paramilitary troops.
The Clinton Administration, under attack from critics on the left and right for alleged timidity in deploying U.S. military power, now reveals a dangerously low threshold for using force in Haiti.

HEADLINE: Rush to the Moon Left Us Nowhere to Go

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I agree with some of the regrets expressed in "Wistful Pride and Cynicism Color Americans' Memories of Apollo 11" (news article, July 18), on the value of the 1969 Moon landing. President John F. Kennedy's challenge in 1961 to land a man safely on the Moon before the end of the decade was shortsighted in two respects. 
 First, it seemed just a nationalistic challenge to the Soviet Union, to show this country and the Russians that he was a strong President. Second, the goal was simply to land a man on the Moon and return him safely to Earth.
The tight time frame required the most expedient means of accomplishing the goal, without establishing any technological infrastructure to support human exploration and, ultimately, colonization of the Moon and other planets. Even Launch Pad 39 is useless and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration wants to tear it down.
Thus, after the Moon walks, there were no other feats that could be achieved. The giant Saturn C-5 delivery system was not capable of economically lifting the enormous materials needed for prolonged stays in space. Instead, NASA had to return to the drawing board and develop the type of "space plane," the space shuttle, that would have been developed had there been no rush to get to the Moon. We essentially had to start over where we had left off in 1961.
We got to the Moon first and we got to the Moon on time, but there was nowhere to go from there. We discovered that we had been led down a dead end by President Kennedy's challenge. We then lost interest in long-term space exploration.
If we had devoted the resources, the interest and the enthusiasm to the space shuttle-type, long-term program, we probably would have space stations and colonies on the Moon by now.

HEADLINE: Rwanda's Wounds Won't Heal Any Time Soon;
Our National Interest

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Three months ago, with the outbreak of violence in Kigali, the international community panicked and pulled out of Rwanda. Against the urging of the Secretary General, the United States and others crippled the ability of a United Nations peacekeeping force of 2,500, which had been in Rwanda since 1990, to curtail the killing rampage. 
 United Nations forces were cut to 700. As the world watched defenseless Tutsi and moderate Hutu hacked to death, the Clinton Administration issued platitudes about the limits of peacekeeping; restoring order in Rwanda was beyond the scope of United States "interests."
The results of international inaction are unspeakable: 500,000 brutally killed, 2.5 million refugees, as much as half Rwanda's former population of 8 million displaced, a fragile subsistence economy wrecked, an educated civil service dismembered.
I am heartbroken to read that the refugees streaming into Zaire are now dying of starvation and cholera. My friends and colleagues from a former job in Rwanda are among these wretched, if they are still alive. This is the awful price of doing nothing until it is too late.
Can Rwanda be saved? The international rescue effort has started, and I am thankful the United States is pulling its weight. The mind boggles thinking about the cost in lives and destruction. As costly is the further loss of moral faith in American leadership in the world's eyes.
To those who said peacekeeping in Rwanda was not in our national interests, they deserve to be fired and sent to Zaire to care for the dying. Let us rethink our priorities: the challenge of our day is not to stand on the moon, but to survive together on this earth.

HEADLINE: Chinese Stock Markets Bounce Back, Rising 30%

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Chinese stock prices surged more than 30 percent yesterday after the Government's announcement late last week that it had halted the listing of new stock issues.
On the Shanghai stock market, an index of class A shares, meant for domestic investors, rose by 36 percent. And on the smaller exchange in the southern city of Shenzhen, across from Hong Kong, the A share index increased by 34 percent. Both markets had fallen by more than 75 percent from their highs last year. 
 The upward momentum appeared to be continuing today. At mid-morning, Shanghai A shares were up 10.3 percent, while those in Shenzhen had gained 11.25 percent.
Last Friday's halt on listing new stock issues was part of a Chinese Government effort to reduce inflation, which has risen to about 25 percent a year in large cities, through restricting capital formation. Last year, Beijing raised interest rates and restricted credit to curb price increases. As a result, many state-owned enterprises turned to selling stock as a way to raise capital.
Moving to prop up stock prices should attract investors who might otherwise spend their cash, said Philip J. Suttle, head of emerging-markets research at J. P. Morgan. "They are trying to build up the savings side of the economy, and the last thing you need is a stock market that is declining."
The move is only the latest of several moratoriums on new share issues by the Chinese. The previous halt occurred in February, but was lifted several weeks later. Some foreign investors applauded this step, but cautioned that it was a stopgap.
"The move would be meaningless now if that's all they are going to do," said Mary Yee, an analyst with Smith Barney, adding: "The problem really stems from the lack of regulation and the poor disclosure requirements. Some companies have been listed for two or three years and have not issued an annual report."
The halt is not likely to last much longer than six months, predicted James Polacheck, an Asian markets analyst for Baring Securities in New York. There is a backlog of about 1,700 companies waiting to issue shares, he said. These concerns have already sold restricted stock to employees and other insiders, and those people are waiting for a public listing in order to cash out their investments at large profits.
Yet, these future issues have hung over the markets, helping to depress shares of the 200 or so companies already listed domestically. The Chinese markets are quite volatile because trading volume is low and because they are dominated by individual speculators often operating without access to the most basic corporate reports or financial statements.
"The volatility is a reflection of a very junior, immature market," Mr. Suttle of J. P. Morgan said.
Chinese companies can issue two types of shares that foreign investors can buy. Class B shares are traded on the domestic exchanges, and the other category, class H shares, are traded in Hong Kong and New York. Companies that issue H shares are subject to much more stringent disclosure requirements and therefore attract money from Western institutional investors. B shares are more popular in Hong Kong and with expatriate Chinese, and are much more volatile.
The market capitalization of the A share market is about $60 billion, compared with $5 billion for the B share market, Mr. Polacheck said.
The prices of A and B shares of the same company have often been quite different, depending on the demand for each. Many foreign investors have wanted the two markets to merge in order to eliminate this discrepancy and create greater liquidity. Chinese officials have indicated that they would like to move in that direction, but that it is difficult until the nation fully eliminates currency controls.
On Friday, however, the Government said it would create a means for foreign investors to buy class A shares through fund-management companies.
In the meantime, stocks in Hong Kong also rose yesterday, in part a reaction to the China markets. The benchmark Hang Seng index of 33 stocks increased by 2.6 percent. This morning, though, it gave up part of yesterday's gains.
China's budget deficit has sharply increased recently. More problematic, Beijing has been running a trade deficit as it has imported equipment, raw material and, increasingly, luxury goods. This deficit, however, has been reduced this year. And foreign currency reserves have increased by 50 percent as the deficit has been more than offset by an increase in foreign investment, Mr. Suttle said.
"It looks as though the Chinese are going to have the soft landing they are aiming for," he added. As a result international investors are becoming a little less negative on China.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE SENATE;
SENATE'S LEADER UNVEILS HIS PLAN FOR HEALTH CARE

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader today proposed national health insurance legislation that he said would achieve coverage of 95 percent of Americans by the year 2000 through voluntary measures and subsidies. A commission would then tell Congress what it should do to insure the rest.
Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, in the rare role of managing legislation, said at a news conference that he did not yet have the votes to pass his bill. But he added: "I believe in the members of the Senate. I believe in their desire to do what's right for this country. And I hope that ultimately a majority can be persuaded, bipartisan, to support this." He said debate would begin on Tuesday. 
 Although the bill outlines a slower, less certain passage to the "health care that is always there" by which President Clinton has sought to define his Presidency, Mr. Clinton promptly embraced the Mitchell proposal. He said it "provides for universal coverage, enables Americans to keep their current insurance and their doctor, maintain quality health care and provides greater opportunity to keep health coverage affordable."
Under the plan, which Mr. Mitchell says is the most extensive one that can get through the Senate, employers would be required only to help insure their workers in 2002, and then only if the 95 percent level had not been reached in 2000 and Congress had adopted no alternative plan. At that point, most employers would be required to pay 50 percent of premium costs.
The Mitchell plan would try to restrain soaring health care inflation largely by relying on insurance law changes to foster competition, though it would impose taxes on expensive insurance policies as a backup. It would cut the growth of Medicare, but would offer new prescription drug benefits and long-term care in exchange.
In contrast, the House bill proposed last Friday by the Democratic leadership seeks universal coverage through requiring employers to pay 80 percent payments of workers' insurance premiums, beginning in 1997, and by expanding Medicare, the government health program for the aged, to include the unemployed poor.
But House leaders, too, lack the votes they need, and there was immediate concern that Mr. Mitchell's proposal would undercut support for the House bill. Representative Jim McDermott of Washington, who is pushing for a wide-ranging bill, said he thought House members would fear casting the tough votes that their leaders are asking when the Mitchell proposal has "run up the white flag to the insurance companies in the Senate."
Even if majorities can be stitched together in both Houses for bills like those the leaders recommend, their varying perspectives will complicate a House-Senate conference.
The conferees would try to strengthen the Senate bill enough to satisfy supporters of universal coverage in the House without scaring off Senate moderates who would vote for something like the Mitchell bill only reluctantly. In both Houses, however, the leaders believe that the closer the final vote is to Election Day, the easier it will be to win.
For Mr. Mitchell, who is retiring at the end of the session, the legislation is a Senate valedictory, the health insurance bill he gave up a Supreme Court nomination to handle and which he intends to keep the Senate considering, six days a week, until it finishes.
 
Listening, and Criticizing
 But despite his hope of ultimate bipartisan support, there was no Republican encouragement today.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, was one of about two dozen senators who paid the Maine Democrat the unusual compliment of sitting in the Senate and listening to his speech outlining the bill. But he said later, "Taken in its totality, the Mitchell bill is very similar to President Clinton's proposal in that it prescribes more government, more taxes and more entitlements."
And if Mr. Dole's tone was mild, some other Republicans spoke more sharply. For example, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas said the Democrats must abandon "their dream that the government is going to run the health care system in this country." Less harshly, Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island said he welcomed Mr. Mitchell's move toward the center, but was concerned about the cost of two new entitlements -- the prescription drug and long-term care benefits, which would begin in 1999.
While Mr. Mitchell's proposal provided the parliamentary progress today, the emotion was supplied in a rally attended by Congressional Democrats and Hillary Rodham Clinton in a Senate office building.
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, told how his son defeated cancer as a child. He recalled the parents he met then who feared that their child would die because because they ran out of money.
"Nobody should go to bed at night and worry that somebody's going to die, not because they have a disease, but because they don't have the money to keep them from dying," he said.
Mrs. Clinton complained that there was "a very small minority with very loud squeaky voices who are dominating this debate." And she said, "They believe we should live in a Darwinian world in which the fit get whatever they can grab for themselves and the rest are left to nature's mercies."
Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House Democratic whip, observed that among the Republicans fighting a health care overhaul were two members named Doolittle and DeLay, specifically, Tom DeLay of Texas and John T. Doolittle of California. "We can give in to the forces of Doolittle and DeLay," he said, "give in to their television commercials, or we can begin to fight."
 
On Way to Universal Coverage
 In Senate itself, Mr. Mitchell said the Congressional Budget Office had made a preliminary finding that his proposal would not add to the deficit, and that it would raise the percentage of insured Americans from the current 85 percent to 95 percent by the turn of the millenium.
Mr. Mitchell told reporters he viewed his bill as a "universal coverage bill." But he said: "Ninety-five percent, in my judgment, is not universal coverage. It is a very important measure on the way to universal coverage."
A major part of the increase in coverage, though Mr. Mitchell's aides could not say just how much, would come from a provision providing insurance for children and pregnant women. Federal subsidies would pay the full cost of health care for families of four with income of as much as about $27,000 a year, while there would be partial subsidies for families with incomes up to $44,000. Mr. Mitchell's plan would also subsidize health insurance for the first six months a worker is unemployed.
Besides the humanitarian appeal of these particular subsidies, they have a political message, too. Mr. Mitchell and his allies calculate that if new benefits are provided quickly, they can insulate the legislation against efforts by future Congresses to repeal or trim it. So while Mr. Mitchell promised today only that the subsidies for children would be available in 1997, Congressional aides were still trying to see if financial and administrative problems could be overcome to begin that coverage in 1996.
 
Middle Ground
 Most of the bill, Mr. Mitchell said, had been drawn from provisions of bills recommended either by the Senate Finance Committee or the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. And indeed in its sweep it fell somewhere between them.
That prompted Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, chairman of the Labor Committee, to complain that the post-2000 steps "invoked to reach the goal of true universal coverage are relatively weak." But there are provisions intended to appeal to Mr. Kennedy, including subsidizing middle-income families to insure their children, and offering subsidies to small businesses that voluntarily add insurance for their workers.
 
Moving to Center
 But the main thrust of Mr. Mitchell's drafting was to conciliate the Senators who believe that market forces can control costs and increase coverage. One of them, Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, called the proposal and "major step forward," and "a good start." A House advocate of such approaches, Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, said, "Mitchell is moving to the center and that is good."
Mr. Mitchell first laid out his proposal to the Democratic Senate caucus, and then to the Senate itself. In a floor speech that outlined the proposal, he scoffed at those who argued that changes like his would limit patients' medical choices and those who argued that all the system needed was steps to increase access to insurance, like prohibiting companies from denying coverage to people who have medical problems.
"Most people's health care choices are limited to one plan that their employer offers," Mr. Mitchell said. And while employers would not be required to pay premium costs, he said, under his bill they would "be required to make at least three plans available to everyone. That's going to widen choices for a majority of Americans immediately."

YESTERDAY
Health care legislation passed another milestone as the leader of the Senate's Democrats announced his proposal, giving both houses of Congress legislation to debate.
 
CONGRESS
Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, presented a bill intended to cover 95 percent of Americans by the year 2000, without requiring employers to pay their workers' insurance. His plan includes Federal subsidies for millions of low-income families, pregnant women, children and others. If 95 percent is not reached by Dec. 31, 2000, businesses and individuals would be required to split the cost of coverage beginning Jan. 1, 2002. Small companies would be exempt, as would those in any state where 95 percent coverage had been reached. Republicans opposition was swift. "It sounds like another corpse to me," said Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader.
 
WHITE HOUSE
President Clinton praised the Mitchell bill, saying that it "provides health security for hard-working middle-class Americans who deserve nothing less.
 
LOBBYING
Hillary Rodham Clinton joined members of Congress, doctors and nurses at a rally at the Capitol and attacked opponents of employer-paid health benefits. "We have a very small minority with very loud, squeaky voices that are dominating this debate," she said. (pg. A18)
 
"LOOKING AHEAD: The Road to a Health Care Law"
 
July 29 -- House Democratic leaders unveil their national health bill that promises universal coverage by 1999 and requires employers to pay 80 percent of the cost of their workers' coverage.
 
Aug. 2 -- Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell presents his plan that aims to cover 95 percent of Americans by the year 2000 without requiring employers to pay their workers' insurance; if more than 5 percent of Americans still lack coverage by 2002, and Congress has not proposed another way to cover them, employers would be required to pay 50 percent of the cost of workers' insurance.
 
Week of Aug. 8 -- House and Senate expected to take up the health care bills. The House, with its tighter rules, is expected to complete action in about a week; no one has a firm prediction on how long the Senate will take.
 
Aug. 12 -- Scheduled start of summer recess. Senator Mitchell says he will keep the Senate in session until it passes a bill.
 
September -- If bills have passed in both Houses, a House-Senate conference committee with try to resolve differences between them.
 
October -- If conference committee reaches agreement final votes take place in both Houses and Congress adjourns in mid-month for election campaigns.
 
Nov. 8 -- Election day. (pg. A18)
 
"COMPARE AND CONTRAST: How the House and Senate Bills Stack Up Against the President's Original Proposal"
 
CLINTON'S ORIGINAL PLAN
 
Coverage: Universal by 1998
 
Benefits: Basic package would contain comprehensive benefits including some coverage for mental health and drug and alcohol abuse treatment; prescription drugs; rehabilitation services; hospice, home health and extended nursing care services, and abortion services.
 
Providers: Most Americans would be required to obtain coverage through regional insurance-purchasing alliances. All companies with 5,000 or fewer employees would have to do so. Medicare would be retained as a separate program for people 65 and over.
 
Financing: Employers would pay about 80 percent of the costs of the average health insurance plan for a single person and about 55 percent of the cost of the average family plan, but no more than 7.9 percent of their payrolls. Individuals would pay up to 20 percent of the premiums. Other financing could come from a 1 percent payroll tax on companies with 5,000 or more workers and from the increase in the Federal tobacco tax to 99 cents a pack from 24 cents.
 
Subsidies: Companies with 75 or fewer employees and average annual wages of the than $24,000 would be eligible for subsidies that would limit employers' costs to a minimum of 3.5 percent of payroll and a maximum of 7.9 percent of the payroll. Employees earning less than 150 percent of the Federal poverty level would also be eligible for subsidies.
 
Cost Containment: A national health board would establish national and regional spending limits and would limit increases in insurance premiums.
 
Health Insurance Reforms: Health plans could not deny coverage or renewal to any eligible group or individual, including people with pre-existing conditions. Premiums would be uniform for everyone in an alliance.
 
HOUSE LEADERSHIP BILL
 
Coverage: Universal coverage by 1999.
 
Benefits: Basic package calls for nationally guaranteed, comprehensive coverage, including prescription drugs, mental health and substance-abuse services, preventive care and a new long-term care program to provide home-and community-based services to people with severe disabilities. House leaders say they are seeking a compromise on abortion.
 
Providers: All employers would be required to offer at least one health plan with an unlimited choice of providers and one managed care plan. Individuals employed in smal firms (fewer than 100 employees) that offered private coverage could buy insurance through the program that covers Federal employees. Some small employers could choose to enrole their employees in the new Medicare Part C program, which would also offer coverage for the unemployed, for low-income families and for part-time seasonal workers.
 
Financing: Employers would generally pay 80 percent of the premiums, and employees 20 percent. Large companies would have to start paying their share by 1997. For companies with fewer than 100 employees, the requirement would take effect in 1999. Other financing would come from gradually increasing the Federal tobacco tax to 69 cents a pack, from 24 cents, by imposing a 2 percent tax on health insurance premiums and the expenses of self-insured plans and by slowing the rate of growth in Medicare.
 
Subsidies: Federal subsidies would be provided to low-wage businesses with 50 or fewer employees and to people with incomes up to 2.4 times the FEderal poverty level (up to $38,400 a year for a family of four).
 
Cost Containment: If greater competition in the health care market failed to control costs in five years, a system of cost containment would go into effect, with the Government imposing fee schedules for doctors and hospitals in states where health spending exceeded Federal targets.
 
Health Insurance Reforms: Plans could not deny coverage or renewal to any eligible group or individuals, including to people with pre-exisitng conditions. Plans sold to groups of 100 or fewer would have to base rates on average costs for all people covered in a particular area.
 
THE LATEST PROPOSAL: SENATOR MITCHELL'S BILL"
 
Coverage: Seeks to cover at least 95 percent of all Americans by the year 2000 through voluntary purchasing cooperatives, insurance market reforms and Federal subsidies. If coverage is not achieved by Jan. 1, 2000, a commission would make recommendations to Congress; if Congress does not act by Dec. 31, 2000, a stand-by system would go into effect. Beginning Jan. 1, 2002, in those states with less than 95 percent coverage, businesses with 25 or more employees would be required to insure their employees and pay 50 percent of the premiums. Employers with fewer than 25 employees would be exempt from the requirement.
 
Benefits: A standard package would include preventive services, precription drugs, rehabilitation services, mental health and substance abuse services, family planning and services for pregnant women, hospice services and extended home care. Also includes several new initiatives to provide long term care to the elderly and disabled.
 
Providers: All employers would be required to offer -- but not pay for -- at least three plans, including a traditional fee-for-service plan and a managed care plan. Businesses with fewer than 500 employees would be allowed to buy coverage through health insurance purchasing cooperatives. States would create voluntary health insurance purchasing cooperatives, each with at least 250,000 people. Welfare recipients, self-employed people and those who work for companies with fewer than 500 employees could buy coverage through the program that provides health insurance to Federal employees.
 
Financing: The measure would gradually increase the Federal tobacco tax, now 24 cents a pack, to 69 cents a pack; increase the Federal tax on certain handgun ammunition; slow the rate of growth in Medicare and eliminate much of the Medicaid program. There would be a 1.75 percent tax on health insurance premiums.
 
Subsidies: Starting in 1997, the Government would pay the full cost of health insurance premiums for people below the official poverty level. In addition, the Government would pay the full cost of premiums for pregnant women and children under 19 with incomes up to 185 percent of the poverty level. There would also be subsidies for employers that provide insurance to employees previously not covered.
 
Cost Containment: A 25 percent tax would imposed on health insurance plans whose costs grow faster than a prescribed pace. A Federal commission would monitor health insurance costs and recommend ways to control costs.
 
Health Insurance Reforms: Insurance companies could not reject applicants for pre-existing conditions. People could retain insurance if they changed jobs. Policy renewal would be guaranteed. MONICA BORKOWSKI (pg. A18)

HEADLINE: 22 Are Arrested in Thefts Of Kennedy Airport Cargo

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
Three major air-cargo theft rings that stole millions of dollars in merchandise from warehouses around Kennedy International Airport were shut down yesterday with the arrests of 22 suspects, many with connections to organized crime, law-enforcement officials said.
Preferring stormy weather because it caused a flurry of alarm-system breakdowns, the thieves broke into dozens of cargo warehouses in the last three years, stealing everything from Dom Perignon champagne to Reebok sneakers to a $1 million shipment of Kodak film, said the Queens District Attorney, Richard A. Brown. Investigators said they can document about $5.5 million worth of merchandise stolen by the thieves but believe the actual amount to be in the tens of millions. 
 Mr. Brown said the investigation shut down an important revenue pipeline for organized crime and helped ease the threat that the mob's infiltration of the cargo business posed to the region's economy.
"Years ago, we lost the shipping industry and the docks as a result of cargo thefts," he said. "I don't want to see that happen to the air-cargo industry."
Sprawling through southern Queens, Kennedy Airport's huge air-cargo business has long been a target of organized crime, most notoriously in the Lufthansa theft of Dec. 11, 1978, when $5 million to $6 million in cash and jewelry was stolen from an airport storage area. In recent years, however, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the agency that operates Kennedy, has cracked down on thefts from the airport, forcing burglars to turn their attention to the large number of air freight companies that store their merchandise off the airport premises, mostly in the Springfield Gardens area just northeast of Kennedy.
The warehouses, known as container stations, take overseas merchandise in large containers from airline docks and break the shipments down for distribution to domestic points.
Yesterday's arrests ended a two-year investigation that began when one of those container stations, Sciara International, reported the theft of $500,000 worth of women's shoes in May 1992. Acting on a tip, a state trooper found some of the shoes for sale at a flea market in the Busy Bee Mall in Massapequa, L.I.
"You don't usually see merchandise this good at a flea market," said an investigator in the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Police began trailing the owner of the flea market stall, noting the dealers from whom he bought his merchandise and then trailing them. After extensive surveillance, the police discovered that three distinct crews were burglarizing the container stations and fencing the merchandise. The crews did not operate in concert, Mr. Brown said, but were aware of one another, used the same methods and did not interfere with each other's territory. Investigators said several leaders of the crews had ties to the Gambino organized crime family.
 
Brand-Name Goods
 The crews only robbed warehouses with at least $100,000 worth of merchandise, investigators said. They preferred small, brand-name goods that were not easy to trace and were easy to sell, including audio and video equipment, telephones, pharmaceuticals and clothing. In two of the burglaries, the crews took $1.75 million worth of Nintendo video-game cartridges.
Using walkie-talkies to communicate and monitoring police scanners, the crews would study a warehouse carefully before striking. As police officers watched from hiding places, the crews deliberately tripped the alarm system at a warehouse and watched how long it would take for a guard from the alarm company to arrive. They would also cut the phone lines to see if the alarm had a radio backup.
Once ready to break in, the crews would trip the alarm several times over several days, giving the alarm company the impression of a malfunctioning system that would eventually be disregarded. The scheme worked best on rainy nights, when alarms are prone to go off on their own and when response times are slower.
 
Beating Alarm Companies
 "It's not like we left the doors open," said the manager at Luv's Container, which lost $250,000 in shoes and medical equipment in one burglary last October. "We had one of the best alarm companies. But it turned out they were smarter than the alarm company."
Of the 30 or so warehouses where the police observed the crews, seven were actually robbed. In the other cases, the police thwarted burglaries in progress or merely observed the thieves casing the buildings.
None of those arrested yesterday were "made members" of an organized crime family, investigators said; even the three crew chiefs were low-level technicians, the "bread-and-butter men" whose activities provided a steady, reliable source of income for the mob. None of the thefts was dramatic enough on its own to warrant the attention of a task force of the police, but over time the crews may have managed to steal far more than in the Lufthansa theft, investigators said.
Mr. Brown said that continuing air-cargo theft threatened to hurt the market share of the New York shipping industry, asserting that Kennedy Airport, long the nation's premier cargo airport, is now in second place.
Dan Muscatello, manager of air-cargo programs for the Port Authority, said that only Memphis exceeds Kennedy's volume, because the central hub of Federal Express is located there. Last year, he said, Kennedy handled 1.38 million tons of cargo, worth $86.4 billion.
 
Thefts Reduced at Airport
 Mr. Muscatello said that cargo theft had actually gone down in recent years on the airport premises, which he attributed to the Port Authority's cargo crime prevention unit. Several officials of the 40 or so container stations in Springfield Gardens said yesterday that they would prefer to move to the airport, where security is better, but said the Port Authority's rents are double what they are now paying away from the airport.
The 22 defendants were arrested yesterday morning at the same time as six indictments were unsealed in State Supreme Court charging them with a combined 192 counts of grand larceny, burglary, conspiracy and criminal possession of stolen property. Two corporations, ONA Systems of 142-50 Rockaway Boulevard and VP Sales of 63-49 Forest Avenue, were also charged with buying and selling the stolen property. Two other suspects were indicted and are expected to be arrested shortly, investigators said. All those indicted were from New York City or Long Island.
The three arrested as crew chiefs yesterday were Joseph Cavalcante, 33, of 84-29 55th Road, Elmhurst; George Licastro, 35, of 103-19 95th Street, South Ozone Park, and Nicholas Kenny, 30, of 137-08 88th Street, Howard Beach, all in Queens.
Mr. Cavalcante and Mr. Licastro were charged with grand larceny in the second degree and face up to 15 years in prison; Mr. Kenny was charged with grand larceny in the first degree and faces up to 25 years in prison. The 24th defendant was charged with lending money at usurious rates to finance the theft of property.

A newly declassified document suggests that Britain did not have advance warning of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, casting doubt on the theory that Churchill deliberately withheld such information from Roosevelt to make sure the United States entered the war, a historian here says.
Anthony Best, a lecturer in international history at the London School of Economics, said an internal history of British naval intelligence prepared in 1945 and released by the Government last week states that although there were warning signals about Japan's intentions, Britain did not know in early December 1941 that a Japanese force was preparing to attack the American fleet in Hawaii. 
 Some historians, citing Britain's extensive intelligence operations against Japan at the time, have questioned whether Churchill fully shared information with Roosevelt in the weeks leading up to Pearl Harbor, and whether the British leader might have withheld warning of a Japanese attack so the United States would have no option but to enter the war.
Dr. Best, who is writing a history of Britain's role in the events leading up to Pearl Harbor, said he found the internal history by chance at the Public Records Office, where it was released last week without any announcement. Britain keeps Government documents classified far longer than the United States, and often releases materials only decades after the fact.
"We had not penetrated the Japanese plan to attack Pearl Harbor, but the United States knew, as did our own command, that it was impossible to keep track of every Japanese unit," the naval intelligence history said in its conclusion. "There was enough to keep the U.S. authorities on the alert, especially in view of Japan's past record in the matter of surprise raids before declaring war."
The document said that as of Dec. 1, 1941, British intelligence had determined that of Japan's 10 aircraft carriers, four were in the South China Sea near Formosa and four others in Japanese home waters, Dr. Best said. Intelligence reports said the other two carriers were near Saipan, more than 3,000 miles west of Pearl Harbor, on Dec. 4.
In reality, two of the carriers that British intelligence thought were in the South China Sea and all four of those assumed to be in Japanese waters were heading under radio silence toward Pearl Harbor, Dr. Best said.
"This was an internal history, designed for internal consumption only," Dr. Best said. "There's no reason for it to say something designed to mislead. I think this does prove, since there's no reason for it to have an angle, that Britain did not know."
Dr. Best said Britain did have a fair amount of intelligence about Japan. "The problem is the evidence would not necessarily have told you about Pearl Harbor," he said.
Other historians continued to express some doubts about what Britain knew. In a letter to The Daily Telegraph today, John Costello, a historian based in New York, said it was "too soon to assert categorically" that Churchill did not have advance knowledge of the attack.
"The time has come for Britain to declassify its full contemporary records or the myth will grow on this side of the Atlantic that American history is being held hostage by the British obsession with secrecy," Mr. Costello said.

HEADLINE: Islamic Hard-Liners Said to Gain Ground in Iran

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TEHERAN, Iran, July 29

 BODY:
After years of internal political struggle for control of Iran's Islamic revolution, the pragmatic faction led by President Hashemi Rafsanjani has been backed into a corner by resurgent hard-liners.
The advance of the Shiite Muslim radicals in the last few months appears to put an end, at least for now, to foreign diplomats' perennial expressions of hope that Iran would mend its relations with the United States and other Western countries, and end its support of Islamic revolutionary movements abroad. 
 Ominously, the rapid ascendancy of radical clerics and the waning power of President Rafsanjani coincides with the bombings of Jewish targets in Buenos Aires and London, which many diplomats here and abroad have linked to the Iranian Government. And three Iranians are awaiting trial in Bangkok on charges of trying to plant a ton of explosives in March outside the Israeli Embassy.
 
A Crackdown on Dissent
 The Buenos Aires and London blasts, which left nearly 100 Argentines dead and scores wounded, follow by days the assassination of two Christian leaders in Iran and a new crackdown on internal political dissent. Parliament, now firmly in the radicals' hands, has stymied the Government's economic reform program, even as rising unemployment, hyperinflation, low oil revenues and a shortage of housing are plunging Iran into crisis.
Mr. Rafsanjani and his Western-trained technocrats have always had to share power with the clerics who formed the hard core of the country's 1979 revolution. But despite widespread discontent with the more repressive aspects of Islamic rule, the clerics have made a persuasive argument that Mr. Rafsanjani's economic reforms serve only the rich and that politically he is tepid and gutless.
"President Rafsanjani has lost all credibility and with him the policies he advocates," said one senior Western diplomat. "He is openly attacked in the Parliament and even his old supporters are deserting him. These bombings are probably our notice that the radical clerics, who call for blood and holy war, are again on the loose."
Iranian officials deny any involvement in the terrorist attacks or the killing or persecution of dissidents, saying many of the killings are the work of enemies who are trying to discredit them.
"The Westerners are admitting that Iran's Islamic slogans and ideas have transformed Egypt, Algeria and some other places in the world," Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said recently. "This is considered a great threat to Western capitalism. Therefore, Islamic Iran, which possesses a powerful weapon like the dynamism of its ideas, logic and words of justice, does not need to resort to terrorism."
A sense of listlessness has descended over the country. In the dimly lit Government-run hotels in Teheran, waiters sit smoking at tables as a few diners pick at a desultory selection of stale bread and wilted greens set out haphazardly on dirty table cloths.
Because of a shortage of raw materials and spare parts, factories are shut down or on reduced shifts. The few foreign companies here have reduced their investments, or are pulling out, because of a refusal by Iranian banks to honor their own loan commitments or to pay for goods and services.
The economic misery has been matched by a new political clampdown. Radical groups, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Councils, which are supposed to oversee the religious zeal of government workers, are muscling their way back into power after a period of dormancy.
 
Writer Is Arrested
 Dissidents, including the well-known writer Ali Akbar Saidi-Sirjani, have been arrested in recent weeks and forced to make public confessions. Mr. Sirjani told Iranian viewers he was involved in "homosexuality, gambling, drinking, smoking opium and having connections with the C.I.A." He remains in prison.
A blast that killed 24 Muslim worshipers in a Meshed mosque in June is now widely believed by Western diplomats here to have been the work of militants from the minority Sunni Persian community, which numbers 3.5 million in this country of 60 million. Sunnis were outraged by the destruction of one of their mosques earlier this year. A conflict between the Sunnis and the Shiite leadership could tarnish Iran's patronage of Islamic fundamentalist groups abroad, most of which are Sunni.
All this should come as good news to policy planners in Washington. The Clinton Administration, pursuing what it calls a policy of containment, has sought to keep Iran economically crippled and diplomatically isolated. But European diplomats, and many Iranians, say the result is a government with a much more violent and narrow agenda.
 
Advocate of Ties to West
 Said Rajai Khorassani, a member of Parliament and of President Rafsanjani's inner circle, is one who believes Iran should build bridges with the United States and Europe. He backed Iran's efforts three years ago to help free Western hostages in Lebanon and remain neutral in the effort to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait. But the cooperation, he says, never paid off.
Mr. Khorassani says the Clinton Administration failed to seize the olive branch he, and others, offered. Now, he warns, it is probably too late.
"We don't have any counterparts in the Clinton Administration," he said, "and this has made it hard to promote a more lenient Iranian policy. There are not many people left who support my line of thought."
Mr. Khorassani, like many in the Rafsanjani camp, has seen his political fortunes plummet. He wrote a letter last year to the Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme religious leader, calling for talks with the United States. The message was leaked to the press, and his enemies mounted a campaign against him. Ayatollah Khamenei referred to those who advocated such a reconciliation as "naive" and "ignorant."
Mr. Khorassani has lost his position as the head of the Parliament's foreign relations committee and deputies are refusing to back an official rights group he wants to set up.
 
President Losing Ground
 The decline in the fortunes of President Rafsanjani, who was re-elected to a second five-year term last year, has been matched by the remarkable ascent of Ayatollah Khamenei.
Ayatollah Khamenei became the country's supreme religious leader in 1989, and has the authority to overrule any action of the Government. But for years, he was beholden to Mr. Rafsanjani, because it was the President who had lobbied Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic republic's first supreme religious leader, to select Ayatollah Khamenei, a relatively junior cleric, as his successor.
But now, Ayatollah Khamenei has gathered behind him the dogmatic clerics and hard-liners who increasingly dominate the Government. Emboldened by his new influence, the Ayatollah has begun to reverse, or criticize, the President's decisions.
 
Dispute on Rushdie
 He recently denied Mr. Rafsanjani's assertion that Ayatollah Khomeini's call for the killing of Salman Rushdie for blasphemy could be reversed. He dismissed Mr. Rafsanjani's brother, Mohammed Hashemi, from his post earlier this year as the head of Iranian radio and television after a decade in the job. And the President's second five-year economic plan, which calls for the cutting of many subsidies, the end of currency controls and the privatization of state-owned industries, is daily being undercut by backers of the Ayatollah in the Parliament.
In late July, a parliamentary committee doubled the plan's proposal for subsidies for wheat, rice, sugar, cooking oil and cheese, despite the President's call for a gradual ending of such subsidies. The chamber also ordered a halt to the sale of some state industries and voted down a bill to reduce the heavy subsidy for gasoline, which sells for about 8 cents a gallon at Iranian pumps.
Iradj Pasha, the president of the Dynaway company, once imported secondhand Mack trucks and spare parts into Iran. But foreign distributors no longer ship to him because for the last year the Iranian banks that handle Mr. Pasha's accounts have refused to pay foreign exporters. It has been 12 months since Mr. Pasha imported a truck. And now a new batch of customs rules demand that he import only as much as he exports.
"I discover now I have to become an exporter," he said, "so I am looking into the trade in pistachios and carpets, both of which I know nothing about. An increasing number of businesses here are going bankrupt."
 
Role of Foundations
 There is not such trouble for the powerful Government-run companies and bunyods, huge foundations that have billions in assets and control industries confiscated after the 1979 revolution. The bunyods are only accountable to Ayatollah Khamenei and are run by a coterie of powerful, and often radical, clerics. With access to dollars obtained at discount from the Central Bank, these organizations have gone on huge buying sprees abroad. Business executives here say the bunyods often over-report their spending and pocket the difference.
"There are millions in profits for these people," said an Iranian economist, "and since they form Ayatollah Khamenei's power base they expect to be left alone. The reforms, and all the prosperity and freedom that were to have come with them, are dead."

HEADLINE: North Korea Says Desire to Settle the Nuclear Issue Continues

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Just days before critical talks with the United States are to begin, North Korea's new leadership partly eased uncertainty over its policies today by indicating that it would maintain an apparently constructive turn in the former leader's approach to North Korea's nuclear program.
Shortly before he died a month ago, Kim Il Sung, Communist North Korea's absolute ruler for nearly five decades, turned away from confrontation by suspending his efforts to produce plutonium, the raw material for atomic bombs. 
 Mr. Kim said the program could be halted permanently if his country was offered a modern, light-water nuclear reactor, economic aid and diplomatic recognition.
Mr. Kim died just as talks on this package were starting, so the full aims of his policy, which had zigzagged over the previous 18 months, were never known. And there has been great uncertainty over whether his son and presumed successor, Kim Jong Il, would pursue this more conciliatory line. In fact, it is still not certain that the younger Mr. Kim has assumed full control of the country.
But today's announcement, in an editorial in the Government-controlled newspaper Rodong Sinmun, confirmed that the same approach would be taken in the negotiations, which are to resume in Geneva on Friday.
The editorial emphasized North Korea's desire to obtain a modern nuclear reactor for generating electricity, a project that would cost billions of dollars and take as long as a decade to construct. Some experts have questioned whether such a reactor is practical for a country as isolated and economically backward as North Korea, but the editorial characterized the light-water reactor as "a touchstone" of American intentions.
"We have already proposed a package solution to the nuclear issue and are still maintaining this position," said the newspaper, which was cited in an official broadcast monitored here.
Positive as the announcement sounded, promising fruitful talks "if both sides take sincere positions," the negotiations may face a critical impasse very quickly, say Government officials involved.
Just before Kim Il Sung adopted his apparently more flexible stand, North Korea violated instructions from United Nations inspectors and unloaded 8,000 spent fuel rods from a reactor at Yongbyon, 60 miles north of the capital, Pyongyang. The North placed the rods in a cooling pond and said it would have to reprocess them quickly for safety reasons.
Western experts say the rods will yield as much as 60 pounds of weapons-grade plutonium if they are reprocessed, enough to construct four or five nuclear bombs, tilt the balance of power on the Korean peninsula and push the region into a far more dangerous crisis than it has faced so far.
The Central Intelligence Agency has estimated that North Korea has already produced enough plutonium to make one or two bombs.
North Korea has said that because the cladding on the rods is deteriorating quickly, it must begin reprocessing by early September. The United States and South Korea have insisted that haste seems uncalled for, and that if reprocessing begins it will be, as one official put it, "a deal breaker we could not tolerate."
The United States has proposed, first of all, to send experts to the site to lengthen the life of the rods by improving conditions in the cooling pond. It is also proposing that the spent rods be moved out of North Korea for reprocessing or storage.
Reports today in South Korea said the North offered at the last round of discussions, in Geneva on July 8, to permit inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor the reprocessing, and then to put the plutonium extracted under the control of the United Nations agency.

HEADLINE: Gore, in Ukraine, Expresses Support for Economic Change

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Aug. 2

 BODY:
In another indication that the West is viewing Ukraine as an important East European country, Vice President Al Gore today offered strong United States support for "comprehensive economic reforms" to stabilize this country's ailing economy.
"This is an extremely important priority for the United States of America," said Mr. Gore, who is the most important foreign official to visit President Leonid D. Kuchma since he defeated Leonid M. Kravchuk last month. 
 "A strong and prosperous and independent Ukraine is a stabilizing force for peace in Central Europe and throughout the entire region," Mr. Gore said.
To bolster this point, Mr. Gore invited Mr. Kuchma to meet with President Clinton on Nov. 29 in Washington, and reminded Ukrainians that it was Mr. Clinton who pressed the industrial countries to offer Ukraine $4 billion in aid last month.
The emphasis on the economy was a departure from previous high-level American visits, which focused on dismantling Ukraine's nuclear arsenal. Last week, the head of the International Monetary Fund met with Mr. Kuchma to encourage rapid market restructuring.
 
U.S. Switches Tactics
 Mr. Gore mentioned the importance of completing an accord, signed last January, to rid Ukraine of its nuclear weapons. But he said he and Mr. Kuchma did not even discuss when Mr. Kuchma would ask his Parliament to ratify the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which would seal Ukraine's commitment to being nuclear-free and allow other nuclear pacts with Russia.
Just as Washington has changed its tactics toward Ukraine. Mr. Kuchma's initial overture to the West is a remarkable reversal of his campaign statements about integrating with Russia. In the past Mr. Kuchma has expressed skepticism over the benefit of Western aid and the probability of strong economic links with the West.
But instead of a post-victory flight to Moscow to heal bad blood with President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Kuchma has entertained Western dignitaries and agreed to draw up an economic reform program with the International Monetary Fund by October.
 
A Two-Pronged Strategy
 "We'll always have time for Russia," said Volodymyr O. Kuznetsov, an aide to Mr. Kuchma. "We need to use the opportunity we have now to meet with the West."
Mr. Kuchma's single move toward Russia has been a vague, joint statement with Mr. Yeltsin, released by a Russian news agency last Sunday, saying it would be a good idea to resolve a dispute over the Black Sea fleet soon.
"Kuchma is playing a smart game -- continue ambiguity in Ukraine's geopolitical orientation but pursue economic reform and get Western assistance," said Ian J. Brzezinski, a member of Ukraine's parliamentary advisory council and son of Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser. "He realizes taking the Russian path creates too much tension with Ukraine's nationalists."
The chief obstacle to economic change is the Parliament, whose largest faction from the revived Communist Party of Ukraine pushed through a freeze on privatization as it adjourned for its summer recess last Friday.
Though the Ukrainian electorate just voted in a President who promised economic reform, its demoralization expressed itself three months earlier when voters elected a Parliament more hostile to reform than their Soviet-era one. It will be an enormous challenge for Mr. Kuchma to ignore or override it.

The Serbian Government has made such threats before, and even claimed to have closed the Serbian-Bosnian border for a time in 1993 in an effort to show that it was complying with international demands that it pressure the Bosnian Serbs to make peace. 
 But the harsh Serbian statement today is its strongest in support of the current peace plan, which would require the Bosnian Serbs to acknowledge Bosnia and Herzegovina's sovereignty and hand back a third of the territory they control.
The plan's engineers -- the United States, Germany, Britain, France and Russia -- have warned the Belgrade Government that they will push the United Nations Security Council to tighten economic sanctions against the Yugoslav federation, which includes Serbia and the much weaker Montenegro, if the Bosnian Serbs do not sign the agreement.
 
Talk of a Referendum
 Calling the deal a humiliation for their victorious army, Bosnian Serb leaders have so far refused to accept the plan despite appeals by their main backer, President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.
Bosnian Serb leaders said today that they might put the peace proposal to a referendum, a move that could buy time without any serious prospect that the plan would be approved. The Bosnian Serbs' parliament is scheduled to meet on Wednesday, apparently to discuss the peace plan for a third time.
The Serbian Government's statement today said that Bosnian Serb leaders would be guilty of a "crime against their own people" if they do not accept the peace plan.
"If at this time, when you are being offered peace, you usurp the right to determine the fate of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, you by this act will be severing all possibility of cooperation with us," the statement said. "There is no sense in 11 million Yugoslav citizens waiting for sanctions to be lifted while you clarify for yourselves things that are clear to the whole world."
"If you are still blinded by some selfish, personal or collective interest," the statement continued, "and if it is not enough for you that peace is being offered to you on a basis that would leave the Srpska Republic occupying half of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, then you are on your way to committing a crime against your own people." The Srpska Republic is the government proclaimed by the Bosnian Serb rebels.
 
Skepticism About Appeal
 The statement, however, did not specifically threaten to cut off funds, food, military support or any other aid to the Bosnian Serbs, who have relied heavily on support from Serbia throughout the 28-month war. Western analysts remain skeptical of the sincerity of the Serbian appeal as well as Mr. Milosevic's ability to sever ties with the Bosnian Serbs.
Today, one member of the Bosnian Serb presidency, Biljana Plavsic, accused Mr. Milosevic of betraying the Serbian people.
"Radovan Kradzic was elected president and his goal was the creation of a Serbian state," she said, referring to the Bosnian Serb leader. "Slobodan Milosevic has supported his work until now. Why has he changed his mind? If it's a matter of power, then this is horrible, it is national treason."
Momcilo Krajisnik, another Bosnian Serb leader, referred to the pressure by Serbia as blackmail.
Western diplomats said Serbia's economy might collapse if the Security Council tightened the sanctions it imposed in May 1992.
Enforcement of the trade ban on Serbia has largely broken down, but an international freeze on Serbia's assets abroad, its isolation from the world banking community and closure of Belgrade's airport have hobbled some of the most productive sectors of the country's economy.
The Bosnian Serbs, rankled by the diplomatic pressure they are facing, retaliated by temporarily reimposing a blockade of Sarajevo, intensifying sniping attacks on pedestrians on city streets and forcing a cutoff in international aid flights into the Bosnian capital by targeting cargo planes.
United Nations officials here said that Bosnian Serb gunmen wounded three people in an attack today on a bus traveling down a mountain road near the Sarajevo suburb of Hrasnica. The Serbs killed a British peacekeeper in an attack on a United Nations convoy at the same location last week.
United Nations officials have reported a surge in fighting across Bosnia over the last two days, including heavy clashes near the town of Bihac between mostly Muslim Bosnian Army forces and rebel Muslim contingents loyal to a local underworld figure.

 BODY:
There's one small problem with the South.
No one can agree on what it is. 
 The simplest definition would be the 11 states that went to war in 1861. But that leaves out the Bluegrass country of Kentucky and leaves in the dusty oil fields of West Texas and the Latin bustle of Miami.
The Census Bureau uses a South of 16 states plus the District of Columbia, running from Delaware to Texas and Oklahoma. The Bureau of Labor Statistics's South is eight states from Kentucky to Florida, with Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas joining Oklahoma and New Mexico in a separate region.
An economist at Georgia State University, Donald Ratajczak, who compiles economic figures on the region, uses a 12-state area of the 11 states of the Confederacy, minus Texas, but with Kentucky and West Virginia. John Shelton Reed, of the University of North Carolina, who surveys Southern attitudes, uses a 13-state South, the Confederacy plus Kentucky and Oklahoma. For this series, The New York Times used a 12-state South of the Confederacy plus Kentucky.
Neither state boundaries nor geography define culture. South Texas and South Florida are as close to the equator as the South gets, and both have more in common with San Juan or Mexico City than Chattanooga and Yazoo City. On the other hand, the Florida Panhandle and the piney woods of East Texas are as Southern as you get.
Mr. Reed has some fanciful definitions of the South that don't hew to state borders. There is the South where students in an informal survey said the state was Southern (90 percent agreed on a core of seven states from Louisiana to North Carolina).
He maps the South as a place where kudzu grows, cotton is cultivated, Baptist churches can be found, whites read Southern Living magazine or there are the most listings for Dixie in the telephone book. There is a South defined by the number of times a state is mentioned in country songs (Texas is first, Tennessee, second).
Of course, those definitions can miss the point.
"If you care to define the South as a poor, rural region with lousy race relations," Professor Reed said, "that South survives only in geographical shreds and patches and most Southerners don't live there any more."

HEADLINE: From Atlanta to Birmingham, Blur of Progress and Stagnation

SERIES: New South and Old -- Last of four articles.

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala.

 BODY:
She was only 14 when she joined Martin Luther King 31 years ago in the civil disobedience that broke the back of the South's fiercest segregation, but Frances Foster White knew just where she wanted to go -- the grand spiral staircase in the Pizitz department store that led to the whites-only mezzanine cafe.
"I always had a thing for Loretta Young," said Mrs. White, now a medical assistant at a local hospital, recalling the 1950's television series that began with Miss Young sweeping down a stairway in a glamorous gown. "And that's why I chose Pizitz, because I wanted to walk down that staircase, proud, with my head held high. And I did it. And it's something I'll always be proud that I did." 
 She was one of the children of Birmingham, the students as young as 6 who braved T. Eugene (Bull) Connor's fire hoses and attack dogs and changed the South three decades ago. What she did not know was that the spiral staircase would lead to another, and another, and another, leaving the South a blur of progress and stagnation, past and present, black and white, like the M. C. Escher etchings of endless stairways leading everywhere and nowhere.
To the extent that progress has stalled, some see the age-old ills of the South.
"You don't think people with power were just going to give it up, do you?" said Nelson Rivers, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's regional director for the Southeast. "They don't have the same allies in government, but the people who had the economic power 30 years ago are the people who have it now."
Others see the inability of blacks to take advantage of the new opportunities open to them.
"It's not enough to say things have not changed," said Andrew Young, the former Mayor of Atlanta. "We have not changed."
Across the South, in places like Birmingham, which is still trying to live down its past, or Atlanta, which is still trying to live up to its artful image of prosperous racial amity, or the Mississippi Delta, which is still in the grip of desperate poverty, Southerners, black and white, are still trying to make sense of it. Sometimes, they even do.
 
Two Mayors
Crossing Barriers, Feeling Losses
 During the civil rights era, they were the two poles of the South. Birmingham, with its racial violence and terror, was branded "Bombingham." Atlanta, with its peaceful integration and go-go business leadership, became "The City Too Busy to Hate."
In many ways they are as different as ever, Atlanta the site of the 1996 Olympics, Birmingham the scene of Michael Jordan's dubious foray into minor league baseball. But when it comes to the plight of the black poor, the two intersect.
Behind his desk at Birmingham's City Hall, Mayor Richard Arrington Jr. keeps an old photograph of his neighborhood baseball team, the 1948 Fairfield Grey Sox, who played in Birmingham's old Negro industrial leagues. In the front row is a young outfielder named Willie Mays.
The photo is a memento of segregation, when Birmingham was a swaggering steel town of black smoke and open hearths, Atlanta was a hustling hub for bankers, salesmen and promoters, and the two cities, 150 miles apart on Interstate 20, were vying to see which would dominate the South.
Birmingham's racial turmoil doomed its hope of regional dominance. But the city has had a substantial renaissance over the past decade, diversifying from steel to health care, banking and services and making strides in race relations. Across from the 16th Street Baptist Church, where four black children were killed by a bomb planted by segregationists on Sept. 15, 1963, now sits the magnificent Birmingham Civil Rights Institute.
Still, there is enough friction between past and present, in endless battles over affirmative action, city contracts with minority business, that Mr. Arrington, a courtly 59-year-old former zoology professor serving his fourth term as Birmingham's only black Mayor, has the weary air of a man who has been fighting the same old battles for too long.
"I'm just a symbol here of something that frightens a lot of whites or that a lot of whites resent," Mr. Arrington said. "I am a symbol of black political strength in Alabama's largest city. I have very strong backing by the black community. I have not had to have my knees knocking every time the Birmingham News or Post wrote something about me. A lot of whites resent that."
 
Front Lines of Integration
 Weariness is not a word that comes to mind when describing Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta. Energetic with wire-rimmed glasses and a quick, dry wit, he personifies the changed South that Atlanta will celebrate with much pageantry two years hence, when it plays host to the Summer Olympics.
The son of the head of the Raleigh, N.C., chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., Mr. Campbell, now 40 years old, integrated the Raleigh schools at the age of 7 and spent five lonely years as the only black student at his elementary school. He graduated from Vanderbilt University and Duke University Law School, came to Atlanta in the mid-1970's and in 1981 was elected to the City Council representing the district where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached and where he now lies entombed. Last year, Mr. Campbell became Atlanta's third black Mayor, following Maynard Jackson and Mr. Young.
He has also come to represent the remarkable continuity in vision and civic promotion between Atlanta's new black mayors and its old white ones.
"I think Atlanta has dealt with its racial concerns better than any other city in this country," Mr. Campbell said, picking at a 4 o'clock lunch of sausage pizza one recent afternoon. "What people will see is the capital of the New South, a high-tech city that works. They'll see a great city at its peak."
But when asked about the nostalgia that many blacks have for the unified black community of the segregated South, with its black role models and support systems, he starts talking with surprising passion about the lost world of his father, the world of the Fairfield Grey Sox.
"There was this wonderful gumbo, self-contained, where everyone was treated with respect and dignity," Mr. Campbell said. "It didn't make any difference whether you were a millionaire or a person who washed dishes, you all lived in the same area, so the kids saw doctors and teachers and lawyers and policemen. But with integration, that all changed when the middle class moved out. The black community spent so much of its energy on fighting the social barriers that we have simply lost our ability to comprehend the terrible effect it was going to have on the black economy."
 
Struggling for Prosperity
 As different as Atlanta and Birmingham are, Mr. Campbell and Mr. Arrington both preside over cities that are largely poor and largely black and are struggling to get their share of the prosperity washing over their metropolitan areas.
While the Atlanta metropolitan area grew to 2.8 million in 1990 from 1 million people in 1960, the city of Atlanta shrunk to 394,017 people, 31 percent white, in 1990, from 487,455 people, 61 percent white, in 1960. Birmingham fell to 265,968 people, 36 percent white, in 1990, from 340,887, 60 percent white, in 1960.
In Atlanta, most of the growth and prosperity is coming in suburban Cobb and Gwinnett Counties. In Birmingham, it's not just out of the city but "over the mountain," on the other side of Red Mountain, in southern Jefferson and Shelby Counties.
Bill Campbell, who from the time he could walk has been living out his father's dream of an integrated South and has succeeded even beyond what his father could have imagined, would be the last person in the South to want to turn the clock back or to minimize the gains. And Atlanta's successes are precisely what his father envisioned -- a better world created largely through the cooperation of blacks and whites in business, government and the arts.
But he talks for a while about the world his father knew and then, the booster voice uncharacteristically gone, he says: "If my father or if Martin Luther King were to come back down Auburn Avenue, hand in hand, I think they would be horrified. I think race was a much greater factor than anyone originally believed. It turned out that what the racists said was true -- 'You can change the laws, but you can't change the minds.' "
 
Two Views
From Optimism To Stark Reality
 Unita Blackwell came to Jackson, Miss. in June to remember Freedom Summer, when students from the North and ordinary Mississippians braved the Klan in 1964 to work for civil rights in a state where crimes, including murder, against blacks and those working with them were prosecuted about as often as the Delta fields sprouted purple cotton.
She and other veterans of the civil rights movement came to celebrate a changed world and their role in helping to bring it about. But they also confronted how far they still had to go.
"I think a lot of us 30 years ago were optimistic; we had to be to survive," said Mrs. Blackwell, then a young volunteer who later became Mayor of the town of Mayersville in the Mississippi Delta. "Since then, lots of people have been disappointed. I guess all of us in our own ways have disappointments. It wasn't long before you found out that this was a resistant society. We didn't know then how imbedded all this was in the state of Mississippi, how imbedded it is in America. You don't get rid overnight of what took 400 years to grow."
To Mrs. Blackwell and many other blacks, the civil rights movement only began to chip away at a vast empire of inequality: of black colleges that got a fraction of the dollars that white ones did, of a political structure that was all white, of an economic system in which all the money and power was in the hands of whites.
The clear lesson to her and many others is how much work still needs to be done in electing blacks to office, fighting discrimination, staying the course.
"It all ties to who we put in office," Mrs. Blackwell said. "Nothing is more important -- and when I say nothing, I mean absolutely nothing -- than your vote, my vote and how we exercise it. People are staying in houses because they had a vote. People have paved streets, water to drink, because they have a vote. Every economic piece in this world is hinged on some vote or other."
 
Different Agendas
 More often than not, that vote is cast along racial lines. Indeed, unlike the biracial nature of Freedom Summer, in Southern politics today, blacks and whites come together only in passionless marriages of convenience in the Democratic Party or local city halls.
There may be much in Southern culture that binds blacks and whites -- from religion and food to manners and morals -- but when it comes to government, blacks and whites have political agendas almost as divergent as they were 30 years ago. Nobody in Rush Limbaugh's America professes as much hatred for government as white Southerners do. Nobody in America is as aware of what government can do for its people as black Southerners are.
Robert Proctor is a lawyer from the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs who has made a name for himself as an anti-tax crusader and as a critic of Atlanta's largely black city government. In blunt language, he says what many whites believe but few will say openly -- that blacks cry "racism" to excuse their own failures, that blacks have gone from wanting equality to demanding special treatment, that the time is long gone when blacks can blame the past for their troubles. He oozes contempt for Atlanta's black-controlled city government.
"I think they're corrupt," said Mr. Proctor, who is 36 and whose parents became Goldwater Republicans back when Georgia was still a one-party state -- that is, Democratic. "I think they're wasteful of taxpayer dollars. I don't think they attend to the basics of government, and I think a lot of what they do is for their own personal economic benefit."
He rails against government programs to foster black businesses; to Mr. Proctor, the programs simply help "a small group of blacks in Atlanta who trade political favors with each other." Asked about the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, he says: "Should we take 50 percent of the wealth of white America and give it to black people, pay reparations, as some of them are urging? When does it end? I think what we need to do in this country, if we're truly interested in dealing with quote, unquote, racism, is we need to stop talking about race all the time. That is all we talk about: race, race, race, race, race."
Mr. Proctor's critics say that the whites who profess to hate government so much have long been the ones who most benefited from it and did business with it. Tyrone Brooks, a black State Representative in Georgia, calls Mr. Proctor "the new sophisticated racist of the 90's."
Mr. Proctor, voicing the views of many other whites, said it was blacks obsessed with race and the past who were today's racists. "I am not a member of the Ku Klux Klan," he said. "I'm one of those who sat silent for a long, long time. Increasingly, a great many people in the middle and upper middle classes in the South are saying what I'm saying, not publicly, but they're saying it to all their friends. And right now, I don't think we're heading toward any kind of solution."
 
Two Eras
Black Gains Vs. Tradition
 John Egerton is a 59-year-old author in Nashville, the son of a traveling salesman, who has spent most of his career dealing with two great constants of the South.
One is food, Southern cooking and its six major food groups -- sugar, salt, butter, eggs, cream and bacon grease. The other constant is race.
For the last five years Mr. Egerton, who is white, has been working on a book titled "Speak Now Against the Day," about a period seemingly as ancient as Byzantium, the period from 1932 to the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 that declared racially segregated schools unconstitutional.
"For people then, it was like encountering a hurricane or a tornado," said Mr. Egerton, whose best-known book is "The Americanization of Dixie" (Harper's Magazine Press, 1974). "You may live in a place where those things happen, but you always think it will hit someone else. Everyone knew things had to change, but the leadership of the South absolutely abdicated responsibility. When integration finally came, no one had a sense of how to make it work. Even the people who knew it was wrong didn't have a clue how to make it right."
Forty years later, in a South that has come further than most people would have dreamed of 40 years ago, somehow the world looks much the same.
"You know, we had the chance to fix things after World War II that we had after Brown, that we have now," Mr. Egerton said. "But you talk to people on both sides of the racial divide and you don't find a hell of a lot of people who really believe the South was ever going to fix anything. It makes me cry when I hear people say, 'Maybe segregation wasn't so bad' -- hear blacks say that. You could fill a phone booth with the people, black or white, who think school desegregation is important. This talk of self-segregation, it's suicidal. But you talk to whites, and it's hard to find a lot of people who can demonstrate they've learned anything either."
 
Enduring Turmoil
 Indeed, 40 years after Brown and 30 years after Freedom Summer, racial disputes are becoming more common and the language of race more pervasive as black political and cultural gains hit the bedrock of Southern tradition and entrenched economic interests.
The struggle plays out in the battles over whether to remove the Confederate battle flag from the Georgia state flag or whether to stop flying it above the Capitol in South Carolina. It plays out in the court fight over the financing and autonomy of historically black state colleges in Mississippi. It plays out most significantly in the lawsuits challenging black Congressional Districts across the South.
For every Malcolm X cap worn by a black, there's a T-shirt worn by a white with the Confederate battle flag and the slogan, "You Wear Your X, I'll Wear Mine." For every T-shirt worn by a black reading, "It's a Black Thing. You Wouldn't Understand," there's a bumper sticker reading, "Don't Blame Us. We Voted for Jefferson Davis."
That so much turmoil comes after so much progress between blacks and whites is perfectly in keeping with the age-old split personality of the South. And in a region where blacks make up 18.6 percent of the population -- and as much as 35 percent in the Deep South state of Mississippi -- as opposed to 12.1 nationally, the South's future, now as always, is inextricably tied to how it deals with race.
But there is one very real difference from the days when the nation looked at race as the province of Bull Connor and Ross Barnett, of "Bloody Sunday" and George Wallace's stand in the schoolhouse door.
"The big difference I see from 40 years ago is that the North is caught up in the same thing," Mr. Egerton said. "Forty years ago, the North had no experience with racism, because they had always lived in essentially segregated environments. Now, they find themselves like the South in all the worst kind of ways. They're realizing now they're knee-jerk racists like the rest of us."
He paused for a moment. "Instead of getting out of the woods in 1954, we have found, all of us, that the woods are lonely, dark and deep, and we still have promises to keep. And the truth is, if we don't fix it, we all go down."

HEADLINE: A Rise in Lending Fuels Optimism

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Rarely has the economy been harder to decipher than it is today. Evidence of a slowdown is building up. But in the midst of the glum news, two important indicators -- consumer borrowing and bank loans to companies -- are still rising smartly, suggesting that there is still optimism and growth. Until this lending dies down, if it does, the economy probably won't slow very sharply.
"The borrowing is a sign that people are relaxing and the expansion will stay for a while," said Prof. Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University. "And it is a sign that people in most of the country, while they might not be getting raises, are no longer so worried about losing their jobs. That's more important." 
 Such assertions, backed up by weekly surveys by the University of Michigan's Consumer Research Center and by interviews with bankers, don't go unchallenged, of course. There is the view that lenders, awash with money, are aggressively pushing loans on people who would not borrow and spend so much without the sales pitch. And some of the business loans are undoubtedly going to pay for stockpiles of merchandise that companies cannot sell so quickly.
But the more common explanation among economists is that the rise in business and consumer loans, excluding home mortgages, reflects an economy that is healthy today, whatever the future might hold.
"As long as this borrowing continues to expand briskly, you certainly raise questions about the imminent slowdown of the American economy," said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
Mr. Roach, in fact, is among the more pessimistic forecasters. He predicts that the rise in lending, which began last year, will soon lose its edge. That will happen, he says, as the national economy slows to an annual growth rate of 2.5 percent or less in the second half of this year, from a 3.5 percent growth rate in the first half.
Already, falling home sales, slowly rising inventories of unsold goods and some easing in the purchase of cars and appliances herald the coming slowdown, some economists say.
That is not the view of the Clinton Administration. The White House optimistically expects economic growth in the second half of the year to be closer to 3 percent, at an annual rate, than to 2.5 percent. "These borrowing numbers signify a basically healthy economy, with lots of consumer confidence and business optimism," said Robert F. Wescott, chief economist at the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
The Administration view gets some endorsement from the Consumer Research Center in Michigan -- but with a twist.
"We have been recording an increasing number of people who say if you are going to make a purchase on credit, you had better do so now, to avoid higher interest rates later," Richard T. Curtin, director of the Michigan surveys, said. He was referring to the likelihood that the Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates four times this year, will do so again, in an effort to hold down economic growth and with it the inflation rate.
But Mr. Curtin also finds in his surveys a more positive reason for the borrowing. There is confidence, he says, that the worst of the layoffs is over, and that jobs are more secure. Rising employment feeds this sense of security, and also adds to the total income that the population has to make payments on loans.
Nevertheless, Mr. Curtin added, "people are becoming more concerned that their wages won't rise in the future, and that is beginning to temper their plans."
If so, Robert Hawkins, chairman of Southern Commercial Bank in St. Louis, has not noticed. Loans to his business customers, many of them machine shops, repair shops and parts makers, had fallen off until about four months ago. Then, just as the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates, lending picked up, and Southern Commercial's loan portfolio rose by about $5 million, to $150 million.
 
Building Inventories
 Some of the business borrowing is for capital spending to buy labor-saving automated machinery, Mr. Hawkins said. But most of the pickup reflects a backlog of orders. To service these orders, companies are taking loans to build up their inventories of supplies and parts.
"I have a couple of guys who make wooden shipping pallets, and they cannot find enough pallet wood, so whenever they can they stockpile to keep their order flow going," Mr. Hawkins said. "We have another guy who makes pulleys that go into lawn mowers and Mack trucks, and he is stockpiling the rough castings. But he does not get paid until he machines the castings and ships them, so he does not borrow to buy castings unless he has orders in hand."
Chase Manhattan Bank in New York reports similar lending to businesses, as well as loans to finance mergers and to switch from long-term to short-term debt at lower rates.
"Interest rates have gone up by as much as 2 percentage points in some cases, even on short-term debt, but whatever the increase, it has not been enough to inhibit business borrowing yet," Richard J. Boyle, vice chairman of Chase, said.
 
'Pendulum Has Swung Back'
 Quite apart from demand, the banks themselves, having written off their bad debts, are pushing to supply loans to borrowers, easing up on their reluctance to lend to anyone other than the most creditworthy borrowers.
"The pendulum has swung back and the banks are competing for loan business," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at First Interstate Bank Corporation in Los Angeles.
Reflecting these trends, total commercial and industrial bank loans, which had fallen all of last year, are now rising at an annual rate of 8 percent, reaching $619 billion late last month, the Federal Reserve reports. Installment credit, which represents a wide range of lending to individuals -- including personal loans and credit-card debt but not mortgages -- started rising last year. It is now growing at an annual rate of 9 percent, reaching nearly $840 billion.
But if business lending and consumer credit is booming, total lending in the United States is not so robust. The sum of all lending, by banks and others -- excluding only the Federal Government's debt -- is rising today at an annual rate of 4.5 percent, to about $9.2 trillion.
That rate of increase, despite the slowdown in mortgage lending in recent months, is still greater than at any time since 1990, when a recession set in. But it is not as robust as the annual increases of 10 percent or more that were characteristic of the 1980's.
 
Growth in Credit-Card Use
 Only consumer borrowing approaches the spirit of the 1980's. Still, some of it probably represents a growing trend to buy with credit cards rather than with cash. Many supermarkets, for example, that once accepted only cash and checks now permit payment with credit cards. And the credit-card companies, competing for business, are offering numerous bonuses to cardholders who run up debt on their cards.
"I learned that I could charge my son's college tuition on a credit card, so I did, paying $11,000 and getting frequent-flier mileage as a reward," Mr. Boyle of Chase said. "I will pay the debt right away, but it is clearly substituting debt for cash, and I get a premium."
But Edward S. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, questions whether consumers can continue to increase their debt load at a faster rate than their incomes. He and other analysts note, however, that debt payments as a percentage of disposable income, while rising, are not yet as high as they were in the 1980's.
"My thesis is that consumers took the money saved from refinancing of mortgages at lower interest rates and used this money to pay installments on new debt," Mr. McKelvey said. "Now that the mortgage refinancing has ended, the leverage to take on more debt should disappear."
"We should see spending for cars and appliances purchased on credit decline, and we are beginning to see some of this," Mr. McKelvey said. "But what is puzzling is that borrowing still remains strong."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Oil Prices Post Steep Drop As Worries on Nigeria Ease

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Oil futures prices tumbled yesterday ahead of an important meeting of the largest Nigerian labor union, which had planned a nationwide strike for today.
September crude oil dropped 41 cents, to $20.14 a barrel. Oil prices had touched a 17-month high of $20.98 for a brief time on Monday. 
 Nigeria's oil workers have been on strike for five weeks, demanding that the military-run Government recognize the results of an election that it had annulled.
There were rumors that Moshood Abiola, a detained politician who had apparently won the presidency in the election, would be freed. Those rumors led to selling by oil traders, whose heavy buying on Monday had been fed by reports of increasing political turmoil in Nigeria.
"There was talk about Abiola being released, and while that may not be enough to end the oil workers' strike, it would ease some tensions," one oil broker said. "But it's totally headline trading, and that's why volume over all in the last week hasn't been that great."
Traders said the market had been so volatile that prices could move $1 a barrel in either direction because of Nigerian developments.
Nigerian crude is especially well suited for gasoline production, and gasoline futures are often strongly affected by developments there. But gasoline for September delivery settled only 0.04 cent lower yesterday at 59.93 cents a gallon.
The gasoline futures were relatively firm because a huge fire at Chevron's refinery in Philadelphia shut a 35,000-barrel-a-day operation and because spot prices in New York harbor were strong. By contrast, September heating oil tumbled 1.24 cents, to 53.02 cents a gallon.
The weaker crude prices contributed to losses in gold and other precious metals that are considered hedges against overall inflation. August gold fell $4.80 an ounce, to $378.40, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
On other commodity markets, wheat prices rose in reaction to an agreement to limit Canadian imports into the United States.
September wheat rose 5.25 cents, to $3.3575 a bushel, the highest closing price since June 15 for the spot contract at the Chicago Board of Trade.
The agreement limiting Canada's tariff-free wheat exports to 1.45 million metric tons this year will probably not have much impact on trade.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Off 14% in June

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell 14.1 percent in June to a two-year low, the Government reported yesterday, providing another sign that an important part of the economy was slowing down.
Analysts said the home sales figures confirmed what recently reported declines in housing starts and sales of existing homes had been suggesting: that interest rate increases engineered by the Federal Reserve Board were putting a crimp in home building and related businesses. 
 The June drop was bigger than anticipated, but a number of economists said it would be a mistake to infer that the decline in housing activity would spread quickly to other sectors of the economy. Indeed, they said that what was happening was fairly typical of past economic expansions.
 "Housing sort of lifts the economy off the launching pad and is the first to show a sign of weakening," said Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg. "And the housing numbers are now decidedly weak."
 
 
Crucial Meeting on Aug. 16
 Still, weakness in the housing market is unlikely to dissuade the Fed from raising interest rates further, particularly if broader economic reports expected over the next two weeks are strong.
The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee is scheduled to hold its next meeting on Aug. 16.
The bond market, which thrives on weak economic data, was unimpressed with yesterday's housing report. After rising sharply in early trading, bond prices gave up all of their gains and closed with little change from Monday. [Page D5.]
The Departments of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development said yesterday that new-home sales totaled 591,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in June, down from the revised May rate. The sales pace was the slowest since June 1992, when new-home sales totaled 584,000.
In addition to the downward revision to the May sales figures, which were cut to 688,000 from 738,000, new- home sales figures for April and March were also lowered.
Since early February, when the Fed began to rachet up the short-term interest rates it controls, rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have risen about 1.5 percentage points, to around 8.6 percent, said Michael Carliner, an economist at the National Association of Home Builders.
 
 
Market Could Rebound
 Typically, it takes four months before a rise in rates translates into slower home sales. But Mr. Carliner said he did not expect conditions in the housing industry to deteriorate further.
"I think we will see something of a rebound from this number," he said. "I would not expect to see a further decline. The peak of this housing cycle probably occurred in the fourth quarter of 1993. But taken as a whole, this year will be an improvement over 1993."
In the fourth quarter of last year, new-home sales averaged 769,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. The average for this year's second quarter was 651,000.
Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company, said a slowdown in residential home building "could certainly" cut growth in the second half of the year by as much as half a percentage point.
But he added that weakness in housing would probably not persuade the Fed to stop pushing up short-term interest rates.
"We think they have some more tightening to do here," he said.
Expectations of additional increases in interest rates remain in place. Even though second-quarter growth was a slower-than-expected 3.7 percent, the Fed would like to see growth at around 2.5 percent, a pace it sees as consistent with stable prices.
 Engineering that sort of a slowdown will require higher rates, because as the expansion progresses, sectors of the economy that are less sensitive to interest rates gather momentum. Analysts argue that such a process is happening now.
"I see other sectors strengthening," said Paul Mastroddi, a managing director at J. P. Morgan & Company. "Business investment is booming, a number of state and local governments are cutting taxes and foreign economies are picking up, which will help exports. I think it is a mistake to misinterpret sectoral rotation for a weakening in the economy."
At their Aug. 16 meeting, members of the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee will probably place more emphasis on reports due later this week and next on employment, prices and retail sales for July, Mr. Mastroddi said.

HEADLINE: An Impatient Advocate Stirs Up the Education Department's Right
Office

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In the year that she has served as the Assistant Education Secretary for Civil Rights, Norma V. Cantu has moved through the once-moribund office like the blustery winds that sweep across the plains of her native Texas.
She has ordered her 10 regional offices to double the number of complaints they investigate. She has told regional officials to hire more bilingual staff members. And her office, which acts as a watchdog against civil rights violations in educational institutions, has unleashed a flurry of regulations on age discrimination and racial and sexual harassment on the job and in the classroom. 
 She has even taken on the National Collegiate Athletic Association, pushing for an increase in the scholarships and other resources that colleges dedicate to women's athletics.
"People who know me know how much I love my work as an advocate for children and education," said Ms. Cantu, a 39-year-old Harvard-educated lawyer who seems to speed-walk to the meetings that punctuate her day. "And I'm not real accepting of people's excuses for why things can't get done."
 
Earlier Critics Satisfied
 By getting things done, she is muffling many of the critics who long complained that the office was an ineffective voice for women, minorities and the disabled, a reluctant defender of those whose civil rights it is charged with upholding.
Three years ago, for instance, Ms. Cantu's predecessor, Michael Williams, created a maelstrom by prohibiting colleges from awarding scholarships based on race, a practice widely undertaken by institutions as a way to diversify enrollments.
"What was so disheartening was the focus seemed to be that the greatest civil rights problems we had were those relating to the discrimination against whites," said Janell Byrd, assistant counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "I get the sense that the department is more in sync with reality now than it was under the Reagan and Bush Administrations."
But others say their sense is that Ms. Cantu is more litigious than her predecessors, a legacy from her years as a lawyer for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund. In that role, Ms. Cantu tended to build her anti-discrimination lawsuits around the remedy of mandatory busing.
"As a litigator, she pushed the outer boundaries for forced busing for desegregation," said Clint Bolick, the litigation director for the Institute for Justice, a conservative public-interest law firm in Washington.
"She continually urged courts to engage in social engineering schemes like busing," said Mr. Bolick, who opposed Ms. Cantu in a school desegregation case in Austin, Tex., in the 1980's. "But fortunately her position was firmly repudiated by the recent Supreme Court decisions on busing."
In those decisions, issued in 1990 and 1992, the Court held that school districts could be released from court-ordered desegregation plans -- and mandatory busing -- if they had made good-faith efforts over the years to eliminate racial segregation. The Justices left the determination of good faith to state courts.
Ms. Cantu says she would rather resolve complaints early than let them escalate into protracted and costly litigation. But she does not shy from court action, either. "We are spending a lot of money in adversarial proceedings," she said. That money comes from a $55 million annual budget that, given her office's mandate, she describes as modest.
 
Roots in the Rio Grande
 Ms. Cantu, warm and friendly with a ringing laugh, has in many ways spent a lifetime preparing for her new post. She was reared in the agriculturally rich but economically poor Rio Grande Valley of Texas. The Cantu family -- she is the eldest of six children -- made do for years on the paycheck of her father, Federico, a postal carrier. Ms. Cantu excelled academically and received scholarships and other aid after graduating from high school in three years with honors.
She double-majored in English and education at Pan American University, graduating summa cum laude in two and a half years, and entered Harvard Law School at age 19. She graduated there in 1977.
She taught English in San Antonio public schools briefly and then joined the Texas Attorney General's office, where she spent two years on a high-profile case investigating fraud and corruption in nursing homes.
But it was her next job, as a lawyer for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, that embroiled her in the politics of education. Ms. Cantu was one of two of the organization's lawyers pressing the State of Texas to narrow the spending gap between rich schools and poor ones, a case that has been in and out of state courts since 1968 and has served as a model for impoverished school systems in 27 other states where similar lawsuits have been filed.
She later took the state to court over the inequitable resources it allots to colleges and universities (including her alma mater, which has since become the University of Texas-Pan American) in South Texas, where more than 90 percent of the population is Hispanic.
 
The Homecoming
 When she returned to Brownsville to try that case two years ago, she stayed with her parents in a homecoming that held special significance.
"It was the first time my parents saw firsthand what I did," said Ms. Cantu, who worked late into the night on their dining-room table preparing for the next day's testimony. She even enlisted her father's help; he picked up witnesses from hotels and drove them to the courthouse. "That was a pretty close time for all of us," Ms. Cantu recalled.
Friends, family and colleagues describe her as approachable but hard-driving and a stickler for preparation. A recent visit to the Education Department's civil rights offices found her setting a torrid pace for herself and her staff, yet refraining from meddling as staff members went about their work.
But those who know Ms. Cantu well also say she has a tendency to take on too much. That can be a decisive weakness for an administrator, a point on which she agrees.
"She's always anxious to help people," said Albert Kauffman, the lawyer for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund who worked with her in the Texas public-school-financing lawsuit. "Because she is rare -- being a woman and a minority -- and because she is high-profile, she got a lot of invitations to be a speaker or to be on panels. After a while, she found out it wasn't possible to do everything. She got better at saying no."
She did not, however, say no to Bill Clinton. After his election as President, she was quickly chosen to become one of the Administration's highest-ranking Hispanic officials.
Ms. Cantu says she uses her own modest beginning as a reference point in her work, since it gives her an intimate understanding of how poverty and discrimination can undermine minority students.
"I don't feel like I'm on a mission impossible," she said, referring to the task of writing regulations that attempt to eliminate racism and age and sex discrimination. "Every time I hear of a new instance of discrimination, I also hear of a new instance where people are treated more equitably. That's what keeps me going."

HEADLINE: Pataki Rival Outlines Plans to Cut Taxes

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Combining economic policy with political jabs at a Republican rival, the insurgent Republican candidate for governor issued a detailed proposal today for cutting state personal income taxes by 24 percent and reducing state spending by almost $4 billion a year.
The proposal by Richard M. Rosenbaum draws abundantly from the policies of two Republican governors whose legislative successes are becoming issues in New York State's race: William F. Weld in Massachusetts and Christine Todd Whitman in New Jersey. 
 But coming six weeks before the Sept. 13 Republican primary, the proposal served as much a political purpose as an economic one. On the one hand, it provided a critique of the policies of the Democratic incumbent, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is being painted as a tax-and-spend liberal by the Republicans.
On the other, it provided a vehicle for Mr. Rosenbaum to attack his Republican rival, State Senator George E. Pataki, who has endorsed cutting taxes but has yet to release a plan explaining how much he would reduce taxes or how he would pay for it.
 
Pataki Under Attack
"I'd like him to stop being the stealth candidate," Mr. Rosenbaum said of Mr. Pataki. "He doesn't release his taxes. He doesn't release his economic program, if he has one. He says he won't debate me, even before I challenged him to one."
Caroline Quartararo, Mr. Pataki's spokeswoman, declined today to comment about Mr. Rosenbaum's plan, saying: "George has said he would cut taxes; he's said some specific things. There will be more specifics on his proposal as the campaign progresses."
Political aides to Mr. Cuomo believe Mr. Pataki's intention is to offer few details about how he would govern until after the Republican primary, a strategy that could help him avoid criticism and give him greater control over his campaign message.
But if Mr. Rosenbaum conducts a vigorous campaign that draws widespread attention, he could pressure Mr. Pataki to define his platform sooner than he wanted, political analysts say. And though Mr. Pataki continued to ignore Mr. Rosenbaum today, some analysts said he does so at the risk of remaining an unknown to fence-sitting voters would could still swing over to Mr. Cuomo.
 
Opportunity for 'Substance'
 "It would be a mistake to take Rosenbaum for granted," said Fred Siegel, senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington. "Here's his opportunity to introduce substance into the campaign. Let him talk about welfare reform and infrastructure problems. Let him show he can be governor."
Mr. Rosenbaum, a former state Republican chairman, developed his plan largely with the assistance of his chief political strategist, Dick Morris, who was also a consultant to Mr. Weld's gubernatorial campaign.
Under the plan, the state personal income tax would be reduced in several ways over the coming three years. First, the top rate of 7.785 percent would be cut to about 6.7 percent. He would eliminate state income taxes on capital gains. He would raise the taxable income at which the top rate takes affect from $26,000 a year for married couples to $100,000. And he would increase the number of poor people who do not pay any income taxes.
To pay for the estimated $4 billion in revenue lost each year by those cuts, Mr. Rosenbaum would drastically reduce spending on several programs. He would, over two years, end welfare payments to able-bodied adults without children, a program known as home relief. He would cut welfare payments to poor families by about 20 percent.
He would also cut "soft" prison costs like transportation programs for prisoners' families and cable television. He would sell public bus routes in New York City to private companies. He would seek a Federal waiver to reduce Medicaid spending on illegal immigrants. And he would raise tuition for the state and city university systems for wealthier families and out-of-state students.
Mr. Rosenbaum has been fighting the perception that he represents the party's liberal wing, and his economic plan, like a welfare reform plan he recently released, seems intended to bolster his campaign contention that he is "conservative enough" to be a tough governor.
But advocates for the poor said Mr. Rosenbaum was using poor people as scapegoats for the state's economic problems. And critics said many of his proposals -- including raising tuition and reducing welfare benefits -- would face an uphill fight in the State Legislature, particularly in the Democratic-controlled Assembly.
Mr. Rosenbaum demurred. "These are not pie in the sky," he said. "We have to put the harsh light of reality on these programs. It's absurd to say you need an open-ended relief program."

HEADLINE: In School

BYLINE: By Jane Gross 

DATELINE: CARSON, Calif.

 BODY:
There was no talk of college in Daniel Gonzalez's home when he was growing up, despite his straight A average. Nor was the boy encouraged in junior high school in South-Central Los Angeles, where most of his teachers set meager goals for him.
"They used to tell me, 'Get a high school diploma,' " Daniel said. "Even to be a custodian, they said, you need a high school diploma." 
 But one teacher pushed harder than that. Four years ago he urged Daniel to apply to a new public high school here, the California Academy of Mathematics and Science, which is a joint venture of the California State University system, eight school districts in the Los Angeles area and a consortium of high-technology companies.
Today, Daniel is headed for the University of Rochester in New York, college-bound like everyone else in his 114-member graduating class, each of them testimony to a bold educational experiment that offers promising minority students a demanding math and science curriculum, access to the resources of a university and lots of remedial attention. The early results have been extraordinary.
"When you think big and offer a nurturing environment, all of a sudden you get these kids contemplating the same schools as the kids at Andover and Exeter," said Linden Beckford, a counselor at the academy, which is sending its first graduates to universities like Stanford, Columbia, Brown, Cornell, Yale and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as to state campuses from one end of California to the other.
The academy, founded in 1990 in response to several studies and task force reports about the erosion of the nation's scientific and technical work force, was the brainchild of W. Ann Reynolds, then the head of the California State University system and now chancellor of the City University of New York.
While many high schools across the country offer accelerated math and science programs, CAMS, as the academy is known here, has carved itself a special mission.
The academy, which operates out of a bank of modular classrooms at Cal State's Dominguez Hills campus here, concentrates on women and minorities, many of them the impoverished children of immigrants who will become the first in their families to graduate from high school. Mirroring the demographics of the districts on which it draws, including Los Angeles, Long Beach and Compton, the student body is 52 percent female and 86 percent minorities.
The academy, with 60 feeder schools, seeks out students with potential, not merely those of honor-roll achievement. Any applicant in the top one-third of the class is considered, not just those in the top 5 percent.
Because the academy shares a university campus, including classrooms, laboratories and libraries, its students have a chance to earn enough college credits to begin higher education as sophomores. Daniel, for instance, has already taken college-level sociology, political science, philosophy, psychology and economics.
And while the average grade point average for freshmen in the state system is 2.48 on a 4.0 scale, CAMS students taking college-level courses at Cal State/Dominguez Hills have a mean grade point average of 3.2 in those courses.
The academy uses educational innovations that include school-based management, in which teachers help make many of the policy decisions usually reserved for administrators; cooperative learning, which has students work in teams, and scope-and-sequence curriculums, where subjects like algebra, geometry and trigonometry are integrated, rather than taught in isolation, one grade at a time.
Those techniques are endorsed by many high-technology companies and make the students attractive to such employers. "They are marketable when they arrive at the doorstep of industry," said Joanne Maguire, the deputy general manager of the defense systems division at TRW, the leading corporate sponsor of the academy. The academy has a $2.7 million annual operating budget, 20 percent from industry and the rest from the state.
The academy also offers an array of programs that would be unnecessary in a school with more privileged students. There are coast-to-coast bus tours every year to visit colleges, for instance, modeled on the trips that many middle- and upper-income teen-agers make at spring break with their parents. There is dormitory space for students living in especially chaotic circumstances, like a girl who had witnessed a murder in her home and a boy whose family was living in a garage. And there are mentors who take students to the opera or the workplace.
There is also enhanced counseling, particularly for juniors and seniors preparing for college. In addition to the two regular counselors, both experts in college placement from the Los Angeles Unified School District, the academy has another at work half time during application season. And the school's full-time fund-raiser, an unheard-of position in most public schools, seeks grant money for the bus tours.
Incoming freshmen, who are at the end of a monthlong summer orientation on the campus, say they are a bit disoriented to be out of their familiar neighborhoods and away from their friends, but grateful to be on a campus without gangs, guns and despair.
Cynthia Zarate, for one, marveled at being in a school where rowdy classmates did not interrupt lessons, where firecrackers did not explode in hallways, where homework assignments were actually collected and where teachers "put positive thoughts in your mind."
Cynthia said that her junior high school friends here in Carson, her sisters and her cousins all asked with scorn why she chose to go to such a "nerdy" school. "But I was starting to see the way they were going," she said. "It's a two-way thing, and they're taking the left turn and I'm taking the right."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Issues Mixed; Bonds Give Back Gains

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday as the bond market gave back much of its earlier gains after a Government report showed a sharp drop in June new-home sales because of higher interest rates.
Bonds were given a lift from a stronger dollar amid optimisim that talks between the United States and Japan would produce a compromise to avert a potential trade war. 
 The price of the 30-year bond slipped 3/32 , to 8611/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 7.40 percent, from 7.39 percent on Monday. The yield on a two-year note dropped 2 basis points, to 5.97 percent, while the yield on a seven-year note fell a basis point, to 6.88 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
 
New-Home Sales Decline
 The Commerce Department reported yesterday that sales of new homes fell 14.1 percent in June, which was weaker than expected.
Home sales are typically the first area of economic activity to be slowed by higher interest rates, said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist for the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh.
"While housing might have contributed heavily to past economic growth, from here forward those contributions will be smaller and will not give the boost to the economy going forward as it has in the past year," Mr. Hoffman said. As a result, he sees economic growth slowing to 2.5 percent, from nearly 3.5 percent in the last two quarters. "Hints are now appearing that growth is cooling," he said.
Analysts said it was important to keep in mind not only the volatility of the homes sales data, but also the tendency for the Government to make sharp revisions to past data. Many analysts said that the June report almost certainly overstated the degree of weakness in housing. Many analysts expect that the Fed will weigh tomorrow's retail sales report and Friday's employment report and may tighten credit on Aug. 16, after the Fed's policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets. Some expect a rise in short-term rates of about a half-point depending on the strength of the employment and retail reports for July.
Mr. Hoffman said he expected that the Fed would raise rates again, but with a gentle touch.
Elsewhere, investors in the municipal bond market found the New York State Thruway Authority's $375 million negotiated sale of revenue bonds attractive enough to cause orders to outstrip the amount of bonds available for sale and in some cases lower the bond yields about 5 basis points.
Underwriters led by Smith Barney Inc. repriced the shorter-maturity serial bonds to yield from 3.75 percent for an issue due in 1995 to 5.95 percent in 2011. For longer maturities, a bond due in 2014 was priced to yield 6.15 percent.
The financing, except for the triple-A rated insured securities which run from 2000 through 2011, is rated A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the corporate bond market, Sears, Roebuck & Company was busy selling $783.5 million of global bonds backed by credit cards, in two parts.
In the first part, underwriters led by CS First Boston priced $750 million of senior securities with an average life of five years at $998.44 for every $1,000 of debt, to yield 7.141 percent, or about 43 basis points more than Treasury securities with a similar maturity.
The remaining $33.5 million of subordinated securities with average life of 6.1 years was priced at $998.13 for every $1,000 of debt to yield 7.40 percent, or about 60 basis points more than a Treasury with a comparable maturity.
Traders said the senior debt was rated triple-A by Moody's and S.& P., while the subordinated debt was rated A1 by Moody's and A by S.& P.

HEADLINE: Stocks Are Listless as Dow Falls 1.95

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
The stock market was listless yesterday and ended with no distinctive trend.
"The burned-out bulls and burned-out bears let the chips fall where they may," said Alan R. Ackerman, executive vice president of Reich & Company. "This was a market that had more than a split personality. It went nowhere fast." 
 Stocks were up strongly early in the day as traders reacted to the unexpected news that sales of new homes plummeted 14.1 percent in June, the slowest pace since June 1992 and an indication of slackening economic growth. The Dow Jones industrial average advanced to 3,811.44 at one point and continued above Monday's closing level for most of the day.
But at the end of the session, all three major market averages were just below the previous day's close, after three consecutive days of increases. The Dow closed at 3,796.22, off 1.95 points, and has not wound up above the 3,800 level since June 16.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed at 460.56, off 0.45 point, and the Nasdaq composite index closed at 724.80, off 0.05 point.
Advancing stocks, however, outnumbered declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange, 1,268 to 906. Volume on the Big Board totaled 295.6 million shares, slightly higher than the yearly average of 287 million shares but significantly greater than Monday's turnover of 258.5 million shares.
International oil companies faltered yesterday, following reports that crude oil for delivery in September dropped 41 cents, to $20.14 a barrel. There was speculation that a monthlong oil strike in Nigeria, which has sharply reduced the country's crude oil production, might end soon. Exxon fell 7/8, to 59 1/4, Royal Dutch/ Shell Group declined 1 1/8, to 111 3/4, and Mobil dropped 5/8, to 83 3/4..
Gold stocks fell as the price of gold was pushed down to a three-month low amid signs of potentially slower inflation. Gold fell $5, to $384.40 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange of New York. Echo Bay Mines closed at 11, down 5/8; Placer Dome closed down 5/8, at 20 1/8; Homestake Mining closed at 18 1/8, down 5/8, and American Barrick closed at 22 1/8,, down 3/8.
But paper stocks moved higher as a result of plans to increase the price of linerboard and optimism among analysts that demand for cardboard boxes would grow. Stone Container advanced 1/2, to 18 1/8, International Paper increased 1 3/8, to 75 1/4, and Georgia Pacific rose 3 1/8, to 69.
Utility issues were also on the plus side, moving in tandem with the bond market, which generally moved higher, except for the 30-year bond. Con Edison rose 1/8, to 29 3/8; Public Service Enterprises gained 1/4, to 28 1/4, and American Electric Power advanced 3/8, to 31 1/2..
A major standout yesterday was American Cyanamid, which stopped trading late in the day with the stock at 93 -- 30 points higher than Monday's close -- after a $95-a-share takeover offer was announced by American Home Products.
Other stocks in the drug group rose in response to this offer. Pfizer climbed 2, to 63 1/2; Upjohn jumped 2, to 32; Eli Lilly increased 1 1/2, to 49 7/8, and Schering-Plough surged 3 3/4, to 66 1/2.
Among other advancing issues, Compania Telefonos de Chile advanced 5 7/8, to 88 3/8. Goldman, Sachs & Company added the company to its recommended list.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Traders' Reborn Optimism On Japan Talks Spurs Dollar

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the yen and most other leading currencies yesterday as concern about trade relations between the United States and Japan faded.
The dollar fell sharply in early trading Monday before trimming its losses, after negotiations aimed at getting Japanese Government agencies to buy more American goods broke down apart over the weekend. 
 But the outlook for the dollar improved yesterday, traders said, as it it appeared to them that the two nations would try to keep negotiating.
The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, has established a 60-day timetable for resolving the dispute. A month after that, the Administration is authorized to retaliate with sanctions.
"People are looking at the situation and thinking, 'We've got 60 days, that's plenty of time for them to get things sorted out,' " said Chris Furness, currency strategist at a market consulting firm in London, IDEA.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 100.36 yen, up from 99.41 yen on Monday. The dollar also gained against the German mark, rising to 1.5835 marks, from 1.5787 on Monday.
The dollar also gained yesterday because more traders and analysts are becoming convinced that the White House no longer wants to use the dollar's weakness to wring trade concessions out of the Japanese.
"There's been a policy shift from benign neglect to apparent concern," said Peter Gloyne, manager of institutional foreign-exchange trading at the First National Bank of Chicago. "People think the U.S. doesn't want to see the dollar go lower because of what it could do to the Government bond market and international investors' confidence."
The dollar tumbled last year after officials said a strong yen would curb Japan's trade surplus by making Japanese exports more costly. The Administration shifted its stance after the dollar's weakness spurred an exodus from bonds, driving up American interest rates.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen reiterated the Administration's new position on Monday, saying he wanted a strong, stable dollar.
"The trade dispute is a tired story for the currency market," said Anil Agarwal, currency specialist at Brown Brothers Harriman. Even with the trade dispute, he said, Japan's $60 billion annual surplus with the United States will start to shrink later this year, taking pressure off the dollar.
Other analysts cautioned that the dollar was making its gains in a slow summer market, a time of relatively light trading. Many Europeans are away for the month on vacation, noted David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics. "This is how August always is," he said.

Mexico Says U.S. Makers 'Dump' Steel

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The American steel industry, one of the most aggressive complainers that it had suffered because of foreign competitors' "dumping" their products in the United States, stood accused today by Mexico of the same violation.
The Mexican Commerce Department imposed tariffs on two types of United States steel imports, arguing that the step was necessary to prevent the Americans from selling their products at unfairly low prices here. 
 The Mexican action came at a time when the United States-Mexico economic relationship is expanding, partly as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Steel tariffs are scheduled to be phased out in the next decade under the trade agreement, which is intended to make North America a single market where most goods and services can flow freely across borders.
 
A Prevalent Accusation
 Dumping is the selling of a product in a foreign market at a price lower than that in the home market or selling below the cost of production abroad to shed excess product. It is one of the most prevalent accusations in international trade disputes.
"After a thorough investigation, the department decided to impose definitive compensatory tariffs of up to 78.46 percent on sheet plate and up to 38.21 percent on galvanized laminated steel," the Mexican Commerce Department said.
The department said that sheet plate makers affected by the compensatory tariffs were the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, with a tariff of 46.18 percent; USX, 76 percent; the Geneva Steel Company, 78.46 percent, and Lukens Inc., 44.9 percent.
Arthur J. Roth, a spokesman for Bethlehem in Bethlehem, Pa., said the company had only begun to review the Mexican Government decision. However, Mr. Roth added, "We disagree with the decision because it is contrary to the facts and the law and are considering an appeal."
He said the company exported only about 1,300 tons a year of steel plates to Mexico, or about 10 percent of its total steel shipments to that country. Other accused United States steelmakers did not respond immediately.
 
Some Companies Not Named
 The announcement added that other United States companies suspected of dumping sheet place on the Mexican market would face tariffs of 78.46 percent. Those companies were not identified.
The Government also imposed a 38.21 percent tariff on steel manufacturers that export galvanized laminate steel, including USX, Mitsui, New Process and World Metals Inc.
The accused "have shown that they were exporting to Mexico at dumping prices that have or threaten to damage the national industry," the statement said.
Under the trade agreement, steel tariffs are to disappear by the year 2004. Tariffs will also be phased out by that year on textiles, cotton, lumber and cosmetics. Duties on such goods as glassware, orange juice, sugar and peanuts are to be phased out within 15 years.

HEADLINE: In Mandela's South Africa, Foreign Investors Are Few

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Courting South Africa last year, the advance scouts of Western money brought an alluring message: make peace and take the free-market pledge, and a thousand projects will bloom.
But 10 months after Nelson Mandela formally invited foreign business to come back, and three months after the elections that secured this reborn capitalist the presidency, South Africa has yet to see the surge of investment needed to fuel growth and jobs. 
 The country reached an almost miraculous political consensus, leading to the end of economic sanctions and the resultant isolation. Mr. Mandela has adopted a sober, growth-oriented economic policy. But investors have found a host of reasons to hold back.
The labor force is costly, unskilled and militant. Trade barriers and currency exchange controls have yet to fall. There are doubts about the Government's long-term commitment to capitalism, about whether Mr. Mandela can contain the expectations of the impoverished majority.
As an investment opportunity, South Africa is an oddball -- part third world, part first world, situated at the bottom of the globe, and attached to a continent that Western investors tend to see, at best, as terra incognita, and, at worst, as doomed.
"In just about every presentation, there's somebody who stands up and asks me, 'What about Rwanda?' " said Charles H. Allison, executive director of New Africa Advisors, an American firm that has been trying to get pension funds to buy a stake in new South African businesses.
Rwanda, that tiny country ruptured by ethnic hatred, is 1,500 miles to the north and is as economically relevant to South Africa as Bosnia is to Boston. But to many Americans, it is all Africa.
"None of the big pension funds are involved in Africa," Mr. Allison said. "The trustees and consultants get off the plane in Johannesburg, and they're shocked that there's an airport, and you don't have to run with lions chasing you."
Mr. Allison, whose company is owned by African-Americans bent on opening that psychological frontier, believes the money will come, and so do many business-savvy South Africans. They point to South Africa's sophisticated business infrastructure and natural bounty. They say the main problem is that big institutional money moves like sludge.
But so far, it is still an open question whether Mr. Mandela will ever get the kind of investment he needs, the kind that produces exports, growth and jobs.
The foreign capital inflow so far has consisted mainly of bargain-seekers buying shares in long-established companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
American and British investment houses set up funds to buy South African stocks and bonds, and at the turn of the year net purchases jumped to 1.094 billion rand, or $299.6 million at current exchange rates, more than double the 440 million rand, or $120.5 million, in December, but since April more foreign money has flowed out than in, a trend that brokers attribute partly to a worldwide anxiety about stocks, but partly to cold feet about South Africa.
With great fanfare, dozens of American companies, led by computer and software concerns and including such brand-name giants as Pepsico and Sara Lee, have opened offices here. But most are either reacquiring subsidiaries that they sold during sanctions, or they are essentially storefronts for goods made elsewhere. They represent little new investment and few new jobs.
"The U.S. companies have historically been there to market to South Africa," said Meg Voorhes of the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a Washington-based group that monitors trade with South Africa. "They can serve the 40-million-strong market in South Africa with goods produced elsewhere. South Africa is not seen as a major sourcing point for exporting globally."
With good reason, said Robert A. J. Irwin, chairman of ASA Ltd., an investment company that buys South African shares, mainly in gold mining. Mr. Irwin recently spent a week here making rounds of bankers, businessmen and officials, investigating other opportunities, and left a skeptic.
"I cannot figure out what South Africa offers to the outside investor in the way of an opportunity to create jobs," he said, citing as its most notable attraction "abundant raw materials."
 
Neither Fish Nor Fowl
 South Africa, he continued, is neither fish nor fowl; it does not fit the profile of other emerging economies, but neither does it have the skills and industrial technology base to compete with developed countries. South Korea and Taiwan, for example, built their muscular economies by exporting cheap clothing and working up to more sophisticated goods, a route that China is now taking.
But that route starts with cheap labor. In South Africa, the manufacturing work force is heavily unionized, costing employers almost $5 an hour in total remuneration, double the cost in Mexico or Brazil and eight times the cost in China. Productivity is comparatively low.
A recent outbreak of labor unrest has been an unnerving reminder to investors -- and to Mr. Mandela -- that workers have not necessarily bought the new Government's message of restraint. Grocery clerks, court employees and construction trades are on strike at the moment. Recently, strikers shut the country's largest casino resort, Sun City. On Monday, 19,000 auto workers stopped work for a day, and they are threatening a longer strike.
 
Workers on Strike
 In the first six months of the year, South Africa lost 1.2 million worker days to strikes, up from 700,000 a year earlier, according to Andrew Levy & Associates, an industrial relations consulting firm. Nor are Westerners alone in shunning South Africa.
"Many Japanese companies invest in Southeast Asia because labor cost is cheaper than South Africa, skills are higher, and sometimes the loyalty to the company is more excellent," said Kyoji Yoshino, Japan's economics attache in Pretoria.
South Africans say that with time the Government will persuade unions to forgo wage increases in favor of training and other measures to increase productivity. But the strong union leaders who might have shaped such compromises have been drafted into Parliament and Government ministries, leaving a power vacuum.
 
Well Equipped for Busineess
 The country is as well equipped for business as most of Europe, with telephones that tend to work, accountants who know their trade, sophisticated banks, a bureaucracy that collects the taxes and delivers the mail.
"You don't have to teach debits and credits in South Africa, as you do in central Europe," said Andre Roux, a vice president in charge of investment capital at Firstcorp Merchant Bank Ltd. "There's a culture of free enterprise that does not exist in South Korea or the Philippines."
Even so, South Africa is not competitive in the developed league. For decades, an aggressive government policy of self-sufficiency directed money from exports and modernization into huge, inefficient import substitution programs. Anti-apartheid sanctions further isolated industry behind a wall of tariffs and currency controls. Cut off from the world, big companies devoured each other, creating cumbersome oligopolies.
 
Signatory to GATT
 Because South Africa has signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, its trade barriers are to fall over the next five years. But in the short run that may cost more jobs than it creates.
Mr. Yoshino, the Japanese attache, said Japanese concerns had no interest in putting money into the auto and electronics plants that operate here under their license, because once tariff barriers were lowered, it would become cheaper to ship in goods.
"There are seven South African motorcar manufacturers, making about 44 kinds of motor vehicles," he said. "The annual sales in South Africa are 300,000 vehicles. That is too many kinds of cars in a small market." He predicts a drastic shakeout.
Much of the optimism about South Africa centers on its potential as a gateway to the rest of Africa. But even if Africa can overcome its self-destructive impulses and become a robust market, South Africa will be wary of knocking down barriers.
"The idea that southern Africa should be opened up into one trading area is very interesting intellectually, but it means initially the exporting of jobs into other countries where labor is cheaper, like Zimbabwe and Mozambique," Mr. Irwin said.
 
A Two-Tier Exchange Rate
 Currency controls, including a two-tier exchange rate, are likely to disappear, but the Government is afraid to move too fast, worrying about a sudden hemorrhage of reserves.
"I don't see South African companies raising money to finance bold new ventures," Mr. Irwin added. "Foreigners are going to look at that and say, 'If locals aren't investing, why should we?' "
That may be changing. According to the South African Reserve Bank, the flight of South African capital overseas, an alarming trend as white rule drew to an end, seems to have slowed in recent months, so at least South African money is staying home.
Where will it go? Chris Liebenberg, the banker named as the next Finance Minister, was asked in an interview where a realistic investor might put money that would produce exports and jobs.
"Tourism," he responded instantly. "Tourism is an export industry." Asked to name a second, he pondered, then suggested "beneficiation," or processing natural resources. Most of the few major expansions under way are cases of beneficiation: aluminum smelting, exploiting cheap surplus electricity from the country's abundant coal; stainless steel, using the country's reserves of chromite ore; turning vast tree farms into pulp and paper, and chemicals synthesized from coal.
Beyond that, bankers say the best hope lies in niche manufacturers, like the BMW subsidiary that makes leather auto seats.
"Despite a lot of negative talk about the money not coming in, it is staggering to see the research going on, the good will," said David M. Lawrence, managing director of Firstcorp. "We have every reason to believe the dollars will be on the table. It will come gradually."

HEADLINE: Businesses' Failures Ebb

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Business failures dropped 20 percent in the first half of the year after economic growth in major industries nationwide, a survey released yesterday indicated.
The survey, by Dun & Bradstreet, said 36,790 businesses failed during the period, compared with 45,906 during the first half of 1993. 
 New England, among the hardest-hit regions in the recent recession, had the largest decline in failures, down 32 percent, to 2,015. New York's failure rate dropped 24 percent.
"The economic recovery appears to have taken hold as the business sector continues to make a steady comeback," said Joseph W. Duncan, a vice president of Dun & Bradstreet and its chief economist.
Also dropping was the size of the failures, as measured by the dollar value of unmet liabilities. That dropped 46 percent, to $13 billion, from $24 billion in 1993.
Among industries, failures in mining had the largest proportional decline -- 41 percent. Failures in finance, insurance and real estate fell by 28 percent. This drop "suggests that the problems the savings and loan industry has suffered over the past few years seem to have subsided," Mr. Duncan said.
Also declining were failures in transportation, utilities, agriculture, construction, wholesale and retail sales, and services.
The failure rate in California, among the states worst hit by the recession, dropped 17 percent.
Rises in failures were reported in Arkansas, 45 percent; Montana, 30 percent; Oregon, 25 percent; Maryland, 8 percent, and Washington, 3 percent.

HEADLINE: Deadliness of Breast Cancer In Blacks Defies Easy Answer

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
IN the two decades that the National Cancer Institute has been gathering data on breast cancer, one thing has been clear: although white women are more likely than black women to get breast cancer, black women are much more likely to die from it. But the question is, why?
Now, several recent studies indicate that breast cancer might appear in a more deadly form among black woman. The tumors tend to be more malignant, as measured by cellular indicators of a poor prognosis. 
 Cancer experts said it was too soon to say whether this indicated that more aggressive treatment was warranted for black women or whether mammography was more -- or less -- likely to make a difference in the prognosis. But they said it was becoming clear that the high breast cancer death rates among black women were not solely the result of poverty or lack of access to medical care.
"There's a difference and I don't think we can ignore it," said Dr. Brenda K. Edwards, associate director of the surveillance program at the National Cancer Institute. She added, "The jury is still out on whether these differences alter our conclusions on the effectiveness of screening."
One study, by Dr. Richard M. Elledge, Dr. C. Kent Osborne and colleagues at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, examined more than 6,000 tumors sent to them from hospitals throughout the United States. They found that tumors from black women had more actively dividing cells than those from white women and had tumor cells that lacked hormone receptors, another indicator of a poor prognosis.
 
Signs of Poor Prognosis
 A study by Dr. Vivien W. Chen of the Louisiana State Medical Center and colleagues examined 963 newly diagnosed tumors and found that tumors from black women were more likely to have several histological features associated with a poor prognosis, including the features found by Dr. Elledge and his colleagues.
A third study, by Dr. Robert S. Siegel of George Washington University Medical Center in Washington, examined laboratory data on 708 tumors from women treated at his hospital and found that the tumors from the black women were more actively growing, were less likely to have hormone receptors and appeared more deranged.
Dr. Larry Kessler, chief of the cancer institute's applied research branch, said the racial differences in breast cancer incidence and mortality had long puzzled investigators. Breast cancer seems to strike black women under the age of 45 at a particularly high rate and to be especially deadly.
No one knows why breast cancer should be more common among young black women, but many cancer specialists have looked for sociological factors to explain why breast cancer is so deadly among blacks when it does occur.
One theory is that the high death rate reflects poor access to medical care among black women. But, Dr. Edwards said, a study she directed found that this can account for only about half of the increased death rate for blacks.
The study included 1,222 women in Atlanta, New Orleans and the San Francisco-Oakland area. The black women, the investigators found, had about twice the death rate of the white women. But, Dr. Edwards said, a substantial proportion of the increased mortality seems to result from biological differences in the cancers of black women.
Dr. Siegel said that in his study he looked at the subset of women who were members of health maintenance organizations where the black and white members had equal access to mammograms and medical care. Even so, he said, the black women tended to have larger, more advanced tumors when their cancers was diagnosed, which may reflect a faster rate of tumor growth.
And Dr. Osborne said that his study looked at the treatments that women received once the disease was diagnosed and found that this factor also did not account for the dismal survival rates for black women.
Another theory is that black women put off seeing a doctor when they find a lump in their breasts, so by the time they get treatment their cancer is advanced and their mortality rate is higher.
Dr. Edwards said investigators in her study asked women who had symptoms, like a lump they could feel or bleeding, pain or discharge from the breast, how long they had waited to see a doctor. Black women waited no longer than whites, she said. "The bottom line is that there was very little difference," she said.
 
Confirming Suspicions
 Some investigators said the new findings confirmed a widespread suspicion among cancer doctors that black women really do have more intransigent cancers.
"I'm not surprised," said Dr. Melvin Moore, who is the director of oncology at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, a hospital that serves mostly black patients. He said he directed a program financed by the cancer institute to recruit members of minorities to clinical trials using the best standard treatment in the control group as well as in the experimental group. He said the program "started with the premise that the reason for the disparate mortality figures had to do with lack of access to state-of-the art care."
Dr. Moore said it was true that blacks often had grossly inferior medical care. "The inequities were glaring," he said. But, he added, "I think there is more to it than that."
Dr. Howard Ozer, director of the Winship Cancer Center at Emory University in Atlanta, said there might be too much blaming the victim for high breast cancer death rates. When black women go to a doctor with already advanced cancer, "it is always said that they don't come to the doctor soon enough," Dr. Ozer said. But, he said, with the evidence that the cancers might also be much more aggressive, "it may not be their fault at all."

Health-Care Gap Seen for Blacks
 Las Vegas, Nev., Aug. 2 (AP) -- African-Americans face a health care system that is "stacked against them," Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders told the National Black Nurses Association today.
Dr. Elders made the assessment while campaigning for the Clinton Administration's health care plan, and urged members to lobby for its passage.
"If every criminal in our country has a right to an attorney, then it's time we gave every sick person a right to a doctor," she said in prepared remarks.
She said blacks faced the greatest threat from the health care crisis because a disproportionate number of them were uninsured and they bore a heavy burden of illness.
"African-Americans face a health care system stacked against them because they are among those Americans most at risk today of going without health insurance coverage and health care," she said.
Losing or changing jobs means losing health insurance, and African-Americans have one of the highest unemployment rates in the country, she said. Contributing factors to the high unemployment include lower education levels and a higher percentage of unmarried mothers, she said. Figures for 1991 showed that 68 percent of black mothers of newborns were unmarried, compared with 22 percent of white mothers, Dr. Elders said.
She said any health care plan must provide universal access to health care, emphasis on prevention and primary care and should stress comprehensive health education.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Ryan Spies Again, This Time as C.I.A. Battles Drug Lords

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN 

 BODY:
Taming the eyeball-glazing prose of Tom Clancy's "Clear and Present Danger" with the same brisk efficiency they brought to "Patriot Games," the makers of this latest espionage thriller have made their first-rate work look easy. And clearly, it was anything but. No amount of exercise under the hot sun will beat the workout involved in following this story, with its dozens of locations, interchangeable-sounding character names (Cutter, Ritter, Clark, Ryan, many more) and high-tech military jargon. A film with a "cellulose encased laser-guided bomb" for a conversation piece is not to be watched casually.
Yet "Clear and Present Danger" (photographed crisply by Donald M. McAlpine and scored by James Horner) looks so lean and moves so vigorously that it actually seems streamlined most of the time. As directed by Philip Noyce, who also did "Patriot Games," this becomes another fast, gripping spy story with some good tricks up its sleeve, and with a much more economical style than that of Mr. Clancy's best-selling novel. Three distinctive screenwriters -- Steven Zaillian ("Schindler's List"), John Milius ("Apocalypse Now") and Donald Stewart (co-writer on "Patriot Games" and "The Hunt for Red October") -- deliver dialogue that is both colorful and swift. 
 Harrison Ford, making only his second screen appearance as Mr. Clancy's heroic C.I.A. agent, Jack Ryan, has already become Old Faithful in this role. Mr. Ford may be the most reticent of American movie stars, but he brings considerable subtlety to the job of humanizing Jack Ryan. In a film that opens with the sight of a waving American flag, subtlety may not be foremost on anyone's mind. But Mr. Ford's wary intelligence does wonders for a potentially one-dimensional character. Jack's heroism on screen has much broader appeal than it does on the page.
Jack is now deputy director of the C.I.A., once his much-admired superior, Adm. James Greer (James Earl Jones, giving a touching, unmannered performance), becomes gravely ill. And one of this film's minor pleasures is the sight of Jack flashing his prestigious C.I.A. business cards at some of the Latin American drug lords who set the story in motion.
"Clear and Present Danger" begins with the discovery of a yacht whose passengers have been murdered, a crime that turns out to be the drug lords' handiwork. Complicating this event are the facts that the principal victim made off with huge sums of money belonging to a drug cartel, and that he was a close friend of the President of the United States. The President, played by Donald Moffat with a Reaganesque mixture of caginess and imperfect hearing, tacitly authorizes a bit of payback.
Unbeknown even to most top C.I.A. personnel, a covert Latin American anti-drug operation is instigated by Cutter, the National Security Adviser (Harris Yulin), with the help of Ritter (Henry Czerny), a rogue C.I.A. man. Mr. Czerny, a Canadian actor who will eventually be familiar to American television audiences when he is seen starring so effectively in "The Boys of St. Vincent," makes a perfect spook. Fidgety, intense, loaded with menace, he becomes the worthiest and most sinister of Ryan's many adversaries in this story.
One of the film's cleverest sequences pits these two in a computer espionage battle, as Ryan and Ritter both try frantically to access Ritter's top-secret files while they also make small talk on the telephone. ("You play tennis?") Only in the brave new world of Mr. Clancy's techno-thrillers does this sort of thing define the meaning of suspense.
Another standout episode, and one of the few here to involve graphic bloodshed, finds Ryan and a group of colleagues suddenly ambushed on a narrow street in Bogota. Equally effective (if a bit less personal) is the scene that follows a smart bomb through the clouds until it hits a drug czar's villa. The villa is one of dozens of varied, sharply evoked international settings here, from the mountains of Colombia all the way to the Oval Office.
The film pays great attention to the lavish, family-oriented home life of Ernesto Escobedo (Miguel Sandoval), who along with his henchman Felix Cortez (Joaquim de Almeida) represents the forces of evil, debonair foreign division. Any similarity to the real drug cartel leader Pablo Escobar, whose death occurred while "Clear and Present Danger" was being filmed, is as fortuitous as it is grim.
Also figuring prominently in "Clear and Present Danger" is a tawny, physically imposing Willem Dafoe as Clark, the mysterious C.I.A. field operative who figures prominently elsewhere in the Clancy canon. The ambiguity of Clark's character suits Mr. Dafoe intriguingly, since it goes so far beyond the ordinary villainy to which he has often been confined. Scenes between Mr. Dafoe and Mr. Ford have a special edginess, since one of them has been so deeply misled about what the other is up to.
There also happen to be a few women in "Clear and Present Danger," but their roles (Hope Lange as a Senator, Ann Magnuson as a hapless pawn in the drug cartel's game) are small. The role that's not small enough is that of Cathy Ryan, the wise, smiling, insufferable wife played again by Anne Archer. Only Cathy seems out of sync with the tough, muscular manner of this story. Cathy doesn't quite ask Jack whether he's remembered his galoshes when he goes off on a dangerous C.I.A. mission, but she comes close.
"Clear and Present Danger" is rated PG-13 (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, most of it discreet, and occasional profanity.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

DATELINE: UKIAH, Calif., July 29

 BODY:
Outwardly, little has changed in the last few years at Eagle Ridge Ranch, where Hubert Germain-Robin makes what may be the best brandy in the United States.
There are still the wheat-colored slopes of the California coastal range, the sheep huddled in the shade to escape the 100-degree heat, the barns, the little distillery, the chai where the brandy ages, and the buzzing of cicadas. 
 But there has been change here, high in the mountains 100 miles north of San Francisco, and it has been harsh. The economic downturn was not kind to the fledgling brandy business. It dried up discretionary income -- no one needs expensive brandy. It also sounded the death knell for the country's traditional distribution system for wine and spirits. As major distributors closed their doors or merged, small producers like Germain-Robin found themselves with no one to sell their product.
"We're just now about where we were in 1990," said Ansley Coale Jr., who owns Eagle Ridge Ranch and is Mr. Germain-Robin's partner in Alambic Inc., their small brandy business.
Hard times occasioned some hard thinking. The two partners decided that they would concentrate on direct sales and that the product would be expensive. "People want something different," Mr. Coale said, "and they seem to be willing to pay for it. Our most expensive brandies sell out first." Currently, the most expensive Germain-Robin brandy is the V 57 Single Barrel, at $130 a bottle.
But Germain-Robin's most innovative move has been packaging brandy in individual casks. Private individuals, restaurants and wine and spirit merchants can order their own casks for $550 to $1,000. The price includes a 10-liter oak cask and a case of Germain-Robin brandy. The quality of the brandy determines the price. A case of 12 bottles holds 9 liters.
The basic Germain-Robin fine brandy is $550 with cask; the Christmas Blend is $720, and the Reserve is $1,000. For brandy connoisseurs, Mr. Germain-Robin will create a custom blend for $850.
The casks are made by Tonnellerie Vernou, a barrel maker in Cognac, from old barrels in which Cognac had been stored. Each cask bears a plaque with the owner's name.
"The owner has a choice," Mr. Coale said. "Consider the cask a one-time thing, drain it until it's about a third full, then put the remaining brandy back into bottles. By then the cask will be drying out and the brandy will be getting quite oaky.
"Or, keep topping the cask off with more brandy. The cask will remain intact and the brandy will never be overwhelmed by oak."
"The brandy in these barrels will continue to age," Mr. Germain-Robin said, "becoming richer and more harmonious." One year of aging in the small cask is the equivalent of two years in a standard Cognac barrel, he estimates. About 50 of the 10-liter barrels have been sold. In all, 100 are planned.
Customers include the Four Seasons Restaurant and Morrell & Company, a wine and spirits retailer, both in New York; the Ryland Inn in Clinton, N.J.; Stars, Postrio and Fog City Diner in San Francisco, and the White House.
Members of Mr. Germain-Robin's family had been making Cognac in France since 1782. When their firm, Jules Robin & Company was sold to Martell, the Cognac giant, he decided to seek his fortune elsewhere.
Mr. Coale is a transplanted Easterner. He came to Ukiah and the bucolic life by way of the University of California at Berkeley, where he spent some unhappy years teaching ancient history. Eagle Ridge Ranch, which he discovered in 1973, was his ticket out. He bought all 2,000 acres "for the price of a house in San Francisco" and escaped from academia.
In 1981, Mr. Coale and his wife, Cynthia, picked up a hitchhiker on a Mendocino highway. He was Hubert Germain-Robin. Out of that serendipitous meeting came Alambic Inc. Mr. Coale had found a way to make his ranch more profitable; Mr. Germain-Robin found an opportunity to make brandy in a more personal, traditional way.
Mr. Germain-Robin returned to France and found an old, handmade copper still that was being sold for junk. It was shipped to California and reassembled by the two men, and it was soon producing about 80 barrels of brandy a year, a level Alambic has maintained.
In the Cognac region of France, the grape of choice in brandy making is called the St.-Emilion. This is an undistinguished grape known elsewhere in France as ugni blanc and in Italy as trebbiano. In California, Mr. Germain-Robin has experimented with many grapes, settling on French colombard, pinot noir and gamay beaujolais as his principal working varieties. Colombard was the principal grape in the Cognac region in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Mr. Germain-Robin recently released a single barrel of brandy made entirely of colombard, called V 16, which produced only 38 cases. Another recent creation is a Cigar Blend, which relies heavily on brandy made from the sauvignon blanc grape. "It's oakier than our usual releases and displays cedar and tobacco overtones that are the perfect complement to an excellent cigar," he said.
For the last two years, Mr. Germain-Robin has distilled a grappa from organically grown, old-vine zinfandel grapes. Grappa is usually a brandy distilled from pomace, the rough leavings of the wine-making process. The Germain-Robin version has a smoothness and elegance rarely encountered in a traditional grappa.

TASTINGS
Groot Constantia Pinotage, 1989, South Africa. About $10.
 
Pinotage is a wine unique to South Africa. The pinotage grape is a hybrid of pinot noir and cinsault, a grape called hermitage in the vineyards of the Western Cape. Pinotage was developed by South African viticulturists in the mid-1920's. The best of it, including this wine made at one of the country's oldest wineries, has little of what we in the Northern Hemisphere expect from pinot noir. The wine more closely resembles a Rhone-style wine with the refinement of a good Bordeaux. In fact, it's a difficult wine to categorize, which makes it all the more intriguing to drink. There is good fruit in this wine and a sweet aroma that is not mirrored in the taste. It is a bit tannic; another year in the bottle would not be amiss.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Broken Dreams on the Road To Country-Music Stardom

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY 

 BODY:
Cabarets in the Times Square district are unlikely showcases for wholesomeness. But with only a few excisions, "Honky-Tonk Highway," a jalopy-to-limousine musical about a touring country music band at Don't Tell Mama, could play Disneyland.
This formulaic, folksy parable about the perils of fame, with a book by Richard Berg and music and lyrics by Robert Lindsey-Nassif, is a smoothly sanitized pastiche of film biographies of Nashville stars, like "Your Cheating Heart" and "Coal Miner's Daughter." And its sensibility bears roughly the same relationship to the throbbing heartache behind the best country classics that airline food does to home cooking. 
 Set in a Tennessee roadhouse in 1970, the show is built around the collective reminiscences of five former members of a band called the Mountain Rangers, who have reassembled to figure out what went wrong on the road to Nashville and to celebrate the memory of Clint Colby, their late lead singer.
Mr. Berg's book covers every conventional base of bittersweet music success stories, and the show's characters are correspondingly generic. There's the baby-faced Lothario (Rick Leon), the melancholy drinker (Matthew Bennett), the family man (Sean McCourt), the group clown (Kevin Fox) and the female vocalist (the lovely Erin Hill), who is the essential link in a chain of unrequited love. Each of the men takes turns portraying the self-destructive Clint, whose demons are pretty mild as demons go. (He is finally felled not by hard-living hedonism, but by a lonely, arrhythmic heart.) And the roles of sex, drugs and drink in the lives of the group are presented with cosmetic light-heartedness.
The director, Gabriel Barre, has made admirably efficient use of the cabaret's tiny stage. Mr. Lindsey-Nassif's imitative songs, which range from Gatlin Brothers-like harmonies to Porter Wagoner-Loretta Lynn-ish duets, are pleasantly tuneful. And the show's undeniably talented, clean-scrubbed performers sing winningly and accompany themselves on a remarkable 18 instruments, from mandolins and fiddles to pianos and guitars.
More like a vanilla milkshake than a stiff shot of Rebel Yell, "Honky-Tonk Highway" never really engages the emotions, and its blandly sweet charm wears thin over two hours. But for audiences seeking midtown entertainment that would pass Senator Jesse Helms's scrutiny, the play provides an economical alternative to "Beauty and the Beast."

HEADLINE: Senate's Promising Health Bill

 BODY:
The health-care bill that the majority leader, George Mitchell, put before the Senate yesterday looks encouraging. It would achieve universal coverage and market reform by borrowing artfully from two flawed committee bills. It is far better than the poorly designed bill before the House. Though there is a glaring fault that needs to be corrected, Mr. Mitchell has provided a workable basis for reform.
Mr. Mitchell's bill would achieve universal coverage in stages. It would first try voluntary reforms to soak up the uninsured. But if by 2000 less than 95 percent of the population is covered, Congress would vote on a plan that is independently certified to achieve universal coverage. If Congress turns down such a plan, an employer mandate would automatically kick in. Employers hiring 25 or more workers would have to pay half the cost of insuring their workers; subsidies would be provided to workers at small companies to buy coverage. 
 The Mitchell bill would create a competitive market for private insurance by requiring states to set up voluntary purchasing cooperatives that would offer workers at most companies as well as the poor and unemployed a menu of private insurance plans. The bill would also open the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan to many otherwise uninsured people. It thereby guarantees everyone access to fee-for-service and managed-care plans.
The Mitchell bill is also noteworthy for what it does not include. Unlike the House bill, it builds in no inevitable slide toward government takeover of health insurance. Nor did Mr. Mitchell give in to powerful lobbyists for physicians by including provisions, as in the House bill, that would stagger most managed-care plans.
In these ways -- and by putting off an employer mandate for at least seven years and exempting very small companies -- he has taken much of the fear out of reform and accommodated the legitimate concerns of reform-minded critics. If conservative Democrats, like David Boren of Oklahoma and John Breaux of Louisiana, as well as moderate Republicans, like John Chafee of Rhode Island and John Danforth of Missouri, turn down Mr. Mitchell's proposal they will have unconscionably rejected the best chance of reform in 50 years.
There is one provision, however, that may give critics reason to reject the Mitchell plan. But it is remediable. Mr. Mitchell recognizes that the only way to get insurers and providers to control costs is to give consumers big incentives to choose low-cost health plans. Mr. Mitchell proposes a strange tax on health plans whose premiums are rising quickly -- no matter how low the premiums might be. Such a tax would lock in existing prices and amount to a backhanded form of price controls. The best way to make consumers, and therefore insurers, conscious of costs is to tax plans with high premiums.
Senator Mitchell has asked critics not to let the best be the enemy of the good. His plan is far from the best. But if the tax on fast-rising premiums is fixed, it would be good enough. Compared with other bills actively before Congress, Mr. Mitchell's bill should give Americans enormous hope as the House and Senate move to floor debate next week.

HEADLINE: THE WHITEWATER AFFAIR: THE OVERVIEW;
SENATORS ASSAIL TREASURY DEPUTY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Wednesday, Aug. 3

 BODY:
In high dudgeon, members of both parties on the Senate Banking Committee assailed Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger C. Altman on Tuesday and into the early hours today for having been untruthful, in their view, about the Whitewater case at a hearing last February.
In a session that went on until 2:08 A.M., the most contentious day of Whitewater hearings yet, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, accused Mr. Altman of being "at the very least disingenuous." 
 At issue were Mr. Altman's responses on four different occasions at a Feb. 24 hearing before the Banking Committee. Mr. Altman was asked then whether he or anyone on his staff had made contact with anyone at the White House about issues related to the Federal investigation into the collapse of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. Madison's owner, James B. McDougal, was a partner of Bill and Hillary Clinton in the Whitewater real estate venture.
Mr. Altman replied each time at the February hearing that he knew of only "one substantive contact," on Feb. 2, when he and members of his staff went to the White House to explain that the statute of limitations was about to expire on civil proceedings against Madison Guaranty.
Subsequently, Mr. Altman wrote the committee four times amending his testimony, but he never gave a full accounting of contacts that have been mentioned by others.
Other Administration officials have testified about several other contacts. The Treasury Department's inspector general counted 40.
Addressing the discrepancies, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said, "This is totally unbelievable." Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida, said the testimony of other witnesses "really calls into question how we can believe you."
And Senator Richard C. Shelby, Democrat of Alabama, who later called on Mr. Altman to resign, asked him, "Mr. Altman, do you think when someone asks you a straight question, you should give a straight answer?"
 
'I Do Not Have Perfect Recall'
 Mr. Altman insisted that he had told the truth, but no senator offered him a vigorous defense.
"Mr. Chairman," Mr. Altman said at one point this afternoon, "I do not have perfect recall, and I may have heard or understood questions in a way that was not intended by the senator asking the question. If I did so, I sincerely apologize to all members of the committee. But I do want to be clear. In no way did I intend to mislead or not to provide complete and forthright answers."
Answering Senator Shelby's question directly, Mr. Altman said he had a solid reputation for integrity and forthrightness.
The question of whether Mr. Altman told the truth at the hearing in February has gained special importance because of the limited scope of this phase of Congress's investigation into the Whitewater affair. The Senate has agreed that the only matters that can be examined at this point are the circumstances surrounding the death last year of Vincent W. Foster Jr., who was the deputy White House counsel, and the contacts between Treasury and White House officials on the Madison case.
The propriety of the Feb. 2 meeting at the White House is an open question. At the time, Mr. Altman was acting chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency that administers the nation's savings and loan bailout. In his testimony, he denied that this meeting amounted to interference with the R.T.C.'s Whitewater investigation, or to special treatment for the Clintons.
Some senators maintain that it was improper for a regulatory official to brief the White House about a case in which the Clintons had an interest. But the special Whitewater prosecutor, Robert B. Fiske Jr., has found that no crime was committed. And the independent Office of Government Ethics reported last weekend that while poor judgment may have occurred, no ethics rule was broken.
Other than that matter of propriety, hardly anything of controversy has arisen in the hearings that began last week and are expected to last at least through Friday. The civil and criminal cases against Madison are, by all accounts, proceeding apace.
 
Longtime Friend of President
 Mr. Altman, who is 48 years old, has known Mr. Clinton since they attended Georgetown University together in the 1960's. A successful investment banker, he worked as a fund-raiser and economic adviser in the 1992 Clinton campaign, and his nomination to the No. 2 post at the Treasury was one of the first announced by Mr. Clinton after the election. Last year he was instrumental in organizing the Administration's efforts to win Congressional approval of the budget and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Until this latest controversy developed, it was widely assumed that he would one day succeed Lloyd Bentsen as Treasury Secretary. Now his prospects for continuing in office, let alone rising there, have been called into doubt.
 
Aide's Testimony on Diary
 The questioning of Mr. Altman did not begin until nearly 5 P.M. Tuesday. In a show of solidarity, B. A. Bentsen, the wife of the Treasury Secretary, sat in the first row, next to Mr. Altman's wife, Jurate Kazickas.
Earlier, four other Treasury officials testified. No new ground was broken. Mainly, the senators heard Joshua L. Steiner, Mr. Bentsen's 28-year-old chief of staff, testify that he had exaggerated when he had written in his diary that Mr. Altman was under "intense pressure from the White House" over the Madison case, that a disaster was unfolding and that Mr. Altman had "gracefully ducked" questions at his Feb. 24 hearing.
"I wish that my diary was more accurate," Mr. Steiner told the committee.
Mr. Altman took issue with the testimony on Monday of Jean Hanson, the Treasury's general counsel, that he had instructed her to keep the White House informed of developments in the criminal investigation of Madison, an activity known as a referral. Ms. Hanson said she told the White House last fall about what she believed was an impending press report that the Clintons were named as potential witnesses.
"I do not believe that I suggested that the White House be informed on any facts relating to this referral," Mr. Altman said. "But if Ms. Hanson did advise the White House of an impending press leak on it, I see nothing improper in that."
 
Exchange With D'Amato
 Mr. Altman also disputed the notion that he should have withdrawn from the Madison case long before he did on Feb. 25. "In retrospect, I perhaps should have recused myself right off the bat," he said. But he quickly added, "I don't think that taking three weeks to make such a complex decision is all that surprising. But again, the important point is that I recused myself without ever having participated in any decisions on Madison."
As is often the case in Congressional inquiries, the senators seemed more interested in making points than in asking questions.
Senator D'Amato set the pattern in his questioning early on, when, speaking in his machine-gun style, he rattled off quotations from Mr. Steiner's diary about various contacts Mr. Altman and people on his staff had with the White House: a meeting Mr. Altman had with Margaret Williams, Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff; a meeting Mr. Bentsen had with George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to the President; a discussion with Harold M. Ickes, another top adviser.
"Was that not about Whitewater?" Mr. D'Amato asked.
Mr. Altman tried to explain why he testified in February that there had been only one substantative contact with the White House. "Senator," he said, "I used the word 'substantive'-- --"
Mr. D'Amato cut him off: "Listen, please don't tell me about 'substantive.' "
"May I respond?" Mr. Altman asked.
"No," Mr. D'Amato said. Then he had a second thought. "Well, I see the red light's on, but go ahead."
Mr. Altman said: "Senator D'Amato, I respectfully disagree, and I do so vehemently, with the premise of the question. I responded on Feb. 24 by saying that I had one substantive contact. Now that's the way I responded. And by that I meant relating to the R.T.C. investigation of Madison. None of the conversations that you just enumerated had anything to do with the R.T.C. investigation of Madison, and I used the word 'substantive' for that purpose."

HEADLINE: State and Developer Agree to Refurbish Times Square Storefronts

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY 

 BODY:
New York State and a principal developer in the long-delayed Times Square redevelopment project yesterday agreed to a stopgap plan for refurbishing dozens of storefronts while the developer waits for the real-estate market to improve.
The Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty, the development partnership, agreed to pay $20 million for renovating the storefronts and $2.6 million for decorative lighting and other street improvements. 
 By doing so, the partners maintained their stake in the redevelopment project, which has been on the drawing board for more than a decade. George Klein, a principal in Park Tower, said he hoped to start building the first of four towers in three to five years.
 
An Interim Step
 But in the short term the deal sets the stage for the transformation of the empty storefronts along Broadway, Seventh Avenue and the strip of 42d Street to the west, where the state hopes that new tenants will convert what seems like a ghost town into a vibrant entertainment and retail center.
The plan to refurbish the storefronts is essentially an interim step in what planners say will eventually be the Times Square that was envisioned in 1981, with four skyscrapers clustered around the intersection of Seventh Avenue and 42d Street, revitalized theaters nearby and a hotel and trade mart on Eighth Avenue.
The tower plan, called Times Square Center, was largely put on hold two years ago when the state allowed Prudential to delay construction until the real estate market improved.
"Because the office market was weak, we knew it would be hard to get on with the project we first envisioned," said Vincent Tese, chairman of the state Urban Development Corporation, the agency responsible for the redevelopment effort. "So we agreed to a delay of the office projects. But at the same time we did not want the street to be dark."
 
Financing Paradox
 Even so, by the time the office plan was put on hold in August 1992, the state had begun condemning tens of millions of dollars in commercial property and evicting longtime tenants.
The money for the condemnation -- more than $270 million -- came from the developers, creating the paradoxical situation in which Prudential and Park Tower are now about to pay $20 million to help replace the tenants they paid to remove.
"I guess we've come full circle on this," said Ray DioGuardi, vice president and chief executive of Nathan's Famous, the fast-food chain that was evicted from one of its locations in the spring of 1990. "They put us out, and now they have to look for tenants. What's the saying? What goes around comes around."
A vivid reminder of that circle could be seen yesterday. As state officials were completing their agreement with Prudential, workers were carrying video games out of the Playland arcade on Seventh Avenue, the latest casualty of the condemnation process.
 
A Turning Point?
 "It's a shame this place is closing," said Matthew Bridges, a 28-year-old office assistant and a Playland regular. "I've been coming here since I was 12 and old enough to take the trains alone. Kids are going to come here. Playland was a nonviolent atmosphere, better than going to peep shows."
State officials said yesterday that the interim plan, which still must be approved by the board of the Urban Development Corporation, is a turning point in the redevelopment of the neighborhood which has come to symbolize urban danger and degradation.
"This contract for the interim plan is significant because it represents forward movement," said Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, the state agency overseeing the development. "For the first time something will be happening. When stores start opening we will be able to push forward with the rest of the development. When a company like Prudential recommits, it has an impact beyond the pieces it will develop. This will help us with the rest of the development plan."
In leasing the storefronts, the state and the development team will be concentrating on entertainment and tourist-related businesses with late-hour operations, like music stores, bookstores and souvenir shops that will build upon the district's honky-tonk appeal.
 
Gaining Momentum
 Mr. Tese said the state had at least a dozen prospective retail and restaurant tenants for the vacant spaces, but he would not identify them. The new tenants would have to sign short-term leases that would allow the developers to move them out when the office towers are to be built.
Mr. Tese also called the interim plan a bridge for the long-range vision of Times Square. "For the average New Yorker and visitor, this interim plan is the important step. Times Square is primarily an entertainment district, and that is not going to change, even after the new office buildings go up."
Yesterday's contract was one more sign that the redevelopment of the area has gained momentum. Last week, the Walt Disney Company was among those submitting proposals for a new hotel at 42d Street and Eighth Avenue. If Disney is selected as the project's developer, it would be the entertainment company's second Times Square project; last year, Disney signed an agreement to renovate the New Amsterdam Theater on the largely barren strip of West 42d Street off Times Square.
 
Agreement on Signs
 The $20 million renovation costs will pay for cleaning and repair of spaces as well as for asbestos removal where needed. State officials expect the money to pay for the renovation of approximately 30 stores in 13 buildings. The contract also required that stores be leased within 24 months of final approval of the plan.
Earlier in the discussions the developers had balked at the state's requirements that Prudential erect huge signs as part of the interim plan to keep the glitzy flavor of Times Square. But in the end they agreed to include 50,000 square feet of retail and electric supersigns in the interim project.
As part of the agreement, the developers will pay the state an annual base rent of $3.3 million, which would increase with inflation. Rents on the interim leases will be paid to the developers.
Brian Murphy, senior vice president of the Prudential Realty Group, said yesterday that having new stores and attractions in the neighborhood would help sell office tenants on Times Square when new construction starts.
"This will give prospective tenants an immediate fix on what Times Square will look like," said Mr. Murphy, "and it will help create a momentum for our corner and for the rest of the development area."
In fact the plan comes at a time when the real estate market in Times Square is improving. When the developers and the state tentatively agreed to stop the clock on the office development and design an interim plan for the area, the office market was in the doldrums. Several new buildings, including a few in Times Square, stood empty or nearly so.
 
Moving In
 Since then office tenants like Morgan Stanley, the investment banking company; Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, a law firm that relocated from Park Avenue; Viacom, the entertainment parent of MTV and Paramount, and Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group have moved into the neighborhood.
As a result Mr. Klein said he expected to begin building the first of the towers within the next five years, rather than into the next decade as he and other officials predicted two years ago.
Despite yesterday's milestone, the overall redevelopment plan still has its critics. Last week the Municipal Arts Society, a longtime opponent of the project, denounced the state for the hefty tax abatements the developers will receive.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the Times Square redevelopment project characterized the stance of the Municipal Art Society incorrectly. Although the group has criticized some aspects of the project over the years, it is not a longtime opponent. It had supported the overall plan, but recently withdrew its support after the state relieved the developers of their obligation to start construction of four office towers according to a set timetable.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Olivetti Chief Tries for New Direction

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: IVREA, Italy

 BODY:
At business school, nobody told Corrado Passera it might someday get this difficult.
Two years ago, Mr. Passera was given the job of fixing Olivetti S.p.A., the office-equipment company that is Europe's second-largest computer maker after Siemens Nixdorf Infomationssysteme A.G. of Germany. Since 1990, Olivetti has not had a profit, and over the last three years it has lost a total exceeding $1 billion. But if all goes according to his plan, by the end of this year Mr. Passera, chief executive of Olivetti, will finally come close to break-even. 
 "It's been a painful and difficult process, but we've now succeeded in growing with fewer and fewer people," said Mr. Passera, who has overseen much of Olivetti's effort to cut 22,000 jobs since 1989, reducing the work force by 40 percent to a current level of 35,000.
 
Attempting a Sea Change
 The turnaround is by no means certain because Mr. Passera is attempting what amounts to a makeover of Olivetti. Mr. Passera means to recast Olivetti -- a company that last year derived the bulk of its $5 billion in annual sales from hardware -- as an information technology company that within a few years would derive one-third or even fully half its revenue from computer services and telecommunications.
Already, Olivetti has farmed out a lot of its computer manufacturing, including a deal with the Digital Equipment Corporation, freeing the company to concentrate more on designing, installing and maintaining computer networks for big corporate European customers like Barclays Bank P.L.C.
And in recent months, Olivetti has signed a string of deals with large American communications companies -- including the Bell Atlantic Corporation, Pacific Telesis and the General Motors Corporation's Hughes Network Systems unit -- to provide wireless communications services in Italy and elsewhere in Europe.
In expanding beyond computers, an industry bled in Europe by cutthroat price cutting and the region's long recession, Olivetti must contend with bigger competitors that were earlier to make such moves, including Siemens Nixdorf and the AT&T Corporation's NCR computer division.
Yet, some analysts give Mr. Passera at least even odds of succeeding in his strategy for Olivetti. "Don't underestimate their strong marketing skills," said Bill Coleman, an analyst at the brokerage house James Capel & Company in London. "That's where Olivetti's skill and positioning is -- in distribution, marketing, and the positioning of its service."
 
A Dynamic Duo
 Working in Mr. Passera's favor is the company's history and the strong advisory role still played by his mentor, Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti's president and principal shareholder. Mr. De Benedetti, an international investor with major holdings in Italy, France and Spain, took control of Olivetti in 1978 and transformed it from a sleepy manufacturer of mechanical typewriters into one of Europe's leaders in office automation.
Mr. De Benedetti, who is 59, remains "very much a part of strategic discussions," Mr. Passera said.
The slight and boyish Mr. Passera, who is 39, was the upstart business school graduate, with degrees from Milan's Bocconi University and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, when he came to Mr. De Benedetti's attention in the early 1980's. At the time, Mr. Passera was earning high marks as a banking and finance consultant for McKinsey & Company in Italy.
Mr. De Benedetti brought him aboard as his personal assistant at the Compagnie Industriali Riunite holding group, with financial interests in electronics, retailing and other fields. There, Mr. Passera developed a reputation as a no-nonsense executive with an eye for detail -- just what Mr. De Benedetti decided was needed when he handed Mr. Passera the mess at Olivetti in 1992.
 
Good 'Underlying Factors'
 Although Olivetti reports its financial results in the Italian currency, the lira, when the data are converted to dollars at the Dec. 31 exchange rate for each year, the numbers tell the following story:
After eking out a profit of $53 million on sales of $8 billion in 1990, the company saw sales decline for two consecutive years, leading to losses of $403 million in 1991 and $440 million in 1992. Last year, the first full 12 months on Mr. Passera's watch, sales edged back up to $5 billion and the loss was reduced to $271 million.
Investors have given Mr. Passera high marks, and Olivetti remains one of Italy's most widely held stocks. But the share price, which was at a 52-week high of 3,080 lire, or about $1.95, in April has lately been trading in the 2,400 range. Some brokerage firms, like Kleinwort-Benson in London, have Olivetti shares on their "take profit" list.
"The underlying factors are good," said Fiona Marshall, a Kleinwort analyst who follows Olivetti. But she added that Olivetti has been promising a return to break-even for several years now, and investors may not want to wait to see if Mr. Passera's prediction this year is borne out.
The mainstay of Olivetti's strategy is a network of alliances, most with the common goal of putting Olivetti more squarely in the world of telecommunications. Indeed, the move reflects the latest fashion in Europe's computer industry, where companies are following the American example of helping their computer customers set up local or long-distance networks capable of sending voice, data or images.
Olivetti was actually one of the first to sniff the wind. In 1984, the company sold a 22 percent stake in its business to the AT&T Corporation for $260 million. But the deal came "too early," according to Bruno Lamborghini, Olivetti's senior vice president for corporate strategy.
The relationship soured in the late 1980's when AT&T proposed acquiring all of Olivetti and Mr. De Benedetti turned down the offer. In 1989, AT&T swapped its holdings in Olivetti for a $492 million stake in Compagnie Industriali Riunite, Mr. De Benedetti's holding company. Since then, AT&T has been selling off its Industriali Riunite position little by little.
Under Mr. Passera, Olivetti turned to another big partner, the Digital Equipment Corporation, which acquired 10 percent of the Italian company in 1992 for about $300 million. Although the deal gave Olivetti access to Digital's technically advanced Alpha microchip technology, so far Digital has sold far fewer Alpha-based computers through Olivetti than expected.
More recently, Olivetti has formed a joint venture with the Redgate Communication Corporation of Vero Beach, Fla., to develop an electronic catalogue that later this year is to enable shoppers in France to use home computers to obtain information in text, pictures and audio form about computer products offered for sale by various companies.
In another recently formed venture, with Docunet, a California-based company, Olivetti intends to develop touch-screen vending machines for theaters, airports and travel agencies in the United States for selling tickets.
But the real drive into telecommunications involves deals with big American communications companies. Olivetti is the lead partner in a group that includes Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis, which was authorized by the Italian Government in April to build Italy's second cellular telephone network. The network would compete directly with the cellular network operated by Italy's state-owned telephone company, Stet.
Olivetti's digital cellular network, which will transmit voice and data in the binary pulses of computer code, is to begin service next year. Mr. Lamborghini says it will not only offer crystal-clear conversations through wireless phones but will also enable users of laptop computers to transmit large amounts of data virtually anywhere reachable by conventional land-line telephones.
In June, Olivetti struck a deal with Hughes Network Systems to offer satellite communication systems in Europe using the small dish antennas that enable large corporations to distribute information among their big offices.
Telecommunications in Europe, as deregulation strides forward, is a fast-growing business. But the frenzy of arrangements Olivetti has entered only serves to underscore the need to play catch-up in a quickly moving new business. Michael Grant, a telecommunications consultant in Cambridge, England, said that Olivetti was coming late to the field.
"I'd be surprised if they made a success of it," Mr. Grant said. "There are a great number of players well down the route."
 
Going Up Against Giants
 Indeed, Olivetti is taking on some giants, as other European companies have also forged their own alliances with American carriers.
AT&T has teamed with Unisource, a joint venture of the national phone operators in Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands. The MCI Communications Corporation recently received United States Justice Department approval to sell a 20 percent stake to BT (formerly British Telecom). And earlier this year, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom of Germany and France Telecom agreed to jointly spend $4.2 billion to acquire 20 percent of the Sprint Corporation.
All the more reason, Mr. Passera said, for Olivetti to continue its own search for partnerships.
"The times when a company could be engaged in everything from semiconductors to hardware to software are finished," Mr. Passera said. "There's a continuing need for alliances."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Again, American General Goes After Unitrin

BYLINE: By KATHRYN JONES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Aug. 2

 BODY:
The American General Corporation, one of the nation's largest providers of retirement annuities, consumer loans and life insurance, said today that it was offering $2.6 billion in cash to acquire Unitrin Inc., a financial services holding company.
Unitrin said in a statement that its board had determined that a sale was not in the company's interest. Unitrin executives did not return telephone calls today seeking further comment. 
 Last week, the board rejected a merger offer made by American General, which is based in Houston.
When American General made the merger proposal on July 12, it offered $50.375 in cash for each of Unitrin's 51.8 million outstanding shares. That represented a 30 percent premium over the $38.75 closing price of Unitrin shares on July 11.
Today's announcement -- which made the previous offer public and set a deadline for the present offer -- was made after the stock market closed. Earlier, American General's shares fell 75 cents to close at $28.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. Unitrin shares fell $1.50 to close at $39.75 n Nasdaq trading.
American General proposed the purchase in a letter that was faxed to Richard C. Vie, Unitrin's chief executive and president, at the company's headquarters in Chicago. American General said the offer would be open through Sept. 16.
 
More Money May Be Offered
 Harold S. Hook, American General's chairman and chief executive, said in a telephone interview that he had not received a response from Unitrin. But he indicated that the company would pursue the offer and would be willing to consider a higher price if Unitrin could demonstrate additional value during negotiations.
"At this stage, we are very hopeful that the shareholders will make their wishes known to the Unitrin board and we'll get a chance to put this together," Mr. Hook said.
American General also said it would be willing to consider other ways of structuring the transaction, including a tax-free exchange of American General stock to Unitrin shareholders.
Mr. Hook said American General was willing to pay a premium for Unitrin because the companies believed the combination would be a "good strategic fit" and position the company to be an even stronger player as the insurance industry consolidated.
The companies together would have more than eight million households as customers and combined assets of $50 billion and revenues of $6 billion, American General said. The company said the transaction would add to its earnings per share in the second year after its completion.
Unitrin's major lines of business are life and health insurance, property and casualty insurance and consumer finance.
"We're in a lot of common markets and seeing a similar clientele and in a similar way," Mr. Hook said. "In line with the economies of scale and competitive nature of business today, it's just a natural progression."
American General has estimated that Unitrin is overcapitalized by about $1.4 billion. Analysts have characterized Unitrin as conservatively managed, while American General is considered more aggressive.
In a recent report, analysts at Conning & Company in Hartford noted that Unitrin was overcapitalized by $1.1 billion, with the excess capital invested mainly in Treasury securities. The analysts said that Unitrin shares have traded below book value recently because of "lackluster" earnings and the absence of a "catalyst" to release shareholder value.
Unitrin earned $28.3 million in the second quarter, compared with $36.9 million a year earlier. Total revenues rose slightly to $340.8 million from $337.7 million a year earlier.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: AT THE WHITE HOUSE;
CLINTON PRESSURES G.O.P. LAWMAKERS ON HEALTH CARE

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Asserting that Congress has a "historic opportunity" this year to enact universal health care legislation after six decades of failure, President Clinton accused Republican lawmakers tonight of abandoning their earlier support for guaranteed benefits and said the responsibility for finding a workable formula "now should shift to them."
But in the third prime-time news conference of his term, Mr. Clinton was also forced to answer accusations that he had abandoned his stated goal of insuring every American by endorsing the version of insurance legislation unveiled on Tuesday by the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine. 
 That bill would guarantee insurance by the year 2000 to at least 95 percent of the population, up from 85 percent now. Mr. Clinton has repeatedly pledged a veto of any bill that does not cover the entire population within a reasonable time, but he said Mr. Mitchell's bill met that goal.
"Senator Mitchell is convinced that it is the most ambitious bill he can pass, but that it meets the requirement" of eventually covering all Americans, the President said. "If it is deficit-neutral, and if it is passed in the way that it is, I think we will achieve full coverage."
Speaking shortly after Mr. Clinton accused his opponents of being unbending on health care, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, asserted that it was the President who may need to compromise. "He says he's got to have everything," Mr. Dole said. "It may mean we'll do nothing. Why don't we take care of the 20 or 30 provisions that Democrats and Republicans agree on?"
Mr. Clinton's remarks tonight underscored the political contradictions the President faced as the major initiative of his term moved toward an uncertain fate on the House and Senate floors.
The Mitchell bill would employ regulatory changes and subsidies for the working poor to reach at least 95 percent coverage. Should the country fall short of that goal, the bill would require employers to pay half the cost of a basic package of benefits for their workers.
But once the 95 percent goal is reached, the legislation offers no mechanism -- other than nonbinding recommendations by a Government board -- to extend insurance benefits to the remaining 5 percent that Mr. Clinton has promised to cover.
Only last month, at a National Governors' Association meeting in Boston, Mr. Clinton hinted he might accept 95 percent or 96 percent coverage of the population in an insurance bill. But a furious protest from his strongest backers in the Democratic Party and the labor movement led the White House to insist within hours that Mr. Clinton was misunderstood, and was truly intent on supporting benefits for each and every American.
Mr. Clinton repeated that pledge tonight, calling universal coverage "the one criteria I have set out" for health care legislation and "the one rock-solid principle" to which he adheres.
At the White House earlier today, the head of Mr. Clinton's economic council, Robert E. Rubin, said that Mr. Clinton was "where he's always been" on universal coverage and that Mr. Mitchell's bill was "a practical guarantee" of reaching that goal.
But he would not assert that it guaranteed coverage for everyone in fact, saying instead that it created "momentum," established a "structure" and set up a "mechanism" to get to that goal.
"What Mitchell is saying, what the bill says, is that he is putting in place forces which he believes will be on a trajectory toward universal coverage," Mr. Rubin said.
For his part, Mr. Clinton argued tonight that the real obstruction to universal coverage was the Republican Party, not the White House.
At one time, he said, two dozen Republican senators were sponsors of a bill to give universal coverage to all Americans. "They have all abandoned that bill," he said. "The questions now should shift to them: Are we going to cover all Americans or not?"
But Mr. Dole complained that the bills the Democrats had offered were unacceptable. The Mitchell proposal, he said, called for "a sort of government-run health care system" that relied too much on taxes.
 
Sliding Polls
 The President's appearance before reporters tonight was an unusually wide-ranging one, in part by White House design. With Mr. Clinton's standing in opinion polls in a summerlong slide, his advisers have sought a way to remind the public of the White House's successes and of what they say is his commitment to help the average American.
The President did all that tonight, recalling for viewers that under his tenure the annual budget deficit had fallen, taxes had fallen for the poor and risen for the rich, four million new jobs had been created and a trade pact approved that had substantially increased exports to Mexico.
He also made a bid to salve chafed relations with the national press, declaring that he enjoyed long news conferences, even though they have been rare events so far, and that he had already planned to hold more of them than the one per six months that he has staged so far.
But the health bills were the dominant issue. For Mr. Clinton, the passage of health care legislation has assumed a political importance that equals and maybe exceeds its gravity as a social issue. A failure to pass and sign a bill could be devastating to Democrats seeking re-election to Congress, where the President's working majority is already shaky.
It could be even more damaging to Mr. Clinton, who has embarked on an effort to show mainstream voters that he can deliver on a promise. Health care legislation is so monumental a promise, and he has campaigned on it for so long, that its success or failure has come to represent his second year in office, if not his entire term.
But Mr. Clinton began his press conference by saying he "felt good" about the progress his Administration was making, particularly on health care. For the first time, he said, health care measures are before both houses of Congress. He urged Americans to tell their representatives and senators that that they had "a historic opportunity" to pass health care legislation.
The President said he expected a close vote but noted that the legislation he originally proposed has been changed, "much of it for the better." The House and Senate measures would provide more support for small businesses, more time to institute changes and less bureaucracy.
Seeking to sharpen the differences between Republicans and Democrats, he said it was now time for the opposition party to better define its own approach. "Are we going to cover all Americans, or not?" he said. "If you don't like our approaches, in the Senate and the House, what is your alternative?"
The issues are complex, he said, but the important thing is "to keep our eye on the central reality, which is, 'How do we solve the problem?' "
Mr. Clinton emphasized that his health care plan would encourage more Americans to seek preventive health care. Better prenatal care is particularly important, he said.
Playing down business opposition to the bills, Mr. Clinton said the more noteworthy developments were that many businesses had come out for universal coverage and even a requirement that employers help finance their workers' insurance.
"We have more business interests for it than ever before," he said.
Mr. Clinton said many Fortune 500 companies agreed that employers should be required to provide coverage to employees, and he said that 600,000 small businesses endorsed that view.
The President said that "universal coverage is popular with the American people." The bills devised by the the Democratic leaders of Congress may offend "organized interest groups," but both bills "have answered the concerns of American voters in every Congressional district," Mr. Clinton said.
 
What People Want
 Some of Mr. Clinton's remarks tonight echoed those he made at a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House earlier today to welcome the health legislation supporters who rode on bus caravans. His comments unfolded in a deeper-than-usual drawl that fit his theme: that his White House is really "the home office of the American Association of Ordinary Citizens," as he put it, and that enacting a system of national health insurance is no harder than just doing what the people want.
"When you've got something everybody wants to do but is not easy to do, the people that hired on have to make the decisions," he said. "And the members of the United States Congress hired on, just like I did.
"We didn't say, 'Vote for me, in a representative form of government, and I will make all the necessary decisions to solve the problems of the country except those that are difficult, controversial and make people mad.' That was not the deal."

HEADLINE: Federal Panel Proposes Register To Curb Hiring of Illegal Aliens

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
A Federal advisory commission proposed today that the Government establish a computerized register of the names and Social Security numbers of all citizens and aliens authorized to work in the United States, so that employers could check the immigration status of job applicants.
In a unanimous recommendation, the nine-member advisory panel, the Commission on Immigration Reform, which is headed by Barbara Jordan, the former Democratic Congresswoman from Texas, said the measures were needed to curb the hiring of illegal aliens. 
 The proposal intensifies a long-running debate over immigration policy, a politically explosive issue in states like California and Florida, where there are many illegal immigrants. The American Civil Liberties Union, Hispanic organizations, Chinese-American groups, Jewish groups and immigration lawyers immediately expressed concern over the proposed register, saying its use could increase job discrimination against members of racial and ethnic minorities and lead to the creation of a national identity card.
Despite these objections, some senators from both parties expressed support for the commission's recommendation at a hearing of the Judiciary Committee today. They said it was a long-overdue step to discourage illegal immigration.
Doris M. Meissner, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, also welcomed the proposal, saying a register was consistent with Clinton Administration efforts to establish a single file of all foreigners authorized to work in this country.
The United States has never had a central register or roll of all its people, though, for tax and retirement purposes, Social Security numbers have been issued to millions of citizens and to many aliens who work or invest in this country. The Immigration and Naturalization Service tries to keep records of foreigners permitted to work in this country, but agency officials acknowledge that the records are full of errors.
The commission said the register could be established under current law, with no further action by Congress. It said the the new computer file should have safeguards to prevent the use of the data for any purpose other than to verify a person's eligibility to work. The commission said it would provide details of the system at another time.
The proposed register would include data provided by the immigration service and the Social Security Administration. Employers would have to check the register before hiring people. The commission said people would not be required to carry national identification cards.
But Lucas Guttentag, director of the immigrants' rights project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said: "This is an overheated response to an overstated problem. Politicians are stoking anti-immigrant feeling, blaming immigrants for social and economic problems not properly attributable to immigration. As a practical matter, a computer register does not work without a national identity card in one form or another."
Ms. Jordan, who was appointed by President Clinton, said he should take immediate action to form a national register and test it in the five states with the highest levels of immigration: California, New York, Texas, Florida and Illinois. Those states have a combined population of more than 90 million, accounting for at least 35 percent of the nation's total.
The commission suggested that the five states test different methods, perhaps using the register in combination with more secure versions of existing documents, like Social Security cards and drivers' licenses.
Noting her record as a champion of civil rights, Ms. Jordan said she would never support a proposal that increased discrimination or invaded privacy. She asserted that the new system "would reduce the potential for discrimination" that exists under current arrangements.
 
'Greater Scrutiny'
 "Employers would no longer have any reason to ask if a worker is a citizen or an immigrant," she said. "The only relevant question is, 'What is your Social Security number?' "
Nevertheless, Vibiana Andrade, a spokeswoman for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, expressed a concern of many critics when she said she feared that "citizens and those immigrants who look or sound foreign will either be subjected to greater scrutiny or be denied employment."
Denyse Sabagh, a vice president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said, "A national registry system, even as a pilot project, is a ludicrous and unreasonable way to solve an immigration issue."
The National Council of La Raza, an Hispanic-advocacy organization, and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund expressed similar objections. Members of the commission may call it a register or a verification system, said the president of the council, Raul Yzaguirre, but "they are still talking about a national I.D. card."
 
Appearance of Authenticity
 Today's proposal continues a long-running debate over immigration and civil liberties. A 1986 law prohibits the employment of illegal aliens and requires employers to ask all job applicants for documents to verify that they are either citizens or aliens authorized to work in this country. The law lists various documents, like passports and birth certificates, that may be used for this purpose, either by themselves or in specific combinations.
The employer does not have to check the authenticity of the documents, but may accept any document that "reasonably appears on its face to be genuine." Employers may not demand a specific document like an alien's "green card."
Yet in 1990, the General Accounting Office said the law had produced a "widespread pattern of discrimination" against people with what some employers took to be foreign appearances or accents. The Justice Department has successfully sought civil fines from many employers accused of discriminating by, for example, demanding specific documents, like a green card, from some applicants.
Social Security numbers are routinely issued to children a few months after they are born. A parent wishing to claim a child as a dependent must enter the child's Social Security number on the parent's Federal income tax return if the child is over age 1.
 
Calls to Crack Down
 People may apply for the nine-digit numbers at local Social Security offices. An applicant must provide evidence of age, identity and United States citizenship or immigration status. A parent applying for a young child must provide the child's birth certificate and some document to identify the parent.
Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee's immigration subcommittee, said he supported the commission's proposal and noted there had been calls from many quarters for a crackdown on illegal immigration. Mr. Simpson predicted that senators would "stick an immigration bill of major import" onto some legislation this year if the committee did not write its own.
Besides Ms. Jordan, the members of the immigration reform commission are Richard Estrada, an associate editor of the editorial page of The Dallas Morning News; Harold Ezell, former Western regional commissioner of the immigration service; Lawrence H. Fuchs, a professor at Brandeis University; Robert Charles Hill, a lawyer in Washington; Warren R. Leiden, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association; Nelson Merced, a former state legislator in Massachusetts; Bruce A. Morrison, a former Congressman from Connecticut, and Michael S. Teitelbaum of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in New York.

HEADLINE: State Queries Some Renters About Income

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
Occupants of 1,900 rent-regulated apartments in New York City began getting notices from a state agency this week asking them for information about their income that could lead to the removal of their apartments from rent regulation.
The agency, the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, has already removed 186 apartments from rent regulations, all of them in Manhattan. The orders, and the notices that are being issued this week, result from a law passed last year by the state removing from regulation apartments renting for more than $2,000 a month to people whose income exceeded $250,000 a year for two years in a row. 
 The 186 apartments were deregulated because their occupants acknowledged in forms sent to them by building owners that their incomes are above $250,000. The apartments are in 127 buildings, all in Manhattan.
As the next step, owners asked the state to verify the income of 1,900 tenants who failed to return the owners' forms or who said they had incomes below the threshold.
 
Compare With Tax Returns
 Donald M. Halperin, Commissioner of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, said tenants who have received the income-verification forms are obligated to fill them out and return them. The forms will be compared with state tax returns.
Because the income threshold is so high, only a handful of the city's one million rent-regulated apartments are affected. Tenant organizations have said they fear that the income-verification procedure may eventually be expanded to remove more apartments from rent regulation.
The high-rent, high-income decontrol law, along with other rent legislation affecting New York City, comes up for renewal in 1997.
Tenants have 60 days to return the 10-page income-verification form. But they do not have to supply their Social Security numbers, only their addresses.
Commissioner Halperin predicted that in a "significant" number of cases the Division of Taxation and Finance would be unable to match a tenant's name with a 1993 state tax return. Without a match, the agency will deny the owner's request for a decontrol order.

HEADLINE: From Consensus to Doubt

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Top Federal Reserve officials are in a quandary: despite what other analysts see as signs of slowing growth, they sense early signs of rising inflation and strong business confidence that could lead to an overheated economy.
But they have doubts about their judgment, and worry that if they are wrong, raising interest rates to stop inflation could halt the nation's economic expansion prematurely. 
 Because Fed officials want more information to form a better judgment, no interest rate increase appears likely before the Aug. 16 meeting of the interest-rate policy committee, and possibly not until the Sept. 27 meeting. The timing will depend heavily on what Fed officials learn about the economy from the July employment data to be released Friday and the retail sales figures that come out next week.
Five members of the central bank's interest-rate policy committee said in separate interviews this week that unlike many Wall Street analysts, they did not see the huge increase in business inventories during the second quarter as a signal of economic weakness in the months ahead.
They dismiss the notion that retailers were caught by surprise by a sharp drop in consumer spending that left store shelves crowded with goods. Instead, they believe that the increase in inventories actually reflects a calculation by business executives that consumers will soon resume shopping in force.
"Inventories had gotten awfully low relative to sales, so my suspicion is a good deal of it was planned," said Susan M. Phillips, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board.
Price increases for industrial supplies like steel, brick and glass, along with strong business confidence, are also making Federal Reserve officials nervous. If they delay too long in raising short-term interest rates for the fifth time since February, they may allow inflation to rise again later this year or early next.
But what if the business community made the wrong bet on the consumer? If consumer spending does not recover quickly, a decision to raise interest rates would only aggravate the resulting slowdown in the economy.
So Federal Reserve officials are eagerly waiting for guidance from the employment and retail data for July. Ms. Phillips said she was interested in the July employment report because consumers were likely to spend more money again if more of them were employed, particularly in well-paying jobs. Further job gains could also be a sign that output is growing so rapidly that inflationary production bottlenecks may develop.
But while a rough consensus seems to exist on the interest-rate policy committee in favor of playing down the importance of rising inventories, officials expressed much less confidence in interpreting the sharp slowdown in consumer spending during the second quarter and guessing whether it would continue.
For instance, John P. LaWare, another governor of the Federal Reserve Board, said he was particularly puzzled by weak retail sales of goods other than cars. "I'm not sure I understand it," he said on Tuesday, adding that he was waiting to see the volume of back-to-school sales.
 
 
Stark Contrast
 The doubt at the Fed now is in stark contrast to the consensus reached ahead of the first four rate increases this year, which have raised the Fed's target for short-term interest rates to 4.25 percent from 3 percent. Officials then broadly agreed that low interest rates were actively stimulating an already healthy economy, and that this stimulus should be removed before it began to feed inflation.
Several of the Federal Reserve officials said the rise in inventories, which accounted for more than half the nation's economic growth during the second quarter, was important because it signaled economic strength for reasons other then business confidence.
An unusually large portion of the increase in inventories consisted of imported goods, notably clothing, they said. Even though imports account for only a tenth of all goods and services sold, they may have been a quarter of the increase in inventories, said one senior official who insisted on anonymity.
If retailers and wholesale distributors decide that their shelves are overstuffed with unsold imports and cut back their orders to foreign factories, this will have little effect on economic growth in the United States, the official said.
 
 
Price Increases
 Several officials said that business executives also planned the increase in inventories to beat price increases by their suppliers, or because of nervousness that low inventories might leave them with nothing to sell if consumer spending surged again the way it did last winter.
In its monthly report on the economy's health, released today, the Federal Reserve mentioned that retail spending seemed to strengthen in the last few weeks, and that among retailers, "there also appears to be a growing enthusiasm over the coming back-to-school season."
The report adopted an unusually gloomy tone about the extent of price increases around the country, but was written mainly by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, where officials have been especially concerned about the risks of future inflation. The 12 regional banks take turns putting together the report.
Mr. LaWare expressed little concern about the recent slowing in sales of cars and new homes, including a 14.1 percent drop in new home sales during June.
While some private economists have pointed to these slower sales as a sign that higher interest rates are already beginning to crimp markets for goods that many Americans buy with loans, Mr. LaWare said that he expected both industries to prosper.
"I'm not worried about it at this time, when there's still a lot of pent-up demand," he said. "I don't think they're about to tank.
A lingering concern of all the Federal Reserve officials interviewed is that the American economy is operating at or near full capacity. "We're there, or close enough for Government work," said the the Fed official who insisted on anonymity. "That doesn't mean you're there in all markets, but it does mean you are in enough markets that it will begin to feed into price pressures."

HEADLINE: Bosnian Serbs Again Reject Peace Plan

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PALE, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Defying Western mediators and their patrons in Serbia, leaders of Bosnia's Serbian nationalists denounced an international peace plan again today and voted unanimously to put the issue to a referendum.
The Bosnian Serbs' parliament had rejected the plan twice before, and took it up for a third time only under heavy pressure from Serbia and Russia, a traditional ally of the Serbs. Their decision to put it to a referendum, scheduled for Aug. 27 and 28, had already been dismissed by leaders in Serbia as a stalling tactic. 
 The Bosnian Serb leadership said the plan was an attempt to get Serbs "to sign their own death warrant."
"Acceptance of such a thing would represent a masochistic crime at which the devil would laugh," they said in a statement issued by the Bosnian Serb press agency.
 
Plan Would Cut Serbian Gains
 Proposed by the United States, Russia, Germany, France and Britain, the plan requires the Serbs to give up about one-third of the territory they have taken in Bosnia, leaving them 49 percent of the country.
The remainder would go to the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government, in federation with Bosnian Croats, which have accepted the plan.
Rejecting the peace plan could put the Bosnian Serbs on a collision course with Serbia, which on Tuesday threatened to cut off all aid to its cousins in Bosnia. Aid from Serbia has been vital in helping the Bosnian Serbs to keep the upper hand the conflict.
Although the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, is widely blamed for inciting the war in his quest for a greater Serbia, he appears to have had enough. United Nations economic sanctions have damaged Serbia and Montenegro, the only republics left in Yugoslavia.
The peace plan's sponsors have asked the United Nations Security Council to expand the sanctions if it isn't accepted.
"We have to accept that the Serbia Government does not support us anymore," the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, said in his opening address to the assembly session today.
He said Bosnian Serbs could be forced to "introduce a state of war, rationing, full mobilization."
The Bosnian Government's military commander, Gen. Rasim Delic, said he doubted if anyone could enforce a peace plan even if the Serbs accepted it.
"We are carving out our own destiny, and they are carving out their own," he said.
 
Advances by Muslims
 United Nations officials reported a surge in fighting in central and northern Bosnia and the highest level of cease-fire violations in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, since spring.
United Nations officials said they had received unconfirmed reports that units of mostly Muslim Bosnian Army had advanced against the Serbs south and east of Vares.
Fires were burning in the villages of Zizci and Brgule, which had been in Serbian hands, said Maj. Rob Annink, spokesman for the United Nations military force here. Fighting was also reported for a second day running just outside the nearby towns of Breza and Visoko.
United Nations officials were at a loss to explain the upward spiral in armed clashes across Bosnia over the last week, but speculated that the fighting in central Bosnia was part of a Government operation to secure a main north-south road between the towns of Olovo and Sarajevo, most of which is under Serbian control.
Major Annink also reported some of the heaviest fighting since March in the north and northeast. The Serbs apparently retaliated by shelling Government-held towns. Several civilians were reported wounded by shelling in Tuzla, 50 miles northeast of Sarajevo.
United Nations monitors reported more than 700 cease-fire violations on Tuesday in Sarajevo, the highest one-day tally since a local truce took effect in February. Sniper fire today near the Holiday Inn drew return fire from French peacekeepers.

The young American assistant naval attache was expelled from Stalin's Moscow on charges of espionage; the 21-year-old Russian medical student was thrown into prison for four months of interrogation, then sentenced to eight years in the Gulag for her contact with him.
Nearly 50 years later, after life marked them both and the Soviet Union that punished them had itself died, she found him again through intermediaries. He invited her to visit him in America, taking responsibility for her tickets and expenses. But the American Embassy rejected her request for a visa, assuming her interest, at 68, was only to emigrate. 
 On the usual photocopied form, without date or signature, the Consular Section simply checked a box saying: "You have not shown that you have sufficiently strong family, social or economic ties to your place of residence to insure that your projected stay in the United States will be temporary."
 
Attracted to Freedom
 But Galina M. Spiridonova, hardened by the camps, decided to keep pushing. She knew too much about the arbitrariness of governments, and she felt her story was compelling.
It started in 1948. "It was a dangerous time," remembered Ms. Spiridonova. "I knew the risks of meeting Americans." The naval officer, Robert H. Dreher, "was a very handsome man, you can't deny it," she said, but "that wasn't the most important thing that attracted me to him -- more important, he was the free representative of a free country."
After her release from the camps, Ms. Spiridonova worked as a music teacher. Tough, brassy and funny, her voice raspy with too many cigarettes in a difficult life, she still works part-time as a cleaner in a medical laboratory to supplement her $55-a-month pension. A proud person, she stresses that she does lab work too, like sterilizing equipment and distilling water.
Moved by his own contacts with ordinary Soviet citizens and convinced popular support for the regime was uncertain, Mr. Dreher joined the new Central Intelligence Agency and helped found Radio Liberty, which beamed news and American themes into the Soviet Union. Now 78, he spent his career with the agency, including more than three years in Vietnam, and chooses to be vague about his duties. But in the postwar Soviet Union, he says, he was not a spy.
As a Navy lieutenant, he came to Odessa in 1946 to clear the port, stuffed with American ships full of United Nations aid for the Soviet Union, which was devastated by the war. He was among the few foreigners allowed to be in Odessa and was even allowed to get a Soviet driver's license. He explored relatively freely, picking up hitchhikers and making friends, though remembers being followed constantly, with those he let off again usually interrogated by the secret police.
After his expulsion, he discovered that a student from Odessa, whom he had met more than once or twice, had also been arrested and spent five years in Stalin's prison camps, finally immigrating and settling in America. "After he told me that," Mr. Dreher said, "I then wondered whatever happened to Galya." He paused, then said, "What happened to her was as bad as I imagined."
Ms. Spiridonova was just one of a long series of friends and encounters, he remembers, though they saw a lot of each other. He went with her to the medical institute where she was studying to become a doctor. "We had lunch and a tour, and I remember they were cutting up cadavers," Mr. Dreher said. "I wondered then if she knew this was very risky and told her that. After the ax fell, I was really quite concerned." After being told of his expulsion, he telephoned her to warn her she might be in trouble.
 
An Actor in Kazakhstan
 "When I first met Galina," he remembers, "she was with two other friends and seemed a rather patriotic Soviet citizen. And when she learned I had an engineering degree, she said: 'Oh, wonderful! Come and join us! We need engineers.' But when I said no, we discussed why, and when I talked of freedom and so on, I think it set her down a certain track."
In the camps, in faroff Kazakhstan, Ms. Spiridonova met an actor, Igor M. Orlov. They married and had a son, now 42. Mr. Orlov, freed in a general amnesty in 1956, died in 1974.
But Ms. Spiridonova felt her life had been changed forever by her contact with Mr. Dreher, and 46 years later, she tried to find him, finally getting help from the wife of a former British Ambassador to Moscow, who contacted the American Embassy in London.
A bachelor, Mr. Dreher lives in Arlington, Va. They exchanged letters; he invited her to visit him. After the United States Embassy in Moscow rejected her visa request, Ms. Spiridonova was in tears.
"They didn't say anything," she cried. "They didn't ask much. They just gave me this paper," which she threw on the floor.
On the telephone from Virginia, Mr. Dreher was furious.
"This is ridiculous and absurd," he said. "She's lived all her life in Moscow and has very good friends. She has a son there and all her ties. When you contrast the porousness of our borders to illegal immigration and the exclusivity being shown here, it incenses me." Then he said: "I'm doing this out of a sense of justice. I'm sure it will work out. It's got to, it's right."
Asked for comment on the refusal, embassy officials said it seemed that an inexperienced consular officer had interviewed Ms. Spiridonova. The Consul General, Nancy H. Sambaiew, reviewed the file and decided to reinterview Ms. Spiridonova herself.
"She was so polite, so sympathetic," Ms. Spiridonova said afterward about Mrs. Sambaiew. "She heard the whole story, she even shed a tear." She also issued her a visa.
Mr. Dreher and Ms. Spiridonova are planning an autumn reunion. But Mr. Dreher takes pains to say: "I'm an elderly retired bachelor, and I'm not interested in Galina as a woman, but as a person who suffered a great deal. I want to do what I can to make amends and bring some happiness to what's left of her life."
 
'Angry at the Regime'
 Ms. Spiridonova is amused by his caution. "On the telephone once, I asked him if he had a piano at home," she said. "There was a long pause." She cackled. "He probably thought I wanted to stay forever! Obviously he got scared. So I wrote him a sharp letter saying, 'I'm not going to turn your life upside down.' " She laughed again. "He's 78! He shouldn't be afraid."
Mr. Dreher said he feels some complicity for what happened, but little guilt. "Frankly, I was so angry at the regime, I found it difficult to assume any sense of responsibility myself for what happened," he said. "She took the initiative, asking me more about this or that. Whether she was a trap or not I had no problem extolling freedom."
Ms. Spiridonova is philosophical. "It wasn't his fault and I blame him for nothing. He promised nothing. But, oh, he was so interesting. So instead of kisses I asked him questions about the Christian Democratic Party in Italy. And I told him one of my friends had already been arrested, and then a second one, and I was prepared. I had a piece of soap and sugar and bread if they arrested me. And I think if it wasn't for Dreher, I would have been arrested anyway, for political reasons." So was it politics or love?
"You know," she said finally, "as a musician I was very impulsive. And my impression was that he was very handsome. But had he been a handsome Communist, there would have been nothing between us."

Transcript of Clinton's News Conference at the White House

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Following is the transcript of President Clinton's news conference, held tonight in the East Room of the White House, as recorded by The New York Times:
PRESIDENT CLINTON Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. 
 Tonight I want to speak with you about crime, health care and the progress of our national economic strategy. As I have said so many times, the central mission of this Administration, renewing the American dream, requires us to restore economic growth, rebuild American communities, empower individual citizens to take personal responsibility for their own futures and make Government work for ordinary citizens again.
We are making progress.
Remember, we are about now a year from the time when Congress passed out economic recovery plan. I remember, then, that our opponents said if that plan passed, the sky would fall, unemployment would go up, the deficit would explode.
Well, they were wrong.
Look at the facts: We cut $255 billion in spending, raised tax rates on only 1.2 percent of the wealthiest Americans, cut taxes for 15 million working families of modest incomes, made 90 percent of our small businesses eligible for a tax cut and 20 million Americans available, or eligible, to refinance their college loans at lower interest rates.
Now the deficit is going down three years in a row for the first time since Harry Truman was President. We've got almost 4 million new jobs, very low inflation, a 1.5 percent drop in unemployment.
There were other skeptics later who said the sky would fall if we passed the North American Free Trade Agreement. They, too, were wrong. We can see this year that automobile sales, for example, in Mexico -- to Mexico -- are growing at five times the rate of last year, and our trade with Mexico is growing more rapidly than that with any other country.
And while I know an awful lot of people are still hurting, the road ahead looks good. According to Fortune magazine, for the first time in a decade, all 50 states will expand their private economies next year. Let me say that again: For the first time in a decade all 50 states will experience economic growth next year.
None of this came without a fight, and now we're involved in two more historic fights. The first is on crime. We have a chance to pass the toughest, smartest crime bill in the history of the United States after six years of bickering over it. Let me remind you of what that bill will do. It will put 100,000 police officers on the streets of our communities, a 20 percent increase. It will make three strikes and you're out the law of the land. It will ban deadly assault weapons and hand gun ownership by minors.
 It will provide tougher sentences for violent criminals and more prisons to put them in. And we've listened to police, prosecutors and community leaders who tell us that they need much more for prevention programs to give our young people something to say yes to as well as something to say no to.
 Believe it or not, there are still special interests here in Washington trying to derail this crime bill. But we're fighting them and the American people will win this fight too.
 Still, the recovery we are building, the communities we're trying to make safer, the individual citizens we're trying to empower to compete and win in the global economy, all of these people are at risk unless and until we reform health care.
 Our system still costs too much and covers too few. It is actually going in the wrong direction. In the past five years, 5 million more Americans have lost their health insurance, almost all of them working people and their children.
 We're fighting for health care reform not just for those who don't have health insurance -- but for those who do have it and who could use it and lose it because they have to change jobs, because someone in their family gets sick, because they simply have to pay too much for it. They deserve better, and we're fighting to see that they get it.
 We want to guarantee private, not government, insurance for every American. The plan I originally proposed has been changed, and much of it for the better. The proposals before Congress are less bureaucratic. They're more flexible. They provide more protection and support for small business. They contain a reasonable phase-in time over a period of years to make sure we get it right. No bureaucrat will pick your doctor. You can keep your own plan or pick a better one. This approach controls government spending but relies on competitive forces in the free market to restrain the growth of private health insurance premiums.
 Much of it has changed for the better but one rock-solid principle remains: private insurance guaranteed for everyone.
 We know it will work. For 20 years Hawaii has required employers and employees to split the cost of insuring all employees. People still pick their doctors there. Health care is getting better there. The economy is doing well there, and almost everything in Hawaii is more expensive than it is here on the mainland except for health insurance where small businesses pay health insurance costs that are on average 30 percent lower than they are in the rest of America.
 Now, after 60 years of trying and 18 months of sometimes trying debate, the question of guaranteeing coverage for all Americans has come to the floor of the Congress and will be decided in the next few weeks in a few critical votes. The votes will be soon and they will be close. I want to urge the American people to tell their senators and congressmen to put aside partisanship and think of the American people and their fundamental interest and needs. We have an historic opportunity. We dare not pass it up. This is a fight for the American people we also have to win.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. Mr. President, in January you waved a pen and said you would veto legislation that didn't guarantee every American private health insurance that could never be taken away. Now you'd indicated you will support a Senate bill that does not guarantee coverage and sets a goal of 95 percent, leaving millions of Americans uninsured. Are you now revising your veto threat, and doesn't the fact that you've indicated you support this less ambitious Senate plan make it harder for House members to go along with a bill that's more like your original proposal?
A. Well, first of all, I disagree with your characterization of the Mitchell bill. I believe it will achieve universal coverage for all Americans, and that is the one criteria I have set out.
What the Mitchell bill says is, if you make a dramatic amount of progress in a short time -- that is, if you move from where we are now at about 83 percent of coverage up to 95 percent in a few years -- that is evidence that we can achieve full coverage in the near future without requiring insurance to be bought.
That is what that bill says.
If it is deficit-neutral, and if it is passed in the way that it is, I believe it will achieve full coverage because what the bill also says is, if we don't make that amount of progress in a few years, there will be a requirement on the Congress to provide for full coverage. And if the Congress doesn't act then automatically employers and employees will be required to purchase insurance.
I believe it does meet the objective that I set out in the State of the Union Address, and I would sign it.
Q. What about the second part of the question, Mr. President. Doesn't it make the fact that you have now indicated support for a less ambitious Senate bill, won't that make it harder to persuade House people to go along with a stronger bill?
A. Well, what the Mitchell Bill does is to put the employer requirement at the end of the process rather than at the beginning. And Senator Mitchell is convinced that that is the most ambitious bill he can pass, but that it meets the requirement. And it says to the people who have not been supportive of our approach: Look, we'll try it in a competitive way first and if that doesn't work, then we'll have a requirement. I think the same debate is going on in the House.
My own view is that the questions now should shift to the members of the other party, to the Congressional Republicans. At one time when we started this debate, and I said I wanted universal coverage, many members in Congress stood up and clapped, of both parties. At one time there were two dozen Republican Senators on a bill to give universal coverage to all Americans; they have all abandoned that bill. We have reached out to them, as was our responsibility, to try to work together in a bipartisan fashion, and every time we've done it, they have moved away. So the questions now should shift to them. Are we going to cover all Americans or not? Are we going to have a bill that provides health care security or not?
If you don't like our approaches in the Senate and the House, what is your alternative? That's what I hope we'll see.
 
On Haiti
 Q. Mr. President, on Haiti you sought and received the approval of the United Nations to launch an invasion if necessary. Why do you need a green light from the international community and not from the American Congress? Will you ask lawmakers to take it up?
A. Well, first let me say that I agree with the resolution adopted by the Senate today that the action of the United Nations should not be interpreted as an approval by Congress, it has no impact on what Congress would do.
Second, let me say I think all Americans should be pleased that the United Nations has stated, with a strong firm voice that includes many voices from our own area, that we should keep on the table the option of forceably removing the dictators who have usurped power in Haiti and who have trampled human rights and murdered innocent people. Let me remind you all of what our interests are there: We have Americans living and working there, several thousand of them. We have a million Haitian-Americans in this country who have family and friends there. We have an interest in promoting democracy in our hemisphere. We have an interest in stabilizing those democracies that are in our hemisphere.
For the first time, ever 33 of the 35 nations in the Caribbean and Central and South America are governed by popularly elected leaders but many of those democracies are fragile. As we look ahead to the next century, we need a strong and democratic Latin America and Central America and Caribbean with which to trade and grow.
So those are our fundamental interests. I would welcome the support of the Congress, and I hope that I will have that. Like my predecessors of both parties, I have not agreed that I was constitutionally mandated to get it, but at this moment I think we have done all we need to do because I don't want to cross that bridge until we come to it. We have kept force on the table; we have continued to move it up as an option as the dictators there have been more obstinate. But it is premature, in my judgment, to go beyond that now.
Rita.
 
On Whitewater
 Q. President Clinton, a number of political analysts, including some who are quite friendly to you, have said that the focus on the Whitewater affair has both undercut public confidence in you and also in your ability to get your programs through Congress. Do you agree with that? And what impact do you think Whitewater has had, particularly with the hearings this week?
A. Well, I would think, first of all, that in the last couple of weeks, that it should have been very helpful to the Administration because we have seen three reports: one from the special counsel, Mr. Fiske, who has said that there was absolutely no violation of the law in any of these contacts, and then, two, one by the Office of Government Ethics and one by Mr. Cutler, the White House Counsel, saying that no ethical rule was violated. Secondly, we have been fully cooperative, as we always said we would be.
So, from my point of view, we've done all we could. Now, I can't say what the impact has been. All I can tell you is that I said we would cooperate fully, and we have. I have said repeatedly that I did nothing wrong, and I didn't. And I have continued to work for the welfare and the interests of the American people.
Almost all -- I've watched none of these hearings. I've not kept up with them. I've been working on jobs and health care and the crime bill and peace in the Middle East and doing the things I was hired to do for the American people. They will have to make up their mind when all the dust clears what they think the impact of it is.
But I'm convinced we're having a very productive time. I think we'll get this crime bill. We have health care bills providing universal coverage on the floor of both houses of Congress for the first time in the history of the republic. No President since Harry Truman has been able to do that, and many have tried, including President Nixon. So I feel good about the progress we're making and that's all I can worry about.
I've got to get up here every day and go to work and try to help the American people.
Karen?
Q. Mr. President, Roger Altman ran into a real buzz saw in the Whitewater hearings, and even some Democrats are questioning his truthfulness. Does he have the credibility to continue as No. 2 at Treasury? Are you going to ask for his resignation?
A. Well, let me say first of all, he spoke with the Senate committee for more than 10 hours yesterday. That's a very long time. And he answered all of their questions. He then spoke for several hours with the House committee today. In that, he admitted that he had not given all the information to them in a timely fashion that he should have, but he said repeatedly that he had not willfully mislead them.
I would like to emphasize, first of all, I do not countenance anybody being less than forthright with the Congress. There have been many people, including people that are not particularly friends of our Administration, who have talked about how we have been much more cooperative with these investigations than previous Administrations have been. That's what I've told the American people I would do, and that is what I have done.
But if you look at the facts -- let's go back to the fundamental facts. There was no violation of the law. There was no violation of any ethics rule. The Secretary of the Treasury pointed out that Mr. Altman has done a superb job in his positions. He was critical to the passage of our economic program that produced almost 4 million jobs in 18 months. He was important in the passage of our trade initiatives. He has done a good job there.
The Secretary of the Treasury has confidence in him, and so do I. And I think he has now answered all the questions that the Senate could possibly have about an incident that involved no violation of the law and no violation of ethics.
Yes.
 
On Haiti Again
 Q. Mr. President, to come back to Haiti for a moment, you mentioned the number of -- of American interests that we have in Haiti, but what is -- involves national security that's at stake? Is there anything in Haiti that involves our security that would require us to go in and invade the country?
A. Well, first of all, I think our security is caught up in whether the people in this hemisphere are moving toward democracy and open markets and observation of the rule of law. And when one country in our hemisphere -- on our backdoor -- has an election, votes for a leader, then that leader is deposed by people who murder, who kill, who rape, who maim, who throw the human rights monitors out, who now won't even let people leave who have been approved for leaving, it seems to me that if you look at the possible ramifications of that on other countries in the Caribbean and in Central and South America, that is where our security interest is.
I can tell you that as I was calling other nations to get them to help in the safe haven project, to be willing to take some Haitians who leave, that is the thing that other leaders mentioned to me over and over again. We know that many of our democracies are fragile but we're moving in the right direction. We don't want to see Latin America take one more wrong turn. We're moving right, we want to stay right. And I think that is profoundly important to us.
Andrea.
 
On North Korea
 Q. Mr. President, just another few weeks we will know whether North Korea has transformed more fuel rods into weapons-grade plutonium. What are the consequences if North Korea does make more weapons-grade plutonium? And are you prepared to carry out that threat?
A. I think I can do no better than to reiterate what I have always said: that North Korea's fate is still in its own hands. It must decide what its own future should be. I think at this time when North Korea has shown a willingness to stop reprocessing and to stop refueling and when our talks are about to begin again next Friday, we should take the facts as we have them and keep working for progress.
This is an issue which is very important to the long-term security of the United States. The question of a country that belongs to the nonproliferation regime deciding to become a nuclear power, the prospect that a nuclear capacity could be transferred, either by design or by accident to other countries or to rogue groups, this is a very serious thing for our long-term security. And we have spent a lot of time to make sure we are firm and deliberate, but that firmness, that deliberateness, has led to these talks which were interrupted when Kim Il Sung passed away. We start the talks again on Friday. The agreement the North Koreans made is still holding about refueling and reprocessing. I think we should focus on that now and keep working for a satisfactory conclusion.
Jean?
Q. Are you confident that we will know whether they violate these agreements?
A. Yes, I am. I believe that. I have no reason to believe we will not know if that agreement is violated.
 
On Approval Ratings
 Q. Mr. President, as you pointed out in your opening statement, the economy has been growing. Last week we saw the peace agreement, or the framework for a peace agreement, between Israel and Jordan. Yet your approval rating continues to slide in the polls. To what do you attribute that? Is it the message, is it the messengers? And a related part of that question: Has Leon Panetta made any recommendations to you for changes in the White House to improve things?
A. Well, first of all, I'm not the best judge of that. Maybe I'm just not as good a talker as you folks thought I was when I got elected President. Maybe there's so much going on, it's hard for anything specific to get through. Maybe it's partly a function of the times in which we live. Whenever we move from one historic era into another, where we -- at the end of World War I, at the end of World War II, moving into the cold war; now at the end of the cold war, moving toward the 21st century -- our people are filled with a mixture of hope and concern. Almost every American is genuinely concerned about something now, whether it's their economic circumstances, their health care, insecurity over crime, concern about what's happening to the fabric of our society with so many children being born out of wedlock and so many families breaking down. There's something gripping the concern of most Americans.
And when people have these balances going on, hope or fear, it is sometimes difficult to get through with the hope and the progress. I can't worry about that. All I can do is to show up for work here every day and, as I said today to the folks who rode the buses for health care, try to make this the home office of the American Association for Ordinary Citizens. And if I keep doing that, I think that the future will take care of itself. My only concern is to continue to be able to be effective, and that's what I will work for.

On Health Care Action
 Q. Mr. President, on health care there were indications on Capitol Hill today that time is now becoming an important factor, that there's a need to get legislative language, there's a need to get various budgetary estimates, and that it may be very difficult to get a vote before the end of this month. Are you prepared now to insist that Congress remain in session and not take its recess until there is action on both Houses?
A. Well, my belief is that Senator Mitchell has done enough work on his bill, and that the House bill has been out there in its basic framework, so that the recess will probably have to be delayed but could still occur. I do believe that they should and will stay here until they can take action on those bills, each House on its own bill. I believe that will happen, and I think that's a good thing. Because that's a way of their putting the American people first, which is something I think should be done.
Q. A two-part question on health care: When you put your own health care plan forward you said you wanted to build on the private insurance industry. The House bill that Congressman Gephardt has put forward could turn control of almost half the health care system over to the Federal Government. Why do you support that approach as opposed to your original idea? And secondly, is Senator Mitchell's bill now your new bottom line, your new minimum? If there is anything less than that coming out of the Senate, would that draw a veto?
A. Let me answer the second question. My goal has been what it has always been: I want a system that will take us to universal coverage. If it takes a few years to get there, that's fine with me. We don't want to mess it up. We want to have the chance to continue to work and strengthen the program along the way.
In the case of the House bill, as you know I've always thought that we ought to allow every American to buy into the Federal Employees Health Insurance Bill, which is essentially a private plan. The House bill offers a Medicare program, if you will, like the senior citizens buy into now, but only if people decide not to buy private health insurance. So it still has a preference for private health insurance, and I think that is consistent with what I think we should do.
I still believe the best thing to do is to build more on the system that most of us have now.
Peter?
Q. Do you favor the Mitchell approach or the Gephardt approach?
A. Well, I'm not going to get into being a legislator. I'm -- I'm -- I'm. My job is to try to keep the American people's eye on the ball and to try to keep the members of Congress working together.
What I favor is now for our friends on the other side of the aisle and all the Democrats to get together, think about the interests of the American people and come up with a program that solves the problem.
Let me just say, if I might, just stop for a moment and say I think it is terribly important in this debate, when these issues tend to be complex and detailed, to keep our eye on the central reality here, which is how do we solve the problem.
I asked two of the people who rode those buses to come here tonight, I want them to just stand up -- David -- Daniel Lumley and John Cox. And I, and let me answer your question this way. Daniel Lumley was a young man who lost his arm riding a motorcycle. He wants to be a schoolteacher; he wants to be a public servant; he wants to know that he'll always be able to get health insurance when he works even though he has a very apparent, pre-existing condition. Like millions and millions of Americans with disabilities he can work and do fine and pay taxes, which releases the burden on the rest of us, if he can get insurance.
John Cox left his job with health insurance and went to work for a Christian radio station because he thought it was his mission in life to do that. He thought he was covered by health insurance and he thought his employer was paying it, and he wasn't. When his wife came down sick, because they didn't have health insurance even though he was working, they didn't go to the doctor. They just talked to a doctor over the phone for months and months. Finally, she became so ill they had to see a doctor at an emergency room. By that time she had cancer that had progressed to the point where it could not be fully treated.
He took this bus ride across the country when his wife was dying because she wanted him to. She died during the bus ride. He buried her two days ago, and he came up here today to be with us.
My answer to you is: If the program works for John Cox and for Daniel Lumley, I'll be for it.
 
On Roger Altman
 Q. Mr. President.
A. Wolf
Q. Mr. President, if I could ask you a specific question on these Whitewater hearings, which I know you're not watching. But many of us were watching till 2 o'clock in the morning last night. One of the problems that Roger Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, seems to have is that he didn't recuse himself or step down as chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation because he feared there could be some sort of appearance of a conflict. He had decided to step down but was talked out of it by Bernard Nussbaum, your former counsel and other White House aides. That seems to be the source of a lot of problems that he has.
And Josh Steiner, the Treasury chief of staff, says that you and the First Lady were furious that Roger Altman told a New York Times editorial writer about this decision before you learned about it. What was so bad about his decision to recuse himself if there was nothing that he could have done to interfere in the R.T.C. investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan?
A. First of all, I never would promote anybody interfering in any investigation. I welcome this investigation. And it will vindicate what I have been saying all along. I had no problem with Mr. Altman deciding of his own independent judgment in consultation with his superior, the Secretary of the Treasury, that he ought to recuse himself.
The only thing that upset me was I did not want to see him stampeded into it, if it wasn't the right thing to do. I just wanted the decision to be made on the merits. I think it's a pretty simple, straightforward position I had, and I think it was the right one.
George.
 
On Baseball
 Q. Mr. President, Atlanta Braves owner Ted Turner last week called on you to intervene with Government arbitration to head off a baseball strike. Now that your Labor Secretary has met with both sides of the talks, do you see any Government role in this matter? Do you see anything you personally can do to head off the strike?
A. Let me say first of all, just as a lifelong baseball fan, I suppose I have a greater interest in this than maybe a President even should. I mean, the prospect of seeing records that are 30 and 40 years old broken for those of us who like the offensive as well as the defensive side of baseball, I mean, this is an exhilarating thing. I think it would be heartbreaking for the American people if our national pastime didn't get through this whole season. And it's a great opportunity for these young players and what they can become.
Secondly, the Secretary of Labor, as you pointed out, did meet with the representatives of the players and the owners. And we discussed what could be done and tried to facilitate better communications between them. There may be some other things which can be done, but at this time the situation is sufficiently delicate that I think we, we need to leave it at that. If we can play a constructive role, we will. We do not want to play a destructive role. We all hope that somehow the strike can be averted.
Maura.
Q. Mr. President, there are many Democratic members of the House, your allies, who disagree with you. They don't believe that Senator Mitchell's bill is a universal coverage bill. Are you ready to tell them that you think that Senator Mitchell's bill is the best that can possibly come out of Congress this year?
A. Well, first of all, let's remember how a bill becomes law. I mean, a bill -- It's very important. Senator Mitchell has to find a majority for a bill that can pass the Senate, and then there must be a majority of people supporting a bill that passes the House. The Senate task is very hard because except on the budget a tiny minority -- 41 percent of the Senate -- can keep any other bill from even coming to a vote. He has a difficult task.
Then the bill goes through a conference, and a final bill will come back and be voted on in both Houses. We have seen many times how a bill passes the House, a bill passes the Senate, a final one comes out that's different from either one. We don't know what will happen.
Let me tell you what I hope will happen. What I hope will happen is that these here -- that the, the debates on the floor of the Senate and the House will be widely publicized, heavily watched and that the debate will grip the imagination of ordinary American citizens who themselves may not be part of any discrete interest group and that there will be a climate in the country welling up, as I believe it is now, for action that works, that solves the human problem.
I believe George Mitchell, as many of the senators pointed out, is in a situation in which every time he tried to do something the -- the members of the other party moved away from a position they had previously had. Normally, in a bill -- when a bill becomes law if you take one position and the people in the other party take another, you move toward them, they move toward you, you work out an agreement. Here's a case where we had 24 senators of the other party committed to universal coverage and they have all abandoned the plan they were originally for. And as he has moved toward them, they have moved away. In that environment I think he has done a fine job with a bill that I personally believe will achieve universal coverage.
And that's all I can say. It is my opinion that it will work.
 
On the Treasury Department
 Q. Mr. President, strictly from a management standpoint, given the conflicting recollections of the various members of the Treasury Department team, do you believe they continue to work together effectively?
A. Well, the management of the Treasury Department is under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Treasury. All I can tell you is, the important thing for the American people is the Treasury Department has worked very well.
Nearly every American, nearly every expert in this town believes that it has worked very well across a whole broad range of issues and that the Secretary of the Treasury has done an absolutely superb job in both domestic and international economic arenas with the support of his team.
The management questions are things that he will have to resolve but I will say again, there was no violation of the law, there was no violation of the ethics rules. The errors which were made have been acknowledged and questions have been answered at extreme length. I think that is a very good thing.
I'll come back to you.
Q. Mr. President, you've worked hard to open new markets for American businesses. Are you upset or disappointed that businesses have worked so hard against health care reform?
A. No, because not all businesses have. It is true we have worked hard to open markets for business, with NAFTA, with the new worldwide G.A.T.T. agreement, selling our airplanes, selling our high-tech equipment, reviving our shipbuilding industry -- all the things we've done. But frankly, I think the amazing story of this health care debate is not that there are still some business interests against it but that we have more business interests for it than ever before.
Let me just say that many of the Fortune 500 companies support the idea that every business should do what it can to cover the employees, and the employees should pay something. We now have 600,000 small businesses who cover their employees and are paying too much, who have come out for our position that all of their colleagues should do the same. I think that is very impressive. When you look at that plus all the other -- the medical groups that have come out for our approach, it is a truly astonishing thing. And what I hope is, again, when this debate starts, that all the people who are doing -- for something, instead of just against something, I hope that they will prevail.
Mary?
 
On New Conferences
 Q. Mr. President, would you tell us why you hold so few solo press conferences? This is only our third, and you have been heard to complain that the lords of the right-wing radio have uninterrupted communication with the American people. And you have the same chance but don't take it. Would you tell us why?
A. I think -- I think it's a mistake and I intend to do more on a more regular basis. Besides, I actually enjoy these, and I think we should do more and do them on a more regular basis, and I intend to. It's one of the changes that I intend to make. Sarah? I can hear you!
Q. I want to tell you that I've just been informed by a volunteer who knows what she's talking about, Mrs. B. A. Bentsen, wife of the Secretary of the Teasury. She works to get prenatal care for millions of mothers. And she says that money, the government money has run out completely for prenatal care, which means that we will have deformed babies that we'll have to pay for the rest of their lives in institutions. Can't you do something about this?
A. Well, of course we can, and one of the things that this health care bill will do, either one of them, would be to cover more prenatal care. One of the biggest problems we have in the United States with about 1 in 6 of our people without health insurance is that a lot of people don't get preventive care when they should. It is true that when women see the doctor several times before their babies are born, the babies are far more likely to be born healthy and at normal birth rate. And that is a focus of both bills. Senator Mitchell's bill, because of the phase-in time, went out of its way to try to take care of that issue.
Peter?
 
On the Middle East
 Q. Mr. President, if I could go back to foreign policy issues. Syria appears to be the big missing piece of the puzzle in the Middle East now. Following the meeting between the Israeli Prime Minister and King Hussein of Jordan, do you see any indication that Syria wants to make peace at this point? Do you see any reason for optimism that they're willing to talk directly to Israel?
A. I think there are difficult issues still between Israel and Syria, but I believe both leaders do want to make peace. As you know, before I announced that King Hussein and Prime Minister Rabin would come here to end their state of war and to commit to establishing full peace, I had a long talk with President Assad on the telephone. I then spoke with him again. I am convinced that he is still very much interested in a comprehensive peace. And we have one piece of public evidence of that, which is that the whole ceremony between Israel and Jordan signing the Washington declaration was shown on television in Syria without comment.
We have other indications that they are, and you may be sure that the Secretary of State and Dennis Ross and all of our team, as well as I are doing everything we can to keeping pushing that.
Q. What are those other indications, sir?
A. I don't think I should say more than that. I -- we've been pretty successful in the Middle East by letting the parties make their own decisions and letting them percolate up.
Q. You may not be a legislator, but you are the head of -- titular head of the Democratic party. Why should you ask Democrats in the House from marginal constituencies to vote for the Gephardt bill when in fact the Michel bill may be more politically palatable?
A. Well, let me say again: the Senate and the House are going to debate both these bills. And they will work through the process and decide where to come out. But let me say, if you just take Mr. Cox there: He's from Athens, Tex. Now, Athens, Tex., is no different from New York City or San Francisco, Calif., or my home in Arkansas when it comes to the existence of people who have these problems. And I think the House and the Senate should each pass a bill which they can best explain to their folks back home as something that solves the problem. I would remind you that we know that universal coverage is popular with the American people. What we also know is that they're concerned about having something that changes something so fundamental in their lives. They want to make sure we fix what's wrong, keep what's right. So in both bills we have reassured the rank-and-file voters both bills in different way may offend various organized interest groups who may be able to advertise and affect the attitudes of rank-and-file voters but we know that both these bills, by having a longer phase-in time, less bureaucracy, more flexibility and more support for small business, clear choice of plans -- that those things have answered the concerns of American voters in every Congressional district in the country.
Yes, in the back.
Q. Mr. President, as Congressman Bill Richardson went recently to Haiti and met for, I think, five hours with General Cedras and he came back and he said Cedras was not an intransigent -- intransigent man. He has been invited to return to Haiti. Has he talked to you about it and would you consider it a good idea for him to go back to Haiti now that the U.N. has passed this resolution?
A. I have talked to Congressman Richardson. I have no comment about any further trips. It is difficult to conclude that Mr. Cedras is not intransigent. After all, he promised to leave Haiti on October the 30th, at the implementation of the Governor's Island Accord, and he broke his promise. And he has continued to visit untold misery on his people. He knows what to do to end the problems of the people of Haiti, and he can do it.
Yes.
 
On Deficit Reduction
 Q. Mr. President, earlier this year --
A. I'm sorry.
Q. -- or last year, rather, you're economic program, you sacrificed a lot of your investment program to get deficit reduction as we've learned over the objections of many of those on your staff. The deficit reduction part has worked out even better than you expected, as you said. But since that time the stock market has drifted lower, long-term interest rates are higher than when you took office and there are some signs of a slow-down on the horizon -- housing starts and new home sales, for example, are down. At this point, do you think, perhaps, you made a mistake -- that you went too far into deficit reduction and that from your point of view the country might have been better off had you put more money into infrastructure and into investment.?
A. Absolutely not. Given the options that we had, the right decision was made.
Let me take you back in time. We had had the slowest job-growth rate for the previous four years that we'd had since the great Depression. The economy was going down, the deficit was going up. Our position in the global economy depended on our ability to get the deficit down. Our ability to generate private economic activity depended on our ability to drive interest rates down. If someone had told any economist a year and a half ago that we could create almost four million jobs, take the unemployment rate down over a point and a half, have no inflation and still have long-term rates almost exactly where they were on they day that I took office, no one would have believed that. They'd say if you're going to improve the economy that much, long-term interest rates will go way up.
Because we were committed to bringing the deficit down without inflation, interest rates went way down and then when we had a lot of economic growth came back up some. The stock market is higher than it was when I took office and the long-term expectations are very good. Most businesses expect to grow next year -- both large and small. Every survey shows that. Consumer confidence and business confidence in long-term economic growth are high. The rate of growth may vary from time to time. My job is to keep the growth going and keep jobs coming into the economy and that is what we are doing.
Yes, sir. In the back.
 
On Democratic Heritage
 Q.Mr. President, thank you. In trade, your Democratic heritage --
A. No.
Q. -- or your campaign promises --
A. No.
Q. -- do you feel that you're an Eisenhower Republican as a recent book put it?
A. No. I think we did the right thing. In the 21st century, most job growth is going to come from the private sector. We will have to do more public work in two areas: in infrastructure, just like all of our competitors do -- our roads, our bridges, our airports, the things that make you a rich and powerful country -- our telecommunications infrastructure, that the Vice President's always talking about, will have to have various supports. The second thing we'll have to do is we'll have to give more direct or indirect support to create jobs in high unemployment areas, that's what our empowerment zones are all about -- enticing people through tax incentives to invest in areas where unemployment is high.
But I would remind you we have increased programs for education and training. We have dramatically increased the availabilty of low-interest college loans. We have increased the number of people who can apply for national service loans. We have increased Head Start. We have increased immunization eligibility for little kids by millions. We have increased spending on the things which are critical to our future. Will we have to invest more there -- we will -- but first we had to get our economic house in order. You cannot keep spending money you don't have and expect to get ahead of the game.
We have now done that and we can focus on investment.
Yes.
Q. Thank you, sir. Mr. President --
A. You're persistent, I owe it to you just for effort.
Q. Thank you, sir. If I may shift to a fresh subject, the Senate Appropriations Committee is hopping mad about what it calls outrageously high salaries that are being paid to defense and aerospace company executives in this country, compensation that is frequently paid by the taxpayers under Defense Department regulations and sometimes to the tune as much as $7 million or more. The committee is offering language which would rule out payments any higher than the salary that the Defense Secretary makes. Do you agree with the committee's finding, and would you support that kind of limit?
A. I'm not familiar enough with the issue to give you an intelligent answer. I will look into it, and I will be glad to give you an answer, but I don't know enough about the issue to answer the question in an appropriate way. All right, go ahead, and then Trude.
Q. Mr. President, I'm Evelyn Baye Davis.
A. I can't believe a member of the press is pushing a microphone away. This is an historic moment in itself.
 
On Mergers
 Q. Mr. President, what is the Administration doing to stop the mega-mergers, particularly in the telecommunications industry, in the pharmaceutical industry and in retailing. We have seen Viacom-Paramount, now Federated-Macy's and we're reading today about American Cyanamid merging with American Home Products, mergers which are not in the interest of the public and the stockholders, and in the case of Federated-Macy's, Federated has the stockholder meeting on the same day as major competitors, they don't want stockholders to come and ask questions, they are in collusion with their competitors. And the Administration is not lifting one finger.
A. Well, you've drawn a lot of conclusions there in a short time. I don't know if I can answer them all. Let me say this: there are two ways in which mergers can be not in the interest of the people of the United States. First is if they violate our antitrust laws, that is if they do significant damage to th competitive environment. And our Administration has tried to reinvigorate the antitrust division of the Justice Department to a significantly higher level than in the last two Administrations.
Secondly is, as you suggest, if there is some illegal erosion of the rights and interests of the stockholders of these companies or their workers or others who have legal rights that are being undermined. That is within the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. I think we have a very able person chairing that commission. I would be glad to ask them to look into these things more than I'm sure they already are but I am not in a position to draw the conclusions you have drawn because I think they are trying to protect the public interest.
Trudy.
Q. My question --
A. Trudy, go ahead.
Q. There is 37 million uninsured Americans. If you can't get a bill that will cover all of them and you get one that will cover, say, 20 million, would you really refuse to sign it? And if you do and don't get a bill at all, how would you explain that to those 20 million?
A. First of all, keep in mind that most of our problem is with working Americans. And the problem with the so-called half a loaf here is that it won't work. That is, we have evidence now, in the states, about 40 states have tried to just change the rules on insurance and put a little more money into covering very poor people to increase health care coverage. No one could say that is not good on its own. But the problem is, if that's all you do, what has happened in the states is that putting people into a health insurance pool who cost more to insure without expanding the size of the pools leads to higher rates. Once the rates get higher, small businesses on the margin and individuals who are young and healthy get out. That makes the pool even smaller. The rates go up more. So what would happen, I am convinced, if we did what you suggest, is what has happened in the states: coverage would go up a little bit for a while then it would go right back down as it has in the United States for the last five years as states have tried to do this. So, again, I say we have no evidence that unless we are moving toward full coverage, that we can control costs and maintain coverage for the working families of the country.
Just one more?
Q. Mr. President.
A. We're almost out of time.
Q. You spoke with some thoroughness tonight about why you think it's in the United States interest to not have a military dictatorship in Haiti. My question is if an invasion force is dispatched and overthrows that military regime, what are the United States obligations at that point to -- to nurture -- to create an environment in that troubled country where democracy would have a chance?
A. . I think the . . .
Q. How long would this last?
A. I think the United States has significant obligations but if you look at the United Nations resolution and what we have said all along, over the long run what we need is a United Nations mission in Haiti that the United States would be a part of but that other countries would participate in also that would the following things:
No. 1: It would have to retrain and re-orient the military to engage in the rebuilding of the country.
No. 2: It would have to re-orient and retrain the police to be a genuine police not an instrument of terror for one political group.
No. 3: We would have to, in addition of that, have a real dedicated effort led by a lot of our Haitian Americans and others to rebuild the troubled economy of Haiti which is in terrible, terrible, shape.
All those things we would have to do. But it would not necessarily be the United States doing it. In fact, it could not be. It would be a United Nations mission as envisaged by the United Nations and the resolution that they adopted.
Thank you very much.

HEADLINE: Information Freeway?;
Open Data Path Is Urged

BYLINE: By ASHLEY DUNN 

 BODY:
With a tangle of cut-rate electronics and a couple of computers, the free-netters of Buffalo are campaigning to bring cyberspace to the people.
"We're built on the concept of community, not profit," said Jody Lebrenz, a founding member of the Buffalo Free-Net. "We believe that the minute you charge even $5, you're dividing people into haves and have-nots. Access should be free to the community, like a public library." 
 The Buffalo Free-Net, a volunteer group of students, librarians and residents, is part of a small but growing grass-roots movement loosely known as community networks. Its mission: to provide computer users with local services like regional news and forums on community issues. But while some community networks have fees, free-nets are championing access without charge to the global computer web Internet.
The free-access groups have opened an electronic portal that allows local residents to connect home computers, for the cost of a local phone call, to the Internet, which is now shared by an estimated 20 million people worldwide. Many free-access networks have set up computers in schools and libraries so that even those without their own equipment can reach the Internet for free.
With fewer than 100 in existence, from Big Sky Telegraph in Montana to Ocean State Free-Net in Providence, R.I., the networks are at the moment just a blip in the cosmos. Most Internet users rely on private companies like America Online, a national service, and Pipeline, in New York City, to provide Internet access for fees that begin around $9 a month.
But the free-access-network idea is spreading. Four more networks are being set up in the New York region, in White Plains, Albany, Rochester and Danbury, Conn. Organizers hope to provide access to everything from job listings to government programs.
"The Common Council agenda is not available here unless you go to City Hall," said Diane Greenwald, a Danbury librarian helping to organize that city's free-access network, which is expected to be ready by early 1996. "We can have lots of local forums. Why not something for ethnic communities? This is the reincarnation of the public library in the computer age."
 
Federal Grants Promised
 To help develop community networks, including free networks, the Federal Government has committed $26 million this year in grants, for which it has received more than 1,000 applications; $100 million has been promised next year.
Most free networks depend on state grants, donations and the largess of a university to pay for or supply computers, modems, phone lines and, sometimes, staff. They often piggyback off a nearby university, which pays the $5,000 to $25,000 for a high-capacity telephone line linking its computer system to the Internet.
A leader of the free-access movement, Tom Grundner, who created the first such network in Cleveland in 1986, has organized the National Public Telecommunications Network, a consortium of 34 networks that aims to coordinate programs. For example, the network recently sponsored an event in which schools competed in math and sports, then posted scores on the Internet.
Mr. Grundner's intent is to create a cooperative called the Corporation for Public Cybercasting, patterned after the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. A cyberspace PBS, he says, would serve as a clearinghouse for Federal funds, help develop information services for local communities and lobby for community access.
 
Access Is an Issue
 As the Internet has evolved from a low-cost computer network limited to researchers and students into a powerful tool of mass communications, free networks have found themselves at the heart of a national debate: should the public be guaranteed free access as the technology evolves? At the moment, no one can lay claim to the Internet, but the telecommunications and entertainment industries are beginning to build advanced communications systems that would put them in a position to control and charge for access.
Earlier this year, 93 civil-rights and consumer groups drafted a letter to Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, chairman of the Senate subcommittee on communications, in support of open access.
In June, Senator Inouye proposed a bill that would provide some guarantee of public access. Other measures moving through Congress demand guarantees of affordable pricing and preferential rates for schools, hospitals, local governments and libraries.
"There are always going to be niches for services that are in demand but can't be found any other place," said Heidi Kukis, spokeswoman for Vice President Gore. "The Vice President likes to tell a story about a 90-year-old woman who refused to go to a nursing home until she was hooked up to a modem so she could communicate on Seniornet. This is a perfect example of why community networks will continue to exist even as the national information infrastructure expands."
There is no pattern to how free networks are set up or financed. Seattle's is backed by the city, which has installed hundreds of computers in public libraries so residents can send electronic messages or tap into data banks.
The Buffalo Free-Net has depended on donated services from the State University of New York at Buffalo and small state grants.
In New York City, Neighborhood Houses of New York, a social-service organization, is sponsoring a community network of sorts with a plan to place scores of computer terminals with some free Internet access in settlement houses around the city.
That the free networks exist at all is a result of the unusual economics of the Internet, which was created in the early 1970's by the Defense Department to allow researchers to exchange data. The system, at first paid for by the Government, connected only researchers at universities, but eventually access spread. Universities began offering free access to students and researchers, who transformed it into a communications system that went far beyond what its creators envisioned.
It was as a student three years ago that Mr. Lebrenz, one of the founding members of the Buffalo Free-Net, discovered Internet.
"I literally spent six hours a day on the Internet for over a year just learning about it," he said. "As a librarian, I thought I had died and gone to heaven."
Mr. Lebrenz and others decided to bring the Internet to Buffalo by tapping the university's connection and using donated equipment. The Buffalo Free-Net now has 8,000 registered users, who can dial up to see who is playing Saturday night at the Lafayette Tap Room downtown, review City Council agendas or sign on to Seniornet, the bulletin board system with information for the elderly.
 
Survival Is Difficult
 Survival, however, has been a struggle, the free-netters say.
To begin with, even a small network needs staff to maintain computer systems and oversee operations. In Peoria, Ill., the Heartland Free-Net consumes $45,000 a year to keep its connection open for the 1,400 people a day who sign on, even with its free connection through nearby Bradley University.
"The bottom line is that I don't know if we're going to survive," said Karen Eggert, executive director of Heartland. "I've been in a seat for four years where every few months you look around and don't have any money left."
Free networks also have been squeezed by their own success. As small entities, they were little trouble for the universities that provided Internet connections. But as computer traffic has increased, many universities are now asking the free networks to pay their share of connection costs.
The Buffalo Free-Net this year made its first payment, $7,500, for its share of the university's Internet connection. The Free-Net, which has set up computers in the public library for residents without equipment, has also spent $7,500 to $12,500 a year, raised through grants and donations, on operations.
"We can't handle any more users," said James Finamore, another founding member. "We can't afford the phone lines or staff. It's just not the right way to run things."
Mr. Grundner, the free-access pioneer, believes government grants and mandated access requirements will go only so far in preserving the networks, and their survival depends on finding a market niche. Despite the vast resources of the Internet, he says, local networks can fill an important role: providing a connection to what is most relevant to people's lives, their communities.
"Community computing is about trying to keep people at home," Mr. Grundner said. "People have to realize that just dumping people onto the Internet isn't going to work."

HEADLINE: Outlook Improves for Industry in New York

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
When he moved his Brooklyn knitwear company to New Jersey eight years ago, Zeev Volchik joined a decadeslong exodus of industrial concerns from New York City. Like so many New York manufacturers before and after him, Mr. Volchik was convinced that he would save hundreds of thousands of dollars by locating elsewhere and avoiding all the troubles of doing business in the city.
But two years ago, Mr. Volchik, an immigrant from Israel, moved his company back to Brooklyn. Why? Even though he had been just a few miles away in Perth Amboy, N.J., Mr. Volchik found that his company, Sarig Fashions, was losing touch with the tight network of garment makers, suppliers and customers in Queens and Brooklyn that helped him survive. 
 Parts to repair his complex computer-driven knitting machines took days to arrive rather than hours. Sweater designers in Manhattan found the trek more burdensome and placed orders elsewhere. Special types of yarn were harder to come by.
"New York is the center of the industry," Mr. Volchik said one day not long ago as he surveyed his crowded, 40,000-square-foot loft employing more than 60 people in Sunset Park. "I couldn't afford to cut myself off from where the action is."
The return of Sarig Fashions highlights an unexpected turn of fortune for New York City's long-beleaguered industrial concerns: , the retreat of manufacturing jobs has recently come to a halt, according to new figures from the New York State Department of Labor. For smaller companies, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens, a modest expansion even appears to be under way.
Moreover, a yearlong study of manufacturing in New York, released at a seminar yesterday at New York University, suggests the recent flickers of life may be something more than a temporary aberration. And with a change in approach by city government, the outlook for industry, with its opportunities for blue-collar workers to gain decent jobs and higher incomes, could substantially improve.
"The future of manufacturing need not be a continuation of the recent past," says the new research report, Made in New York: The Future of Manufacturing in New York City, financed by the State Urban Development Corporation and the Sloan Foundation.
But a cautionary note was raised by the author of the study, Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at N.Y.U. "Unless public policies are formulated that make New York City a more conducive environment for manufacturing activity," he said, "the rebirth of manufacturing in New York City will be limited."
The report identifies several underlying reasons why manufacturing could once again gain ground in New York. These three were found to be particularly important:
*An underlying shift in many industries away from large-scale mass-production centers makes it far easier for specialized manufacturers that operate in smaller spaces to succeed.
*Similarly, a drive to respond quickly to changes in consumer taste gives an advantage to the city's trend-oriented and services-related industries like fashion, furniture and food.
*Equally important is the collapse of New York's runaway real-estate boom at the end of the 1980's. "The decline in the residential and commercial real-estate market has limited the conversion of old industrial buildings and created an opportunity for manufacturers to thrive in Manhattan and in other boroughs," the report notes.
 
Rising Rent a Problem
 A prime example of a company that has taken advantage of its niche in New York City is the Lowel-Light Manufacturing Company, which dominates the market for lighting equipment used on location by television stations, independent film makers and still photographers.
Started 35 years ago by a former cinematographer who was frustrated by the lack of equipment designed for outdoor locations, Lowel-Light now sells its lightweight, portable lighting systems across the country and around the world. Although not deeply involved with major film studios, the company has long worked closely with the many photographers, television networks, advertisers and video specialists based in New York.
Once located at West 54th Street and Ninth Avenue, the company was driven out of Manhattan six years ago by rising rent. Determined to stay close to home, the owners found cheaper space in the Brooklyn Army Terminal, a city-run industrial complex in Sunset Park.
"We're noted for our design and innovation," said Marvin Seligman, chief executive officer of the company. "Because we listen so closely to our customers using our equipment, we're in a position to develop new products quickly that help us stay ahead of the competition."
Another successful company, J. Manheimer Inc., was also pushed out of Manhattan because of high costs. Its owners, all members of the same extended family, wanted to keep working nearby their residences in Manhattan and Long Island. So they relocated to Long Island City, Queens, home to the largest concentration of industrial companies in New York.
"We don't have to be here," said Arnold L. Manheimer, executive vice president of the company. "But we have very high value products, which makes it worthwhile to continue doing business in the city."
J. Manheimer has other important reasons for remaining in New York. The concern, which started as a spice importer in 1860, is at the nexus of the food and fashion businesses, two of the largest industries in the area. It sells more than $50 million worth of flavors, fragrances and oils to food processors, as well as makers of shampoos, beauty products, perfume and the like.
To be sure, manufacturing will never again be the major force it once was in the city's economy. Thirty years ago, almost 900,000 people worked in manufacturing; today fewer than 300,000 do.
Much of that collapse was unavoidable. Industry abandoned congested cities across the Northeast in a huge migration after World War II to large, more efficient single-floor factories in outlying areas.
But government planners and policy makers, convinced that manufacturing had little future in New York, also contributed to the decline. Redevelopment projects dislocated hundreds of manufacturing companies to make way for office towers, hospitals and large public works projects like Lincoln Center and the Brooklyn Civic Center. Tighter regulations, higher taxes and frequent fines forced many companies out of business and drove others to seek a more welcoming climate elsewhere.
At the root of New York's industrial decline "is an elitist industrial ideology embraced by an enduring political coalition," said David Friedman, a former New Yorker who directs the New Economy Project in Los Angeles, which is examining changes in the economy of southern California.
"As early as the mid-60's, New York leaders were indifferent to what they saw as 'crummy' jobs in such then-flourishing sectors as garments, metalworking and sophisticated electronics," he continued. "Instead, they wanted to build a 'post-industrial' society centered on high-tech, financial services and tourism, coupled with aggressive welfare relief."
Reversing that industrial decline will not be easy, the report by the Urban Research Center concluded. Small manufacturers, dispersed throughout the city, are not well-organized and have little clout in New York's prominent civic and business organizations. To take advantage of New York's potential new appeal to smaller, light-manufacturing companies, public officials must end years of, at best, indifference or, at worst, active hostility to gritty blue-collar industries, the report argues.
The recent signs of life among manufacturers have little to do with political changes at City Hall. Rather, it is a shift in the underlying conditions that opens a window of opportunity for industry.
To improve the outlook for manufacturing, the study recommends that outmoded zoning laws against mixed land use should be eliminated but that development of large retail stores and waterfront housing should be carefully managed to avoid disrupting viable manufacturing concerns. Municipal buying practices should encourage purchases from local manufacturers. High school vocational education and technical training at community colleges should be strengthened.
One of the biggest complaints of local companies, the report found, were costly parking fines often running into thousands of dollars a month. "The city should adopt a policy that allows vans to be treated with the same deference given to limousines parked in front of Barney's and in Rockefeller Center," it said.
"Despite all the problems that manufacturing firms encounter here, this city still has an enormous concentration of manufacturing activity," Professor Moss said. "It's time we stopped treating manufacturing as a lost cause."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Appeals to Union Leaders for Help in Campaign

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Seeking to revitalize the liberal-labor coalition that helped start his political career 12 years ago, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo implored state union leaders today to give him the foot soldiers and the money he needs to win perhaps his toughest campaign.
In a fiery speech to leaders of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., Mr. Cuomo cast the race in grand historical themes, calling it a battle for the "heart and soul" of America and warning that a Republican victory would be a powerful blow to union workers not just in New York State but nationwide. 
 "If you understand that we stand for the same things, and you care for the things you stand for, then make this your personal crusade, your personal mission," Mr. Cuomo told 480 union leaders. "Let the word go out that when we win, you win; that when Cuomo and Lundine are returned to office, the union movement is vindicated, and so is the great history of the State of New York."
Although Mr. Cuomo left the hall with a standing ovation and an endorsement from the 2.5 million-member A.F.L.-C.I.O., there are signs that his labor support is not as ardent as it was in 1982, when unions provided the backbone for his upset victory over Edward I. Koch in the Democratic gubernatorial primary.
 
Displeasing Unions
 The state's largest public employee union, the Civil Service Employees Association, has voted to remain neutral in the 1994 race, making it the first time in Mr. Cuomo's four gubernatorial races that he has not had the support of the 250,000-member union and its sophisticated statewide political network.
The state's second- and third-largest public employee unions are expected to follow the lead of the civil service group. And some smaller but still influential unions, including the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, are also mulling the possibility of not endorsing Mr. Cuomo.
Moreover, Mr. Cuomo has done plenty to displease union members, from laying off unionized state employees to opposing labor-sponsored bills. Though he can expect support from most union leaders, there are questions about whether their fervor will trickle down to the rank-and-file members.
Asked whether union enthusiasm for the Governor is as great today as it was in 1982, the president of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., Edward J. Cleary, said: "No. He's the guy who's built up all the negatives."
But loyalty to Mr. Cuomo runs deep among union workers, Mr. Cleary said, because the Governor's overall record is considered sterling, and many workers vividly remember his support of striking workers at Eastern Airlines and The Daily News.
 
Unions' Influence
 "How many politicians get up in front of television cameras and praise the importance of the labor movement?" Mr. Cleary asked. "He does it constantly."
After 1982, Mr. Cuomo had two races where labor support was less significant because he had only tepid Republican opposition.
But this year, he is sagging in the polls and most likely to face, in either Richard M. Rosenbaum or George E. Pataki, a well-financed Republican challenger. With the influence of political parties waning, large unions will provide the workers, computers, telephone banks and literature for a statewide get-out-the-vote operation that, in a close race, could be pivotal.
For that reason, several analysts said the defection of the civil service group hurts the Governor. "C.S.E.A. matters," said Norman Adler, a political consultant and former union official who helped run Mr. Cuomo's 1982 campaign. "In 1982, they were the Cuomo campaign north of Rockland. The loss of C.S.E.A. is the loss of not inconsiderable ground forces. And that's hard to replace."
Mr. Cuomo will still receive strong support from New York City's municipal unions such as District Council 37 and Local 1199, the health and hospital workers union, both highly effective in field campaigns. His aides also said that the defection of the Civil Service Employees Association could help Mr. Cuomo among more conservative voters by demonstrating that he made tough decisions to balance the state budget.
 
Lingering Bitterness
 Danny F. Donohue, the Civil Service Employees Association's president, said the union decided against supporting Mr. Cuomo because of lingering bitterness over past contract fights, layoffs and the Governor's use of a state pension fund to close budget gaps. He said Mr. Cuomo's decision this year to support tax cuts for businesses while opposing an inflation-linked pension increase for retired government workers only worsened the relationship.
"It's hard to look at the Governor and say, 'This is the man we spilled blood for in 1982,' and then not endorse him," Mr. Donohue said. "But back then, you had a sense there was a new leadership. I think people have a question about where we are going now."
But other union leaders chastised Mr. Donohue as being shortsighted, saying that a Republican governor would be disastrous for labor. They point to New York City, New Jersey, Massachusetts and California as examples of how Republican administrations have cut budgets and laid off or threatened the jobs of thousands of unionized workers.
"It was a big mistake on the part of the state unions," said Dennis Rivera, president of Local 1199. "The 30 percent tax cuts that the Republican challengers are advancing, will that bring more money for state workers?"
In a rousing introduction for Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Cleary called the choice between the incumbent and his challengers "one of night and day, of inside the family and outside the family.
"We made the difference for him in 1982; we must make the difference in 1994," Mr. Cleary said. "He is in the toughest fight of his career. Above all, we must not defeat ourselves by lack of enthusiasm, by lukewarm support for the battle."

HEADLINE: July Vehicle Sales Fell a Bit as Dealers Ran Low on Cars

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 3

 BODY:
Car and truck sales fell slightly in July as dealers' inventories ran low with assembly plants idled for model change-overs, the leading auto makers said today.
Detroit's Big Three and the three other leading auto makers in the United States sold a total of 1,197,236 cars and light trucks during the month, off a tenth of 1 percent from a year earlier. 
 Vehicles sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 13.7 million -- the industry's worst showing in more than a year, and down from 14.6 million in June after peaking at 15.8 million in March. In July 1993, the annual rate was 13.75 million.
 
A Lack of Supply
"I think the weak sales in July -- and they were weak, there's no getting away from that -- were due mainly to lack of supply rather than lack of demand," said David Healy, the automotive analyst with S. G. Warburg & Company.
"The companies that had plenty of inventory out in the field sold cars, and the companies that didn't have inventory had weak sales," Mr. Healy added.
Domestic cars were hit particularly hard in July, with an annual selling rate of 6.4 million, down from 6.7 million a year earlier. Domestically built light trucks, however, sold at a 5.4 million annual rate, up from 4.9 million a year ago.
The General Motors Corporation was hit particularly hard, with sales of domestic and imported cars off 8.7 percent and light-truck sales down 4.6 percent.
G.M. attributed its drop to an agonizingly slow start of production for its 1995 Chevrolet Lumina and Monte Carlo cars at a plant in Oshawa, Ontario, as well as to the factory change-over for its new Chevrolet Cavalier and Pontiac Sunfire subcompacts, which are due out this fall.
But G.M. said it thought it could halt the slide. "Our share is going to depend on how fast we can get these plants on line," William E. Hoglund, an executive vice president at G.M., said in an interview. "Our Chevy dealers are hurting for inventory."
 
Chrysler Gains 5.2%
Sales for the Chrysler Corporation and the Ford Motor Company were also hampered by idle factories.
Chrysler's overall sales rose 5.2 percent, to 167,884 units, with domestic and imported cars down 8.3 percent while domestic light trucks, including mini-vans, rose 13.8 percent.
Ford's sales rose 3.7 percent to 308,767 units. Ford's domestic and imported car sales rose just 1 percent, while its domestic light-truck sales jumped 6.5 percent to set a 10th consecutive monthly record.
Analysts said sales would likely improve in the fall as the Big Three and other auto makers increased production, but some were more cautious about tighter credit conditions.
"Unfortunately, when industry supply conditions improve, the economy itself may be weaker," said Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers Association. "With our sister industry, housing, having already left the dance floor, the party may be over for us, too."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Moderate Gains Posted By Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose moderately yesterday, as several reports provided few surprises on economic growth.
The Treasury's 30-year bond rose 6/32 , to 8617/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 7.38 percent, from 7.40 percent on Tuesday. 
 "Basically, the numbers we saw today were mixed and along the same lines of what we've seen over the past few months -- numbers that show the economy growing at a healthy pace but slower than the pace set in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, and about the same as the second quarter," said Greg Jones, an economist for MMS International, a market research and analysis firm.
 
Focus on Employment Report
 As such, analysts said, the bond market will be focusing more closely on tomorrow's Government report on July employment for new indications of the economy's direction and hints of inflationary pressures.
"Of all the data put out today, the real contributor to the bond market's gains was the monthly auto sales by the Big Three auto makers, which showed the slowest sales pace since September," Mr. Jones said. "Auto sales were the key, since they were the only piece of new information."
Over all, sales of new cars and light trucks slipped one-tenth of 1 percent in July from a year earlier.
Meanwhile, the Government reported yesterday that its index of leading economic indicators rose by two-tenths of a percent in June and that factory orders rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in the month. Both were close to economists' expectations.
In addition, the Federal Reserve said in its latest survey of business activity, known as the beige book, that there were scattered signs of a slowdown but also possible indications of rising prices.
 
Beige Book Not Favorable
 Mr. Jones said the beige book was not that favorable for the bond market. "It mentioned that retail activity had picked up recently and that a tight labor market has spurred faster wage growth," he said. "While the report says business activity is expanding solidly, there are some signs of slowing."
Yesterday afternoon, the Treasury announced the breakdown of its $40 billion quarterly refunding's for next week. Analysts said the refunding plans were slightly smaller than the expected $40.25 billion.
The Treasury will auction $17 billion of new three-year notes on Tuesday and $12 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday.
On next Thursday, it will be auctioning $11 billion of 30 1/4-year bonds, instead of bonds of the usual 30-year maturity.
Economists like John Ryding of Bear, Stearns & Company noted yesterday that an odd-dated maturity bond helped out the market for zero-coupon bonds. Unless the Treasury sells odd-dated bonds, securities firms won't be able to meet demand for zeros with a May or November maturity date, the months dropped from the quarter financing schedule last year.
A zero-coupon bond is created by breaking a bond into two parts -- one with interest payments, the other with principal payments -- that are sold separately.
Also on next Thursday, the Treasury will be selling $7 billion in 38-day cash management bills.
In when-issued trading ahead of next week's auctions, the three-year note was being offered at a price to yield 6.31 percent; the 10-year note at a price to yield 7.07 percent, and the 30 1/4-year bond at a price to yield 7.28 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S Intends to Raise Science and Technology Spending, Gore Says

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 3

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration announced its intention today to increase the nation's overall spending on science and technology research to a level equivalent to those of Japan and Germany.
At a news briefing, Vice President Al Gore presented a report, "Science in the National Interest," that outlines the Administration's commitment to expanding its support and making science and technology "a top priority" in future budgets. 
 Dr. John H. Gibbons, assistant to the President for science and technology, said the United States Government and industry together were spending 2.6 percent of the gross domestic product on nonmilitary science, and he said the goal was 3 percent, roughly the amount spent in Germany and Japan. But, he said, "we haven't translated that figure into specific programs for the future."
 
Shifting the Balance
 Dr. Gibbons said today's report was more a way of making a commitment to protect science budgets in a period of budget cutting. All agencies must think of the future "only in terms of present dollars, not of increases," he said, adding, "If there is to be more money, it must come from other programs or from increased productivity."
Federal spending on research has increased a few percent a year in recent years, he said, "which is pretty good in times of a tight budget."
Dr. M. R. C. Greenwood, associate director for science at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said that while no figures had yet been prepared "we do have a plan to increase support."
"Each agency will be asked to come up with proposals," Dr. Greenwood said.
The shift to civilian science from military science promised by President Clinton in the 1992 election campaign has already begun, she said. In 1992, 60 percent of research money went to the military and 40 percent to civilian work, and after the President's first budget, she said, "it's now more like 55 to 45 percent."
If the shift between those two budgets continues, about one-third of the goal of reaching a total national expenditure of 3 percent of domestic product will be reached.
The White House also announced the list of members of a new Committee of Advisers on Science.
The new members are:
John A. Young, Hewlett-Packard Company.
Norman R. Augustine, Martin Marietta Corporation.
Francisco J. Ayala, University of California at Irvine.

HEADLINE: Economic Data Up; Outlook Murky

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
A host of fresh economic reports was released by the Government yesterday, but private analysts said the reports shed little additional light on whether the pace of economic growth was moderating.
The Commerce Department said its index of leading economic indicators, its main forecasting gauge, rose by two-tenths of a percent in June, following a revised one-tenth of a percent increase in May. 
 Meanwhile, a separate Commerce Department report showed orders to the nation's factories posted a solid eight-tenths of a percent increase in June, the fourth straight monthly gain.
Both reports were in line with economists' expectations.
 
Fed Sees Signs of Slowing
 And in a report that provides a somewhat fresher snapshot of economic conditions, the Federal Reserve Board said in its latest survey of business activity that there were scattered signs of a slowdown but also possible indications of rising prices. The survey, known as the beige book and based on anecdotal reports from the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, covers a period that ended in mid-July.
"If there was any surprise," in the reports, said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc., "it was in the Fed's beige book, where there was a little bit of emphasis on potential price pressures. Those pressures have yet to be borne out by upward movement in either producer or consumer prices."
In its report on manufacturing orders, the Government said the rise of eight-tenths of 1 percent in June matched the previous month's increase. The gain in orders covered nearly all categories, except construction-related material and home furnishings.
 
Housing Declines Reported
 A drop in orders from those types of businesses is consistent with recently reported declines in housing. The rise in interest rates engineered by the Fed over the last six months is beginning to retard building activity.
"Growth is clearly slowing in housing and construction," Mr. Fine said, "and that partly explains the slowdown we are seeing now."
Last week, the Government reported that the economy expanded at a 3.7 percent rate in the second quarter, a more moderate pace than many private economists had expected.
Even though it is intended to predict turns in the economy by six to nine months, the index of leading indicators is widely disliked by most private analysts, who contend that its components are badly outdated.
"The index shows the economy is growing, but since some of the components are out of whack with what the economy is about today, I am not sure how much it means," said Joseph Carson, chief economist at Dean Witter, Discover Inc.
 
5 Index Components Rise
 Five of the 11 components of the index of leading indicators advanced, led by higher prices for raw materials and fewer weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance. Also, there were more unfilled orders for durable goods, more business orders for plant and equipment and higher stock prices.
On the negative side were a smaller money supply, fewer building permits, a shorter average workweek, faster business delivery times that usually are a sign of decreasing orders, a lower index of consumer expectations and fewer factory orders for consumer goods.
On balance, yesterday's reports are unlikely to help members of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee at its next meeting on Aug. 16, Mr. Carson said.
The meeting will get widespread attention because many analysts and participants in financial markets expect the committee to vote to raise interest rates in an effort to moderate the economy's growth path further.
But Mr. Carson said he was not so sure that the Fed was on the verge of increasing interest rates, partly because recent statements from Fed governors suggest the central bank is pleased with what is unfolding.
Mr. Carson noted that Alan Blinder, the Fed's newly installed vice chairman, said in an interview in USA Today yesterday that the economy was "not too hot, not too cold, but just right."
"Trying to predict the Fed right now is difficult," he said. "I think it will take a few months of additional data before they move."

HEADLINE: Stocks Have Aimless Day; Dow Off 3.56

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
Stocks were mixed yesterday for a second consecutive session, as traders awaited the release of important economic information this week and next. With investors focusing on individual stocks, the overall market was generally directionless.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down more than 9 points near 4 P.M., benefited from a last-minute buying surge of blue chips and regained ground to close at 3,792.66, off 3.56 points. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 1.11 points, to 723.69. 
 In contrast, the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.90 point to close at 461.46. And advances topped declines on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,100 to 1,004. Volume was 282.4 million shares, lower than the 295.6 million shares that changed hands on Tuesday but just about the average for the year.
"The market traded in a very narrow range," said Bernard Spilko, senior vice president of Bank Julius Baer. "We're going to continue in that range until additional economic data is released, which will either fuel or quell the speculation as to the timing of the Fed's next move."
The Federal Reserve's policy-making panel is scheduled to meet on Aug. 16, and many analysts expect it to raise its target for the overnight bank lending rate -- Fed funds -- for a fifth time this year. The Fed may have received the impetus for such an increase yesterday when the index of leading indicators rose more than had been expected and the beige book, based on reports from district banks around the country, said that business activity in July expanded at a solid pace.
 
Drug Stocks Still Strong
 Drug issues were among the strongest on the list, just as they were Tuesday, when American Home Products made a hostile $95-a-share bid for American Cyanamid. A huge price gain in American Cyanamid came in after-hours trading on Tuesday, so yesterday -- after a delay at the opening -- it sold off slightly to 90 3/4, down 2 1/4. When the stock was halted for trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, the price stood at 63 3/4.
However, many other drug companies moved upward in reaction to this hostile bid. Upjohn rose 7/8, to 32 7/8; Warner-Lambert advanced 3 3/4, to 72 1/4, and Johnson & Johnson increased 7/8, to 48.
The three major United States airline companies all closed lower by the end of the day. UAL, parent of United Airlines, fell 1 1/8, to 99 7/8; AMR, parent of American Airlines, dropped 1/8, to 58, and Delta Air Lines declined 3/8, to48 3/4.
Following yesterday's settlement by Dow Corning of 18 suits over silicone breast-implants, the stock price of one of its owners advanced and the other declined. Dow Chemical rose 1 3/8, to 71 1/8, while Corning dropped 3/8, to 31.
In another special situation, Thermo Electron, jumped 1 1/4, to 40 3/4. The company is a member of the Lockheed team that was selected by the Department of Energy yesterday to manage and operate the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Chrysler Is Asking for Directions on Quality

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., Aug. 3

 BODY:
Grappling with both the public's perceptions and the reality of its quality headaches, the Chrysler Corporation has turned to an outside consultant to try to improve its scores on an independent automobile quality survey.
Using the outside company, the Process Development Corporation in Taylor, Mich., is one of several extraordinary efforts by Chrysler to improve the quality of its Neon subcompact cars by this fall, when the survey, by the California auto consultant J. D. Power and Associates, is conducted. 
 The annual survey, conducted at the beginning of the model year, is widely used by the auto makers and buying public as a gauge of quality. It measures the number of defects that owners identify in the first 90 days they have a vehicle.
 
Disappointing Scores
 "We're a little disappointed in J. D. Power," Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, said today, referring to Chrysler's scores, which have been below the industry's average. "We're trying to step up and make sure that we really understand what the customers are telling us there."
Some of the complaints about the Neon have included poor fit and finish and a faulty radio.
The company said it hoped the Neon would end up ranking with the highest-quality small car, the Toyota Corolla.
Mr. Eaton emphasized that Chrysler was not trying to improve the quality of its Neons just for the three months during which J. D. Power conducted its surveys. He said Chrysler wanted all its customers "to be absolutely satisfied with our products."
Mr. Eaton made his comments at an annual automotive conference held by the University of Michigan here.
On Tuesday, John E. Fernandez, the chief engineer for the Neon program, said Chrysler was using a "three-prong attack" to prepare for the J. D. Power survey.
 
A Wide Plan of Attack
 In addition to focusing on the plant in Belvidere, Ill., where the Neon is built, Chrysler has called in its top suppliers for the car to discuss the J. D Power measurement system, and it has conducted a similar program with its dealers.
Beginning in July, the outside consultant -- which had done other quality work for Chrysler in the last year -- modified Chrysler's internal quality surveys to produce results similar to those used in the J. D. Power survey, Mr. Fernandez said. In remarks similar to Mr. Eaton's, Mr. Fernandez emphasized that any quality changes Chrysler made would benefit all its customers, not just those who bought Neons during the J. D. Power testing period.
Process Development is also helping other Chrysler vehicles prepare for the J.D. Power survey.
The consultant has performed similar quality work for the Ford Motor Company and the General Motors Corporation, said James Pongracz, the owner and chief executive of Process Development.
Mr. Eaton's comments today reflected the tone of the conference, which has been quite sober despite the record quarterly profits announced last month by the three domestic auto makers. For example, Edward Hagenlocker, president of Ford Automotive Operations, warned that the next 10 years would be more difficult for the auto companies than the last 10, during which G.M. and Chrysler endured record losses.
"When the next downturn comes, it's going to be extremely rough," he said. The cyclical nature of the auto industry, he added, is becoming more intense, as regional economies become more closely aligned.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
2 Big Eastern Railroads Said to Discuss Merger

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
Two large Eastern railroads, the Norfolk Southern Corporation and Conrail Inc., are discussing a possible merger, according to people familiar with the companies' plans.
The talks raise anew the possibility that the two railroads would join forces. Norfolk Southern, the fourth-largest railroad in terms of revenue, made its first offer to buy Conrail, currently the fifth-largest railroad, in 1984 for $1.2 billion, and pulled its final offer to buy the railroad for $1.9 billion in 1986 in part because of a six-month impasse in getting approval for its offer from the House of Representatives. 
 The Federal Government, which owned Conrail at the time, eventually sold the railroad in an initial public offering.
 
 
Consolidation Trend
 A merger of the two railroads, with combined revenues of $7.1 billion, would add to a consolidation trend that has reshaped the rail industry since it was deregulated in 1980. To cut costs, many railroads have merged to achieve economies of scale and more efficient operations.
If an agreement is reached, the combined railroad would operate track that stretches from Boston to New Orleans, and from Chicago to Jacksonville, Fla.
Spokesmen for Conrail and Norfolk Southern declined to comment on the talks, which were first reported yesterday in The Journal of Commerce.
Stocks of both railroads surged early yesterday on the news, but after a day of heavy trading, shares of Conrail ended $2.25 higher at $56.50, while Norfolk Southern's stock fell 12.5 cents a share, to $63.625.
 
 
'Makes Sense'
 Scott Flower, a transportation analyst at Kidder, Peabody, said that if an agreement was reached, it would likely be a stock swap. As the on-again, off-again courtship of these railroads suggests, a merger "makes sense for all sorts of reasons," Mr. Flower added.
Besides their extended geographic reach, both railroads are large carriers of coal and have big interests in "intermodalism," a rapidly growing part of the industry in which railroads carry truck trailers over long distances to destinations where they are then delivered by local drivers.
Two large railroad mergers were announced in recent weeks. In late June, Burlington Northern Inc. and the Santa Fe Pacific Corporation announced a plan to merge in a stock swap valued at $2.7 billion. And two weeks ago, Kansas City Southern Industries said it was selling its railroad business to the Illinois Central Corporation in a stock swap worth about $1.6 billion.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls as Dealers Await Reaction to U.S. Jobs Report

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against other leading currencies yesterday as traders grew edgy ahead of tomorrow's report on July employment in the United States.
A strong employment report could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates, giving the dollar a boost. But if the report also raises fears of inflation, it could depress the dollar. 
 "It's a hard call," said Melissa Fairfield, an analyst with Shawmut Bank said.
Traders noted that the dollar plunged after the last three interest rate increases from the Fed because prices of fixed-income securities were hurt, setting off a flight of capital out of the United States.
Ms. Fairfield said it was unclear whether investors would "buy dollars on a strong number" for July employment, since this had proved to be a bad bet in the past.
"People may want to see how the dollar reacts rather than try to get ahead of the market because it is so difficult to read," she added.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 100.31 Japanese yen, down from 100.36 yen on Tuesday. The dollar slipped to 1.5758 German marks from 1.5835 marks.
A survey shows economists anticipate that 204,000 nonfarm jobs were added to payrolls in July, down from 379,000 in June. Job creation averaged 287,000 a month in the first six months of the year.
The Fed's latest survey of business conditions around the country, known as the beige book, showed solid business expansion with some pockets of weakness and higher commodity prices. An improving labor market resulted in some wage increases.
Anthony J. Vignola, chief economist of Kidder, Peabody & Company, said the report meant that "we have not ended the Fed tightening cycle," though the report itself was not a reason for the Fed to raise rates.
"There is no question that the 125- basis-point increase in the funds rate is not enough to reverse the trend of this economic expansion," Mr. Vignola said. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent. So far this year, the Fed has raised short-term lending rates to 4.25 percent from 3 percent.
He predicted that an increase of 300,000 payroll jobs would cause the Fed to increase the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans by at least a quarter-point when its policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets on Aug. 16.
The dollar did not react to two other economic reports released yesterday, which delivered no surprise. The June index of leading indicators rose two-tenths of 1 percent, and June factory orders rose eight-tenths of 1 percent.
In other currency trading in New York yesterday, the British pound edged up to $1.5423, from $1.5352 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Recalling history, analysts in Tokyo are cool to Japan Tobacco.

BYLINE: By James Sterngold 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
IF there is one thing that stock market experts tend to understand, with their obsession for charts and tables, it is stock market history.
And that may be one reason that analysts here have been decidedly cool to what will be the biggest event to reach the Tokyo Stock Exchange in the last year, the initial public offering of Government-owned Japan Tobacco Inc., one of the world's largest cigarette companies. 
 The Finance Ministry will begin the two-step process of auctioning off J T, as it is known, later this month, and trading is scheduled to start on Oct. 27. That will be a year and a day after trading began in the shares of the last Government-owned company to go public, Japan East Railway.
It is an ill omen: Trading in J R East, as it is called, was so chaotic that it blacked out the stock exchange's computers, while driving down the overall market by 4 percent in three days.
The debacle was worsened because on the first day of trading the share price soared inexplicably, allowing the Government to dump an additional $3.4 billion of shares on the market at inflated prices; afterward the price plunged.
No matter. The Finance Ministry is sticking to its schedule, prompting many here to buckle their seat belts.
By most measures, J T is a company of questionable promise. For decades it held a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in Japan, where more than 60 percent of men smoke.
American trade negotiators opened the market to foreign brands in the 1980's, and since J T's market share has dropped to 82 percent, and the market is shrinking.
Kyoko Matsuyama and Eizo Uchikura, analysts with Goldman, Sachs (Japan), said J T would continue to lose one-half to one percentage point of market share every year. "We basically think this is not a growing company," Ms. Matsuyama said.
One strength in the past was that since the Government controlled the cigarette business, there were virtually no serious studies here of the effects of smoking, and little information was made public. But that may be changing. The first antismoking ad was shown on television recently, and lung cancer recently leaped into first place as the leading killer among cancers in Japan, raising the public's concern.
But the Government still protects J T's profit margins by regulating what retailers can charge for cigarettes; discounting is illegal. "That's why this company should be regarded as a utility," said Takefumi Suzuki, an analyst with Baring Securities. He added that it had used some of its excess cash -- it has some $3 billion on its books -- to try to develop new businesses like pharmaceuticals.
"Frankly, I think that will take 10 years or more to break even," Mr. Suzuki said.
But analysts say something interesting could happen with supply and demand.
The Finance Ministry has said it will sell one-third of J T's two million shares. Ms. Matsuyama and Mr. Uchikura of Goldman, Sachs said that because the company was not expected to post any growth, it was best valued through its assets. The fair market value, they said, is about $8,000 a share.
But they and other analysts said they were expecting an initial price of $10,000 a share, and that it could soar well above that.
The reason is that many big Japanese investors may have to buy the stock, because of pressure from the Finance Ministry and because investors who own huge portfolios that approximate the overall market's makeup cannot avoid holding what will be one of the most heavily capitalized companies on the exchange.
With a limited supply, even modest demand can push the price up and, analysts worry, create a repeat of last year's turmoil on the exchange.
"We could easily have a similar price movement to last year," said Shigeru Aoki, an analyst here with Jardine Fleming Securities. "With the supply so limited, you could have a 50 percent rise at the opening. I'm not sure they've prepared for that."

Why a trade dispute over roses is turning into a perennial.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
ACCORDING to Gertrude Stein, a rose is a rose is a rose. But not according to the Department of Commerce, which is on the prowl for imports that unfairly compete with American Beauties. And while it's easy to make light of the latest charges that Colombian growers are "dumping" millions of dollars worth of flowers in Miami and points north, the Colombians aren't laughing.
Nor should American consumers, suggests Robert Z. Lawrence of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. For the case illustrates much of what economists think is askew in America's anti-dumping laws. "The whole thing's a travesty," Mr. Lawrence concludes. 
 On five occasions in the last eight years, the Colombians have been accused by domestic growers of selling cut flowers below fair value. And on all five occasions the Commerce Department has exacted only token penalties. Dumping duties have ranged from 1 to 5 percent -- sums too small to undermine Colombia's competitive position. Why, then, are the domestic rose growers trying again?
One possibility, suggests Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, is that harassment by domestic producers is implicitly encouraged by the trade laws. Even dumping accusations with little legal merit are expensive to defend against, he notes, and Government procedures for calculating fair value are so arbitrary that bizarre outcomes are not unknown.
Another is that American flower growers are likely to find a more receptive audience in Washington these days. Previous cases were brought during the tenures of Presidents Reagan and Bush, who were sympathetic to Colombia's efforts to export something besides coffee and cocaine. This time around, Colombia won't be able to count on help from the White House.
For one thing, President Clinton is loath to offend Congress before it blesses the GATT agreement. For another, Colombia is in the diplomatic doghouse these days because it is making noises about concluding a separate peace with the drug cartel.
However dubious, the Colombian rose case does offer an example of how far the American anti-dumping law has strayed from its economic rationale.
To economists, "dumping" means exporting below the price charged in the home market. That can offend in either of two ways: The domestic price may be above cost, implying that the seller is a monopolist gouging the folks back home. Or the export price may be below cost, raising the prospect that the exporter is trying to knock out the competition and then exploit its ill-gotten monopoly power.
But American law doesn't require the Commerce Department to find that the export price is below the home price. All that is necessary to prove dumping is evidence that the foreigners are exporting below their cost of production.
Sounds simple, but it is complicated enough to keep hundreds of lawyers up to date on their BMW payments. Consider the issue of what export price to use to compare with cost. Should it be the average price over a day? A month? A year? Or should it be the price in any single transaction -- the definition favored by plaintiffs, who speak darkly of "rifle dumping" in which foreigners sell, say, 999 tons of steel above cost in order to sneak in one ton below cost.
The domestic industry argues that the Colombians sell roses below average costs during the summer. But so, of course, do domestic growers who make a killing around Valentine's Day and take whatever they can get off-season.
"If dumping assessments based on daily or monthly prices have any logic," Mr. Hufbauer concludes, it is only for goods that can be held as inventories.
Then there is the matter of computing foreigners' costs, a rat's maze of conceptual problems even where companies maintain solid financial data. To finesse the accounting issue with Colombian roses, the Commerce Department could fall back on the traditional definition of dumping. But since there is effectively no home market for Colombian flowers, the department is considering using the price of Colombian roses sold in Europe as its benchmark.
The catch there, however, is that the Colombians sell only token numbers outside the United States. And to avoid being judged by European prices, the Colombians are apparently prepared to end all rose exports to Europe. The result, ironically, would be an increase in exports to the Colombians' real market, the United States.
Could the anti-dumping laws be fixed? "You'll never get a level playing field as long as there is one set of rules for domestic production and one for imports," Mr. Lawrence argues.
The free trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand, he points out, requires each country to treat the other's producers exactly like its own. As a practical matter, that means integrating the anti-dumping laws into antitrust laws prohibiting predatory pricing against competitors, domestic or foreign.
An impossible dream for America and its trading partners? Not for optimists like Mr. Lawrence, who believes Americans will one day figure out that the gain would more than offset the pain.

HEADLINE: Right and Wrong on Trade

 BODY:
This was the week for the Clinton Administration to play tough on trade. It threatened to retaliate unless Japan reversed government procurement policies that discriminate against exports of U.S. telecommunications and medical equipment. And it bludgeoned Canada into agreeing to reduce wheat exports to the U.S. for a year while a commission reviews an ongoing dispute about such exports.
The fighting stance toward Japan is justified, though the Administration threatens to carry it to excess. The decision to shut out Canadian wheat, by contrast, amounts to an assault on U.S. consumers -- the price of Mr. Clinton's promise to bail out Midwestern farmers whose support he desperately needed in Congress to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 Government purchasers in Japan blatantly discriminate against U.S. equipment manufacturers -- perhaps because Japanese companies bribe local officials. Whatever the cause, the solution is for government procurers to adopt open bidding and contract procedures that would expose underhanded deals. So far, the Japanese have refused to do so -- which justifies the Administration's threats.
Yet even if the Japanese were to concede on procedural issues, the dispute would not end because Mr. Clinton is fixated on getting the Japanese to swallow numerical targets to measure compliance. For example, he wants Japan's Government to increase purchases from U.S. equipment manufacturers by a substantial amount over the next several years. The Japanese are dead set against numerical targets, which they label managed trade that violates free-trade principles.
But their resistance is misplaced; government purchases are not controlled by market forces. What the Japanese probably fear, no doubt correctly, is that if they feed Mr. Clinton's appetite for numerical targets for government purchases, he will extend the idea to areas where it ought not to apply -- to private markets like auto parts. The important point for Mr. Clinton to absorb is that the meager economic gains to be had by winning numerical targets are not worth risking a trade war.
There is considerably less merit to keeping out Canadian wheat. U.S. imports are high because of misguided policies that keep land out of production and subsidize the sale of U.S. wheat production abroad. Canadian wheat fills the void. By keeping Canadian wheat out, Mr. Clinton would drive up consumer prices of commodities like pasta.
The best outcome would be for the Canadian wheat deal to last only the one obligatory year and for Mr. Clinton to impose sanctions on Japan only to win more open procurement procedures. But there is little reason to expect the best. In trade disputes, as well as in its legislation to institute the Uruguay Round international trade agreement, the Administration has been all too willing to buy off powerful domestic manufacturers.

HEADLINE: You Call This Scam Health-Care Reform?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A July 25 front-page article describes the millstones burdening Hillary Rodham Clinton as she campaigns across the country for health care reform. We're advised, Don't even think about a single-payer plan or a Canadian-style plan: they are as dead as socialized medicine. 
 This message is not really new. The spineless Washington representatives of teacher groups have dunned us with that message since the medical and health insurance lobbies compromised to give us emergency-care insurance in the late 1950's.
The millions of dollars reaching those lobbies and Government leaders have paid off. Many Americans are persuaded that single-payer plans are just not "politically feasible" for the foreseeable future. The government leaders who have been paid off are quick to tell us that what we want is to retain our choice of doctors. No. What we really want is competent doctors who have to provide good health care for all.
They're quick to insist that what we want is portability of insurance. No. What we really want is health care wherever we are, whenever we need it. Too many insist that we really want extended care. Wrong again. The poor and the middle class will settle for limited care because it is so much more than we now have.
Government spokesmen insist on quibbling over what universal coverage means, but not one of them mentions John, the street person in my neighborhood, who is typical of millions in this country who are unemployed and neglected by the health care system and by every politically feasible reform plan, even though the habits of most such outcasts constitute a clear and present danger to the health of all of us.
We are being asked to settle for more of the same. The Democrats have lost their will. The Republicans have all but declared victory. With the Democrats, they make ready to announce health care reform that will continue the present system.
Yet it's not too late. The Clintons have done the country a great service by introducing health care reform. They want good health care for every American. They made their position clear at the start and then declared their faith in the political system. Maybe it's that faith in the political system that needs re-evaluation.
What's being offered as reform now is nothing but more money in the pocket of insurance representatives, lawyers, doctors and pharmacists. It is the present system with higher rates to pay off the lobby interests.
It's time for the Clintons to repeat the words of their original challenge to the country. Let's make health care available to every American who needs it. Let's put government
controls on health costs and raise taxes to pay for phasing in a single-payer plan.

Chase Sets $348 Million Acquisition

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Bank said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire American Residential Holdings for $348 million, or $28.25 a share, in another sign of contraction within the mortgage banking industry prompted by rising interest rates.
Following the announcement, American Residential shares set a 52-week high in Nasdaq trading at $28, before ending at $27.75, up $2.875. 
 The acquisition of the company, whose wholly owned subsidiary the American Residential Mortgage Corporation originates, sells and services first-home mortgages, would give Chase a total mortgage portfolio of $11.5 billion. Based on figures from the first half of the year, that would make Chase the nation's fourth-largest mortgage lender, a move up from No. 7. The deal also goes a long way toward making good on a pledge by Chase, the nation's fifth-largest banking company, to become one of the country's top three mortgage lenders by 1997.
American Residential, based in La Jolla, Calif., generated $4.4 billion in mortgages in the year's first half and services a $15.4 billion portfolio. Fees are earned by the company for collecting monthly payments and passing them on to investors, as well as handling delinquencies and foreclosures.
The company, which had its start in 1983 as the mortgage banking arm of the Imperial Savings and Loan Association, now defunct, earned $5.9 million, a 3 percent decline, in the quarter ended March 31.
"Strategically, it appears the two companies fit very well," Thomas P. Hanley, a banking analyst from CS First Boston, said.
Most of Chase's mortgage loans have been to affluent customers needing "jumbo" loans of $203,000 or more. Most of American Residential's clients required smaller loans.
"So it's not just volume, it's a different type of customer," Mr. Hanley said, giving the bank an opportunity to cross-sell its services.
Mortgage bankers enjoyed a boom in refinancing business in 1992 and 1993 as homeowners rushed to lock in low interest rates. That cycle peaked in October as 30-year rates on fixed mortgages then began to rise. The number of new loans written this year is expected to fall as much as 40 percent.
"It's going to be a punishing year," John M. Robbins, the chairman and chief executive of American Residential, said. As mortgage banking companies are forced to lay off employees and shrink their operations, lower earnings and depressed stock prices will follow, he said.
With that in mind, Mr. Robbins said a decision was made this spring to sell the company at a time when banking companies are scrambling to improve their market share for mortgages and bolster noninterest fee income. Last month, for example, the Chemical Banking Corporation paid $330 million for the Margaretten Financial Corporation.
"Virtually all the public mortgage companies are in play," said Guy D. Cecala, editor and publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a weekly trade publication. "We're still in the early stages of the trend."
Capturing a mortgage banker with a branch system also serves as a toehold for a bank seeking to expand interstate banking operations, said Gareth Plank, an analyst for Mabon Securities in San Francisco.

HEADLINE: SERBIA ISOLATING ALLIES IN BOSNIA

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The President of Serbia announced today that most political and economic links with Serbian nationalist rebels in Bosnia were being severed because the Bosnian Serbs had rejected an international plan for ending the war here.
In a statement this morning, the Government of Yugoslavia, the rump state made up of Serbia and Montenegro and dominated by Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, announced that it would bar Bosnian Serb leaders from entering Serbia and ban all trade with Serb-controlled parts of Bosnia except for shipments of food and medicine. [Excerpts, page A9.] 
 If enforced, the moves would isolate the Bosnian Serbs' self-declared state and most of the territories in Croatia that were seized by rebel Serbs there in 1991. The cutoff could also produce a feud between Serbs loyal to Mr. Milosevic and confirmed nationalists who accuse him of selling out their dream of a Greater Serbia combining all territories inhabited by Serbs.
Similar threats have been made before, and in May 1993 the Belgrade Government even claimed that it had cut off arms and fuel shipments to the Bosnian Serbs. But that embargo was soon seen to be a charade by Serbia in an effort to weaken support for international economic sanctions, which have damaged Serbia's economy.
Given Serbia's record, skepticism about the sincerity of Mr. Milosevic's remarks was widespread among Bosnian Government officials and representatives of the five foreign powers that drew up the latest peace plan. Some also questioned whether Mr. Milosevic has the political strength to cut off the Bosnian Serbs.
But Western diplomats in Belgrade said tonight that they had received reports that the Serbian authorities had stopped civilian traffic through some of the dozens of border crossings to Bosnia. Journalists reported seeing a stepped-up Serbian police presence on the border.
"It looks as though they have closed the borders pretty tightly," said a Western diplomat in Belgrade.
In his remarks today, the Serbian President was scathing in his condemnation of the Bosnian Serb leaders, describing them as "war profiteers" and "insane with political ambitions and greed."
"Their decision to reject peace cannot be in the interest of the people by any criteria of truth and justice," he said. "It can only be in the interest of war profiteers and in the interest of those people whose conscience is not clear, who are afraid of peace."
 
Muslims Accept Peace Plan
 The peace plan, which has already been accepted by the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government, was drawn up by the United States, Russia, France, Germany and Britain. They warned Belgrade that it would face punitive measures, including tightened economic sanctions as a first step, if the rebel Serbs in Bosnia turned down the proposal. The plan would force them to recognize Bosnia and Herzegovina's sovereignty and give up control of a third of the 70 percent of Bosnia's territory they have seized.
The Belgrade Government has been a major military backer of the Bosnian Serb rebels since before they started the war here in April 1992. In an unusual acknowledgement, Mr. Milosevic said today that the Bosnian Serb state "would not survive" without aid from Serbia.
The Yugoslav Army's top generals, who sent troops and war materiel to the Bosnian Serbs, expressed grave misgivings about the peace plan last month. The head of Yugoslavia's customs office, a close associate of Mr. Milosevic, has been linked with supplying arms to rebel Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia.
 
Sincerity Questioned
 "The fear now is that those quarters who want to believe that Milosevic is sincere will have plenty of ammunition to say he is a peacemaker and let's nominate him for the Nobel Prize and lift the sanctions," another Western diplomat said. "There are plenty of people who want to believe this. But we have no evidence whatsoever to believe that it is true.
"Let Milosevic give diplomatic recognition to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Let him agree to put international monitors on the border crossings leading into Bosnia and Herzegovina from Serbia."
The United Nations Security Council imposed the economic sanctions against Yugoslavia in May 1992 in retaliation for the military and economic support for the rebel Serbs.
Embargo violations, especially by Russia, Macedonia and Greece, have rendered the trade sanctions a dead letter. But an international freeze on some of Serbia's assets abroad, isolation from the world banking sector and the shutdown of Belgrade's airport have hamstrung much of the country's most important industries.
Vitaly I. Churkin, Russia's special envoy to the Bosnian peace talks, said Serbia might be able to avoid tougher sanctions by cutting the Bosnian Serbs' umbilical cord.
 
Referendum Criticized
 Mr. Milosevic's statement said, referring to the Bosnian Serbs, "They are rejecting peace at the moment that their Serbian Republic has been recognized over half of Bosnia and Herzegovina's territory, and when their acceptance of peace would bring about the lifting of sanctions against those without whom they cannot exist."
"They have called a referendum to make the citizenry responsible for a state policy about which they have not been consulted and which the citizens did not pursue," the statement said, blasting a decision Wednesday night by the Bosnian Serbs' "parliament" to hold a referendum on the peace plan on Aug. 27 and 28.
Mr. Milosevic rose to power by whipping up Serbian nationalist passions and made the "defense of endangered Serbs outside Serbia" the hallmark of his platform since 1988.
In recent weeks, however, he has tried to strengthen his grip on political power by singling out scapegoats in Serbian political life as well as its military and police to take responsibility for the country's complicity in the 1991 war in Croatia and the Bosnian war, which began in April 1992.
In a letter to Serbian leaders across the border, the Bosnian Serbs' parliament wrote that it was "insulted" by Mr. Milosevic's threats to sever ties. "For the first time in 500 years, Serbs west of the Drina River are free," the letter says. "We defended ourselves and you."
 
'Serbian National Idea' Cited
 "By accepting this plan, we would be accepting the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina," the letter says of the peace plan. "This would be an end of the peace of mind of the Serbs and the Serbian national idea."
Rebel Serb leaders in Bosnia and the Serbs' "parliament" in Croatia called again today for the unification of their lands with Serbia.
After Wednesday night's meeting, the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, said the weeks before the referendum would allow the five countries who drew up the peace plan to make adjustments, including territorial concessions to the Serbs. Dr. Karadzic also warned Serbs in Bosnia that he might be forced to declare a state of war and impose rationing.
Diplomats from the five drafting countries have denounced the referendum as a waste of time.

HEADLINE: Pollster Advises Democrats: Don't Be Too Close to Clinton

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Acknowledging that the Democrats face a grim political environment this fall, President Clinton's pollster is advising that those seeking re-election should emphasize their own records rather than link themselves too closely to Mr. Clinton or even their own party. He also recommends that they make crime the central issue, not health care or the economy.
While the pollster, Stanley Greenberg, stopped short of saying that candidates should distance themselves from the President, his recommendation amounted to a tacit recognition that Mr. Clinton's weaknesses could damage Democrats' prospects in November. It is also at odds with comments by officials like David Wilhelm, the Democratic chairman, who has publicly urged Democrats in Congress to run proudly with their President. 
 "Democrats make gains in this race running on their accomplishments and their agenda to help people at home," Mr. Greenberg wrote in a memorandum titled "Strategic Guide to the 1994 Election."
"There is no reason to highlight these as Clinton or Democratic proposals. Voters want to know that you are fighting to get things done for them, not that you are advancing some national agenda."
The document, obtained from a Democratic organizer, was distributed a month ago to a few Democratic leaders and officials at the White House. Though the memorandum said the Democrats faced "a tough year," it is not entirely downbeat. In fact, it is intended as a blueprint for how Democrats can blunt significant losses in November.
The memorandum is based on extensive interviews and focus groups with voters and candidates in four swing House districts: in a Rocky Mountain state, on the West Coast, in the Deep South and in the Midwest. All are districts where the incumbent Democrat faces "a genuine battle for re-election," it says.
The party that wins the White House almost always suffers serious losses in the next midterm election. The last time the party in power picked up House and Senate seats in the midterm election was in 1934, during the first term of Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat. This year, Democrats are less fearful of losing outright control of the House or Senate than of suffering such large losses that it would be difficult to build winning margins for Administration proposals in the next two years.
"The mood of the election up to this point has energized Republicans and somewhat demoralized Democrats," said Mr. Greenberg, who did not make specific predictions about possible losses. He added, "Obviously, the White House must do more to mobilize Democrats in support of candidates this year."
The notion that incumbents should separate themselves from a President of their own party is nothing new: Some Republican officials gave such advice in 1990, after President Bush agreed to a deal to raise taxes. And in June, Donald Sweitzer, political director for the Democratic Party, told The Washington Times, "There are clearly some areas of the country where it is not going to benefit a candidate to associate himself with Bill Clinton."
Mr. Sweitzer was immediately rebuked by Mr. Wilhelm, the party chairman, for his comments. But Mr. Greenberg offered much the same message, though his memorandum was less explicit.
 
Clinton Support
 Mr. Greenberg also asserted, however, that Republicans would be wrong to try to turn the elections into a referendum on the President because people still want him to get things done. "If the Republicans choose to make this election about stopping Clinton," he said, "they are missing the mood of the electorate in these swing districts, where voters still want to see Clinton succeed."
Incumbents, Mr. Greenberg said, should discuss their legislative battles and emphasize that they were in them "not for Clinton" but "for the people at home."
The memorandum is striking in its acknowledgment that Mr. Clinton's top legislative initiative -- health care -- has not struck a chord with voters. It is not clear from the memorandum why health care has not registered more interest, though some analysts have explained that many people are confused by the issue or fear losing coverage.
But the pollster says health care could help the Democrats if a measure is passed before the elections, Democrats who have heard Mr. Greenberg present his findings said. Mr. Greenberg did not return calls today.
Another major Clinton initiative that is not registering with the voters is a welfare overhaul, but Mr. Greenberg suggested that if such a measure was passed by Congress, it would be of immense help to Democrats.
 
Emphasis on Crime
 The memorandum also advised that candidates emphasize issues, like crime, that have been the province of Republicans. Mr. Greenberg said a campaign message emphasizing the improved economy would backfire because "assertions about economic performance press up against the public's skepticism." The same, he said, would apply to a message of "breaking gridlock," because "Democrats are seen to share in the problem."
Instead, Mr. Greenberg said, the best thing that Democrats can do is portray themselves as independent fighters. That is their best hope, he said, of capturing the "clearly volatile" group of voters who voted for Ross Perot in 1992 -- the group Mr. Greenberg identified as the one the Democrats most need to win back.
"The most important accomplishment in every district is the passage of 'three strikes and you're out,' " he said, referring to a provision in the crime bill, now stalled in Congress, that would impose lifetime prison terms on criminals convicted of a Federal crime who had two previous serious felony convictions, state or Federal. "No other accomplishment even comes close, suggesting that the agenda message should give a more central place to crime. Indeed, crime is an opportunity for Democrats."
After the three-strikes proposal, Mr. Greenberg said, voters are most interested in these issues: the cutting of 250,000 jobs in the Federal bureaucracy, tax relief for working families, tax cuts and incentives for small businesses, the passage of the ban on assault weapons and the Brady bill, which imposes a waiting period on the purchase of handguns.
 
Courting Middle Class
 Mr. Greenberg said Congressional Democrats "have no reason to be defensive or timid but, instead, should take individual ownership of the agenda." He said they would do best, particularly in the South and West, by stressing middle-class issues like tax relief for small businesses and families of moderate income.
In the Rocky Mountain states and in the Midwest, Democrats would fare well with a more reformist message, he said. He advised that incumbents should concentrate on their votes for restrictions on lobbyists and changes in campaign financing law, as well as for voting for "the biggest deficit reduction in history."
While some Democrats argue that it is risky for their party to attack the Republican Party for its growing dependence on people who identify themselves as part of the religious right, Mr. Greenberg called that strategy a sound one.
"The conflict with the radical religious right favors the Democrats in every one of these swing districts," he wrote. "We gave voters a tough choice: 'What is the greater danger -- that the Democrats will pursue policies that undermine family values, like forcing gays into the military, or that the Republicans, backed by extremist religious leaders like Pat Robertson, use the Government to impose their religious beliefs on others?' In every district, voters were more worried about the extremist religious leaders."
Mr. Greenberg also said that taking on people like Mr. Robertson would help "mobilize Democratic-base voters and appeals to independent voters, particularly Perot supporters."


GRAPHIC: President Clinton's pollster, Stanley Greenberg, is advising Democrats seeking re-election to present themselves as independent of Mr. Clinton and the national party. In a memorandum, he offered these hypothetical pitches:
 
WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR
Chart: "STRATEGY: How to Portray Oneself"
 Possible attack a Republican could use against a generic Democratic House incumbent, "Congressman John Smith":
 He is very critical of John Smith for supporting President Clinton's budget and tax program that gave the country the largest tax increase in history. Smith even supported Clinton's proposal to force gays into the military and Clinton's proposed Government takeover of health care that would undermine the quality of care in America. It's time for a change in Washington.
 
WHAT TO SAY
 Depiction that John Smith could give of himself, without mentioning President Clinton:
 Democrat John Smith is an independent fighter for [state]. He's voted to change things in Washington -- backed tough restrictions on lobbying and a tough anti-crime bill. He voted to put our economic house in order -- a bold deficit reduction package that helped produce three years of lower deficits for the first time in 50 years, the highest economic growth in 9 years and three times more jobs than created in the entire 4 years of the Bush Administration. The budget raised taxes for the wealthiest 1 percent, but he fought for the tax cut that gave relief to 30,000 [state] families with modest incomes. Smith is a tough, independent fighter for [state].

DATELINE: BEIJING, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Sol Adler, the United States Treasury Department's representative to China in World War II and a translator of Mao Zedong's works, died of cancer today in Beijing. He was 85.
Mr. Adler had been living in China for more than three decades when he signed up with the Treasury Department. He was recalled to the United States in 1947. 
 He fell victim to the anti-Communist climate in the United States and was subjected to Treasury Department and grand jury investigations for several years before eventually being cleared.
Mr. Adler then left the United States for Britain, the country of his birth, and lost his American citizenship. It was restored in the early 1970's, when Washington opened its first mission in Beijing.
Mr. Adler was also a fellow at the Institute of World Economics in Beijing.

HEADLINE: Auditors Say Poverty Line Should Vary Across Nation

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 31

 BODY:
For decades, the definition of poverty has been uniform throughout the country, but Federal auditors now say the poverty statistics should be adjusted to reflect differences in the cost of living in different areas.
Such a change, suggested recently by auditors from the General Accounting Office, could ultimately increase the flow of Federal money to New York City, Los Angeles, Connecticut and other places where living costs are high. Southern states could lose money if the change occurred. 
 Poverty statistics directly affect the distribution of at least $22 billion a year in Federal money for education, community development, child nutrition and other purposes.
Since the Government began collecting poverty data in the 1960's, it has set the poverty threshold at the same level for the whole country, even though living costs, especially rents, vary widely.
Jerry C. Fastrup, an economist who supervised a recent study of the question by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said, "If you take cost-of-living differences into account, that would give you a better measurement of people in need."
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, a Democrat, and Representative Dean A. Gallo of New Jersey, a Republican, have introduced bills that would require the Census Bureau to adjust poverty data to take into account geographical differences in the cost of living. The measures are fiercely opposed by members of Congress from Sunbelt states.
 
Getting Started
 While Congress seems unlikely to pass the bills this year, the proposals have focused new attention on the issue. Instead of an overall change, lawmakers could end up revising the Federal aid formulas for specific programs to reflect regional differences in the cost of living.
The White House Office of Management and Budget has not taken a stand on the question. The officials who know most about the issue, Census Bureau experts, agree that the poverty statistics should be adjusted.
At present, the Federal poverty level is the same for all families of a particular size. A family of four was classified as poor last year if it had cash income less than $14,764, whether the family lived in New York City or Tunica, Miss.
Under the bills introduced by Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Gallo, the Census Bureau would develop a poverty threshold for each state and people with incomes below that threshold would be counted as poor.
Members of Congress from Sunbelt states acknowledge that there may be theoretical justifications for adjusting the data. But they argue that states like Connecticut have less need for Federal aid because they have more wealth and can raise revenue from taxpayers more easily than states like Mississippi and Alabama.
"States with limited resources and lower tax bases would lose money to wealthier states with greater resources and higher tax bases," said Senator Thad Cochran, the Mississippi Republican who is co-chairman of the Congressional Sunbelt Caucus.
 
Question of Fairness
 The General Accounting Office agreed that, for the sake of fairness, new Federal aid formulas ought to take into account states' ability to raise revenue from their own taxpayers, as well as local living costs.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, a longtime student of social policy, said that to him it was obvious that "you should adjust the poverty index for the cost of living." When that is done, he said, "the results are quite startling." A larger number of New Yorkers are classified as poor, he explained, and the state's poverty rate rises to a level not too far below that of Mississippi.
Dowell Myers, a demographer at the University of Southern California, said: "The current poverty measure is indefensible. It doesn't show what's happening to real people in real places. Rents in the Northeast and in California are more than twice as high as rents in Southern and Plains states. It costs much more to live in a high-rent state than in a low-rent state. But the poverty index doesn't make any distinction."
Daniel H. Weinberg, chief of income and poverty statistics at the Census Bureau, said, "With the poverty rate, you are trying to measure who doesn't have the resources to purchase the necessities of life. If those cost less in Mississippi than in New York City, we should take account of that."
Poverty statistics help determine how much money goes to state and local governments through Federal programs like Head Start, community development block grants, home energy assistance and remedial education for poor children.
Senator Lieberman said, "States like Connecticut, where the cost of living is high, get fewer Federal dollars than they deserve because cost differences are ignored. Other states, where the cost of living is low, get more than they deserve."
Paul A. Armknecht, Assistant Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the current version of the Consumer Price Index was intended to measure price changes at the national level, not local differences in the cost of living.
The Government samples prices around the country, but it does not have enough data to make a reliable estimate of the cost of living in each state and does not systematically collect data on prices in rural areas. In calculating the Consumer Price Index for the nation as a whole, the Government collects information on prices in 44 urban areas.
Using economic models rather than data, Mr. Armknecht said, differences in prices for food, clothing and housing in the 44 urban areas could be estimated. That could provide a useful guide to regional differences in living costs because food, clothing and housing account for nearly half of all consumer spending, he said.
In general, Federal data show that the Northeast has higher prices than the Midwest or the South. Within each region, urban areas generally have higher prices than rural areas.
Patricia Ruggles, an economist who has written a book about poverty statistics, "Drawing the Line" (Urban Institute Press, 1990), said: "The evidence for real differences in price levels across regions has become too compelling to ignore."
Ms. Ruggles said problems could arise if one poverty threshold was used for a region, because living costs can vary substantially within a region. For example, in the Northeast, prices are higher in New York and Boston than in Pittsburgh or, for that matter, Skowhegan, Me.
"The Government needs to collect more data, especially in rural areas," she said.


GRAPHIC: The Government does not systematically analyze regional differences in the cost of living, but a few private organizations try to do so.
Map/Table: "SNAPSHOT: The Cost of Living, State by State"
 The research department of the American Federation of Teachers has devised this index (shown) using Goverment data from 1992. The index measures the cost of living in each state, relative to a national average of 100.
 The American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association has devised a similar index to measure differences in living costs among urban areas. The data, from 1993 were collected by local chambers of commerce. Some examples are shown at the end of the table.
 Below, how the cost-of-living index in each state relates to the national average.

The carrot-and-stick proposals would be to punish Serbia if it fails to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to accept the latest international peace plan for Bosnia, or to reward the Serbs if their diplomatic efforts are successful. 
 One of the two versions, which United Nations officials said were drafted by representatives of the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia, would reinvigorate sanctions that were imposed on Serbia and Montenegro in 1992, but which have been increasingly violated.
Provisions under consideration for the new sanctions package are a virtual blockade on traffic headed to Serbia on the Danube River, a major route for oil imports. Also under consideration are a freeze on a wide range of Serbian financial assets, and even a limit on the amount of fuel that trucks entering Serbia could carry in their gas tanks.
 
Announcement by Belgrade
 Demands for even stricter sanctions against Serbia may be undercut by Belgrade's announcement today that it was withdrawing economic and political support for the Bosnian Serbs. But the harsher version could be introduced if the Security Council doubts the sincerity of the announcement from Belgrade.
One diplomat here said that many of his colleagues remained unconvinced of the sincerity of the announcement from Belgrade and that the formal introduction of the harsher resolution might be the better choice because it would pressure Serbia to make good on its announced intentions.
But the Russian representative, Yuli M. Vorontsov, said after the announcement from Belgrade that he considered the new Serbian position to be a possible "turning point" in efforts to bring about peace in Bosnia.
The Security Council will also seek to sort out its options on the United Nations peacekeeping force in Bosnia, probably early next week.
 
Withdrawal of U.N. Force
 Last month, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali suggested that the Security Council should seriously consider whether the United Nations forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be withdrawn in the event of peace there. He said he felt that only the major powers could enforce a peace accord.
The peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, Croatia and Macedonia are costing more than $2 billion a year, an enormous drain on United Nations financial resources.

Warning on Arms Embargo
 WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 (Special to The New York Times) President Clinton's chief of staff seemed to signal a shift in the Administration's Bosnia policy today, warning that the United States will ultimately defy an arms embargo in the region if the Serbs reject the latest negotiated peace.
But Mr. Clinton's press spokeswoman later said the Administration's policy of grudging compliance with the embargo is unchanged. She said the real threat to lift the arms ban comes from Congress, which increasingly believes the embargo gives the Serbs a military advantage and may well direct Mr. Clinton to ignore it.
Leon Panetta, Mr. Clinton's new chief of staff, appeared to align the White House with Congress's growing displeasure in an interview with broadcast reporters this morning.
"If we don't get agreement by the Serbs and they continue to fight this issue," he said, "then ultimately we will seek a multilateral lifting of the embargo, and if necessary, a unilateral lifting of the embargo."
Mr. Panetta said the United States would not take those actions until it had "put maximum pressure on them" to accept the peace terms.

HEADLINE: Pentagon Worries About Cost of Aid Missions

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Defense Secretary William J. Perry warned today that the military's relief mission for Rwanda was bleeding the Pentagon's budget and threatening combat readiness.
"We're an army, not a Salvation Army," Mr. Perry told the House Appropriations subcommittee on military spending, where he went hat in hand today to ask for $270 million more in emergency aid for Rwanda. 
 Without the extra allotment and approval to shift money from other accounts, Mr. Perry warned, some tank divisions would have to stop buying spare parts, the Atlantic fleet could only do emergency aircraft-engine repairs and a major Army command in Atlanta would have to dismiss temporary civilian workers.
 
Plea for Patience on Haiti
 The Secretary also discussed Haiti, and acknowledged that economic sanctions so far have had "very little effect" on forcing the military regime to step down. But, he said, the new ban on commercial flights into Haiti, tighter restrictions on Haitians' assets abroad and stricter enforcement along the border with the Dominican Republic should be given "some weeks" to work.
Mr. Perry's main goal today was to win support for the $270 million that President Clinton asked for on Friday. The money would be used to establish and operate airports, provide safe water and provide logistical support to United States forces in Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire. Mr. Perry said the money was for costs estimated through Sept. 30.
Senior civilian Pentagon officials and top field commanders have expressed increasing alarm that the costs of peacekeeping and relief missions are straining their declining budget and imperiling the Pentagon's main goal: to be prepared to fight two regional wars nearly simultaneously.
Mr. Perry reiterated the Administration's position that the United States would support a United Nations peacekeeping operation in Rwanda but would not directly take part. And he said that if widespread killing resumed, the United States would withdraw.
 
A Short Stay Predicted
 "We do not plan to put in military forces to enforce the stability in the area," Mr. Perry said. "Therefore, in that case, we would have to pull out."
He also said the United States relief mission would be brief.
"We're there for emergency humanitarian aid, and as soon as the operation is up and running, we want to get out and turn things over to the relief agencies," he said. Mr. Perry has said the United States involvement would last less than a year.
Mr. Perry, who was accompanied by Gen. John M. D. Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and John Hamre, the Pentagon comptroller, also heard concerns from lawmakers that relief operations could reduce combat readiness.
"We're desperately concerned about readiness being eroded by all these concerns," said Representative John P. Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat, who heads the subcommittee.
General Shalikashvili said he had ordered a review of the deployment of certain units in high demand, like C-130 cargo plane crews and Marine expeditionary forces, to determine if "we're running them ragged."
 
Trying to Seal a Border
 Mr. Perry's remarks on Haiti reinforced views he voiced on Tuesday in a meeting of senior national security advisers. At the meeting, Mr. Perry said the United States should fully explore all options for forcing out Haiti's military leaders before resorting to an invasion, Administration officials said.
American intelligence analysts here and in Haiti have expressed skepticism that tighter sanctions, which clearly hurt the country's poor people, are pinching the pocketbooks of the elite and the military rulers.
"The embargo to date has had a very limited effect on the regime or the elites," Mr. Perry said. "We've been very effective in blocking goods coming by sea. Meantime the back door is wide open to goods coming in through the Dominican Republic. Until that back door is closed, sanctions can't be that effective."
The Pentagon said this week that it was sending 6 helicopters, 18 military scouts and several technical experts to the Dominican Republic on Monday to help stop smuggling of fuel. The officials will be part of an international team of 88 observers who are to patrol the 186-mile border under an accord signed Monday between the United States and the Dominican Republic.
"The Dominican Republic will also be continuing to patrol, and this will be in addition to that," a Pentagon spokesman, Dennis R. Boxx, told reporters today. "Smugglers will not know precisely where the observers are going to be. They will be moving, and hopefully that'll help add a little mystery to it."

HEADLINE: Auto Stocks Lead Market In a Selloff

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The stock market sagged under the weight of a selloff in auto stocks yesterday after total sales from Detroit's Big Three auto makers came in weaker than expected on Wednesday. The July sales were the lowest annual rate in 10 months.
Market analysts said the drop in auto sales might have caused investors to be concerned that the corporate profits of companies in segments like autos, building products and semiconductors could peak sooner than expected. 
 Moreover, traders became defensive ahead of today's jobs data, waiting to see if the numbers confirmed a modest growth scenario, one that would ease the immediate need for some Fed action and higher interest rates. Expectations were for an increase of 200,000 on nonfarm payrolls.
 
 
Bond Market Weakness
 The prospect of a stronger-than-anticipated monthly employment report today that could forecast higher interest rates sometime soon was enough to keep buyers at bay. Weakness in the bond market and the dollar added to the stock market's uneasiness.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 26.87 points, to 3,765.79. With the exception of the American Stock Exchange composite index, which was up 0.76 point, to 441.35, all the other market indicators were off slightly. The Big Board composite index fell 1.31 points, to 253.27. Declining stocks outpaced advancers by 1,188 to 912.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 294.3 million shares, up from 282.4 million shares on Wednesday.
Merrill Lynch stoked investor concern about auto stocks early, citing poor sales performance and higher interest rates before downgrading its rating recommendation on the Big Three. General Motors dropped by 2 1/8, to 50 3/4; Ford Motor declined 2, to 29 1/2, and Chrysler fell 1 3/4, to 45 5/8.
Lawrence R. Rice, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross, said that autos were the key to market weakness, and that they in turn caused issues tied closely to the sector, like steel, to drop.
"The market's breadth, which had held all day, became more pronounced to the downside at the end," he said. "People were anticipating a rally that did not materialize. There was just too much weakness too early in the session to overcome, especially ahead of the jobs data."
Some stocks which managed to turn in some good results included Best Buy up 2 3/4, to 27 1/4, on modest retail sales gains in July, and Circuit City, up 1 3/8, to 22 1/2.
"I.B.M., which has been bucking the trend and has been a very good performer of late after a decent second quarter, has not given ground since," Mr. Rice said. Yesterday, I.B.M. stock rose 3/8, to 63 1/8.
A weaker-than-expected economic report today, he said, would help bonds and that would help stocks.
Takeover stocks continued to interest investors. While Norfolk Southern and Conrail have declined to comment on reports that they are negotiating a merger, analysts believe the report could help railroad stocks generally. Shares of Norfolk Southern closed down 1/2, to 63 1/8, while those of Conrail fell 1 1/2, to 55.
Other talked-about takeover candidates included American Cyanamid, following a $95-a-share bid by American Home Products. Speculation quickly spread to other issues like Warner-Lambert, up 2 1/8, to 74 3/8; Schering-Plough, down 1, to 66 5/8, and Amgen, down 3/8, to 50 3/4.
Unitrin, which initially rose in Nasdaq trading on news of a $2.6 billion cash takeover bid from American General, was down 2, to 46 3/4 at the close.
QVC was up 3/4 for the day at 44 3/4 on expectations of a sweetened offer from Comcast and Liberty Media. The offer, according to The Wall Street Journal, was $46 a share.
General Electric dropped 1 1/8, to 48 1/2, as investors refocused their attention on the securities trading scandal at the company's Kidder, Peabody subsidiary.

HEADLINE: White House Cites Economy To Bolster Clinton's Ratings

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
Stepping up its campaign to bolster President Clinton's sagging public standing, the White House today paraded out eight top economic officials who touted their agencies' accomplishments over the last year and a half.
President Clinton highlighted the economy's performance in the opening statement of his prime time news conference on Wednesday, the third of his term. Administration officials said this evening that he would hold another news conference in the Rose Garden on Friday morning just to discuss the economy. 
 They predicted that the President would focus on the July employment figures, which the Labor Department is scheduled to issue early Friday morning. Independent economists say the report could show that employment has risen by four million jobs since he took office, half the eight million jobs that Mr. Clinton had promised to create during his first term.
Several of the eight officials at today's news briefing on their agencies' records expressed frustration that the Administration has not received more credit for the nation's strong economic growth, low inflation and falling unemployment.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, came the closest to blaming the news media for not paying enough attention to the economy's health or to the role that White House policies may have played in the current economic expansion.
"If the economy were in trouble right now, I am sure that there would be a lot of observation to the effect that the Clinton Administration strategy was totally responsible," Ms. Tyson said when asked whether the Administration had been lucky, rather than skillful, in its handling of the economy.
"So in a sense I feel like I should start by saying I will take as much credit -- we will, the President will, the Administration will -- take as much credit for the current good situation, as I'm sure many of you would cast blame on the Administration if the economy were not performing well," Ms. Tyson said. "That's the first point, and it's actually a correct observation."
Private sector economists have been divided about the extent to which the Administration is responsible for the economy's health. Critics say that the Federal Reserve's low interest rate policy last year played the crucial role while admirers say that White House policies were also important.
These were among the main Administration accomplishments cited by the officials today:
*The halving of the Federal budget deficit as a percentage of economic output -- to a projected 2.4 percent next year from 4.9 percent in 1992.
*Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the negotiation of a new global free trade pact now before Congress.
*Expanded job placement services and retraining for the unemployed.
*Reduced bank regulation to make loans more available to small and medium-sized businesses.
The theme of the current spate of Administration news conferences is the approaching one-year anniversary of Congressional approval of the President's budget-deficit reduction legislation. The Senate passed the legislation on Aug. 6, 1993, with Vice President Al Gore casting the deciding vote.
Despite the strong economy and these programs, the President's approval ratings have been slowly slipping this year, from 54 percent in January to 42 percent in July, according to New York Times/CBS News polls.
 
 
'A Little Puzzled'
 The erosion of support has surprised polltakers. "I've been a little puzzled about why Clinton is doing so poorly given that all the current economic statistics are doing so well," said Fred P. Steeper, a Republican polltaker in Southfield, Mich. "I wish we'd had these numbers for Bush in '92."
One possibility, Mr. Steeper and other experts said, is that the President is getting credit for the economy but that his performance in other areas has dragged down his poll ratings.
Public approval of Mr. Clinton's handling of the economy has stayed almost flat this year, inching up to 43 percent last month from 42 percent in January, a statistically insignificant change, according to New York Times/CBS News polls. But approval of his foreign policies has plunged to 36 percent from 50 percent.
In a short conversation after the briefing in the Old Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House, Ms. Tyson said she had been trying to point out that the American public always blames Administrations for poor performance and that she had not meant to single out reporters for criticism.
 
 
'Extraordinary Job'
 But other officials also voiced frustration at today's news conference, although not quite as forcefully. "I don't think that the President has gotten the credit that he has deserved," Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said. "Any objective analysis of the economic data would have to conclude that this President has done an extraordinary job of leading this country to a period of economic growth and job creation."
Academic analyses of the linkages between economic performance and Presidential popularity have tended to look at changes in the average person's after-tax disposable income, adjusted for inflation. This has risen at an annual rate of 1.9 percent so far in the Clinton Administration, according to Commerce Department figures, compared with four-tenths of 1 percent in the Bush Administration.
John Goodman, the president of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a bipartisan public policy research group in Dallas, said that Americans might be unusually hard to please when the country was coming out of a recession, demanding nothing less than an economic boom and being dissatisfied with any slower growth. "When you come out of bad times, you expect better times," he said.

HEADLINE: David Reichmann, Israeli Executive, 34

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 4

 BODY:
David Reichmann, a member of the Reichmann family of Canada, died on Tuesday near Tel Aviv. He was 34 and lived in Israel.
His lawyer, Yehuda Raveh, said he died of a heart attack. The police found him in his car on the side of the road between Tel Aviv and the suburb of Bnei Brak, said a police spokesman, Gadi Doron. 
 Mr. Reichmann was the son of Ralph Reichman, one of the three Reichmann brothers. The family was reputed to be one of the wealthiest in the world before the collapse of its vast real estate empire in 1992.
The younger Reichmann pulled out of his family's Canary Wharf development project in London four years ago, not long before that project's financial collapse.
He moved to Israel and set up a communications company, Darcom. One of its contracts was to set up the communications link between the American Embassy in Tel Aviv and the State Department in Washington.
Mr. Reichmann studied at Jewish seminaries and contributed to religious institutions in Israel.
In addition to his father, he is survived by his wife and five children.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Fall in Late Trading

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell late yesterday after a Federal Reserve official raised concerns in the bond market that today's employment report might prompt the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates.
The Treasury's 30-year bond fell 8/32 of a point, or $2.50 per $1,000 bond. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 7.40 percent from 7.38 percent. 
 After showing little change for most of the day, bonds dropped after Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in a speech in Salt Lake City, "We can't be certain that any slack remains" in the labor market.
Some traders interpreted Mr. Parry's remarks to mean that if the employment report shows more jobs than expected were created in July, the Fed might raise short-term interest rates to cool off the economy and head off inflationary pressures.
"Ahead of the employment number, the market's very sensitive to any comments like this on employment," said Tony Crescenzi, director of fixed-income trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company.
The Fed has raised the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans four times so far this year to contain inflation. Mr. Parry, a voting member of the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, termed the previous rate increases "appropriate."
Economists estimate that the economy probably added about 200,000 jobs in July, down from 379,000 in June. The unemployment rate is forecast to rise to 6.1 percent from 6 percent a month earlier.
A bigger gain, of about 250,000, "would indicate we would see a pickup in inflation" by the end of the year, said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America.
Inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income securities, is running at an annual rate of 2.5 percent so far this year, down from 2.7 percent for all of last year.
Before Mr. Parry's comments, investors were reluctant to place bets before the employment report. The monthly job survey typically generates the largest market move of any economic indicator, according to a Salomon Brothers study.
Late in the day, Market News Service quoted an unidentified Fed official as dismissing the notion that the central bank was undecided about whether to raise rates again.
Bonds dropped early in the day, then pared their loss, after a report that the number of people applying for first-time jobless benefits unexpectedly dropped last week. Many analysts discounted the jobless claims figure because it may have been skewed by seasonal aberrations.
Still, the Labor Department's report that claims fell by 10,000 to 319,000, the lowest level since February, magnified concern that tomorrow's report will be stronger than expected.
"The economy seems to be doing fine," said Robert McGee, chief economist at Tokai Bank. "If the labor market stays strong, it's hard to see the economy slowing down."
The economy expanded at a 3.7 percent pace during the second quarter, the government said last week.
"There hasn't been a significant amount of slowing," in the economy, said Paul DeNoon, who manages the $1.2 billion Alliance Bond U.S. Government Fund in New York. "The big question is what the underlying rate of growth is."

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE KIDDER SCANDAL: NEWS ANALYSIS;
How Profit Was Created on Paper

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
There were virtually no genuine profitable trades. Joseph Jett, Kidder, Peabody's former bond-trading star, simply made up trades and marked them down as having made money. In the meantime, his few real trades consistently lost money.
Those are the conclusions of Gary G. Lynch's study of the phony profits at Kidder. While the report clears all of those above Mr. Jett, the chief Government bond trader, of knowledge of what was going on, it sharply chastises Kidder as an institution for monumental failures in oversight and systems that kept it from catching on long before it did. 
 The report by Mr. Lynch, former chief of enforcement for the Securities and Exchange Commission and now a partner in the New York law firm of Davis, Polk & Wardwell, confirms the brokerage firm's account of what Mr. Jett did, an account that was given in the days after he was dismissed on April 17.
 
Arbitrage and Fiction
 Mr. Jett seems to have taken advantage of a Kidder accounting system, which allowed him, by simply announcing plans to take two offsetting positions, to post a phony profit. The system would eventually wipe out that false profit, but by then Mr. Jett would have created new, similarly fictitious gains.
He did that, the report says, by alleging activity in a part of the Government bond market that has been around for many years, and whose fundamentals are well understood on Wall Street.
It consists of stripping a Treasury bond -- separating each interest payment and the eventual principal repayment, and selling them separately. Sometimes, when strips are selling for a relatively high price, the practice can be profitable. On the other hand, sometimes it is possible to make money by reconstituting a bond, that is buying all the strips and putting them back together to form a bond. That is known as a "recon" in Wall Street language.
The markets in those bonds are relatively efficient, however, and arbitrage keeps the prices of the strips and the recon close to each other. So the profit to be made in these activities is usually small, and the opportunities fleeting.
A single strip constitutes a Government promise to make a payment in the future. As a result, the price of that strip will rise as the payment date approaches, assuming no change in interest-rate levels. The Kidder accounting system, now changed, allowed Mr. Jett to take credit for whatever part of that inevitable rise he wanted to claim. It did that because he would report having agreed to sell the security in the future, at the higher price, while seemingly paying the lower, current price.
 
The Bookkeeping of Trillions
 As the later date neared, the report said, those fictitious profits would vanish from the books. So to get the profits back, he would have to put on more phony trades. The quantities got so large that he was claiming to control more than twice the total amount of some bonds that had been stripped -- something Kidder did not notice.
In the first three months of 1994, he told Kidder he had made trades involving $1.76 trillion in principal value. In fact, the report says, $79 billion of those trades were real. The 95 percent remaining -- $1.68 trillion -- was never traded.
Over time, various questions were raised at Kidder, but until this spring no one seems to have noticed the inherent implausibility of what Mr. Jett said he was doing. He was given huge bonuses for the profits he claimed to be generating, when, in fact, his real trading was producing losses.
Changes in the accounting system will prevent this particular ruse from happening again. But the Lynch report makes clear that the new bosses at Kidder, Peabody will have to pay more attention to what their supposed star traders are up to.

HEADLINE: Exchange To Build And Stay In Manhattan

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
A day after it formally completed its merger with the Commodity Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange announced yesterday that it would build a new office tower in lower Manhattan, keeping its headquarters and 8,100 jobs in the city.
The exchange, which has been in the World Trade Center since 1977, decided to build the tower beside the Hudson River in Battery Park City after ruling out another site in Manhattan and one in Jersey City, its chairman, Daniel Rappaport, said. 
 In a news conference at City Hall, where the announcement was made, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo praised the exchange's decision, describing it as a signal of the city's pre-eminence in the financial world.
 
Still the Financial Center
 "This would have been a blow to us had we lost the exchange," Mr. Cuomo said. "The fact that after the recession, with all the importunings by our neighboring state, with all the seductions, with all the offers, they remain here is a confirmation that this is the financial center of the world."
The decision to build a new headquarters for the exchange came after several years of searching and after it twice declared it would relocate.
The first plan involved moving with all the city's futures exchanges to a new building in TriBeCa, but the Mercantile Exchange pulled out. Then, in 1992, the exchange announced it would move into a building on Greenwich Street in Manhattan that was owned by Shearson Lehman, but that deal collapsed when Smith Barney took over Shearson and occupied the space.
 
Considered Moving
 Mr. Rappaport said the exchange's directors gave "an extraordinary amount" of thought to moving to New Jersey and at a meeting late Wednesday night voted narrowly to approve the new headquarters in Battery Park City, which is run by a state authority and has office and residential tenants.
The new tower, whose construction costs are estimated at $225 million, will rise 20 stories above the Hudson River next to the World Financial Center. It will include two 25,000-square-foot trading floors as well as offices. Construction is expected to begin in a few months and be completed in 1997.
City and state officials offered a package of incentives to the exchange, including $125 million in capital construction money, divided evenly between the city and state. The exchange also received tax abatements of $43 million, and it is eligible for lower energy costs from the State Power Authority.
With their merger completed, the Commodity Exchange, the world's largest precious metals futures exchange, is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Mercantile Exchange, which is the world's largest futures market for oil.
Mr. Giuliani said that the merged exchange contributed $177 million in tax revenues each year to the city and state. More important, he said, "This helps to confirm the fact that New York City is the place to be if you're a player in global industry."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Job Data Today and Rumor On Haiti Push Up the Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar advanced against other currencies yesterday in largely technical trading before the July employment report, with a rumor of an American invasion of Haiti providing an early lift.
It rose to its high for the week against the German mark, despite the absence of any significant new economic data or policy statements, a move that Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Paine Webber Inc., called a "bullish signal." 
 "Big funds are moving a lot of capital into U.S. markets this week; that set the tone," he said. "There is pent-up demand for dollars."
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5882 marks, up from 1.5758 marks on Wednesday. It also rose to 100.55 Japanese yen from 100.31 yen.
Analysts said concern that Washington would impose trade sanctions on Japan in the next few months limited the dollar's gains against the yen. "Dollar-yen is caught in a very narrow range because of the trade dispute," said David De Rosa, a director in New York for the Swiss Bank Corporation. "Nobody is willing to pay 101 for something that may be worth 95."
With Japanese monthly trade data due to be released today in Tokyo, few dealers were willing to stake new positions, he said.
The Haiti rumor was quickly dismissed by many traders and denied by officials. It was one of a number of such rumors that has made the rounds in the last few weeks. Nevertheless, it pushed up the dollar in early trading in the United States, where thin volume helped amplify the rise, and in late trading in Europe.
"The market is turning," said Dave Glowacki, senior trader at the National Bank of Detroit. "A month ago, you had a sell-dollar mentality. Now, we've turned the corner, and any excuse is used to buy."
But much of the dollar buying yesterday reflected traders' adjusting their positions in advance of the Labor Department's report today on employment in July. The figures are expected to provide a clue as to whether the Federal Reserve might again raise short-term interest rates.
"People don't want to be short going into the unemployment report," Mr. Glowacki said.
Forecasters think the report is likely to show that about 200,000 jobs were created last month, down from 379,000 in June. That would be consistent with recent reports indicating moderate economic growth and low inflation.
In trading of other major currencies yesterday, the British pound fell to $1.5355 from $1.5425, while the Canadian dollar was steady at 72.07 cents.

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Drop

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 4

 BODY:
The number of Americans seeking state unemployment benefits declined for the second consecutive week last week, dropping to the lowest level since February, the Government reported today.
The Labor Department said initial jobless claims totaled a seasonally adjusted 319,000 in the week that ended last Saturday. That was the lowest level since Feb. 26. 
 The figure declined 10,000 from the revised 329,000 reported for the week that ended on July 23. That figure was initially reported at 331,000. It was the first time the measure had dropped in two straight weeks since May.
The Labor Department's four-week moving average of jobless claims was 350,750, a decrease of 6,250 from the previous week. That was the lowest level in four weeks. The four-week average is more closely watched by economists than the weekly number because it smooths out fluctuations.
The Labor Department said increases in initial claims were reported by eight states and territories in the week ended July 23; 44 reported decreases, and one was unchanged. State totals lag a week behind the national ones.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Who Pays China's Army?

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Two months ago, President Clinton wiped out Asian human rights as a political, economic or diplomatic concern of his Administration's foreign policy.
He did this with the help and guidance of the American China lobby, which pays for its business profits in China by supporting the interests of the Government in Beijing. 
 But only the President himself could actually do the deed and only in one way -- by tearing up the promises he had made before and after the Presidential campaign, including his own executive order. That was the one all about how the minimum trade tariffs China enjoys would be raised unless Beijing allowed Chinese and Tibetan citizens some relief from forced labor, political arrest, prison torture and religious persecution.
China, sensing the sponginess of the President's commitment to human rights before many of us who voted for him, did not give him an inch. So he caved.
Why he did I do not know or perhaps am not ready to believe. Mr. Clinton learned long ago how important the money and other support of major corporations are at election time. All American politicians learn this. But not all go along, not on such an issue of honor and heart.
At least 100 members of the House of Representatives have stated their readiness to resist the pressure of the China lobby, the President and Beijing. Next week they will vote for legislation to raise the low tariffs subsidizing the massive exports of the Chinese Army to the U.S. -- yes, the Chinese Army.
How many more will join them depends in good part on how many Americans really care, enough to show it.
Once the tariff pressure was off, the Chinese repaid Mr. Clinton exactly as he and the lobby could have foretold -- if they had cared.
Human Rights Watch/Asia reports that the noose has tightened on all dissident activity. And the political branch of the conference of American Catholic bishops says that religious persecution is increasing and so is forced abortion.
Economically China is cashing in big. This year it will sell Americans $30 billion more than it buys from them. Meanwhile Beijing, according to the C.I.A., is the chief nuclear supplier to Iran and the major missile salesman to Syria and Iran, still tests nuclear weapons and is the only major nuclear power to increase its military budget.
Here is the evil comedy: The U.S. consumer is supporting the growth of the Chinese "People's Army," which is both the major instrument of Chinese power abroad and the major weapon of repression at home.
Are we all total fools with no commitment to human rights or even our own interests? No, not all of us -- not the bishops, not the A.F.L.-C.I.O., not the human rights groups, and not those members of Congress getting ready for next week's fight.
One of them, Gerald Solomon, Republican of New York, has introduced one-paragraph legislation: Reject the President's decision, raise the tariffs. It won't win but, oh, what a pleasure it would be to vote for him in November.
The other representatives have put together compromise legislation that targets principally those products manufactured by the network of thousands of plants owned by the Chinese Army.
The Administration is now so trapped by China that along with the China lobby it is actually fighting any human rights move against the forced-labor economic power of the Chinese military or its subsidization by U.S. low tariffs.
The Chinese Army's products range from guns exported by the thousands to America to machinery, furniture and clothing -- often produced by workers paid in prison gruel.
That wipes out American competition and makes for huge profits that go to the leading Communist Party families, the party itself and the Chinese Army.
All around Asia other countries with a taste for repression are delighted with the signal from Washington -- forget that human rights stuff because when it comes to trade America does not care.
American voters have a choice. They can phone or fax their minds to their representatives about subsidizing the Chinese Army. Or they can go on making Chinese generals even merrier, more stuffed with American billions and more powerful militarily.
Either way, one day the news of the American choice will get to the Chinese and Tibetans in their subsidized torture cells and labor camps.

HEADLINE: Big Houses Guzzle Natural Resources

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Building Small . . . Thinking Big" (news article, July 21) cites costs, demographics and environmental concerns as reasons for a trend toward smaller houses. 
 I would urge that more architects, contractors and home buyers become aware of the environmental aspects of construction. The numbers are startling:
* The American Institute of Architects estimates that the building industry consumes 40 percent of the natural resources used by the United States economy.
* The average all-electric house in Austin, Tex., consumes 19,000 kilowatt-hours of energy a year, causing the release of 10.5 tons of carbon dioxide into the air and contributing to the risk of global warming. Most of this energy is for heating, cooling and lighting needs that vary directly with the size of a house.
* Construction and demolition waste makes up 20 percent of the municipal waste stream.
With the persistent fear of the destruction of old-growth forests, the spread of monoculture timber plantations, the increasing use of fossil fuels and the shrinking amount of landfill space, it is timely to consider downsizing our needs for large houses and their appetite for lumber, energy and landfill space.

HEADLINE: Stop Witch Hunts for Uninsured Drivers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The police road blocks for uninsured drivers in New Jersey are reminiscent of the Gestapo in 1930's Germany. The stoppages are essentially a witch hunt against decent, working people, who because of the escalating cost are priced out of auto insurance. 
 Members of the police are disgusted with this law. One explained: "These people only have so much money. They can either feed their kids or pay their auto insurance. They feed their kids."
The first-offense penalty for driving without insurance is a mandatory six-month ban on driving, community service and a $300 fine.
Many people must drive to work, so they risk getting caught again, rather than lose their jobs and go on unemployment. The second offense brings a $500 fine, two weeks' imprisonment, 30 days of community service and a two-year driving ban. In each case a $750 surcharge on the driver's license fee must be paid.
This is especially burdensome for single, divorced and widowed women, whose income often makes compliance with the law impossible. One individual banned from driving ordered a pizza on the Saturday of the Fourth of July weekend, and it was the only food in the apartment for three days because of lack of transportation. This is how mandatory sentencing treats lower-income workers who go to their jobs every day and are otherwise model citizens.
This legislation is obviously the work of the insurance lobby, with the cost of enforcement paid from the police budget. The legislation should be thrown out and pardons immediately awarded to those sentenced. The sooner political action committees are outlawed, the sooner all citizens will be better served by their legislators.

HEADLINE: Design Team Chosen to Set Stadium Plan

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

 BODY:
Seeking to make the Yankees feel at home in the Bronx, the city yesterday hired a team of consultants to design a make-over of the stadium and the neighborhood around it. The aim is to create more fan-friendly transportation and parking and a more vibrant setting for the ball park.
Leading the consulting team will be the architectural firm Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, which has designed several baseball stadiums, including Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, which is widely regarded as the premier modern urban ball park. 
 City and state officials want to present the Yankees with a master plan for the area within six to nine months and quell threats from the team's principal owner, George Steinbrenner, that the team might move out of the Bronx when its lease on the stadium expires in the year 2002.
The project manager at the architectural firm, Timothy Delorm, said he envisioned "the evolution of a South Bronx-Yankees sports and cultural district."
 
New Attractions
 In applying for the $630,000 contract with the city's Economic Development Corporation, the firm raised the possibility of creating a range of attractions other than the stadium in the ball park's South Bronx neighborhood, from a sports museum and a sports-training village to art galleries and a waterfront amphitheater.
"What we'd like to do is extend the attractions of the area," Mr. Delorm said. "The long-term future of both the Yankees and the neighborhood depends on integrating the community with the stadium and vice versa."
Mr. Delorm said plans for improving the neighborhood would be worked out with community, political and business leaders. City officials have said that renovations to the stadium could cost as much as $250 million, but no parameters for the price of the entire project have been set.
The application submitted by the firm, which is based in St. Louis, said the first thing that would need to be done would be to resolve the Yankees' concerns of "safety perception, image, access and parking" in the Bronx. The application said that creating more retail businesses and other attractions in the area would increase pedestrian traffic, "which will eliminate the perception that the area is unsafe."
Officials have not determined how much of the plan would involve renovation of the stadium itself. At the minimum, city officials said, luxury sky boxes and refreshment stands would be built.
The Yankees were silent yesterday on the city's action. "I'm not in a position to discuss it at all," said Joseph Carella, a spokesman for the team.
Yankee officials have periodically talked about leaving the South Bronx, saying attendance at games has been dampened by the fear of crime and by the difficulty of getting to the stadium and finding parking spaces.
 
Searching For New Sites
 The Yankees recently asked city and state officials to search for other sites within the city to build a new stadium, and a list was compiled. But city officials have said that their intention is to keep the Yankees in the South Bronx, and yesterday's decision to hire the team of consultants seemed to show their commitment to that strategy.
"We believe that the Yankees belong in the Bronx and can be happy in the Bronx," James A. Schmidt, the executive vice president of the Economic Development Corporation, said yesterday.
Clay B. Lifflander, the corporation president, said the city wanted to avoid the mistakes of the 1970's, when the stadium was renovated but little attention was paid to the neighborhood. "The focus was more architectural than community planning," he said.
The cost of the contract approved yesterday by the development corporation will be split between the city and the New York State Urban Development Corporation.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, noting the firm's work at Camden Yards, said, "We are counting on this very same vision to help us create a plan for the economic revitalization of this area."
Mr. Delorm discouraged comparisons between the Yankee Stadium project and the building of Camden Yards. In Baltimore, the stadium is part of the city's Inner Harbor district, which had been under renovation for more than a decade and was already a tourist destination when the stadium was built.
Not only are the Mott Haven and Highbridge neighborhoods around the stadium not tourist attractions, but such basic tasks as repaving the Cross Bronx and Major Deegan Expressways and designing other ways to get fans to and from the stadium must be accomplished before any other amenities can be added to the neighborhood.
Plans for improving stadium access have been discussed by the state Department of Transportation, including building a Metro-North train station at the stadium as well as a bridge across the Harlem River from Manhattan to a parking garage near the stadium. In those plans, which have been criticized by Bronx officials for encouraging a negative image of the area, fans would be able to reach the stadium from the parking garage by an enclosed walkway. The bridge would allow them to attend a ball game without setting foot on Bronx streets.

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption yesterday about a plan to refurbish Yankee Stadium and its environs described the team's attendance incorrectly. It has risen slightly, not fallen, from the same time last season.
(August 10, 1994, Wednesday) An article on Thursday about a political dispute that has stalled final passage of the Clinton Administration's comprehensive crime bill characterized the voting patterns of Republicans in the House incorrectly. While Republicans often vote as a block to oppose key Democratic measures, they do not always do so.

In response, the city has hired a team of consultants, headed by the architectural firm Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, to design a make-over of the stadium and the neighborhood around it.

Investing for College
 
Q. Our 23-year-old nanny is saving money to be used in the next four years for her education. Would a conservative stock mutual fund be good, or would another type of investment be better?
LISA G. MATTHEWS, Darien, Conn.
 
A. Each year, the stock market may go down, as well as up. At present, prices of stocks are high relative to dividends, and interest rates have been moving up. So people who will need money in a short time would be safer choosing investments with less risk than stocks.
 If your nanny will need money in each of the next four years, she should predict her annual cash flow and invest so that money will be available as required to pay tuition bills and other costs.
 "Invest your money to earn the highest interest for the longest time with little or no risk to principal," advised Madeline I. Noveck, president of Novos Planning Associates. "For example, money needed in one to three years might be invested in Treasury bills or short-term target maturity funds. For the money needed in four years, you may want to take more risk for the potential of higher return by investing in a conservative stock fund with good performance in down markets or preferably a global asset allocation fund."
 
 
Earnings Up, Shares Down
 
Q. Why does a stock's price decline when a company does well in a quarter, but its reported earnings fall below analysts' predictions?
DANIEL S. JACOBY, East Williston, L.I.
 
A. The price of a stock typically reflects investors' perceptions both about the company's immediate prospects and long-term potential. Earnings that are positive, but below the consensus of analysts' estimates, are disappointing.
 Some investors who have read news reports that earnings fell below forecasts may decide to shed their shares, as may some clients of brokerage houses whose analysts have reduced their ratings on the stock. Such selling, of course, depresses the stock price.
 "Below-estimate earnings can cause price weakness because the anticipated earnings are probably built into the stock price," said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers. "Investors worry about additional disappointments."
 
 
Limitations on I.R.A.'s
 
Q. Can I contribute $2,000 to my I.R.A. if I am not working and receive income only from Social Security and investments? Can I deduct my contribution from my income for tax purposes?
BERNARD SCHER, Margate, Fla.
 
A. A taxpayer's annual contribution to an individual retirement account can be made only from earned income. The contribution is limited to the amount earned or $2,000, whichever is less.
 "Social Security and investment income do not qualify as earned income," said Martin Leventhal, head of a New York accounting firm bearing his name. "Hence, no I.R.A. contribution, whether deductible or nondeductible, may be based upon income from those sources."

HEADLINE: A SURGE IN HIRING CHEERS PRESIDENT BUT ROILS MARKETS

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The economy continued to produce jobs at a brisk pace in July, the Government said today, prompting drops in financial markets as investors expressed fear that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again soon to prevent any increase in inflation.
Employment grew by 259,000 jobs last month while average hourly earnings rose 4 cents, to $11.12, the Labor Department announced. President Clinton welcomed the news, saying that nonfarm employment had now risen by 4.1 million jobs since he took office, half of the 8 million jobs that he promised to create during his first term. 
 But traders and investors in financial markets were much less enthusiastic. They worried that the central bank would interpret rising wages and employment as signs that the economy would overheat and that inflation, now running at slightly less than 3 percent, would pick up. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.77, to 3,747.02, while the interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 7.54 percent, from 7.40 on Thursday. [Pages 34 and 41.]
While there were sharp reactions in the bond and stock markets, there is not much uncertainty on Wall Street about what lies ahead. Most analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise its short-term interest rate target again, the fifth increase this year. The debate is just over the timing.
The jobs data released today made the increase seem more imminent, possibly as soon as Monday. But if data next week indicate a slowdown in consumer spending, traders and investors may conclude that the Fed can wait, either to the next meeting of the Fed's interest-rate-policy committee on Aug. 16, or even longer.
In separate interviews this week, five top Federal Reserve officials expressed uncertainty about the economy's direction that today's figures only partly resolve. Their uncertainty suggests that the Federal Reserve is likely to wait at least until Aug. 16 before raising rates again.
Although job growth was strong in July, the unemployment rate crept up to 6.1 percent, a statistically insignificant increase of a tenth of a percentage point from June. Unlike the figures on job creation, which come from an extensive survey of businesses, the unemployment rate is based on a survey of households.
The household survey has been producing unusual results since the Labor Department changed the questions at the beginning of this year, and even department officials have become hesitant to rely on it. "The household survey still is -- since it's a new survey instrument and it's a small survey in terms of the number of people surveyed -- is still bouncing around a little bit," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in a telephone interview this afternoon.
Other analysts were less polite. "It's not a reliable number, particularly on a month-to-month basis," said David M. Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York.
Employment rose even faster in June, by 356,000 nonfarm jobs. But Katherine G. Abraham, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said that the slightly slower pace in July was not significant because some hiring in highly seasonal industries appeared to have taken place in June this year instead of in July.
 
 
'Responsible Thing to Do'
 The strong jobs figures for July suggested to some analysts that another rate increase might be imminent. No economic data are scheduled for release on Monday, so the financial markets may be quiet. A rate increase that day, said Eugene J. Sherman, the director of research at M. A. Schapiro & Company, a New York brokerage firm, might help the Treasury Department in its big auctions of securities later next week, by reassuring investors that the American central bank was on guard against inflation.
"It would be the responsible thing to do, to move and move promptly," Mr. Sherman said.
But central bankers have made clear this week that before taking action, they want answers to three basic questions: is output growing, do people have the money to buy that output, and will people actually spend the money if they have it?
The first question was answered on July 29, when the Commerce Department announced that the nation's economic output grew at an above-average annual rate of 3.7 percent. But more than half of the extra output went into business inventories, as consumer spending slowed sharply.
 
More are earning More
 So central bank officials have been waiting for evidence of whether American consumers have the money to buy these goods and whether they actually will buy them. Today's figures on jobs and wages suggest that more Americans are earning more money.
But Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Federal Reserve Board governor who heads the board's panel on consumer finance, said the increase in wages might not be enough to insure that the extra inventories would be sold.
In a telephone interview this afternoon, Mr. Lindsey said, "I feel a little bit less confident than I would like to" that there will be enough new consumer spending to empty the shelves that were filled in the second quarter.
Today's report also does not show whether Americans will spend the extra money or save it. The Commerce Department is scheduled to release next Thursday its figures on retail sales for July. Federal Reserve officials eagerly await this information as an indication of consumer spending.
 
Debating the Timing
 The Federal Reserve could raise rates next Thursday, after the retail sales figures are released. But that would run counter to the central bank's pattern of avoiding rate changes in the few days before a meeting. In addition, top central bank officials say they have found many contradictions in recent economic data, making it likely that they will want to talk over the figures in person here on Aug. 16 instead of holding an emergency telephone conference call before then.
To be sure, the Federal Reserve is also watching data on inflation itself, and not just information on whether the economy is overheating. The Producer Price Index is also scheduled for release on Thursday, with the Consumer Price Index due on Friday.
 
 
 
Lower Commodity Prices
 One possible source of optimism for Federal Reserve officials lies in the recent small drop in commodity prices. Susan M. Phillips, another governor of the Federal Reserve Board and its most influential voice on commodities, said in an interview this week that good weather seemed likely to refill grain bins emptied by bad harvests in the last two years and prevent a sharp rise in food prices.
"As each day goes by, we get in a little better situation as far as agricultural commodities," said Ms. Phillips, a former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
The Federal Reserve has raised overnight interest rates four times this year, to 4.25 percent from 3 percent. While the Clinton Administration has largely refrained from criticizing the Federal Reserve, another interest-rate increase could test the relationship sorely. Another rate increase could also further upset members of Congress.

HEADLINE: Clinton Goal: Avoid a War

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The last thing President Clinton wants this week or this month is a war. Not in Haiti, not in Bosnia, and certainly not in both at the same time -- not while he is struggling to wrest from a recalcitrant Congress a health-care program that will fulfill his campaign promises.
In the minds of Democratic strategists, at least, the political situation comes very close to a matter of life and death: fail on health care, they say, and the President's chances of winning a second term, let alone limiting his party's anticipated losses in the November Congressional elections, will be severely eroded. 
 This morning, in a brazen thumb in the eye, Bosnian Serbs "liberated" one of their tanks and some other heavy weapons from impoundment by the United Nations. The action was followed by a carefully calibrated NATO air strike. But there is little prospect, Administration officials said this afternoon, that the United States will get involved in active, sustained combat as a result.
"This is a momentary flare-up, not a turning point," a senior State Department official said. "We are not about to escalate here."
As in Haiti, Mr. Clinton is trying to use economic and diplomatic activity to bring about the desired result. He has countenanced the occasional military gesture, like today's retaliatory attack by American A-10 bombers, supported by French and Dutch warplanes, on an antitank emplacement. But talk of more concerted military action is mostly just that -- talk, intended to turn up the heat.
"I think it was a good step forward today," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said of the allied response, because it kept the psychological pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace proposal they have so far turned down. Drafted by the United States, Russia, Britain, Germany and France, the plan would return some of the Serbian nationalists' conquests to the Bosnian Muslims.
Should the President decide that the national interest requires it, there are plenty of troops and plenty of planes to carry out an invasion of Haiti and a major operation in Bosnia at the same time; cuts in the Pentagon budget have not destroyed the nation's capacity to fight two limited conflicts at once.
Rather it is the political situation that constrains Mr. Clinton.
 
No Room for Error
 "The President is standing on a precipice," said a Democratic Senator friendly to the President. "In the next few weeks, the biggest issue of his term will be decided. To win he needs to focus all his attention, and all the attention of Congress, on health care. It is close enough so that careless errors could cost him the game.
"So he won't go looking for foreign-policy trouble on the Hill."
Though there is no official acknowledgment, the feeling is widespread in Washington that Haiti, the problem in the American backyard, rather than Bosnia, the trouble spot in the European hinterland, holds the higher priority in the Administration's current calculations.
But in fact there is no widespread public clamor for quick American action either in Haiti or in Bosnia.
Mr. Clinton has made no sustained effort to build support for such action, either on Capitol Hill or among the general public, in part because doing so would inevitably detract from his evangelism on behalf of health care. And the Somalia experience has persuaded at least some of his advisers of how important it is to bring Congress and the electorate into line before committing American forces abroad.
The President got conflicting counsel today from senior Senators.
Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, the minority leader, renewed his insistent demands that the United States break with the United Nations by lifting the embargo on arms shipments to the predominantly Muslim Government in Bosnia, which is outgunned by the Bosnian Serbs.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, an influential figure on the Armed Services Committee, took a much less interventionist position. He warned in a floor speech that the United States might be "on the verge of a very dangerous move without the American people being consulted."
But in fact, Mr. Clinton has everything to gain from avoiding any bold new steps in Bosnia, at least in the near future, and until he steps forward, the European nations are reluctant to do much about the Balkan problem. In other words, things are stuck in just about the same place they have been for months.
That was evident last weekend in Geneva. Mr. Christopher had promised a tough new approach, but the five nations sponsoring the peace proposal in fact made only the most modest response -- a promise to seek fresh economic sanctions -- to the Bosnian Serbs' repeated rejections of the plan.
They made no threat of air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions, and they critically weakened their comment that lifting the arms embargo "could become unavoidable" by describing such a step as "a last resort." The seizure of heavy weapons by the Bosnian Serbs today, their most aggressive move since last April, demonstrated how little credibility the allied message carried.
Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, returned today to the same formulation -- "a decision by the U.N. to lift the arms embargo could become unavoidable," she said -- and the practical results seem likely to be the same: nil.

HEADLINE: Protesters Battle Police in Havana; Castro Warns U.S.

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 5 -

 BODY:
In a rare display of political unrest, protesters clashed today with the police and Government supporters on the Havana waterfront and in the hotel zone after a series of boat hijackings by people trying to flee Cuba.
Responding to the riots, President Fidel Castro threatened to let Cubans leave without restriction for the first time since the Mariel boat exodus of 1980, which brought a flood of refugees to the United States. 
 Mr. Castro said that unless the United States stops encouraging people to flee Cuba by sea, "we will stop blocking the departure of those who want to leave the country."
"We cannot continue to guard the coasts of the United States," he said while touring the scene of the clashes. His remarks were carried by the Cuban Government news agency La Prensa, monitored here.
 
Castro Blames U.S.
 Mr. Castro accused American-based radio stations of inspiring the departures and added, "The Government of the United States has a great responsibility in this."
Demonstrators shouting anti-Government slogans confronted Communist Party militants in several places along the waterfront and in the hotel zone shortly after noon today. The Mexican news agency Notimex said the violence apparently erupted when police officers enforced security measures to stop people from stealing boats to flee.
Some people were apparently arrested, but there were no official reports of arrests or injuries, Notimex said.
The official Cuban Government news agency, Prensa Latina, said stores and hotels were attacked and "thousands of Havana workers entered the streets to confront the provocateurs and show their support for the revolution."
 
Increasing Privation
 Struggling on skimpy rations, many Cubans resent the dollar-only stores in some luxury hotels where even soap and simple foods can be too expensive for most citizens.
Mr. Castro also said that hijackers had killed two policemen to seize a ferryboat to flee Cuba on Thursday night, but the agency gave no further details about that incident.
In his remarks, the Cuban President appeared to be threatening a renewal of the Mariel exodus, when Cuba dropped all restrictions on departures and 120,000 people fled to the United States within a few months, causing massive problems for United States officials.
He said the riots were "something that had been organized for a while and the Government of the United States has a great responsibility in this."
The United States grants automatic asylum to any Cuban who reaches its shores.
 
Retaliation Threatened
 Mr. Castro hinted that any further protests would be confronted by the so-called "rapid action brigades" organized by local party committees.
"I believe that for this battle, the masses must be unleashed, because they fear the masses," Mr. Castro said of the protesters.
A Cuban reporter reached by telephone said several hundred people were involved and the clashes involved sticks and stones. Notimex reported that hundreds ran for cover when they heard what sounded like gunshots.
In Washington, a State Department official said a crowd estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 assembled at about 2 P.M. today near the ferry dock in Havana, attracted by rumors that another ferry was being diverted northward.
The Cuban reporter said he had seen hundreds of Cubans gathered on Havana's Malecon waterfront this morning to shout "Adios!" and wave at a small ferry that headed out to sea toward Florida.
 
New Taxes Imposed
 At least three Havana harbor ferries in the last 10 days have been hijacked by departing refugees. Cuba blames the United States for strictly limiting visas while granting exile to people who leave the island illegally.
Notimex said ferry service was suspended this morning and that the police imposed tight security along the harbor.
Efforts to flee the island are at their highest level in years, apparently because of an economic crisis caused by the loss of aid from the former Soviet Union and socialist backers in Europe as well as a United States trade embargo.
On Thursday, Cuba's Parliament approved the most sweeping series of taxes in a quarter century.
The law would impose a 2 percent tax on housing, boats and farms, as well as undisclosed fees on profits, sales and other items.
The Communist Government abolished most taxes 27 years ago, and services have been financed largely out of profits of state companies.

HEADLINE: U.S. Hits Bosnian Serb Target in Air Raid

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 5

 BODY:
American fighter aircraft attacked a Bosnian Serb anti-tank vehicle near Sarajevo tonight, hours after the Serbs tested NATO's resolve by seizing weapons that had been impounded by United Nations troops and attacking a United Nations helicopter.
The United Nations commander in Bosnia, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, said he had called for the attack because Serbian nationalist forces violated a NATO order prohibiting heavy weapons in a zone around Sarajevo. This morning Bosnian Serbs seized a T-55 tank, two armored personnel carriers and an anti-aircraft gun from a weapons impoundment area in Ilidza, a Serbian-held town north of the Bosnian capital. 
 General Rose said the pinprick air strike was intended to show the United Nations' concern for the "erosion of the integrity" of the zone. When NATO imposed the zone on Feb. 21, the Serbs were warned they would face air strikes if they did not withdraw or hand over to the United Nations all heavy weaponry positioned around the city.
The air strike was the first executed to enforce the Sarajevo zone. In April, allied jets raided Gorazde, a designated "safe area," after Serbs attacked United Nations personnel there.
 
A Lull, Then a Smattering
 The Sarajevo ultimatum ended a 22-month Serbian bombardment that claimed thousands of lives, but Serbian forces still surround Sarajevo, and recently small-arms fire has increased.
Bosnian Serbs made several attempts this week to withdraw heavy weapons from United Nations sites. General Rose threatened Serbian commanders this week with air strikes if weapons were seized.
"We don't regard the weapons-collection sites as some sort of supermarket," General Rose said in a news conference tonight. "There is a limit to how much infringement on that total exclusion zone we can accept."
Adm. Leighton W. Smith, NATO's commander in southern Europe, said at a briefing in Naples, Italy, that two American A-10 ground attack aircraft operating out of Aviano Air Base in northern Italy fired 600 cannon rounds at a Serbian anti-tank weapon in a sparsely populated area about eight miles south of Sarajevo, well within the 12.3-mile zone. The target was destroyed, he said.
General Rose said he received a message one hour after this evening's air strike from Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic, the No. 2 officer in the Bosnian Serb army, promising the immediate return of all Serbian heavy weapons inside the exclusion zone.
The Serbs returned the armored personnel carriers, but General Rose warned that he might call for air strikes on Saturday if the tank and a mobile anti-aircraft gun were not returned.
"I merely called a pause in the NATO operation," he said. "I expect these weapons to be withdrawn."
But the general did not impose a deadline for the return, saying, "the Balkans are the Balkans."
United Nations officials here said the anti-tank gun hit was not one seized from the compound, but was one of four targets chosen because they are far from populated areas. Cloudy weather prevented aircraft from engaging the other targets, the general said.
General Rose said he gave the Serbs a one-hour warning.
Pentagon officials said Dutch F-16 and French Mirage fighters escorted the A-10's. Each A-10 carries a 30-millimeter cannon capable of firing 3,900 depleted uranium rounds per minute.
Serbs drove some of the seized weapons to Semizovac and reportedly parked them near a school and hospital to shield them from an air attack, the authorities said.
At about 6 A.M., small-arms fire by Serbs struck a French Puma helicopter dispatched to find the stolen weapons. The crew was uninjured.
United Nations officials said they were investigating how the Serbs made off with the heavy weapons while the Ilidza center was being guarded by about 30 Ukrainian soldiers. A mortar was seized from the site this afternoon, General Rose said, adding that a soldier was injured in the incident.
 
Provocation and Sympathy
 Western diplomats here said the Serbs' seizing the weapons was a calculated attempt to provoke the United Nations and NATO to retaliate, probably in an effort to gain public sympathy from Serbia a day after Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, ordered political and economic ties between Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs to be cut. His move was an effort to distance his country from the Bosnian Serbs, who have rejected the latest international peace plan for Bosnia.
Today, the Serbian police reportedly stopped hundreds of trucks from crossing from Serbia into Bosnia, and telephone connections were severed.
The United Nations has imposed economic sanctions on Serbia as punishment for its support of the Bosnian Serbs, and additional sanctions are being contemplated if the Bosnian Serbs continue to defy the international mediators.
Today's weapons seizure by the Bosnian Serbs also appeared to be a reaction to a Bosnian Government offensive that could break the siege of Sarajevo. The Bosnian Army has been trying to loosen the Serbs' grip on a swath of territory between Sarajevo and the Bosnian Army-controlled town of Visoko. The area is the most vulnerable point of the Serbian siege and has been the scene of fierce fighting throughout the 28-month war, including heavy shelling and rocket attacks this week.
United Nations officials say that by attacking south of Visoko, the Bosnian Army is exploiting the NATO exclusion zone around Sarajevo in.
"The configuration of the exclusion zone creates a tactical weakness for the Bosnian Serbs," a United Nations military officer said. "The Bosnian Army can use heavy weapons outside the zone to pound in. But the Serbs cannot have heavy weapons there."
The Visoko area has become more sensitive in recent weeks because Bosnian Army construction crews have carved out an airstrip just northwest of the town that is or will soon be capable of handling large cargo aircraft.
 
New Arms Pathway
 Badly outgunned by the Serbs at the beginning of the war, the Bosnian Government has widened its arms pipeline since it struck a deal with Croatia in the spring. Weapons shipments now arrive in Bosnia from the Dalmatian coast of Croatia. But the widespread rumor in Sarajevo is that the Croats receive one-third of each shipment. If the Bosnian Government is able to defy a United Nations-imposed ban on flights over Bosnia and open the new airstrip for arms deliveries, it could tip the balance of firepower in the war.
One Bosnian Army officer said that some aircraft carrying weapons have already landed at the airstrip.
Bosnian Army forces have advanced this week on a plateau southeast of Vares. Bosnian Army officials said they were trying to secure a main road between Sarajevo and Olovo.
A Bosnian officer said that the army was close to securing the plateau, which could be used to mount an advance southward toward Sarajevo.
United Nations officials, however, say they doubt that the Bosnian Army, suffering low morale and exhaustion, could succeed at the task.

The Economy
The economy continued to produce jobs at a brisk pace in July, causing drops in financial markets as investors feared the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again soon to prevent any increase in inflation. Employment grew by 259,000 jobs last month while average hourly earnings rose 4 cents, to $11.12. President Clinton welcomed the news, saying that nonfarm employment had now risen by 4.1 million jobs since he took office, half of the 8 million jobs that he promised to create during his first term. [Page 1.] While the national unemployment rate for July rose to 6.1 percent from 6 percent in June, New Jersey's unemployment rate dropped to 6.4 percent from 7.1; New York State's edged up to 7.1 percent from 7 percent, while New York City's jobless rate climbed to 8.8 percent from 8.5 percent. [44.]
The White House is doing little to fight protectionist provisions in the legislation Congress must pass to underpin the new GATT pact, say many who wish to bring down trade barriers. [33.]
U.S. monetary authorities bought a total of $2.81 billion through the sale of German marks and Japanese yen in May and June to support the dollar. [42.]
 
Companies
The F.C.C. sternly admonished high bidders at its recent auction for slices of the broadcast spectrum to meet their obligations when their 10 percent down payments are due Monday. [33.]
Nextel agreed in separate stock deals valued at $2.4 billion to acquire Dial Page, a wireless operator in the Southeast, and the remaining American wireless licenses owned by Motorola. [33.]
Simon Property will buy 19 regional shopping malls and a management company for $1 billion from Equitable. [35.]
Fund American Enterprises said it had received a proposal to buy its Source One Mortgage Services unit. [35.]
 
International
Millions of Chinese have learned a lesson about how quickly prices can climb, collapse and climb again on what has become one of the most volatile stock markets in the developing world. [33.]
Brazil has become the South American magnet for computer companies from around the world; many have set up local production, with the broader Latin American market in mind. [33.]
 
Markets
Stocks fell on fears of another rate increase. The Dow dropped 18.77 points, to close at 3,747.02. [34.]
Prices of Treasury securities tumbled after the monthly employment numbers for July showed the economy adding jobs at a fast pace. The 30-year bond fell 114/32 of a point, to 8428/32 , for a yield of 7.54 percent. [41.]
The dollar fell against most major currencies after the bond market's sharp decline. [42.]
Oil prices plunged after a Nigerian court ordered the release of a politician whose imprisonment had set off strikes that crippled oil production in the West African nation. [42.]
 
Your Money
A new business structure that is taking the accounting profession by storm is also being recommended for a host of businesses. Called a limited liability company or limited liability partnership, the structure assures owners or partners that their personal assets will be protected if their businesses are sued. [30.]
New York City's Public Advocate wants mutual fund companies to adopt a new, standardized label that would summarize a fund's goals, strategies, risks and costs. [30.]
Adjustable-rate mortgages are making a comeback, thanks to their modest rate increases, a spate of new loan products and heightened competition among lenders. [31.]

HEADLINE: New Jersey's Jobless Rate Fell in July

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
New Jersey's unemployment rate dropped to 6.4 percent in July from 7.1 in June, while the rates in nearby states and for the nation were rising, the Labor Department reported today.
 The national unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent from 6 percent in June. The rate in New York State edged up to 7.1 percent from 7 percent, while Pennsylvania's rate rose to 6.5 percent from 5.9 percent. 
 In addition, New York City's unemployment rate rose to 8.8 percent from 8.5 percent.
 
Governor Is 'Delighted'
 Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey expressed some cautious skepticism over the size of the decline in the state's rate, but she said it provided evidence that her program to reduce the state budget and cut income tax rates was working.
 "Obviously, I'm delighted," the Governor said. "I'm always a little concerned when there's that big a jump, even though it's in the right direction.
 "I'm assured from all the discussions I've had with labor that this a real trend. I hope we can sustain it, and certainly our position relative to surrounding states shows that we're doing something right."
 Peter J. Calderone, New Jersey's Labor Commissioner, called the statistics "unqualified good news," even though the state's unemployment rate was still higher than the national average. He said employment and labor force figures were up, as was consumer spending, while the number of business failures had declined.
 
Retail Sales Up 8.5%
 Mr. Calderone said the state's monthly survey of employers showed that the economy was generating jobs faster than it did last year and was outpacing gains in Connecticut, New York and Pennsylvania.
 In addition, he said, retail sales for the first five months of the year were up 8.5 percent from a year earlier, indicating a stronger employment picture.
 Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, the regional commissioner of labor statistics for the United States Labor Department, said the slow recovery of the New Jersey economy was "picking up steam."
 He said the employer survey earlier this year and the household survey that forms the basis for the latest figures both indicated "that more people are looking for jobs and getting them."
 But he warned, "The state's economy has been lagging for a long time and its problems are not yet over."
 
Factory Employment Stable
 Mr. Ehrenhalt said the bright spots in the New Jersey employment picture continued to be the service industry and construction jobs, along with increases in trade and financial employment. "In addition, factory employment, which had been declining for a long time, has been relatively stable since last winter," he said.
 There were 261,000 unemployed New Jersey residents in July, a slight drop from 284,000 in June. The number employed in July was 3.79 million, compared with 3.72 million in June.
 In July, the number of people employed in New York State rose to its highest point this year, 8,110,000, while 620,000 people were unemployed.
 Although the unemployment rate was up in New York City, the actual number of people employed in the city increased to 3,010,000 in July from 2,972,000 in June. There were 292,000 people out of work last month.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: BEHIND THE SCENES;
With Long Hours and Little Fanfare, Staff Members Created a Health Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The ambitious health care bill going soon to the floor of the House of Representatives is called the Gephardt bill, in honor of the majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. But it is really the work of the Democratic staff of the House Ways and Means Committee.
The staff includes a half-dozen experts on health policy, people who have years of experience analyzing how to regulate health costs, how to pay doctors and hospitals, how to provide care to more people. 
 The members of this elite group did not need a throng of advisers, like the 500 assembled last year by Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton, to tutor them on the intricacies of health policy. For more than a decade, the largely anonymous committee staff had been studying ways to overhaul the health care system, weighing options and drafting legislation.
In the Senate and the House, scores of Congressional aides are toiling behind the scenes, trying to shape health care legislation to address the concerns of constituents or lobbyists. The basic process is the same as with other legislation and other committees, but the health care legislation dwarfs other bills in its scope and complexity.
The leader of the health care specialists on the Ways and Means staff is David S. Abernethy, a shaggy-haired man of 44, with drooping mustache and wire-rimmed glasses. In a sense, his entire professional life has been preparation for his current role.
"I am one person who is sitting in the right place at the right time for what we are trying to do," he said. "I started more than 20 years ago at the Haight-Ashbury free clinic in San Francisco, trying to provide health care to people who couldn't pay for it. I believe in this agenda."
The health specialists work for the full Ways and Means Committee, but much of their day-to-day labor is for the chairman of the panel's health subcommittee, Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California. The relationship is intense, with continual brainstorming, hundreds of questions and answers and endless demands for instant facts.
"It has been like one long therapy group in which the leading technique is the primal scream," Mr. Stark said.
Many features of Mr. Gephardt's bill, like the expansion of Medicare to cover millions of people who are poor or uninsured, emerged from Mr. Stark's subcommittee.
In the last few weeks, the health specialists have also worked directly for Mr. Gephardt, helping him write the bill that he unveiled last week with the imprimatur of the House Democratic leadership. When the bill reaches the House floor, the staff will be busier than ever, crunching numbers and answering questions as lawmakers offer amendments.
The Gephardt bill differs from the Clinton proposal in many ways. It relies less on new, untested institutions; builds more on the foundation of Medicare and relies less on states and more on the Federal Government. In all those respects, the House bill reflects the priorities of Mr. Stark and his staff.
 
Knowing the Subject
 Even people who disagree with staff members respect them for their knowledge and thoroughness.
Charles N. Kahn 3d, executive vice president of the Health Insurance Association of America, which represents commercial insurers, said: "I see these people as classic Ways and Means staffers. They work for what is probably the most powerful committee in Congress. They understand the heavy responsibility that lies on them. All of them are people of strong views. But they are hardened professionals and probably know more about health than any other group of people on Capitol Hill."
Mr. Kahn, a Republican who worked for the committee from 1986 to 1993, often disagrees with Democrats on the staff. But he said: "These are the best people I ever worked with. They know the issues. They know the law. They worry about the details because the bills they write often become law."
Mr. Abernethy, the son of an ophthalmologist in San Mateo, Calif., has a master's degree in public health from Yale University and worked for seven years as a senior official in the New York State Health Department. Such state government experience is rare among Congressional aides.
The Ways and Means staff also includes Patricia H. Neuman, who has a doctorate from the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health and worked for three years for the Senate Special Committee on Aging; James A. Reuter, a veteran of the Congressional Research Service who received a doctorate from Johns Hopkins in 1977, and Lisa Potetz, who has worked for the Senate Finance Committee, the Congressional Budget Office and an agency that advises Congress on payments to hospitals under Medicare.
Also on the staff are Ellen Magrini, a lawyer from Chicago, and Dr. Eric Trupin, a child psychologist from Seattle, who helped design the mental health benefits in the bill going to the House floor.
The role of the staff in conceiving and molding legislation is difficult to explain. The staff is continually engaged in a dialogue with lawmakers. "It's a very symbiotic relationship," Mr. Abernethy said. Ideas swirl in a creative jumble that he described as "a marble cake."
Mr. Abernethy said he knows "the loneliness of the minority health staff" because he worked several years in the late 1970's for Tim Lee Carter of Kentucky, who was then the ranking Republican on the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Health. "Back then," Mr. Abernethy said, "health care was more bipartisan, mainly because the Republicans were less conservative than they are today."
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, often quarrels with Mr. Stark. Of the staff, she said: "They are very smart, very competent, but they do come at the subject with a strong ideological bias. The way that bent affects minority members of Congress, particularly members who take a different view, is this: They are not anxious to give you information that undercuts the bill their boss is trying to get through the committee.
"Unless you ask exactly the right question," Mrs. Johnson said, "you don't necessarily get the information that you and the public need. Committee members, Democrat and Republican, don't get to see the total picture."
In response to such criticism, Mr. Abernethy said, "We are not paid to be bipartisan." But he hastily added, "We are not paid to lie or to miscast issues or to be unprofessional in presenting information."
 
Barrage of Lobbying
 Congressman Stark said of his staff: "They just don't come any better. They have no equal in any Federal agency or any committee on Capitol Hill. No one in the United States is more familiar with, or has been more active in designing, the health care reform package."
As a result, the staff members have been popular targets for lobbyists and interest groups trying to shape the outcome of the health debate.
"They're always in here making their case to us as a first line of attack," Ms. Neuman said. She said lobbyists have often tried to resolve issues with the staff, avoiding public fights in committee rooms or on the House floor.
Ms. Neuman said she has had "an unbelievable amount of contact with lobbyists" seeking insurance coverage for medical benefits as diverse as dental care, psychotherapy and chiropractic.
Many people, including Mr. Stark, suspect that Mr. Abernethy secretly favors a Canadian-style health system in which the Government would pay all medical bills. But Mr. Abernethy insisted that "I am not a closet single-payer advocate."
He said that as the son of a doctor, "I grew up thinking that Medicare was socialized medicine and that the worst possible thing in the world was government-financed medicine."
His sister, Janet E. Abernethy, chief executive of an ambulance company in Sacramento, Calif., said that their father, Dr. Rodney Abernethy, "felt people had a right of access to health care, and he instilled that view in us." He was one of the few ophthalmologists in San Mateo County who took Medicaid patients, she said, and he organized trips to provide free eye care to poor people in Latin America.
As a state official in New York, David Abernethy gained extensive experience in health planning and the regulation of hospital costs. Unlike many economists and Republican politicians, he has never seen free-market competition as a cure for the ills of the nation's health care system.
Today, he said, he likes the idea of expanding Medicare to serve as a safety net for people who have no other source of health insurance. But that, he said, is much different from having the Government as the sole source of payment for all care.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Off Sharply On Jobs Data

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities tumbled yesterday after the monthly employment numbers for July showed the economy adding jobs at a fast pace, once again raising investor fears of inflation. And the data could turn out to be a pivotal factor if the Fed decides to raise rates again.
 The Labor Department reported that last month's payrolls rose a higher-than-expected 259,000, with hourly earnings rebounding by 4 cents, to $11.12, also higher than expected. The average workweek was unchanged and the unemployment rate edged higher, to 6.1 percent.
 
 In response, the Treasury's 30-year bond fell 114/32 , to 8428/32 , or about $14.37 for each $1,000 of face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 7.54 percent from 7.40 percent. It was the highest closing yield since July 27, when it was 7.61 percent.
 Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said, "The Fed will tighten in the very near future because it cannot afford the risk of an overheated economy."
 "Given that a tightening will take place," he added, "the first question is when? And Aug. 16, when the Fed conducts its Federal Open Market Committee meeting, is the most likely time period."
 There is some question in the market as to whether the Fed might act before the meeting, but analysts say the policy makers will be tempted to wait because they will be getting a great deal more economic information in coming days. Between now and Aug. 16 there will be new data on producer prices, consumer prices, retail sales, business inventories, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment readings, industrial production, capacity utilization and housing starts.
 As to how far the Fed might move, Mr. Fine said, "At this juncture, a move of 50 basis points would seem proper to insure that the economy slows to its long-run noninflationary growth path, but with the housing and auto sectors showing signs of slowing, the Federal Open Market Committee may well choose to move a quarter of a percentage point now and thus have more time to analyze future data before acting further."
 The average rise of 300,000 in payroll jobs in each of the last five months and the acceleration in wage growth suggest a healthy momentum in the economy. And analysts say the Fed's worry now is that a lack of tightening would damage its credibility as an inflation fighter.
 
Worries About Statistics
 James P. Hale, an analyst with MMS International, observed that the sharp gains in nonfarm payrolls had not been matched by similar increases in household employment. "And given the difficulties with adjusting the new household survey, the Bureau of Labor officials are clearly putting more weight on the payroll data," he said.
 "In fact, the officials are worried that the current divergence might suggest that in September and October there will be a monstrous increase" in household employment, Mr. Hale said, adding, "If so, the Fed can look forward to the unemployment rate dipping in the mid-5 percent area and can expect to hear accusations that they are well behind in the tighening cycle."
 The Fed's last rate increase was on May 17, when it moved to raise both the discount rate, which is what it charges banks for loans, and the Federal funds rate, which is what banks charge one another for overnight loans. The Fed has raised the Federal funds rate four times this year.
 The increase in hourly wages in July was of particular interest, Mr. Hale said, given the Fed's concern about rising pressures on wages. Although the July rise followed a slight decline in June, he said the overall wage trend was clearly upward.
 "With slack in the labor market diminishing rapidly, the potential for future wage pressures is substantial," Mr. Hale said. "Wages are generally viewed as a lagging inflation indicator, so the urgency for the Fed to tighten is now much greater."
 
A Forecast of Lower Rates
 Jane Tedder, vice president and senior portfolio manager at the Security Management Company in Topeka, Kan., said the employment data did not change her longer-term outlook on bonds. "We have been anticipating that interest rates would move down between now and year end," Ms. Tedder said. "If anything, this could speed up the process."
 Her point was that a rate increase by the Fed on the shorter maturities would be positive for bonds with longer maturities. "But I will keep my seat belt tightened, because this is likely to be a bumpy ride," she said.
 Next week, the Treasury will offer debt securities as part of its quarterly refunding. In when-issued trading late yesterday, the three-year note, to be offered on Tuesday, was priced to yield 6.57 percent, while the 10-year note, scheduled for Wednesday, was priced to yield 7.25 percent. The yield for the 30-year bond, to be auctioned Thursday, was 7.43 percent.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls, Taking Its Cue From Treasury Securities

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most major currencies yesterday, after a Government report showing stronger-than-expected employment growth drove the bond market down sharply.
 Steady in overnight trading, the dollar rose just after the Labor Department said the economy added 259,000 jobs in July, convincing many traders that the economy is strong enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to push up interest rates. Higher rates can make dollar-denominated deposits more attractive.
 
 But the dollar quickly gave up its gains after prices of Treasury securities tumbled, renewing speculation that overseas investors were selling dollar-denominated investments. The July employment report raised concerns in the bond market that inflationary pressures were rising.
 "The dollar rose, then looked over its shoulder and saw that the bonds were writhing in agony," said David De Rosa, director of foreign-exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation. "The bond market is taking this as a catastrophe."
 The Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls rose last month by 259,000, exceeding analysts' estimates of about 200,000, and that hourly wages rose.
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5802 German marks, down from 1.5882 marks on Thursday. It had risen as high as 1.5915 marks just after the employment report was released yesterday morning. The dollar also fell to 100.25 Japanese yen from 100.55 yen.
 Currency traders look to the bond and stock markets for signs of whether dollar-denominated investments are in demand by overseas investors. Yesterday, they were not.
 "There isn't much aggressive buying of Treasury bonds from overseas investors," said Chris Iggo, international economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank. As long as that's the case, the dollar will be vulnerable to selloffs, he said.
 Even after yesterday's slump, the dollar remained well within the week's trading range against major currencies. Mr. Iggo and others do not expect the dollar to stray far from current levels until the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets on Aug. 16.
 "There's no direction for the dollar at the moment," Mr. Iggo said. "Most people expect the Fed's next move will be to raise rates."
 Meanwhile, the British pound rose to $1.5420 in New York yesterday from $1.5365, while the Canadian dollar was little changed at 72.11 United States cents.
 And the dollar slipped to 5.4100 French francs from 5.4340 francs, to 1.3336 Swiss francs from 1.3406 francs, and to 1,576 Italian lire from 1,585 lire.

HEADLINE: July Employment Data Spur Decline in Stocks

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stock prices fell again yesterday after a stronger-than-expected report on July employment increased speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates for a fifth time this year.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 18.77 points to close at 3,747.02. It ended the week off 17.48 points. Broader market indicators also declined. But trading volume was moderate.
 
 Analysts said the July unemployment rate was on target at 6.1 percent, against the previous month's 6.0 percent. But nonfarm payrolls posted a larger-than-expected gain of 259,000. Wall Street had been looking for an increase of about 200,000. Adding to traders' concerns about inflation was an increase in hourly wages.
 The Government's report set off a sharp selloff in the bond market, pushing interest rates higher. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond climbed to 7.54 percent, from 7.40 percent on Thursday.
 
Credit-Tightening Speculation
 While analysts said the July employment report did not seem to be enough by itself to push the Fed to raise rates, it nonetheless had investors doubting recent speculation that a credit tightening was not in the works.
 "It just creates that uncertainty, and therefore people are just as nervous as cats on a hot tin roof," said Ned Collins, head of United States equity trading for Diawa Securities.
 The Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet on Aug. 16, so the financial markets will be focusing on other economic data, including July producer and consumer price reports next Thursday and Friday.
 Still, some analysts played down the impact of yesterday's employment report on the stock market. David Holt, director of technical research at Wedbush Morgan, said he thought traders had used the report as an excuse to continue the market's selloff on Thursday, when the Dow fell 26.87 points.
 "It's not a climactic day," Mr. Holt said.
 Fears of higher interest rates pulled down some issues that are particularly sensitive to slowdowns in the economy. Caterpillar fell 2 7/8, to 104 3/4, even after shareholders approved a 2-for-1 stock split effective Aug. 9. International Paper declined1/2, to 74 3/8.
 But Scientific-Atlanta Inc. surged 4 3/4, to 39, after the telecommunications equipment company's earnings soundly beat analysts' forecasts.
 Nextel Communications jumped 1 1/8, to 26 3/4, in Nasdaq trading on news that it had reached a merger deal with Dial Page Inc. and was buying Motorola Inc.'s remaining United States specialized mobile radio licenses.
 Dial Page slipped 1 3/8, to 30 5/8, and Motorola finished up 1/8, to 52 5/8. The news raised other wireless communications stocks, including Onecomm, which rose 1 5/8, to 26 7/8.
 Fund American Enterprises Holdings climbed 3 7/8, to 74 7/8, after it said it had received an unsolicited bid for its Source One Mortgage Service Corporation subsidiary.
 In the broader market, declining issues led advances, 1,341 to 794, on New York Stock Exchange volume of 230.3 million shares.
 The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks fell 1.31 points, to 457.09. The American Stock Exchange index was off 1.01, to 440.34. And the Nasdaq index was off 1.51, to 718.67.
 The Big Board's composite index lost 0.77, to 252.50.
 In Tokyo, Japanese stocks ended lower yesterday. The Nikkei index of 225 issues slipped 155.14 points, to 20,521.70.

HEADLINE: An End Run on GATT

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
The White House fights to open trade; Congress fights to close it. Or at least that's the way it has been for the last half a century -- and the way it was when the Clinton Administration did battle to win passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement last year.
 But to the surprise and anguish of many who wish to bring down trade barriers, the White House is doing little to fight protectionist provisions in the legislation that must be enacted to underpin the new GATT pact. Indeed, key Administration players on trade seem bent on including what Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, calls "tools of choice for protectionists" in the bill expected to emerge from a House-Senate conference committee early next week.
 
 No member of the Administration and few knowledgeable members of Congress were prepared to talk about the unfolding negotiations on the record. But it is possible to piece together what is happening from background discussions.
In part, argues Representative Bill Archer, a Republican from Texas who specializes on trade issues and sits on the conference committee, the Administration's stance on the so-called anti-dumping provision reflects its "inclination to listen to protectionists allied with the Democratic Party." Industries including steel, autos and semiconductors have become expert at using the law against dumping, or importing goods below what is considered fair value, and they view the enabling legislation for GATT as an opportunity to increase their leverage.
 But the Administration's position is apparently also a product of skillful maneuvering by opponents of free trade within the White House. The Commerce Department's International Trade Administration, which often sees its primary task as reducing competition from foreign producers, has formed an alliance with the tiny but influential Office of the United States Trade Representative.
 And the two agencies so far have blunted the power of free traders in the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget. Treasury officials would not comment for the record, nor would economic analysts at the White House or at the Commerce Department.
 To deliver on the promises in the new pact of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, each country that signs the pact must change its laws to conform. And under the so-called fast track provisions of American trade law, the revised laws, written by Congressional committees with a lot of help from the White House, are voted up or down in the House and Senate -- no amendments allowed.
 That narrows the room for give and take, and for politics as usually practiced. The legislation presumably cannot stray far from what was initialed in Geneva. And where there is room for interpretation, all deals must be cut in committee. Still, this reality has not guaranteed the measure an easy ride.
 Trade experts expected tough bargaining on ancillary issues, ranging from how to recoup Government revenues lost from reduced tariffs to the extension of the fast track approval mechanism for future trade accords. What caught lobbyists working for major American exporters by surprise was the fierce attack on the letter and spirit of the pact itself -- and what the free traders contend is the cooperation of the Administration with the attackers.
 Until the 1980's, domestic industries sought protection from import competition under a variety of statutes. But in the last decade the Commerce Department, the agency with wide discretion to decide whether foreigners are indeed selling goods below cost or fair value, has increasingly viewed itself as a defender of those fighting imports. And by no coincidence, Mr. Hufbauer suggests, those seeking import relief have leaned increasingly on the anti-dumping laws.
 
Battle on Several Fronts
 The Commerce Department, which dominated the American negotiating position at the GATT talks, fought against provisions that would weaken its authority. And what it lost at Geneva, it has reportedly sought to regain -- or even toughen -- through the GATT enabling legislation.
 To do that, the department needed allies beyond the protectionist lobbies in Congress. And it found one in the Office of the Trade Representative, which under Mickey Kantor has expanded its role beyond the standard one of serving as the negotiator for others in the White House.
 Together the two allies reportedly neutralized opponents in the Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget, powerful agencies that generally support open trade but have bigger policy fish to fry at the moment. The result, argues Gary Horlick, a lawyer who represents a coalition of export-minded businesses including Cargill, Caterpillar, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard, was an Administration trade bill with the "most protectionist anti-dumping measures since the 1930's."
 Those measures require patience and generous amounts of caffeine to comprehend. But the basic principle of protection -- giving American companies a better chance in their home market -- is one that strikes a chord with most Americans. An example of what the Administration did not want in the bill makes the point.
 
Seeking an Exception
 Republicans on both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee asked for an amendment allowing the Administration to waive anti-dumping penalties when domestic producers could not supply adequate quantities to meet domestic demand. The idea was to avoid situations like the fiasco involving flat-panel computer displays in 1992, when American computer makers had to move production offshore so they could get color screens for laptops without paying anti-dumping duties. But the Commerce Department lobbied strongly against the waiver provision and managed to defeat it in both committees.
 Some flatly deny the new interpretation of Administration actions. "We take our GATT obligations very seriously," said a senior Administration official who insisted on anonymity, adding, "we are implementing the Uruguay Round" the best way the Administration knows how. And Administration supporters and even some of its critics say that where compromises have come, they have come as a result of domestic realpolitick, to preserve the possibility of having any bill at all.
 Lobbyists for major exporters are still hoping to rally support within the White House to soften the Administration line on dumping. And Republicans, who have been shouldering the free trade burden, haven't quite given up the fight. But Representative Archer concedes that he needs "the strong hand of the Administration to prevent the bill from moving away from the spirit of Geneva."

HEADLINE: More Bought On Credit

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve reported today that consumer credit rose in June for a 15th straight month.
 Borrowing increased $10.9 billion in June after rising $11.5 billion in the previous month. The May figure was revised upward from an earlier estimate of $10.4 billion.
 
 The June credit figure exceeded the expectations of analysts. But Sandra Shaber, an economist at the WEFA Group, a forecasting service in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said the healthy employment picture, as evidenced by a report by the Labor Department today, suggests that Americans are not borrowing excessively.
 "If we look at the whole picture, if we look at the debt-to-income ratio, borrowing is rising very slowly," she said. "People are borrowing in line with income growth. The ratio is below 17 percent. It had reached 19 percent before the recession started in 1990."
 The Commerce Department reported Monday that consumer spending rose a moderate four-tenths of 1 percent in June, matching the May increase. Retail sales were up six-tenths of a percent in June.
 Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity. Consumer credit includes all household debt not secured by real estate, like home equity loans and mortgages.
 The latest rise in borrowing brought outstanding debt to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $849.6 billion in June, up from $838.7 billion in May.
 Auto loans rose at an 18.8 percent annual rate, to $301.2 billion, after a 15.7 percent rise in May. Credit card borrowing climbed 15.5 percent, to $312.6 billion, after increasing 15.7 percent in May. Other forms of credit, including loans for mobile homes, education, boats, trailers and vacations, was up 11.6 percent to $235.9 billion, on top of a 17.9 percent advance in May.

HEADLINE: Japan Trade Surplus Rises

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 5

 BODY:
Japan's current account surplus rose 4.7 percent in June and was up 2.2 percent for the first half of the year, to a record $68.78 billion, the Finance Ministry said today.
 The current account is a broad measure of a nation's international economic flows and includes merchandise trade.
 
 For June, Japan's current account surplus rose 4.7 percent, to $11.11 billion, and officials said exports of ships helped lift the figure.
 The surplus for the first half was the biggest ever for any six-month period in part because of the high value of the yen against the United States dollar.
 In yen terms, the current account surplus for the January-June period was down 6.7 percent, but it was up 9.7 percent when measured in dollars because of the yen's 22.6 percent rise against the dollar since January 1993.
 It is expected the higher yen will eventually reduce Japan's surplus by forcing exporters to raise their overseas prices, making their products less attractive. At the same time, a stronger yen would theoretically encourage imports by making them cheaper in Japan.

HEADLINE: Panel Clears Fed Nominee

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 5

 BODY:
President Clinton's nomination of the economist Janet L. Yellen to the Federal Reserve Board was endorsed today by the Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 18 to 1.
 Her confirmation, which is expected by the full Senate before Congress recesses later this month, would bring the seven-member board to full strength for the first time since mid-February, when the resignations of David W. Mullins Jr. and Wayne D. Angell took effect.
 
 Alan S. Blinder, a former member of Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, was sworn in as vice chairman of the Fed in June.
 Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen are viewed as less likely to favor raising interest rates to quell inflation and slightly more likely to cut rates to stimulate growth than the five Republican appointees on the board.
 The only member of the committee who voted against the nomination, Senator Lauch Faircloth, Republican from North Carolina, told Ms. Yellen at the confirmation hearing that he was impressed with her academic credentials but would have preferred the President to have nominated someone with more experience in business. Ms. Yellen, 47, is a professor at the University of California at Berkeley.

HEADLINE: Inflation Index Is Up

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
A preliminary inflation index for July from the Center for International Business Cycle Research rose to 109.1 from a revised 108.9 in June, people familiar with the report said yesterday. The June index was revised down from a preliminary 109.2. The index rose seven straight months before leveling off in June. The index is closely watched by the financial markets because the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is said to follow it. The index does not forecast the size of price increases, just that they will occur, and has a lag time of about six months. The research center is based at the Columbia Business School.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
New Choices in Bonds, Gold and Real Estate

BYLINE: By Carole Gould 

 BODY:
The new Franklin/Templeton Strategic Income Fund aims for income by investing in issues of the United States and foreign governments, junk bonds, mortgage-backed securities, preferred stocks and convertible securities. Strategic income funds are a form of one-stop shopping, providing bond investors broad exposure around the world. But given the possibilities of currency moves, economic changes or political shifts in the issuing countries, the fund's share price may be volatile.
The Gabelli Gold Fund is managed by Caesar Bryan, who recently resigned from Lexington's Goldfund and Strategic Investments fund. The Lexington Strategic fund was the best-performing mutual fund in 1993, as Mr. Bryan nimbly rode rising gold prices. His fund was highly leveraged to gold, making share prices volatile; witness Strategic's 11.7 percent decline in the first six months of 1994.
 
 The Columbia Real Estate Equity Fund is part of a boom in realty funds. The fund aims for capital appreciation and income by buying equity in real estate companies. It plans to own mainly real estate investment trusts, which are publicly traded, and a strong performance will be predicated mostly on a turnaround in the real estate market.

HEADLINE: Progress in Midtown

 BODY:
Times Square is another step closer to renewal, and none too soon. It has been 10 years since New York City and the state's Urban Development Corporation struck their first deal with developers, and twice as long since a neighborhood priest organized community pressure to clean out the area's crime and sleaze.
From the beginning, this project has been a magnet for controversy, particularly its soaring office towers at the intersection of Broadway and 42d Street. Construction of the towers is now on hold, because the last thing midtown Manhattan needs is four new empty skyscrapers. But plans for upgrading the once tawdry, now deserted block between Broadway and Eighth Avenue are well underway. 
 The 1993 deadline for starting construction of the towers was lifted two years ago in a tentative agreement that has now been completed in detail. Final official approval is expected by mid-October, but the developers -- the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty -- are to start removing debris from condemned buildings in the project area right away.
Until construction begins, maybe in the next four or five years, maybe much later, there will be "interim" development, a halfway concept that involves creating new stores, eateries, bright lights and other diversions that the developers can shut down when they want to start building.
The developers have been at odds with state and city officials over how glitzy the immediate development should be. This reflects a natural tension between developers who are more interested in filling office space from 9 to 5, and the public authorities focused on creating a lively street scene for fun-seeking locals and tourists, day and night.
Times Square's trademark billboard neon and flashing lights were a big sticking point in the final round of negotiations. Signs like those are expensive. As an advertising medium, they are old-fashioned. But they are Times Square, and the developers have finally been persuaded to pay for them.
One conspicuous critic, the Municipal Art Society, is so scornful of the project's overall financing that it advocates, even at this late date, negotiating a new deal. Financial calculations apart, officials fear that further delay in a project that has already survived 47 lawsuits would risk losing the interest that Walt Disney, Warner Brothers, Madame Tussaud and others have shown in establishing themselves on a renewed 42d Street.
The street has come a long way since that first community protest in the early 1970's. It still has a long way to go -- the faster the better.

HEADLINE: Yankees Aren't to Blame for State of the Bronx

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Bombing in the Bronx" (Op-Ed, July 26): I do not disagree with all of Matt Bai's points, but he wrongly gives much of the blame to the New York Yankees for the moral and social decay not only of the area surrounding Yankee Stadium, but throughout the Bronx as well. 
 A loyal Yankees fan and onetime home-game regular, I recently attended a night game at the stadium and found myself caught in a terrible postgame traffic jam. While not being able to move for what seemed hours, motorists fell prey to four examples of "neighborhood children," with lead pipes and chains, hawking beers from a filthy trash barrel at $10 a can.
The intimidating salesmen were doing a booming business, thanks to the cooperation of the police (there were none) and a brilliant customer offer of "Buy the beer or die!"
Are these the neighborhood children who should receive discounted bleacher seats?
I'm also insulted Mr. Bai thinks fans are staying away from the stadium because George Steinbrenner, the team's owner, tells them the area is unsafe. Give fans credit for being able to assess the perils of traveling to and from the stadium without opinions from an owner they don't respect. The area is as unsafe as a child playing with matches.
The Yankees are involved with outreach programs for children in New York City. But none of those programs call on them to protect fans from thugs in children's clothing, nor should they.

HEADLINE: Yankees Aren't to Blame for State of the Bronx;
On Road to Recovery

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Bombing in the Bronx" (Op-Ed, July 26) raises an issue that is central to the episode involving Richard Kraft, the Yankees' official whose remarks about area residents resulted in his resignation. There has been bias against the people of the South Bronx for decades. 
 The image most often called to mind of the South Bronx is that of burned-out blocks with deserted buildings. Banks have left most of the area. Large retailers have written off those living here. The primary medical treatment needed by a population living in what is considered to be the poorest Congressional district in the United States remains inadequate.
But the South Bronx is on the road to recovery. The nonprofit sector has taken the initiative, at times with government aid and at times without. Affordable housing is appearing, as rehabs and new construction.
Drug treatment, homeless programs, job training and AIDS programs are empowering residents to become contributing community members. Borough President Fernando Ferrer is unifying numerous components to develop an urban revitalization that should dispel this negative bias once and for all.
The Yankee management can assume leadership in revitalizing the South Bronx. Its support and partnership in providing a strong and effective influence will reap benefits for years to come.

Offer Made To Acquire Source One

BYLINE: By ANDREA ADELSON 

 BODY:
Fund American Enterprises Holdings Inc. said yesterday that it had received an unsolicited proposal to buy its Source One Mortgage Services Corporation, another example of merger activity surging through the mortgage industry as interest rates rise and home sales level off.
 Shares in Fund American, a holding company based in Norwich, Vt., soared as much as 12 percent yesterday, closing at $74.875, up $3.85, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
 Source One, the nation's second-largest independent mortgage banker after Countrywide Credit Industries, could fetch as much as $500 million, based on prices paid for two recent mortgage banking companies, according to Guy Cecala, editor and publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a weekly trade publication.
 
A Flurry of Mergers
 Earlier this week, Chase Manhattan Bank said it would buy the American Residential Holding Corporation for $348 million. Industrywide merger activity was sparked in May when the Chemical Banking Corporation agreed to acquire the Margaretten Financial Corporation in a $330 million transaction.
 A possible bidder for Source One is Nationsbank, based in Charlotte, N.C., which analysts said came up a loser in bids for Margaretten and American Residential.
 Fund American declined to identify the potential buyer and cautioned that it was not committed to selling its only remaining operating unit. "We would have to get a very attractive offer before we'd consider it," Terry Baxter, a company spokesman, said.
 Source One, based in Farmington Hills, Mich., services $38.9 billion in mortgages, a portfolio twice the size of American Residential's. The company, which has 2,000 employees and 100 offices, generated just $3.4 billion in new mortgages in the first half of the year, a ranking of 17th in the industry.
 Mortgage-banking companies are alluring to commercial lenders as a result of their established branch networks and the potential cost savings to be wrung out of combining servicing portfolios, Mr. Cecala said.
 The emphasis of Source One on servicing, in which it gathers fees for collecting monthly payments and handling delinquencies and foreclosures, has resulted in poor earnings in recent years. Fee income becomes volatile during a refinancing boom such as the one set off by the three-year decline in interest rates, which bottomed out in October at 6.8 percent for a 30-year fixed mortgage.
 "Rapid refinancing hurts a large servicing portfolio the most," Mr. Baxter said.
 The ascent in interest rates, to 8.38 percent this week, has slowed new lending and depressed earnings of mortgage companies, making them takeover targets. Source One's operating profits declined 7 percent in the first half, to $21.6 million.
 A prime beneficiary of a Source One takeover would be John J. Byrne, Fund American's chairman. He owns 9 percent of the company's 8.3 million shares and has warrants that would lift his ownership to 20 percent.
 Fund American is sitting on about $1 billion in assets left over from its $3.3 billion sale of the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company in 1990. Source One had been Fireman's mortgage company.

Uniform Diversity In California

BYLINE: By Tessa Melvin 

 BODY:
DIVERSITY describes the student population in Long Beach, Calif., where Cambodian and Spanish are heard almost as often as English. But when public schools open next month, the city's 50,000 elementary and middle-school children will all, in one important sense, look alike.
To combat "gang wear," or gang-related clothing, soothe the frenzy over designer clothing that highlights economic disparities and help pupils focus on learning, the city's school board has agreed to mandate uniforms for all the lower grades. 
 The move follows a five-year experiment involving 11 Long Beach pilot schools. The school administrators said that required uniforms cut absenteeism, reduced group conflicts and improved student performance. "In schools without uniforms, the kids are polarized along racial and ethnic lines," said Richard Van Derlaan, a spokesman for the district. "With uniforms, there's more mixing. We are really replacing one uniform with another."
Dozens of school districts in southern California have experimented with the idea, though none have gone as far as Long Beach, whose decision has prompted a flood of inquiries from around the country.
In Baltimore, economics provided the impetus for the seven-year-old voluntary-uniform program in 90 percent of the elementary schools. "As soon as people realized uniforms were cheaper, much cheaper, they all supported them," said Justin B. Wood, ombudsman for the superintendent of schools. Student uniforms, Mr. Wood said, have eliminated brand-name envy and teasing over students' designer clothing while increasing self-esteem and school pride.
Long Beach has set aside $175,000 to defend itself against possible legal challenges. And a bill explicitly permitting districts to require uniforms is before the California Legislature with bipartisan support; the measure, with a provision promoted by the American Civil Liberties Union allowing parents to opt out of the program, has been endorsed by a broad coalition of school groups.

HEADLINE: Jump-Starting Capitalism

BYLINE: By Michael Winerip 

DATELINE: SHIPROCK, N.M.

 BODY:
TERESA Whalen, an M.B.A. candidate at the University of Michigan, was having another action-packed day. She was helping develop a financing package for two Navajos who want to open a roadside stand selling roast mutton sandwiches. She was putting together an employee training program for three Burger Kings here on the reservation. She was talking to professors at Navajo Community College about creating a Navajo-owned water quality testing laboratory.
She was having a blast. "I can't wait to get my hands on that lending circle," she said as the four-wheel vehicle she was riding in bounced along a dirt road and over a mountain pass, heading toward her next appointment. 
 This was precisely why she'd decided to go to business school -- to help the poor.
Same for Jim Pfeffer, her M.B.A. classmate and partner on these Navajo projects. "You want to make a difference," said Mr. Pfeffer. "Help people who traditionally got the shaft."
Ms. Whalen and Mr. Pfeffer are members of the University of Michigan M.B.A. Domestic Corps, a program started two summers ago that places graduate business students in economically depressed areas across the country, ranging from Detroit's inner city to a Michigan suburb where a General Motors plant shut down to Indian reservations.
These M.B.A. students are trying to use their newly acquired business skills to jump-start capitalism in places that prosperity has passed by.
The idea grew out of a similar University of Michigan M.B.A. international program. In 1990 Michigan began sending M.B.A. students to Poland and the Soviet Union to work with entrepreneurs trying to establish businesses in the countries where Communism had collapsed or was losing its hold.
It soon dawned on the Michigan program director, Marian Krzyzowski, that the problems facing the new Eastern European entrepreneurs struggling to overcome 70 years of Communist rule weren't too different from those facing Indians on a reservation, where a central tribal government dominates a heavily planned economy.
Mr. Krzyzowski found Navajo businessmen like Richard Mike quite receptive to an M.B.A. domestic corps. "We need help changing the economic culture here," says Mr. Mike, who owns three Burger Kings, making him one of the six largest Navajo businessmen on a reservation the size of West Virginia. (The only large private companies, mining concerns, are not owned by Navajos).
"The M.B.A. Corps' work in Poland gives me a lot of hope," Mr. Mike says. "Poland's had three generations of Communist rule, but they're succeeding in setting up a market economy. Our people have no role models, no business culture. Being one of the few Indian businessmen, I feel like the Lone Ranger."
 
'Still in the Minority'
 The University of Michigan is not alone. "There are an increasing number of programs of this nature at business schools, though they're still in the minority," says Richard Edelstein, a director of the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business. "Michigan's is among the best."
In 1990 the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina started its own M.B.A. Enterprise Corps. This year 22 graduate business schools, including most of the Ivy League, Stanford University, Duke University and the University of Chicago, sent 85 recent M.B.A.'s to work in Eastern Europe and Africa. And this summer, for the first time, the Kenan Institute began a domestic spinoff, an Urban Enterprise Corps, placing 7 M.B.A.'s in minority-run North Carolina businesses and paying their salaries for a year.
Among other business schools with programs aimed at helping poor and minority communities in this country are U.C.L.A., Rutgers and Wharton. The business corps are a 1990's version of Vista and the Peace Corps. "I don't know a lot about sociology," said Mr. Pfeffer, who spent the summer of '93 working with Michigan's international corps in Poland, and last summer here. "But I have a feeling there's a social change going on in our country. A lot more people are doing what we're doing as opposed to following the money grub."
There have been many more students applying than Michigan's international and domestic corps can accommodate -- 100 applicants for three dozen slots. Next year the school plans to double its domestic corps to two dozen students. Michigan's domestic corps students are paid a $10,000 stipend for the summer. The two assigned here live in spartan Navajo Community College dorms.
After graduating from Wayne State University and working several years in a Detroit employment program, Ms. Whalen was ready to return to school. She considered getting a master's in social work, but worried it would not give her the clout she was looking for. "If you're going to have a career pushing liberal causes," she says, "for anyone in power to take you seriously, you have to have a background they understand. If you're talking about developing businesses, your background should be in business."
Still, she was nervous about going for an M.B.A. "When I came to business school," said Ms. Whalen, "I thought I'd be ostracized for not being a money-grubber."
It is hard for outsiders to understand how different the Navajo economy is from the rest of America's. As Mr. Mike says to visitors to the reservation, "You didn't realize there was a socialist government in the middle of America, did you?" Starting in the 19th century, the United States Government dominated and controlled the Navajo economy, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. As the United States began to loosen its reins in the 1960's, the Navajo tribal government jumped in and took control, but these Navajo leaders remade themselves in the image of the Federal bureaucracy.
Today the Navajo tribal government is the major employer on the reservation -- 5,000 jobs. The utilities, the paper products company, the largest farm, the community college and much of the housing are owned and controlled by the central tribal government.
These government-controlled businesses have a history of being unprofitable and have not been able to turn the reservation economy around. The reservation unemployment rate ranges between 40 and 50 percent; 56 percent of Navajos here live below the poverty line.
Complicating matters for the entrepreneur is the Navajos' view of land -- that it is collectively owned by the tribe. An individual Navajo doesn't own land; the best he can do, if he wants to build a business or home, is lease grazing rights. So, for example, King Mike, Richard's brother, a business professor at Navajo Community College, would like to have his own home, but instead lives in shabby college-owned housing.
This causes all kinds of economic problems for aspiring entrepreneurs. If you don't own land or a home, you probably have no collateral to get a loan from a bank.
It creates crazy problems for Navajo employers and employees. Glenda Kaisem, a Navajo, is the manager of the Burger King in Chinle, where she works 14-hour days. Her family has a home 150 miles away; she'd like to rent an apartment in Chinle. But there are no rental apartments and the only trailer park is full. She is lucky, though -- she lives in a spare office above the Burger King.
 
Basic Capitalism
 And so, much of the M.B.A. domestic corps effort here is basic grass-roots capitalism, aimed at helping Navajos scrape together the initial investment to leverage a small loan and create a new business.
The students have worked closely with Adah, a new Navajo lending circle aimed at starting what M.B.A.'s call "micro-enterprises" and what a lay person here would call a flea-market booth.
The lending circle is made up of a half-dozen aspiring business people who hope to borrow $500 each. Instead of putting up collateral for a loan, they are asked to take a 15-hour business course. All six pledge to be responsible for their circle's loans; if one member defaults, the other five must make up the loss. (First Nations Development, a small, Indian-oriented investment group based in Virginia, will provide the loans when the lending circle here is ready.)
The part-time executive director of the Navajo lending circle program is David McKenzie, a Navajo and a retired Baptist minister. When the M.B.A. students asked what help he needed, he answered, "Pretty much everything."
At a lending circle meeting Shirley Montoya, a Navajo member, worried that mothers who got business loans would feel pressure from their families to use the money for personal reasons. "The way we handled that in Detroit," Ms. Whalen said, "we made the checks out directly" to the business people's suppliers.
Somebody else suggested asking for token collateral like a washing machine or bike, but Ms. Whalen said, "You don't want to make a threat you can't enforce."
The students have also worked with the Navajo Community College faculty to develop a new business course on the reservation economy. The college, Professor Mike says, "offers a regular business curriculum; however, that doesn't apply to the reservation." He would like to see a course that would teach about the tribal government's complicated building and zoning restrictions, its grazing rights leases and housing policy.
In addition, the 1993 Michigan students helped the Navajo small-business association defeat an income tax that the central tribal government had hoped to impose.
But it is still too early to say how much long-term impact the Michigan corps will have here. The students love it, and say they are inspired to continue with this grass-roots work.
Steve Uline, who served here in 1993, called it "a great experience." But, he says, "It was harder to accomplish things and change things than I'd hoped. You have to be careful about going in with the idea that you're going to change the world."
Most of the Michigan domestic and international corps students serve in the summer after they've finished the first year of the two-year M.B.A. program. Both the students and Mr. Krzyzowski, the director, worry that three months each summer is not enough time to make an impact. In contrast, the University of North Carolina program requires people to have completed their M.B.A., and has a minimal commitment of a year.
The other danger is that the program will get too good -- and too threatening to the central tribal government. There have been several instances when Peace Corps or Vista workers have been kicked out of a region.
The tribal government says it favors independent business development, but Mr. Mike is skeptical. "The way the economy's set up now," he says, "Indians on the reservation are a nation of clerks. A lot of people with safe tribal jobs would have a lot to lose if that changes. I hope the University of Michigan has enough experience to resist or take the pressure."

HEADLINE: END PAPER;
Ode to Academic Nastiness

BYLINE: By William H. Honan 

 BODY:
LAST summer, Prof. Thomas J. Kniesner took a strong dislike to a book called "The Overworked American," by the Harvard economist Juliet B. Schor. After dissecting the book in a seven-page review in the Journal of Human Resources, Professor Kniesner, who teachers economics at Indiana University in Bloomington, laid into it with a vengeance.
Professor Schor's thesis -- that Americans are working too hard -- is "overwhelmed" by a lack of supporting evidence, he wrote, and then scathingly likened the book to "diet or exercise books that offer quick weight loss without inconvenient sweating or rearranging one's eating habits." 
 Asked about the vitriolic tone of the review, Professor Schor said it may have been inspired by professional jealousy because her book, published in 1992, received rave reviews in the popular press and appeared briefly on best-seller lists.
Whether Professor Kniesner's review in Human Resources was justified or not, almost no one in the academic world denies that professorial nastiness -- intense ever since universities were founded in the Middle Ages -- has never been more vicious than it is today.
The phenomenon is widely perceived and commented upon. Henry Kissinger says the bitterness of academic disputes "is in inverse proportion to the importance of the subject." And in their recent critique of higher education, "Up the University" (Addison-Wesley 1993), the brothers Robert and Jon Solomon declare that "the level of mutual respect in academia is probably the lowest of any job or profession in America, except perhaps for professional wrestlers."
After spending a year teaching at Kenyon College in Ohio, the writer P. F. Kluge has compared the savage internecine warfare waged by the faculty of the small liberal arts college to the atmosphere of "downtown Mogadishu," and quoted an anonymous professor who described the faculty hatreds with the words: "We're talking Yugoslavia, plus."
Scholars differ as to who or what turned up the heat. Some say the economy-driven faculty reductions of the last three years have embittered many young professors who now find themselves thrust into fierce competition for a dwindling number of jobs.
"If you give a rave review to someone in your specialty, you may be helping that person get the job that's ideal for you," said one young academician who spoke on condition of anonymity. She added: "But if you don't rave you've made an enemy and you're likely to get the chop when that person's turn comes around."
Daniel S. Hamermesh, a professor of economics at the University of Texas at Austin who has published several articles on academic etiquette and jokingly calls himself the Ann Landers of higher education, says he thinks young professors "may be even meaner than their predecessors because they grew up in the 'Me Generation,' believing that virtually everything is due them."
He said the coddling of these young people had ill prepared them for the tough-minded give-and-take of scholarship, and that when their ideas were sharply questioned they were likely to explode in fury.
Professor Hamermesh added: "Academic life attracts people who are not good in a hierarchical situation. They are just ornery."
In their book the Solomon brothers lay the blame on overspecialization, arguing that as scholars learn more and more about less and less they condemn themselves to a life that is the psychological equivalent of that of a caged rat. "Pressed in against one another, perhaps for decades at a time, professors grow to despise one another," they write. "They prudently put as much distance as is available between themselves, but inevitably two tails get tangled, one steps on the other's toes, one gives a course that conflicts with another, one makes a statement at a meeting in which he or she casually ridicules another, and the battle is enjoined [sic]."
Others insist that whatever the cause of the present viciousness it is less important than understanding the long tradition from which it arises. Georges May, a former provost, dean and professor of French at Yale University, said academic disputes had always been heated because professors believe they are engaged in the search for truth, and those who claim to seek the truth are quick to find infidels.
"The university is a daughter of the church," he said. "We have inherited from it the costumes, the vocabulary and the concern for truth, and when the truth is at stake you may regard someone who disagrees with you as a heretic."
Professor May also said that present-day backbiting was mild compared with the invective that Leninists and Trotskyists flung at each other in the pages of Partisan Review in the 1930's, and that long before that academicians were known to have fought duels to settle their professional differences.
Scholarly warfare has spawned some classic putdowns. In recent years the historian David Hackett Fischer attacked Daniel Boorstin, the former Librarian of Congress, as "simple-minded, uninformed and seriously inaccurate." J. H. Round once called a fellow historian, Douglas Southall Freeman, "a superseded fossil." The English historian G. R. Elton wrote that Erik Erikson's widely praised psychoanalytic study of Martin Luther "does not contribute anything of value to an understanding of Luther or his age," and added with a sneer: "Insofar as it has been responsible for John Osborne's play, it may even need condemnation."
A possible consolation is that the wounds inflicted in some of these battles heal without leaving permanent scars. In 1961, for example, an economist named Diran Bodenhorn published a textbook called "Intermediate Price Theory." In the acknowledgments he thanked two colleagues for their help. Barbara Bergmann, an economist at American University in Washington, wrote a scorchingly negative review for the American Economic Review in which she listed the names of the professors who were thanked for their help, adding tartly: "They should sue."
"It didn't exactly stunt my career," chirped Professor-emeritus Bodenhorn, who went on to become chairman of the department of economics at Cleveland State University.

HEADLINE: New Pressures on Vocational Education

BYLINE: By Laura Mansnerus 

 BODY:
First, as vocational education enrollments wane for another year, set aside the tradition of practicing for adult work with jigsaws and adding machines. It's going. And most educators say, fine, leave it behind.
Next, consider the relentlessly climbing youth unemployment rates, the dwindling earnings of nonprofessional workers in their 20's and the complaints from employers that high school graduates are not prepared for the workplace. 
 So how to serve the half who do not go on to four-year colleges, or who do and then drop out and drift? How to respond to the news that high school voc-ed gives its customers no advantage in career choice or earnings? What's going to replace wood shop and bookkeeping class?
A few answers have emerged from the scramble to replace the old model of vocational education, which dates to World War I-era legislation. They rely on two perhaps incongruous approaches: getting kids into the workplace to learn by experience, and giving vocational students academic basics of the same caliber that college-prep students have.
Either way, most of the new models bear the popular rubric "school-to-work" -- which is partly a dressier term for "voc ed" and partly a reflection of genuine innovation.
In Philadelphia, public high school students can choose the Academy for Fitness, Health Promotion and Sports Education, or the Hotel Restaurant and Tourism Academy. In Rothsay, Minn., students run a lumberyard, hardware store and grocery, which together took in $450,000 last year. In Broome County, N.Y., sophomores can apply for four-year apprenticeships that extend through a two-year community college program.
"Vocational education is a large enterprise slowly turning in the right direction, punctuated by very impressive examples of how to do it well," said Marc Bendick, a labor economist in Washington who was staff director of the city school board's commission to restructure vocational education. "In parts of the system, if you woke up Rip Van Winkle style from 1917 you'd feel right at home, and in other parts of the system they've made some marvelous changes."
If the marvelous changes are disparate, they reflect disparate views of what school, and particularly high school, is for.
The failures of the marketplace have reinforced the critics who say it's mostly futile to train a high school student for a specific job. While conservatives like Diane Ravitch and Chester Finn prescribe a more rigorous and traditional academic curriculum for all, the view from left of center is that everyone learns more when academic and practical skills are cultivated together, in a curriculum that abandons the old tracks.
At the same time, out-of-school training has brought a rush of interest, apparent in the brand-new School-to-Work Opportunities Act, which will pass out Federal grants to make apprenticeships and other work-based programs bloom all over the nation.
The slow crippling of vocational education began about 10 years ago. A flurry of national reports -- "A Nation at Risk" in 1983 was probably the most prominent -- spoke sternly of academic deficiencies and set off something like the Sputnik panic a generation earlier. Academic graduation requirements notched up, which vocational educators say discouraged concentration in vocational subjects. Budget cuts compounded the effect.
According to the National Assessment of Vocational Education, a huge Federal research project that made its final report to Congress last month [NB: JULY], the proportion of students concentrating in vocational subjects dropped to 28 percent in 1990 from 34 percent in 1982. Another Department of Education survey, which asked high school sophomores to identify themselves by track, found a starker result: the percentage calling themselves vocational students, as distinct from general-track or college prep, dropped from 21 percent in 1980 to 7.9 percent in 1990. And the consensus is that the decline continues now.
In 1990, Congress amended several longstanding Federal policies on vocational education. The legislation sent more money to poorer districts and two-year colleges. It also called for the "integration" of occupational and academic studies in the high school classroom.
Hard to define and harder to practice, integration is a popular idea. "Now, it's a given," said Larry (cq) Rosenstock, who worked on the 1990 legislation and is now executive director of the Rindge School of Technical Arts in Cambridge, Mass. In that respect, educators have turned 180 degrees since the 1984 Congressional hearings in which, Mr. Rosenstock recalled, "it was considered blasphemy" to suggest dismantling the separate vocational track.
"If it's a second track, the problem is that from the front end you're sorting by income and by the education level of one's parents," Mr. Rosenstock said. "That has nothing to do with intellectual capacity.
"Vocational education is the starkest form of class sorting, so the first question is to insure that it's not a separate track, because that's doomed to failure. The only people who advocate a second track are those who are talking about someone else's kids."
As Mr. Rosenstock defines integration, "it's taking the best of each -- vocational methods and academic content."
At Rindge, ninth graders can begin with "Cityworks," a yearlong exploration of Cambridge in which students make maps, models and architectural blueprints, take photographs, and conduct interviews and write oral histories.
In the school's carpentry course, students study deforestation and zoning; in a class called "electric car," which has them replacing the gas-propulsion systems in city vehicles with electric systems, they discuss environmental issues.
"Kids feel like they're doing adult work," said Mr. Rosenstock. "They're kinetic. They use that moment to do the midwifery of rigorous academic content."
Still, Mr. Rosenstock says this approach is more admired than imitated -- a suspicion confirmed in the National Assessment's report. The researchers found that efforts to integrate vocational and academic curriculums were widespread but "new and small."
The National Assessment was not much more engouraging in its larger conclusions: that "most secondary vocational education is still very traditional," that the programs "are not as coherent or rigourous as they should be" and that defections to academic courses have left vocational programs with a heavy concentration of disadvantaged students.
The brighter spots are programs involving coordination with employers or postsecondary schools. The vocabulary and the practices overlap, but here are the main offerings in the new voc-ed catalog:
TECH PREP: Hardly anyone argues with "tech prep," the catchword for programs that span the last two years of high school and two years of postsecondary training. The goal is an associate's degree or equivalent certificate in a field like engineering technology or agriculture.
"We realized we couldn't promise kids that they would be job ready when they left high school," said Alan J. Miller, director of the program at the Hillsboro Union district in Oregon. "We said, 'We can give you training for entry-level jobs, but that will require two years of community college in most cases."'
Hillsboro's two high schools and 24 others in the area worked with Portland Community College to design four-year sequences of courses that would fulfill associate's degree requirements in fields including medical technology and nursing, accounting and manufacturing technology.
That is still rare, though. As one researcher for the National Assessment reported from the field: "Tech prep is just a concept here; it appears to be widely supported but not well understood."
CAREER ACADEMIES: These are the laboratories of integration. The idea started in Philadelphia, where an electrical-trades academy opened in 1969 at Edison High School. The project was meant to keep at-risk students in school, but as the academies multiplied and extended to fields like health and aviation, more college prep students enrolled and the curriculums were adjusted. Now, about half the city's academy graduates go to college.
Another example is the Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences; its success shows that "in learning, the context can be quite arbitrary," said Mr. Bendick, the labor economist.
"The graduates of that school, who are very heavily minority, go to college in droves," he said. "They've learned biology, and they tend to become pre-med majors. What they learn in that school is to be hellishly smart science students."
Where the idea is executed well, those who don't go to college have marketable job training. The drawback is that well- run academies tend to siphon better students from the rest of the system.
APPRENTICESHIP: Traditionally offered by labor unions to a small number of young men in skilled trades, apprencticeships are rapidly gaining enthusiasts in education. "The capacity of teen-agers to select a career direction and follow a path toward it is vastly underestimated in the United States," said Prof. Stephen Hamilton of Cornell University, who runs an apprenticeship program in Broome County, New York. "In Germany, the majority make a career choice between 16 and 18."
The Broome County apprentices, who are paid, work for 10 employers, including I.B.M., Blue Cross/Blue Shield and several manufacturers and hospitals.
The program has elements of tech prep, since students are expected to continue their jobs and their education for at least two years after high school. Of the first class of 22, who enrolled in the fall of 1991, 20 completed the first year. Most of those entered either four-year or two-year colleges, and most, Professor Hamilton said, "remained on their career path."
The program also draws on cooperative education, which has been around for most of the century. But Professor Hamilton noted that most co-op arrangements last one year at most. "So this is co-op education to the fourth power," he said. "It's a coherent, sequential program up to four years long."
Many states have pilot programs, but none have much potential for expansion, said James R. Stone 3d, an education professor at the University of Minnesota. "Apprenticeships are very hot right now, but it's hard to get businesses to sign on," he said. "I was in a meeting where somebody said, 'How can we justify hiring unskilled kids when we're laying off their highly skilled parents?' "

SCHOOL ENTERPRISE: School enterprises are everywhere. Larry Rosenstock's students in Cambridge design and market bread boards and T-shirts. All over the nation, construction-trades students build houses; in Montgomery County, Maryland, a program to sell them on the open market brings in students in landscaping, architecture, interior design, accounting, marketing.
In Rothsay, Minn., high school students -- this year's graduating class was 27 -- took over a lumberyard and hardware store that had closed, and when the town's only grocery store failed, they acquired that, too. For credit and grades, students learn retail management, accounting, marketing and even meat-cutting. They obtained their own grants and a bank loan and formed a corporation, and the enterprise is breaking even.
Perhaps because Rothsay's students were doing well -- the dropout rate is consistently zero, and more than 90 percent go on to postsecondary education -- there was resistance in the town of 500. "Some said this is not what education should look like," said Tom Fossy, a former teacher and insurance executive who helped develop the project. "But what the business world wants is people who are creative, who are problem-solvers and lifelong learners; in school, we call those people disruptive. The business world wants people who work well together; in school, we call that cheating."
Then, of course, there are the old ways, which do lumber on with new computers and electronic equipment. And not everyone says this is a bad thing.
The new approaches are laudable and "ultimately fit together nicely," said Professor Stone, "but all are doing the same thing voc ed had been trying to do since the 1917 legislation, which is try to help young people make the formal transition to the workplace."
"The apprenticeship people see kids easing into work via the German model. Then you have people saying, 'Use the workplace as a lab.' Those who are pushing integration see it as a better way to learn. Then you've got the traditional voc-ed people scratching their heads and saying: 'But we did this already. What is it? Do we have bad breath?' That's in a way exactly what they have."
They have in response tried changes in presentation. The Philadelphia school system's vocational education office, for example, was recently renamed Education for Employment. The teachers' journal School Shop changed its name, too, to Tech Directions, and ran an article entitled "PR for Vo-Tech -- How to Get and Keep Students."
Vocational educators have more than a public relations problem, though. The data show not just a declining interest in a vocational track but a huge appetite for college -- and thus for college-prep courses. "Most policy makers seriously overestimate the number of students who want to go to work right after graduation," said Kenneth Gray, a professor of education at Pennsylvania State University.
 
Few Envision a Vocational Future
 In a Department of Education survey of high school seniors in 1992, only 5.3 percent said they expected to go no further than high school. As for the seniors' future occupations, only 2.8 percent said they expected to be employed in skilled trades, 3.5 percent in clerical occupations and 1.9 percent in sales, while 59 percent were planning careers in professional fields.
Even the model vocational programs meet some resistance. Mr. Miller in Oregon said the school's tech prep curriculum "is catching on rather slowly in some regards, because high school students and their parents typically believe that a four-year college degree is in the future for everyone."
"We're dealing with that bias," he said.
Many of those students are bound to be frustrated, said Professor Gray, whose main interest is "the average student -- the bottom of the iceberg, you might say." He continued: "We need to help students see that there are ways to win other than aspiring to a four-year degree and turning into a lawyer."
Professor Hamilton at Cornell agrees that a four-year college is not for everyone -- though he says the students' aspirations are simply a rational reaction to the job market. "A manager of an American multinational in Germany told me the technicians in his plant, trained though apprenticeship, could do many of the things engineers do in this country," he said. "When you consider that these people started their careers when they were 15 or 16, you have to think we're spending time and money that we don't need to spend."
College or no college, Professor Stone in Minneapolis says, regretfully, that predictions of shortages of highly skilled workers are exaggerated. He cites Labor Department projections that the job category producing the most employment over the next 20 years is salesperson, with secretary next on the list.
"It's a de-skilled marketplace," he said.
"I have a nightmare. We'll do everything we want to do, and the kids will all be skilled and highly trained, and they'll be flipping burgers at McDonald's."

HEADLINE: The Newest Moynihan

BYLINE: By Todd S. Purdum; Todd S. Purdum is a correspondent in the Washington bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
I DON'T THINK THE AIR-CONDITIONER ADDS MUCH," Daniel Patrick Moynihan says, his long, slim fingers fiddling with the vents of a rental van on the morning after Memorial Day. "I'm going to suggest we turn the air-conditioner off. It's a beaut-i-ful day. We don't get many. We just open the windows, you see, and air comes."
The Moyni-van is rolling out of Binghamton, an old shoemaking city in the Southern Tier of New York State, toward the Democratic State Convention in Buffalo. The candidate has just held a small rally on the courthouse lawn in front of a bronze statue of Daniel S. Dickinson, the last New Yorker before him to head the lordly Finance Committee of the United States Senate, in 1850. With that event, Moynihan has formally begun his campaign for a fourth term in an office it once seemed entirely improbable that he would win. 
 Kevin Ryan, his young driver and personal aide, stammers and begins a balancing act that will last all day: toying with the knobs of the air- conditioner, trying to tune it low enough to escape his boss's notice without suffocating the passengers in the rear seats. But the Senator, who simply rolls up his window the moment the noise of rushing highway makes conversation impossible, is already on to other things. He begins a running discourse on the history, geology, architecture and politics of the cities and counties he is passing through on this brilliant May day, his voice spluttering and stuttering like Jiffy Pop on a campfire.
Now he explains the depth of the Finger Lakes; now the origin of cobblestone houses; now the prevalence of towns like Homer, Marathon and Ithaca, named in a fit of 19th-century republican idealism. As the van approaches Auburn along Route 20 -- the path Alexis de Tocqueville took on his survey of American prisons in the 1830's -- the topic is the past, and the dangers of its casual disregard.
"I have an incom-plete theory," says Moynihan, who is cherished and mocked in Washington for no shortage of the same. "In the 1950's, with a progressive government and newspaper, you got into urban renewal and destroyed everything of value in your town." He is looking out the window, addressing the strip malls and gas stations that make up Auburn's mediocre modernity. "If you'd had a reactionary newspaper, and a grumpy mayor, you might still have it."
Might still have it, indeed. Entering his fourth decade at the center of debate on social policy, Pat Moynihan has become the Grumpy Mayor of America. It is a role he relishes, although it has made for an excruciatingly delicate relationship with a young Democratic White House that often sees him as an impediment to its sweeping goals. His campaign manager, closest adviser, defender and wife of 39 years, Elizabeth Brennan Moynihan, attributes it to a simple problem: "They definitely don't get him."
Getting him has never been easy. He is the only member of the Senate who had an honored seat at the funerals of both Richard M. Nixon and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. His Irish soul composed the epitaph for Camelot, answering Mary McGrory's lament the weekend of J.F.K.'s assassination that "We'll never laugh again" with the soft certainty, "Heavens, Mary, we'll laugh again; we'll just never be young again." His Irish wit led the diarist H. R. Haldeman to describe him as the most upbeat presence in the early Nixon White House, the "shot in the arm that the rest of the staff lacks." Moynihan was the prescient heretic and brilliant self-promoter who had the temerity to argue -- before Ralph Nader was a household word -- that better cars and seat belts, not better drivers, were the key to auto safety; who warned anyone he could find on Saturday, Nov. 23, 1963, that the Federal Government had better get Lee Harvey Oswald into custody to protect his life and avoid conspiracy theories; who accurately prophesized, years in advance and without honor, the collapse of the black family, the fall of the Soviet Union and the havoc that the Reagan revolution would wreak in the form of crippling deficits.
He is the onetime barkeep who (it is often said on Capitol Hill) can be unreliable after lunch and he is the relentless scholar and commentator who has written or edited 16 books -- more (it is also said) than most politicians have read. He also just happens to be the most popular politician in his state, with favorable ratings above 60 percent. Six years ago, Moynihan won the state by the largest majority of any contested election in the history of the Senate, carrying 61 of 62 counties.
Now, after 17 years harrumphing and needling and inveighing on his pet topics, from transportation to welfare reform, he finds himself in the seat of Russell Long, the longtime lion of the Finance Committee, wielding power over taxes and Social Security and trade -- half the Federal budget. He ascended to the chairmanship when President Clinton plucked Lloyd Bentsen from the post to be Treasury Secretary. It was a swap the Clinton White House has long since had occasion to ponder, since in confronting the challenge of the President's massive proposal for reshaping the nation's health care system, Moynihan has given the Clintons, and much of the rest of Washington, no end of grief. Indeed, the struggle over the health care bill has been nearly as much a test of Moynihan as of the President.
The Senator's cautionary tale of Auburn's missing grump helps explain why. Moynihan has always been more confident perceiving problems than devising solutions, more comfortable pointing than leading. The organizing political principle of his public life has been a restless skepticism of Utopian ideals. Asked to describe his credo, Moynihan at first demurs. "Nothing I want to give a name to," he says. "I'm not a Socialist and I'm not a Libertarian. I was never a Stalinist and I was never a Trotskyite. I guess if I had to say -- and I don't have to say, but you asked -- it's an avoidance of ideology." He pauses, then adds acidly: " 'Which side are you on? If you're not on our side, you're on their side.' There's a different their all the time."
Twenty-four years ago, zealous liberals and sour conservatives in the Senate Finance Committee killed Moynihan's dream, as Richard Nixon's urban policy czar, of providing poor Americans with a guaranteed income. From this and other bitter experiences, Moynihan has developed a wariness that has only increased with age. Now, at 67, he confesses he is not sure that Government can master even the modest challenges he has forced it to spend money on -- like converting the old General Post Office into a grand new Penn Station in Manhattan, to redeem the destruction of the old one 30 years ago.
This worries him, and the word he picks to describe it is the physicist's term for the amount of energy unavailable for useful work: entropy. What worries him even more is the thought of making immodest promises and, as he wrote 20 years ago, "the failure of executives and legislators to understand what is risked when promises are made."
"He believes the function of government is to do good in society, and he's always looking for ways in which it can do good," says James Q. Wilson, the U.C.L.A. social scientist and a friend of 30 years. "But he's also prepared to admit that good intentions are not enough and that sometimes where people set out to do good, evil follows."
The van rolls westward. Moynihan peers out at another town, reading aloud a convenience store sign. " Qwik-Fill Mi-ni Marttt!" he spits in contempt. "Now do we call that progress?"
Outside the Ontario County courthouse in Canandaigua, Moynihan is holding a short rally. "As you all know," he cheerily tells a blank-faced crowd, "this is the courthouse where Susan B. Anthony was tried in 1873 for vot-ing in the election of 1872." Like many Moynihan asides that start out seeming to have no point, this story in fact has one. He tells it to apologize for being late, having dallied too long in nearby Seneca Falls, where the Women's Rights National Historical Park opened last year, thanks in part to the sponsorship of . . . Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who, he notes, won 60 percent of the vote in Ontario County six years ago and would like to again.
Moynihan starts to leave when a combo of high-school students strikes up "Danny Boy." He climbs carefully back up the steep steps, waves to quiet the small crowd and points to the saxophonist.
"Here's a young man," he says, "prac-ti-cing to be Pres-ident!" It is an affectionate reference and the crowd laughs. But its delivery tells much about his relationship with this President. The Senator likes to style himself as the only person to have served in the Cabinet or subcabinet of four Presidents -- Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford -- and he has lectured them and their successors for years. When Clinton was still a high-school student shaking Kennedy's hand in the Rose Garden, Moynihan was already correcting Kennedy's arithmetic in the Oval Office as an Assistant Secretary of Labor. Now, as chairman of the Finance Committee, Moynihan has power over virtually every aspect of Clinton's agenda and the public preceptorial between them has fascinated Washington for much of the last 18 months. The two are as stylistically different as it is possible to be: Clinton the ultimate flesh-presser, Moynihan skittish and shy around strangers or a crowd he can't dominate.
Back in the van, Moynihan's face pickles at the memory of Clinton confessing to a young woman on MTV that he wears briefs, not boxers. "I don't mind the question, but how could he have answered? He should have said: 'Young lady, I don't think that's a-pro-priate. Go wash your mouth out with soap!' " On "Meet the Press" a few Sunday mornings after the Buffalo convention, Tim Russert, a former top Moynihan aide, asked the Senator to clarify the President's position on health care. Moynihan smiled cryptically: "Ask him on. He'll come on, you know, if you had a little basketball hoop or something like that around here."
Such references bewilder the White House and even Moynihan's own aides, who profess much mutual respect and affection between the two men. "I was just saying he's a guy who's always jogging and jumping around and doing things like that," Moynihan explained later. "And he goes on television a lot, the way other Presidents have never done. You know, that's something new in Presidential politics, those, you know, talk shows."
In many ways, Clinton is the heir to the centrist Democratic gestalt that Moynihan worked for years to make respectable. As Governor of Arkansas in 1988, Clinton was actively involved in the passage of Moynihan's Family Support Act, which required more work training for welfare recipients along with stricter child support enforcement. Just before the 1992 election, Moynihan's newsletter to constituents pronounced a blessing: "I have to say, I like the idea of a 46-year-old Governor coming to Washington with a zest for new ideas."
But almost from the beginning, there was trouble, and not just over style. "He's cantankerous, but he couldn't obstruct us even if he wanted to," an anonymous top Administration official was quoted as saying by Time magazine, referring to Moynihan. "We'll roll right over him if we have to." Moynihan has spent a good part of the months since showing who would do the rolling. In public and private, he criticized the President's health bill as often as he supported it. Last fall, he dismissed the Administration's cost estimates for a health care bill as "accurate fantasy." When the White House signaled that it might hold off on welfare reform, Moynihan described Clinton's end-welfare-as-we-know-it campaign promise as crass "boob bait for the Bubbas." He added that there was no health crisis and threatened to hold health care "hostage." Later, when asked on live television whether a special prosecutor should look into the Whitewater affair, Moynihan's "Yep" made him the first senior Democrat to say so.
The Finance Committee's chief of staff, Lawrence O'Donnell Jr., who confesses that as a Harvard student he was too intimidated to take Moynihan's class, attributes the frictions partly to junior aides and partly to Moynihan's own candor.
"Pat Moynihan does a very simple thing that at the end of the 20th century has become the most inexplicable trait a politician can have: he says what he thinks."
"He's a brilliant and complex man who speaks his mind," says George Stephanopoulos, the senior Clinton adviser who is often on Moynihan patrol. "Washington isn't always prepared for that. I think we understand Senator Moynihan and that he believes in the President's agenda. That doesn't mean there aren't tactical differences, or realities of the Senate, which he communicates very clearly."
There have been big differences. Moynihan complained that the Clintons' plan was drafted in secret, took too long to produce and ended up too complex to ever draw the bipartisan support he believes is necessary to pass and implement such a major program. From the beginning, he warned that his committee was narrowly divided, and he suggests that the Clintons adhered to a rigid party line long past the time when bipartisan compromise was possible. His own ability to deal, he suggests, was hamstrung by their inflexibility.
In a speech last month, Moynihan also complained that the health debate "has been plagued with press accounts of White House aides doubting this Senator, questioning that committee, detecting hidden motives -- the while, of course, hiding themselves behind the anonymous leak." Privately, Moynihan complained that the Clinton plan's tilt against the high-cost medical specialties -- the pride of New York's premier hospitals -- smacked of 60's radicalism.
The White House and its most ardent Democratic allies countered, sotto voce, that the chairman was simply not on board and that for all his garrulous, accommodating affability he was not stroking his committee and could not deliver the votes. It became a dialogue of the deaf. In the end, Moynihan lost effective control of the narrow 11-to-9 Democratic majority on his committee. In the frantic hours before the July 4 recess, a bipartisan group of moderates produced a bill much less ambitious than Clinton's, one that would not guarantee the President's bottom line of universal coverage. Instead, the bill hopes to provide new subsidies for the poor, intended to cover 95 percent of all Americans by the year 2002; a commission would figure out how to deliver coverage if that percentage was not met. About the best most Democrats would say for the bill was that it kept the legislative process alive and gave the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, a fig leaf to wrap around the other proposals on the floor.
As usual, Moynihan satisfied neither the liberals nor the conservatives. "If he really believes this was a potential danger to American medicine, there's much more he could have done to fashion a bipartisan bill," says Bill Kristol, the conservative analyst and Moynihan's former teaching assistant at Harvard. "I'm worried that Pat will have failed to influence the outcome in any meaningful way." He adds: "He's never in anybody's camp. In a way, that's admirable. It's also fair to ask, if you are going to be in real politics, don't you have to choose sides?"
Moynihan says with some heat that he was whipsawed between the White House's unrealistic expectations and unexpectedly partisan intransigence from the Republicans. But that reveals the failure of the chairman's single strategy: he had counted on cooperation from Bob Dole, his ally from the 1980's when the two joined forces to rescue the Social Security system. When the support did not materialize, he seemed to have no clear idea where to turn. In his own defense, Moynihan points with pride to his proposal for a trust fund, financed by an assessment on insurance premiums, to support the nation's great academic medical centers and teaching hospitals, which happen to be located overwhelmingly in New York.
"If anyone had a bill out of the Finance Committee four years ago with that much in the way of insurance subsidy, insurance change and commitments, you would have said, 'My goodness, what on earth has happened?' " He adds: "Down in the White House, they never could quite hear us say, you know, that nothing is 100 percent. We don't collect 100 percent of our taxes; the census doesn't count 100 percent of the population."
As staunchly as Moynihan defends the jerry-built bill, however, the fact remains that it was not truly his, merely a bill eked out by a fractious committee. Instead of laying to rest doubts about Moynihan's loyalty and legislative acumen, the bill exacerbated them. The unkind whispering on the Hill was that, by contrast, even Bentsen, the old Texas Tory, would have been a better soldier for his President: unruffled, sly, but in the end willing to twist arms and persuade wavering colleagues, whatever his private doubts. Bentsen even attended a couple of meetings with White House aides and committee members, ready to act as an informal liaison.
The liberals on the Finance Committee were deeply disappointed by Moynihan's performance, though characteristically none are eager to talk about it for attribution. "He's done more clenching of teeth than talking," says one Senate aide, explaining the reluctance of that aide's employer, a Democrat, to offend Moynihan openly.
On the topic he most cares about, welfare, Moynihan's relations with the White House have been much better, mostly because it has done what he wants: stress that welfare cannot be a permanent dependency. After brutally deriding the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, in her confirmation hearings for appearing to back away from Clinton's campaign promises on the topic, he has goaded and prodded, all the while refusing to say exactly what changes he favors.
Indeed, when the President unveiled his welfare reform plan in June, Moynihan was so delighted at Clinton's emphasis on the danger of growing illegitimacy -- a Moynihan crusade for three decades -- that he said he would co-sponsor the bill, though he thinks its central tenet of ending benefits after two years may be unrealistic. In his first hearing on it last month, he dealt with Shalala like a Dutch uncle and praised her testimony as "historic."
"We've come round to recognizing it, that's the big thing," Moynihan says. "You have to do something about how children are raised in our society. The specifics of a bill, how you're going to finance it or whatever, we've gotta work out."
Such persistence "drives the true believers absolutely nuts," says Moynihan's old friend Roger Kennedy, the director of the National Park Service. "He's not the vagrant, capricious spirit. They are. They focus intensively on something for three months and then move on to something else. He's consistent, slogging along for 30 years on the same thing. And then, when the cavalry runs in, he's still there, worrying about family structure."
If family structure has been Moynihan's most consistent theme, it has also been the most painful subject of his personal and professional life. In part that's because when Pat Moynihan talks of unstable families, he knows what he's talking about. As he said in a rare outburst during an interview with The New York Times nearly three decades ago: "I grew up in Hell's Kitchen. My father was a drunk. I know what this life is like."
In 1937, when Pat was 10, his father, John, an advertising copywriter for RKO Pictures, left home and never saw Pat again. Margaret Moynihan and her three children dropped out of middle-class life in the New York suburbs into an unhappy second marriage and a series of grim apartments. Pat shined shoes, graduated first in his class at Benjamin Franklin High School in East Harlem, worked as a stevedore on the Hudson River piers and ultimately found escape via City College and the Navy's V-12 program, which sent him in 1944 to train at Middlebury College. On the G.I. Bill, he went on to college at Tufts, returning on vacations to tend bar in a tavern his mother had opened near Times Square. He finally broke out for good with a Fulbright Scholarship to the London School of Economics.
Moynihan waves off any attempt to see reflections of his upbringing in his work. "Oh, don't, don't, don't, don't," he says, lightly but firmly. "We don't talk about that. I've been around the world a lot, yeah. But there's less here than meets the eye."
Perhaps, but perhaps only because Moynihan's triumph over a shattered home is one of the exceptions that proves his rule. He began his government career as an aide to Gov. W. Averell Harriman of New York in the mid-1950's, then dipped into academia at Syracuse University before joining the New Frontier in 1961. In 1965, he left Washington for an unsuccessful run for New York City Council President and a return to academia. But it was with a report that year to President Johnson entitled "The Negro Family: The Case for National Action" that he made his biggest policy splash.
In the report, Moynihan warned that rising illegitmacy rates and a "tangle of pathology" posed grave threats to the stability of black families and put at risk the gains in income and equality that blacks had managed to achieve through the civil rights movement. Moynihan saw himself as a liberal watchman on the heights, summoning his country to make whole in reality the revolution already occurring in law.
"From the wild Irish slums of the 19th-century Eastern seaboard to the riot-torn suburbs of Los Angeles," he wrote at the time in a Jesuit magazine, "there is one unmistakble lesson in American history: a community that allows a large number of young men to grow up in broken families, dominated by women, never acquiring any stable relationship to male authority, never acquiring any set of rational expectations about the future -- that community asks for and gets chaos."
Instead of being praised, Moynihan was bitterly denounced as blaming the victim and fueling racism. He retreated from the fray into what friends say was the most painful period of his life. Even now, he speaks of it only with the tightest reserve. "Well, it has made for difficult weekends, you could say."
It's cold comfort that Moynihan's thesis is barely debated today. "It set a bad example to others who might have carried on that work," he says. "We took a generation to pick it up again."
And the controversy continued. In 1969, after an interlude at Harvard, Moynihan broke with his fellow Democrats and returned to Washington as Richard Nixon's chief urban affairs adviser. There, a new storm broke over a memorandum, leaked to The New York Times, in which Moynihan counseled the President to focus on the problems of other minorities and cool overheated rhetoric.
"The time may have come when the issue of race could benefit from a period of 'benign neglect,' " Moynihan wrote. The memo was immediately interpreted as calling for neglect of black Americans, and Moynihan was despondent. "Moynihan in to see me, disturbed about staff leaks designed to screw him," Haldeman wrote in his diary on March 31, 1970. "Made point he's ruined in Democratic Party because of the 'benign neglect' memo. He's really distressed, mainly because he has nowhere left to go."
Moynihan moved on -- back to Harvard, then to India as Ambassador for Nixon and to the United Nations as chief delegate for Ford. But the controversy never really went away. This year Moynihan's opponent in the Democratic primary for the Senate nomination is the Rev. Al Sharpton, the protean black street protester who made a surprisingly strong run for the Senate two years ago. No one gives Sharpton a chance of doing much more than annoying Moynihan, but he has used his campaign to do just that. "I represent the historic disfavor he's had in the African-American community," says Sharpton, who turned what was to have been a 2-minute speech at the Buffalo convention into a 15-minute broadside against Moynihan. "He rose to fame talking about the black family, and I'm a broken family product." Sharpton goes on to describe himself as the character that Shakespeare (had he written a play about all this) would have introduced at the peak of Moynihan's career "to bring back all the questions."
Indeed, when Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, eager to soothe Sharpton and avoid alienating black voters, went out of his way to meet with the minister in Buffalo, he thanked Sharpton for an innocuous introduction, allowing that it was "benign." The Moynihan forces hit the roof at what they saw as a deliberate dig. Since then, half a dozen meetings between the Senator and Governor to discuss the impact of health care legislation were scheduled and mysteriously canceled by Moynihan's office at the last minute.
Moynihan's relations with New York's black political establishment have always been touchy, and they were not helped last year when he made a speech recalling how much more livable the city was 50 years ago. Mayor David N. Dinkins, in an uphill re-election bid, took that as a slap at his stewardship. Even Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem -- who has endorsed Moynihan -- refers to him as "Mon-a-han," in a kind of can't-be-bothered semi-slap. As the fourth-ranking Democrat of the House Ways and Means Committee (the Finance Committee's tax-writing counterpart), Rangel was often called on by its former chairman, Dan Rostenkowski, to find out what on earth Moynihan had meant by some obscure remark. Rangel inevitably returned just as puzzled.
"If he selects his audiences very carefully, those astute enough to understand the papers that he writes, he'll have no problems," Rangel said of Moynihan in a recent interview on the "MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour." "But when it's an across-the-board audience and when it appears as though he is indicting rather than providing solutions, I think the professor part of Pat Moynihan has many, many problems." When I asked Rangel to repeat the remarks, he declined, saying he had already heard complaints from Moynihan's staff.
Just last month, Moynihan stepped into controversy again. During a hearing on welfare, he noted that within the next decade half of all American children will be born out of wedlock. That prospect, Moynihan said, marked such a change in the human condition that biologists could talk of "speciation" -- the creation of a new species. Sharpton promptly denounced Moynihan as a "Harvard version of Jimmy the Greek," a reference to the Las Vegas oddsmaker who lost his job as a television commentator after saying that black athletes were fleet-footed because they had been bred that way in slavery.
The bitterest pill for Moynihan may be that such criticisms enabled the insurgent Reaganauts to call the problems intractable and retreat from Government spending for the cities and the poor.
"It was the last moment of a kind of expectancy about activism in Washington," Moynihan says of his Family Assistance Plan in the Nixon years. "The problem, then as now," he wrote with typical candor in 1992, "is that no one has a clue as to what it would take for public policy to be sufficient."
On a frigid February day last year, Clinton and Moynihan made a pilgrimage to the home of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Hyde Park, N.Y., where the President pressed for his economic plan. When they reboarded Air Force One, Moynihan banged a table top in the V.I.P. cabin and growled with Falstaffian flair: "Whisky! Get me a whisky!"
Nervous White House aides fluttered for a moment, unsure whether he was joking, until, one of them later recalled, "I think the assumption was, if the Senator wants a drink, bring him a drink."
Moynihan's drinking is a subject his friends and enemies raise matter-of-factly. He drinks, by all evidence, more than most public figures in this era of white wine and designer water, and reporters and Washington insiders collect Moynihan drinking stories like baseball cards. There is Moynihan, asked for a late-night comment on the death of the Irish Republican hunger striker Bobby Sands in 1981, declaiming unintellgible dialogue from "Juno and the Paycock." Moynihan burbling an air-check for the Democratic response to one of President Bush's weekly radio addresses, then snapping into clear voice when the broadcast began. Moynihan consuming, according to a tablemate, 14 glasses of wine at a recent White House dinner, asking the waiters to keep all three of his glasses -- white, red and Champagne -- full.
"He's a rogue," one old friend says simply. "Pat's an Irish country person. And he drinks too much. We all know him: he's the smartest guy in town, who doesn't have enough good people to talk to, who exhausts himself and those close to him and" -- by drinking -- "finds surcease from that enormous intellect. He's a man who could easily be a squire in the west of Ireland. But then there'd be other squires and a bishop and a community to talk to."
In his classic chapter on Irish New York in "Beyond the Melting Pot" in 1963, Moynihan mused on the curse of his race. "A dominant social fact of the Irish community is the number of good men who are destroyed by drink. In ways it is worse now than in the past: a stevedore could drink and do his work; a lawyer, a doctor, a legislator cannot."
No one suggests that Moynihan's drinking -- which friends say appears to have tapered off a bit with age -- has seriously affected his work. On most mornings these days, he leads long and complicated hearings on health care, welfare or trade, perched on his dais like a lanky Jimmy Stewart on a lily pad, praising a colleague, goading a witness, recounting a favorite lesson.
Asked why people talk about his drinking so much, Moynihan says quietly: "People just always have, and there's nothing I can do about it." Asked if it's a problem, he replies, "It's not a problem for me. I'm sitting here, doing my work."
Moynihan's drinking may be the least of his eccentricities. This is a man who, if any aide tells him "the White House called," is sure to interrupt with a peremptory: "No! Houses don't talk. You spoke to a person. Now, who was it? Begin again."
In the Senate, he lives by his own clock. After morning hearings and the twice weekly Democratic caucus lunches, he is apt to repair to the gym and an afternoon of reading and telephoning in his hideaway just off the Senate floor. He'll visit the floor for a speech and return to his office in the late afternoon. He bunches his appointments at the end of the day, sometimes forcing constituents to scramble for the last shuttle back to La Guardia.
He avoids the Washington social circuit and generally dines quietly at home with Liz or close friends. A light sleeper, he reads into the night. Though he affects disinterest in his own press, by 8 or 8:30 A.M. he has read The Washington Post and The New York Times "more thoroughly than the owners of either of those journals," says O'Donnell, chief of staff for the Finance Committee. During the summer, in a former one-room schoolhouse on his farm in the tiny Catskills hamlet of Pindars Corners, Moynihan bangs out his books and scholarly articles.
In an era of handlers and "message" meetings, Moynihan writes his own constituent newsletters (they are as likely to review history as to tout his accomplishments) and rewrites the efforts of consultants into his own distinctive 30-second campaign commercials, with never an actor or gauzy soft-filter in the lot.
He also spends inordinate time checking his footnotes. To show the Senator's sympatico relationship with Clinton, Stephanopoulos reveals that Moynihan keeps up an active correspondence with the President. A recent note praised Clinton's speech to the French National Assembly after the D-Day commemorations, in which Clinton warned of the dangers of resurgent ethnic nationalism. Moynihan suggested that the President gather experts to review the problem, the way the Manhattan Project developed the atomic bomb for F.D.R.
But a follow-up phone call with Stephanopoulos revealed Professor Moynihan's double-edged sword. When Stephanopoulos said he guessed this would be like "Dr. Einstein" coming to the White House, Moynihan broke in.
"Doctor? I don't think he was a doctor," said the Senator. Stephanopoulos, a Rhodes Scholar, apologized for the seeming error, but a couple of days later came another letter from Moynihan, confessing his error and listing Einstein's curriculum vitae. "Even when I turned out to be right, I still felt dumber," Stephanopoulos laughs.
Moynihan's eclecticism has rubbed off on his three grown children. In the Nixon years, when student protesters threatened to burn down his house at Harvard, Moynihan had nothing but contempt for the sons and daughters of privilege who, in his view, had paralyzed the country and destroyed the Johnson Presidency. But Moynihan's worldly success has given his offspring the financial freedom to pursue decidedly nontraditional lives. The eldest son, Timothy, is a sculptor of papier-mache caricatures. (A life-size Thomas Jefferson stands in Moynihan's office.) Maura is a sometime performer who now works for the Campaign for Tibet. And the youngest, John, is an animator. "And none," Moynihan interjects drily, "are employed."
The gyroscope that keeps Moynihan balanced is Liz Moynihan, the handsome woman he met in 1954 on the Harriman campaign. An architectual historian and an expert on the Mogul gardens of India, she has been his political alter ego, doing the fund raising that bores him. She also drives -- since, Tim explains, "the old man" has a way of spying something distracting out the window and driving off the road.
Liz has her own back channel to all of Washington, including Hillary Rodham Clinton. A recent cartoon in The Washington Post mapping the brain of the prototypical plugged-in Washingtonian included in the folds of the well-kept cortex "Liz Moynihan's phone #."
The Senator has a flash temper and a long memory, but his colleagues agree that Liz Moynihan is steelier. "Sometimes he tells you tough things that you know she's told him to tell you," one Congressman says. "But when you hear it right from her, watch out."
MOYNIHAN'S RECORD, AS befits a wide-ranging intellect, is more a story of influence on an array of issues than authorship of a passel of big bills, though the Senator can claim his share of those. In 1983, he and Dole worked out a compromise involving higher taxes and fewer benefits to bail out the floundering Social Security system. In 1988, he shepherded his Family Support Act to passage. And in 1991, he used the occasion of a highway reauthorization bill to create the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, which appropriated huge new sums for transportation and gave states wide choice in whether to use the money for highways or mass transit.
Though he is often accused of disdaining parochial interests, Moynihan keeps close track of how the Federal Government parcels out revenue to New York, publishing an annual report on the way entitlement formulas favor other parts of the country. And he takes great pride in bringing physical structures -- new courthouses and office buildings -- to the state. In 1991, he forced the Feds to repay New York $5 billion for the cost of building the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway four decades ago.
"He's a spectacular vote-getter, and I think the reason is twofold," says Raymond B. Harding, the leader of the New York State Liberal Party and a longtime supporter. "He's a marvelous pol, something he manages to hide most of the time. Secondly, he's truly an upstater, in terms of his orientation and knowledge."
After winning the Democratic nomination over a crowded, more liberal field in 1976, Moynihan won an easy victory over the Conservative incumbent, James Buckley. He has been re-elected comfortably since, running strong in Republican districts and protecting his left flank with his outspoken opposition to the Reagan administration's abandonment of the cities.
His opponent this fall is Bernadette Castro, a Republican fund-raiser from Long Island and heir to the convertible sofa business. Moynihan was edgy enough about the money she and her adviser, Edward J. Rollins Jr., might spend to attack him -- or to repeat Sharpton's attacks -- that he called for her to dismiss Rollins. Rollins caused a firestorm last year with his boast, later retracted, that the campaign organization for one of his clients, Christine Todd Whitman, had paid black groups to suppress turnout in the New Jersey gubernatorial election.
Polls show Moynihan with a commanding lead over all comers, but there is an undercurrent of dissatisfaction on the left.
"Frankly, when I hear a Democratic Senator from the state of New York say that there is no health care crisis in America and suggest that it's O.K. for 37 million Americans to have no health care coverage, that's deeply troubling to me," says Jan Pierce, a vice president of the Communications Workers of America in New York. Pierce recently told a union gathering that he personally could not support Moynihan. "I said while I don't have the courage to endorse Reverend Sharpton, I sure as hell intend to vote for him." The union, which has given money to the Senator for years, supports Moynihan again this year.
For his part, Moynihan appears to be doing his best to enjoy his moment on the mountaintop. But the verdict on what kind of chairman he will ultimately be -- whether he can express his will on issues that are not as dear to his heart as welfare -- remains open. Will the Senator, who long ago decided, like Henry Clay, that he would rather be right than President, rank as a Great Compromiser in the best sense of the word?
Every day brings a new test. The welfare debate is just beginning, and once again Moynihan will be called on to be a team player in steering a complex bill on a thorny topic whose subtleties and pitfalls he sees too clearly. If health care falls apart, the White House may well be less inclined to humor him. Winning this fourth term would carry him into the millennium and a quarter-century in Congress. Moynihan may yet grow more confident and adept in his command. He isn't getting any younger, though, and sometimes seems to grope harder to pluck things from that vast card catalogue in his head.
Being Moynihan, of course, he doesn't talk much about it. But in a recent twilight conversation in his Senate office, surrounded by old silver and boxed foreign editions of his books, Moynihan did pause to reflect, his voice barely audible as he dragged on a Marlboro, one of three he allows himself daily.
"The century began with vast expectations of what government could do and ended up with a huge amount of disappointment," he said, fending off any suggestion that his own goals are too modest. And he insists he is not as complicated as people think. "I don't find myself hard to understand. I find a lot of the things I deal with hard to understand. You know, there's a lot of complexity about the world."
When he argued for seat belts or predicted the decline of the Soviet Union, he adds, the world wasn't quite ready for him. "If you're outside a paradigm, people will think you're crazy. It is by that kind of pattern in the sciences, and what is wanly called social sciences, in which no argument ever gets settled in one generation. A huge argument breaks out, and it just goes on until another generation comes along and it has accepted one of the other views. And no one will say: 'Gosh, oh golly-gee, I got that wrong! My courses for the last 25 years have been wrong, but I have now changed my ways.' "
It is Moynihan's singular satisfaction to have been right about some of the biggest arguments of his time. That he might be wrong this time around on health care is a criticism to be borne, not one to dwell on. As the conversation turns to the well-worn doubts about his party loyalties and legislative skill, Moynihan softens his voice until -- after discussing his drinking -- he stops altogether.
"May I," he begins hesitantly, "put you on a slightly different course?" He walks to a shelf where a two-foot stack of honorary degrees rest in their colored leather folders. He picks up the top one and displays it. The degree, received this year, is from the University of Rochester. The citation reads in part: "Independent to the bone, he is the vigilant guardian of the nation's well-being. We call to honor Daniel Patrick Moynihan: teacher-politician, thinker-activist, international homeboy and pride of New York." He enumerates other glories: the gold medal on the mantelpiece from Notre Dame, the gold medal of the American Philosophical Society.
"I don't think I've spent my life being denounced," he says. "So why should I go around with a hang-dog look?"
The act is revealing: at the peak of 30 years of accumulated power and respect, at the start of his barony as Finance Committee chairman, he still feels insecure enough to recite his honors for a visitor half his age. Moynihan picks up a clipping from The New York Post, with the latest polls showing his popularity, and turns again to his visitor.
"I get along with people in New York very well. I'm not sitting here" -- his voice has now risen almost to a shout -- "I'm not complaining! Why are you asking me?"
This Senator knows what he cares about, what is lasting and what is not, and he does not need colleagues, critics or the President of the United States to tell him. The flash of anger quickly past, his voice is silky again.
"Seriously," Daniel Patrick Moynihan says. "Why go on about being misunderstood? I mean, I'm still here."

When Your Own Initials Aren't Enough

BYLINE: By Paul Goldberger 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH IT HAS SLOWED DOWN in the last couple of years, at least in Japan, the economic energy of the Far East has led to plenty of business for architects from the United States and Europe. But if the first generation of their buildings is any indication, Asia has been more helpful to architects' balance sheets than to their reputations. Most work by American architects in Japan turns out to look pretty much like their work back home, only more so. It is as if they saw their commissions more as advertising than as design opportunities.
Frank Gehry, for example -- as potent a creative force as exists in American architecture -- built a restaurant in Kobe partly in the shape of a fish, his favorite form. The Kobe fish, whose metal-scaled tail shoots up three or four stories, isn't much more than a spectacular sign. It's fun, but it hardly pushes Mr. Gehry's work forward: it's more a caricature of Gehry architecture than an exemplar of it. The rest of the building (which houses an American-style restaurant called the Fish Dance) is ordinary, even dull. 
 So, too, with Charles Moore's apartment building south of Osaka or Kevin Roche's Tokyo office tower: routine buildings that seem to have been put up to take advantage of their designers' names. The Moore buildings are medium-size towers with gabled roofs, an amiable but banal attempt to merge high-rise architecture with the charm of the down-home, single-family house -- an exaggeration of an old Moore theme.
The Roche building, which rises behind a celebrated address in Tokyo, the severe facade of the Dai-ichi Insurance Company Building, Gen. Douglas MacArthur's headquarters during the American occupation, is even duller. It's startling to find Mr. Roche, designer of some of the most striking commercial and institutional buildings of the 1970's and 1980's, retreating into such caution, especially in a cityscape as wild and intense as Tokyo's. Was he seeking to make his mark by creating a quiet island in the midst of the raucousness of Tokyo? If so, it doesn't work, since this building calls to mind not the serene architecture of ancient Japan but the dull architecture of most American cities.
At least a bit better is Robert A. M. Stern's effort in Tokyo, Bancho House, an office and apartment building across the street from the British Embassy. Mr. Stern was hired to design a facade, a penthouse apartment and a lobby for a building already under construction, and he produced a neo-classical granite building, vaguely Soanian, that at least pays homage to the British Embassy if it does little to engage in any serious way with the architectural and urbanistic issues raised by Japan. It's a building that Mr. Stern could have produced anywhere, or at least anywhere with a neo-classical British Embassy across the street.
Michael Graves, too, designed just a front, a gridded facade of indigo and white tile for an apartment building that seems almost conservative compared with much of his other work. Is this the architect whose Humana Building in Louisville, Ky., and whose Whitney Museum addition for New York (never built) caused such architectural scandales? It's hard to believe, looking at this cheerful but watered-down example of the architect's work. It's as if Mr. Graves felt he had come to Japan to produce a simplified version of his architecture for children.
Such attitudes may, of course, be encouraged by the Japanese, who have often hired well-known architects from the West more as brand names than anything else. With a handful of exceptions, most of the buildings in Japan designed by Western architects have been commissioned by commercial developers, and their goal has been to exploit the celebrity of Western architects more than to garner serious architectural thought. When Japanese clients have higher architectural ambitions, they tend to hire serious Japanese architects like Arata Isozaki and Tadao Ando.
This suggests that the Western architects are not entirely to blame for their inability to produce much more than quick and dirty synopses of their work in Japan. The Japanese are well known for their fondness for status symbols from the West, and it's not all that surprising that in the lavish 80's they would treat internationally known architects as the equivalent of Hermes or Gucci or BMW. It wasn't all that different from the hysterical art collecting that went on: Buy a van Gogh. Commission a Michael Graves. It's all the same. Of course, it's worth remembering that Mr. Isozaki's first American commission was the Palladium nightclub in New York, a job for which he was clearly sought as a high-profile international name, not as a thoughtful theoretician. If he has come in more recent years to be sought as a serious architect in the United States, his way into the door was as a brand name, too.
The willingness to be seduced by the chance to become an architectural Hermes is not limited to American architects. Mario Botta, the Swiss architect, designed a small commercial museum, the Watari-um, in Tokyo, which has a monumental facade of masonry in light and dark stripes, Mr. Botta's signature writ large. But the facade, handsome as it is, functions as little more than a Botta billboard, since the interior space behind it is tight, awkward and dreary.
Two curious exceptions are the American architect Peter Eisenman and Sir Norman Foster, an Englishman, both of whom seem to have emerged from the maelstrom of building in Japan with better results. Mr. Eisenman, whose highly theoretical work generally eschews entertainment at all costs, threw his normal designing mode out the window and jumped with zeal into the vibrant Japanese streetscape, producing a portion of a showroom structure in Tokyo that consists of pink and green and glass cubes set into a larger mass, considerably more whimsical than most of his work; it could actually be described as delightful, not a word normally applicable to the Eisenman canon.
Sir Norman Foster, meanwhile, produced the Century Tower, not only one of Tokyo's few distinguished skyscrapers but a clear and serious descendant of the same architect's Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, one of the most important buildings of the 1980's. A vertical crystal palace supported by pale gray trusses, it has a lovely profile that stands out in Tokyo's sprawling cityscape with dignity and even grace.

HEADLINE: Rent Deregulation of the Wealthy Creeps Forward

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
TO explain how a certain 51-year-old stockbroker at a downtown investment house came to buy a co-op for $1 million on Madison Avenue last May, it will be necessary to honor his insistence on anonymity.
It seems that he was at the beach on eastern Long Island one day last summer when he heard from a friend in the real-estate business of the state's new high-rent, high-income decontrol law. The law said that if a regulated rent was at least $2,000 a month as of Oct. 1, 1993, and the income of primary residents in that apartment totaled at least $250,000 a year for two years in a row, the apartment would become deregulated. 
 Subsequently, the City Council, in adopting the law, removed that Oct. 1 cutoff, so that if the income exceeds $250,000 the apartment becomes deregulated after the rent reaches $2,000, whenever that occurs. The state law also introduced vacancy decontrol for apartments renting at $2,000 or more a month: Regardless of any tenant's income, once the apartment is vacated it is deregulated.
The law meant the eventual end of regulation in the stockbroker's apartment. He was paying $2,400 a month for a three-bedroom unit with a Central Park view in the East 80's. The building had converted to a co-op but he had stayed on as a renter.
He could have held on, withholding from the owner the information that he was over-income and waiting until the state housing agency asked him directly. But he didn't.
"I could see the handwriting on the wall," he said. "We wanted something larger anyway." He bought the apartment from the sponsor, promptly resold it at a modest profit, and bought another co-op twice as large a few blocks south in the East 70's.
His was one of the 186 apartments for which decontrol orders have already been granted by the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal under the law. All of them are or were occupied by tenants who were willing to acknowledge to owners that their incomes were above the threshold.
They can be said to have set an example of ethical behavior. Others who are over-income may acknowledge it on the state form, but still others may try to squeeze through holes in a law that is less than airtight.
Years of experience with the city's prime-residency law -- providing that tenants are entitled to their regulated apartment only if it is their primary residence -- suggests that wealth is no assurance of rectitude when the right to possess a regulated apartment is at stake.
In any event, the tortuous route to deregulation of a small number of occupied apartments has reached a key juncture for high-income, high-rent, regulated renters. If they replied to their landlord's inquiry on income by reporting that it was below the threshold, or if they failed to reply at all, the landlord was able to ask the state to do an income-verification check. Landlords had until June 30 to make that request.
With the deadline past, figures are now available to indicate potentially how far-reaching will be the decontrol of apartments for tenants "in place" under the 1993 law.
LANDLORD applications for income checks on 2,168 apartments, were received by the state agency, officials said. Since 186 decontrol orders have been granted, it appears that 1,982 are headed into the income-verification procedure. This suggests that a maximum of 0.02 percent of the entire regulated stock -- one million apartments -- could be deregulated under the new law.
The figure 1,982 would also be only 8 percent of the 11,600 regulated apartments that were renting for more than $2,000 a month last year. But it is 30 percent of the 6,600 over-$2,000 regulated rentals that receive no tax abatements. Apartments built with Section 421a abatements cannot be deregulated until the 10-year abatement period ends.
Of the 11,600 apartments that were renting for $2,000 or more last year, 2,200 rented for $3,000 to $3,999, and 1,100 for more than $4,000, the housing agency said.
Last week the agency began sending 10-page forms to the 1,900-odd tenants asking them to check off whether their income did or did not exceed $250,000 in each of the last two years. Tenants must also list the names and addresses of all occupants of the apartment (except temporary residents) "as they were or would have been entered" on the New York State tax return. Officials said that this means that even those who filed no New York State return must respond. The tenant has 60 days to return the form.
FAILURE to respond will trigger a deregulation order under the law. Most tenants probably will respond, however. The question is, will the information they provide produce a valid income check at the Department of Taxation and Finance?
Since the state tax agency says that Federal law prevents it from accepting Social Security numbers for the verification checks, the forms don't ask tenants to supply them. The tax agency will notify the housing agency whether it was able to match tax returns to names and addresses. If it can, the housing agency will move to decontrol apartments of tenants who are over-income. But if it cannot achieve a match, decontrol will be denied.
"Despite our best efforts we anticipate that a significant percentage will not match up right," said Donald M. Halperin, the State Housing Commissioner.
Lula Anderson, the deputy commissioner for the Office of Rent Administration, said that the office had seven staff members assigned to processing cases. "For 1995 we expect that most of the initial implementation problems will be conquered, leading to a more efficient process for both owners and tenants," she said.
Modest as the over-all consequences of the law may be, they may be significant in specific buildings. In one building, the 831-unit 500 East 77th Street, 12 decontrol orders have already been granted. In another, at 215 East 68th Street, with 608 apartments, 10 decontrol orders have been granted. In 12 other buildings there have been at least two decontrol orders. The rest of the orders are for one apartment in the building.
The law may also set in motion a variety of housing responses by high-income people, even those who are not yet paying $2,000 a month or not yet earning $250,000 a year.
"There's no question in my mind that a healthy percentage of people will feel vulnerable to one or more of the current restrictions on occupancy of regulated apartments," said Adam R. Rose, executive vice president of Rose Associates, a major owner that has converted nine of its Manhattan rentals to co-ops. About 1,000 of the 2,000 apartments within these co-ops are still occupied by long-term renters. The company also owns and manages about 1,000 newer apartments in pure-rental buildings.
A TOTAL of 82 notices went to tenants paying more than $2,000 a month as renters in the co-op buildings, Mr. Rose said. Eight tenants acknowledged being over-income. Of these eight, only one has vacated. One has decided to rent at a negotiated rent level, two have bought their apartments and the others are considering buying.
Rose Associates is following up the income verification procedure for all the over-$2,000-a-month renter-occupied apartments in co-op buildings. Over the next three years, Mr. Rose estimated that perhaps 100 tenants whose rents are currently below $2,000 a month would be above that level.
"The higher the rent, the more likely the tenant is to buy," he said.
High household income does not necessarily make a household cash-rich for either purchasing or big rent increases.
One household can be earning $260,000 a year and have three children in private school; another can have an income of $1 million and few expenses; a third can have three or four roommates of moderate income living together and pooling their income to pay the rent.
In about 10 conversations with tenants who felt susceptible to deregulation under the law, Glenwood Management, another large East Side rental owner, has offered renewal leases with no increases to some tenants because they were already paying close to the top of the market, said Gary Jacobs, executive vice president. But for others the increase asked is as much as 10 percent.
"Some were much more than 10 percent," Mr. Jacobs said. "These were long-term tenants. They accepted it. They recognized that the gravy train was over." Mr. Jacobs said that Glenwood has many three-bedroom apartments renting for $1,700 to $1,800 a month comparable to nonregulated apartments now renting for $3,500 a month. It has numerous two-bedrooms renting at $1,200 to $1,400 that have a rental value once upgraded of $2,800 to $3,000 if unregulated.
A retired 72-year-old clothing manufacturer living in a Glenwood apartment on the East Side said, after being assured anonymity, that he had acknowledged he was over-income under the law. He was paying $2,300 a month and was vulnerable to a 5 percent increase under rent stabilization. The rent was raised $100 a month after deregulation.
The tenant praised the condition of the building, and said he loved his apartment and loved living in Manhattan, having moved into the building with his wife seven years ago after he retired. He also owns a villa in Lake Worth, Fla., and lives there half the year.
"It's a terrible law," he said of high-rent, high-income deregulation. "I had a couple of very good years, but my income could drop. I don't want to fight the landlord. They treated me very well and anyway it's a losing battle. But what business is it of anybody what my income is? It's a terrible invasion of privacy."

HEADLINE: Shift by Nonprofits Leaves Space Behind

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
FOR SALE: the former headquarters of the United Negro College Fund. For sale: the former headquarters of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. For sale: the former headquarters of CARE.
Nonprofit organizations are on the move. Several prominent ones, most recently the 50-year-old college fund, have relocated headquarters and back-office operations from New York City, leaving a string of empty East Side office buildings in their wake. 
 All told, New York has lost 2,000 of the 4,000 nonprofit headquarters it had 11 years ago -- "a hemorrhaging of about half our community" -- said Joel A. Dolci, president of the New York Society of Association Executives.
Although help came with the opening in 1992 of the Association Center at 120 Wall Street, where nonprofit tenants are exempt from real estate taxes, Mr. Dolci said "we still have a problem with the exodus of not-for-profit organizations."
Perhaps the biggest single beneficiary of this movement is Atlanta, to which the Boys and Girls Clubs moved in March, CARE (the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere) moved last September and the American Cancer Society moved in 1988.
Why they left is plain. New York, they say, has become too expensive for them.
Why they settled in Atlanta can be explained in part by the quiet workings of the Robert W. Woodruff Foundation, named for the man who led the Coca-Cola Company for many decades. Its principal asset is Coca-Cola stock left to it by Mr. Woodruff, who died in 1985. The Atlanta-based foundation has made grants on the order of $2.5 million each to the three big-league transplants.
"Once we learned that Atlanta was in the running, the foundation did make commitments that were helpful to the organizations' moves," said its president, Charles H. McTier. "We do not seek them out. We only act when the organization has made its decision to look at other communities and then has expressed a strong interest in Atlanta."
Atlanta has developed a "very aggressive" reputation, Mr. Dolci said, but it is by no means alone. William H. Gray 3d, president of the United Negro College Fund, credited the Virginia Department of Economic Development and the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors with enabling the fund to move.
Last month, the fund began relocating operations out of the 20-story Equal Opportunity Building, 500 East 62d Street, to the Willow Oaks Corporate Center in Merrifield, Va., and an office in downtown Washington. The National Urban League co-owns the building.
Many organizations, of course, are bound to New York. These include groups that are based in certain neighborhoods or serve specific communities, as well as those that depend heavily on the talent and wealth that are peculiar to New York City.
For example, the American Foundation for the Blind could in theory have gone anywhere when it decided to leave its old quarters at 15 West 16th Street. Instead, it is moving to leased space at 11 Penn Plaza, on Seventh Avenue, between 31st and 32d Streets.
"We did consider sites outside Manhattan," said the foundation's president, Carl R. Augusto. But the board quickly decided to give priority to a Manhattan location. Behind that consideration was the fact that an integral part of the foundation's work is the production in eight recording studios of "talking book" tape cassettes.
"We employ actors and actresses, radio and television personalities to narrate our books," Mr. Augusto said, "and that pool of talent exists here. We wanted to be in an international city because we are involved internationally in the blindness field. And after some investigation, we felt that the real-estate costs in other cities were not dramatically better."
But housing costs can be daunting -- so daunting that organizations find themselves unable to attract the people they need.
THAT was a reason the Boys and Girls Clubs moved in March to Peachtree Street in Atlanta. Its old headquarters, a six-story building at 771 First Avenue, near 44th Street and directly across from the United Nations, is now on the market.
"We have to have a national staff of the highest quality," said the president, Thomas G. Garth. "We would have a staff position open and perhaps the best person to fill it would be from Omaha. They would say, 'I'd like the position but I can't afford the financial sacrifice.' We had an accumulation of these experiences in our hiring."
That did not mean that the organization was headed for the suburbs. "Since we are really focused on people who live in urban areas and are primarily from economically disadvantaged backgrounds," Mr. Garth said, "we wanted to stay in a city with an urban image and urban issues."
Also, Mr. Garth said, "Our staff has to be out in the field, so we needed a good airline hub that had competitive air fares."
The organization looked at Atlanta, Baltimore, Dallas, Fort Worth and Newark. Several things started to turn the tide in Atlanta's favor. For instance, Mr. Garth said, the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce conveyed the "sense that they want to work really hard and want you to have the sense that you're important."
Then there was the Coca-Cola connection. Mr. Woodruff was a member of the board of governors of the Boys and Girls Clubs, Mr. Garth noted, as is Roberto C. Goizueta, the current chairman and chief executive. The Woodruff Foundation was "helpful in our acquiring a new home," Mr. Garth said.
CARE's international character fit well with Woodruff's emphasis on "broadening the dimensions of the community experience," as Mr. McTier described it.
"They think about the city in a holistic way," said Katharine Day Bremer, senior vice president of marketing for CARE, speaking about the Woodruff Foundation. "They have set the internationalization of the city as an objective and CARE's advent to Atlanta was part of that."
CARE had its own objectives. "We're not occupying much more space than we were in New York," Ms. Bremer said, "but the purpose of the move was to lower the operating costs of the organization and, because housing is more affordable, it gives us the opportunity to rotate more of the overseas staff through headquarters."
CARE opened its new headquarters last September in a five-story building in downtown Atlanta and has put its old building, 660 First Avenue, at 38th Street, on the market.
Besides the $2.5 million grant from Woodruff, Ms. Bremer said architectural, contracting and legal services had been donated to CARE, and furnishings had been made available at a discount. She said the goal of the move was the saving of $10 million over 10 years and that "we are on track."
Mr. Gray said the United Negro College Fund would "add millions to our bottom line" over the next 10 years through consolidation and relocation. His statement, contained in a news release, did not specify the savings.
The fund is already on the move but the building's other owner, the National Urban League, has not yet reached a decision. The new president and chief executive, Hugh B. Price, said through a spokesman that the organization is "looking for new space in Manhattan." He did not elaborate.
Clay Lifflander, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, said relocations were inevitable but that the flow need not always be out of New York.
"We're always going to lose some," he said. "The trick is to try to keep everything we can and attract new not-for-profit and trade organizations to the city." He cited two potential newcomers, which he did not name, with more than 800 jobs between them.
"Over 10 percent of the jobs in the city are held by not-for-profit institutions," he said. "It's one of our targeted growth industries."
The city's Industrial Development Agency has provided some $350 million to nonprofit organizations over the last seven years, he said, for projects like construction, renovation, expansion, acquisition, refinancing and installation of new building systems.
The Economic Development Corporation contributes to the Nonprofit Facilities Fund, which provides loans of up to $500,000 for the development or expansion of facilities.
ALSO, the Industrial Development Agency technically holds title to portions of the 34-story tower at 120 Wall Street known as the Association Center. Municipal ownership lets the landlord, Silverstein Properties, rent to nonprofit tenants without charging for real estate taxes, a saving that can amount to $6 to $8 a square foot a year.
The Association Center was announced three years ago by Mayor David N. Dinkins. Since then, 14 nonprofit tenants have signed leases for some 116,000 square feet of space. Among them are Freedom House, the Alan Guttmacher Institute, Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, Ms. Foundation for Women, Acoustical Society of America, Inform Inc., Society of Women Engineers, National Neurofibromatosis Foundation and American Vacuum Society.
"Close to 90 percent of them are coming from midtown or midtown south," said Ed Kulik, senior vice president of Silverstein Properties. Downtown is not normally a spot where one expects nonprofit groups to gather. However, Mr. Kulik said, "With their fundraisers, they depend heavily on financial institutions and being down in their environment, many feel, will be helpful."
Mr. Dolci, of the Society of Association Executives, said the Association Center was a success but that more was needed.
"What could be marketed and be even more successful," he said, "would be a similar building in midtown. Headquarters feel that they must be in the midtown area because of the members and delegations that come in and out of New York all the time."
To which Mr. Lifflander responded: "Would we be interested in a not-for-profit center in midtown? By all means. I'd caution one thing -- everybody knows that midtown is more expensive than downtown."
Actually, the new owners of the former Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. headquarters, 830 Third Avenue, have in mind something along those lines: a condominium for nonprofit organizations or United Nations missions.
After three years on the market, the 13-story building at 51st Street was purchased last month by the R.F.R. Holding Corporation, an investment group based in Frankfurt whose partners are Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs. "That building was on the market for a very long time," Mr. Rosen said. "The reason was the asking price was so high."
Neither Mr. Rosen nor Mary Rose Main, national executive director of the Girl Scouts, would disclose the ultimate price.
The Girl Scouts, Ms. Main said, are "nicely settled" in the office condominium that they purchased in 1991 at 420 Fifth Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets. Earlier this year, they were joined at 420 Fifth by the Rockefeller Foundation, which moved from 1133 Avenue of the Americas.
At 830 Third Avenue, Mr. Rosen said the plan was to sell condominium units to nonprofit organizations, which would be exempt from property taxes as owners, as the Girl Scouts and Rockefeller Foundation are. (The Association Center is the only building where nonprofits are exempt as tenants; elsewhere, their landlords pass the real estate taxes along in rent.)
FLOOR sizes range from 6,000 to 11,500 square feet, Mr. Rosen said, and prospective occupants have expressed interest in units of as many as four floors. The renovation is being designed by the Philips Janson Group of Manhattan. The 38-year-old building will get new systems and a new lobby.
An existing condominium is the Nonprofit Center of New York, 305 Seventh Avenue, at 27th Street. This 20-story loft building still has furriers but is now home to about 15 nonprofit groups, said Brian S. Waterman, a managing director of Newmark & Company Real Estate, which leases and manages the building. Recent deals include the Rabbinical Council of America and the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development.
An office condominium is one possibility for 500 East 62d Street, which is being marketed by Grubb & Ellis New York and Webb & Brooker. The 22-year-old tower has 100,000 square feet of space. The College Fund and Urban League bought it in 1974 for $2.875 million, after selling their building at 55 East 52d Street to Fisher Brothers.
With so many medical institutions nearby, there is a special focus in marketing to nonprofit health-care agencies, said Norman K. Livingston, senior managing director of Grubb & Ellis. The building might also be converted to institutional housing, he said, or used by groups related to the United Nations.
If any one of the buildings for sale has a U.N. claim, it would be the former Boys and Girls Clubs headquarters. "We have the last piece of private property across the street from it," Mr. Garth said. "We feel a natural client is a country that wants proximity and visibility to the United Nations."
One of those countries might be the United States, whose mission is a block away.
The prime location, Mr. Garth said, was an important factor leading to the decision to move. "We had a sense," he said, "that the building might be a very valuable asset that could go into our endowment."
CARE's seven-story building with its distinctive corner dome, home to the Kips Bay Brewing Company at the turn of the century, is still being used as a regional office by CARE but it is on the market.
The American Foundation for the Blind found a buyer for its 16th Street property in the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, which sold its building at Fifth Avenue and 86th Street to the Serge Sabarsky Foundation for Expressionist Art, which is to use it as a museum.

A Satellite Workshop for Peekskill's Artists' Colony

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

DATELINE: PEEKSKILL

 BODY:
THE campaign to enrich downtown Peekskill's artists' colony will get a boost later this month when the Westchester Art Workshop, a school in White Plains that is accredited by the State University of New York, opens a satellite campus here.
"This will bring 600 to 1,000 people into the downtown," said Mayor Frances S. Gibbs. "We worked very hard to convince the school that Peekskill would be a complementary location for them, and allow the school to get new enrollments from northern Westchester." 
 The school, which is part of Westchester Community College, will lease 10,000 square feet on the ground floor of a downtown building that once housed a Woolworth's. Part of the upper floor is now occupied by the Parole Board of New York State, said Edmond Schorno, assistant city manager for development.
"This is just another of the pieces that is taking Peekskill to the next level," Mr. Schorno said. "It's really moving in a positive direction. There's definitely momentum."
For the last several years, the city has been actively pursuing new uses for the large blocks of space left behind by departing anchor stores. In June, it completed the purchase of a 24,000-square-foot building that had been vacated by the Peekskill 5 & 10 in the fall.
The city paid $300,000 for the building and is now in the process of renovating the space to create artists' lofts and studios on the upper floors and retail space at the street level.
"We are close to a lease signing for part of the lower floor," the Mayor said. Declining to name the retailer, she did say it was a stationery and art supply store. "And we're talking to other potential tenants for the other space."
The ultimate plan, she added, is for the city to get the building fully leased and then sell it to a private investor. "We gave ourselves a year to find tenants, but in just a few months it's looking very positive. We're ahead of schedule."
Another vacant downtown building, which has 30,000 square feet, was vacated by the Steinbach department store four years ago and continues to be a blight on the downtown, Mayor Gibbs said. "The problem is that Steinbach has a lease on the building until 2007. So the landlord isn't undergoing any hardship. After we get our building leased, we're going to take a look at that situation and see if we can convince the landlord to do something."
AROUND the time that Steinbach left, Peekskill had hit its lowest point. It was characterized by empty storefronts and a generally run-down appearance. As shoppers switched to nearby malls, the downtown became a hangout for idlers, many of whom were left unemployed by the flight of business.
That's when Ralph DiBart, an urban planner and development consultant from Scarsdale, was hired by the city to transform its downtown. He decided the best use was to reinvent the city completely as an alternative community for artists from New York City.
"We had all this vacant space, especially above the retail level, some of which hadn't been occupied for 30 to 40 years," Mr. DiBart said.
The concept of attracting artists occurred to him because Peekskill was already home to the Paramount Center for the Arts, a 1,000-seat theater, built in 1930. It presents a full line of theatrical performances, as well as dance and classical music concerts. "I saw that it drew a healthy distance from the city," Mr. DiBart said. "People were already coming to Peekskill for the arts."
In addition, the Gothic and Victorian-style buildings downtown lent themselves to loft and studio conversions, Mr. DiBart said. So he began an aggressive artist recruiting campaign through direct mail and advertisements in The Village Voice.
The city then created a special purpose zoning district downtown that permitted artists to live and work in lofts above retail space. "The goal of the first two years was to have 50 artists in the city," Mr. DiBart said. "We've met that goal and now we're looking to bring in 25 more."
The biggest draw for artists continues to be the low rents, relative to Manhattan. The average living/working loft is 1,000 to 1,200 square feet and rents for $800 to $900 a month. Rents for studios average $400 for 350 to 400 square feet.
With its artist's recruiting program firmly in place, the city is now turning its attention to making badly needed repairs. This year, it received $1 million in state funds to refurbish Central Avenue, which links downtown to the waterfront. The repairs will include updating the drainage system, installing new sidewalks and landscaping, and resurfacing the street.
In addition, a $180,000 Federal grant will go to improving portions of Main Street, including landscaping, new lighting fixtures and reconstruction of curbs and sidewalks. Work on both street projects is expected to begin in the spring of 1995, the Mayor said.
PERHAPS the most urgently needed repairs involve the city's waterfront, said Dwight Douglas, director of planning. "In 1990, we did a redevelopment plan to determine what improvements were necessary for the waterfront," Mr. Douglas said. "Now we're beginning to implement those recommendations."
A $750,000 state environmental bond grant will be used to refurbish the shoreline at the 12-acre Riverfront Green, a city-owned park. "The wave action has caused considerable erosion," Mr. Douglas said, both to the shoreline and to the city's public boat launch, which is in the park. Portions of the launch have sunk, and may need to be replaced, Mr. Douglas said.
About $150,000 from the same state grant will be used to reconstruct a dilapidated pier at the one-and-a-half acre Charles Point Pier, which is slated to become a park soon. "It's just dirt now," Mr. Douglas said. "But it has a magnificent view of the river, and a deep-water port."
In the future, the city would like to create a trail connecting the Riverfront Green to the Charles Point Pier Park.
"The first step is to do the shoreline improvements," Mr. Douglas said. "All the work has to be approved by the state Department of Environmental Conservation. We're submitting permit applications within a month. Realistically, we probably won't be able to begin work on the waterfront until next spring."

Sociology, Economics and Art Pottery

BYLINE: By BETTY FREUDENHEIM 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
PROVING that there can be more to a pot than its shape, glaze and function, an exhibition of American art pottery at the Newark Museum provides insights into the sociology and economics of potters and the ceramic industry from 1880 to 1930. And a display of vessels of contemporary work focuses on the esthetic goals of today's clay artists.
Dull and pedantic? Decidedly not. The work is of top quality and surprisingly varied. The show's title, "American Art Pottery: An Uneasy Evolution," hints at the obstacles faced by Victorian china painters and potters who endeavored to raise the quality and taste of handmade ceramics above the level of industrial products. 
 The examples are chosen from the museum's ceramic collection, started in 1910, the year after the museum was founded. It is now recognized as one of the best-documented and most comprehensive groups of American art pottery in the country, with more than 300 pieces.
"This show is not about the craftsmanship of art pottery," said Ulysses G. Dietz, the curator of decorative arts. "Here we see the tension between art and industry. Commerce hampered artistry, and the artists were often very impractical."
In the late 19th century, men were allotted the heavy tasks of potting and firing the kilns of the art potteries. Many women who needed to work for a living chose careers of ceramic design and decorating to escape being factory workers. In New Orleans, Sophie Newcomb College for Women established an art pottery that served as a training ground.
An 1894 brown mug, which depicts a hobgoblin on one side, suggests that ceramic designers were not always practical. Rows of holes around the rim, unless you cover them wih your fingertops, would certainly cause the contents to dribble out. No wonder it is named "Puzzle Mug."
By contrast, what could be more elegant than a tall faience bottle vase adorned with a dragonfly, a bird and raspberries all edged in gold? The background resembles ivory-toned silk with quilting.
A few artists worked in their studios. One of the three delicate bud vases by Adelaide Alsop Robineau, dated 1914, has a citron glaze that glows like crystalized frost on a window. Another, created 10 years later, has the white crackle glaze flowing down like melting snow.
Economic problems plagued most of these independent artists. Robineau was fortunate to have a husband who could support her career and help with the glaze formulas. But accidents could be costly and frustrating. After an entire kiln load turned out to be blistered and warped, he complained that "anyone who is foolish enough to do porcelains ought to be shut up in an insane asylum."
George Ohr has been called the "mad potter of Biloxi." At craft fairs, he demonstrated his skill on the potter's wheel with his 24-inch-long mustache tucked down into his shirt. Although flower pots and chimney pots provided a living, his creative life lay in his "mud babies," which are now avidly sought by collectors.
These skillful, delightfully witty pots bear the imprints of his thumbs as he twisted and bent the paper-thin clay. But pouring tea from the teapot on display could invite trouble. Its handle is too lumpy to grasp, and the lid seems very insecure. Obviously, function was irrelevant.
Ohr believed himself to be a genius; after 1900, he sold only the "gimcracks." His dream was to have the best work -- 6,000 pieces -- purchased en masse for the nation. But the pots remained in the family warehouse until 1972, when a New York antiques dealer bought them.
Sometimes ceramic artists treated pots like canvases for painting. A monumental vase from the Rockwood Pottery in Cincinnati, decorated by Maria Longworth Nichols in 1883, features a romantic scene with dragonflies and water birds, framed with bands of patterned gold.
"Fiddleheads," a vase designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany for the Tiffany Pottery in Corona, N.Y., takes on a sculptural aspect. Each fern frond rises into an ornate swirl at the top. But even the family store couldn't sell enough to keep his pottery going.
An Art Deco vase from the Fulper Pottery in Flemington, N.J., was created before a disastrous fire hit the company in 1929. The Depression brought an end to most of the other art potteries.
This show runs through June 1995.
The interplay of work by 14 contemporary ceramic artists is dynamic. Each piece expresses a distinctive personality; they harmonize in spite of the cacophony of colors and forms. Mr. Dietz created pairs of male and female ceramists and assigned one philosophic heading to both. Usually the examples are totally dissimilar.
Mary Lou Higgins and Ralph Bacerra have each created a work in "Decorated Vessel" category. Two figures recline around the outside of her bowl, which is titled "Circle of Hope; Circuit of Dreams." The hands reach out and grasp, while faces stare into the void. The mysterious landscape inside might be the very depths of the sea.
Mr. Bacerra's "Bird Platter" conveys a crazy quilt of overlapping patterns that assume the contours of birds in flight with eyes and wings of pink, gold and lavender. The flowing lines suggest the illusions found in W. C. Escher's art.
Another category is called "Perfect Pot." The impossible goal of creating such a pot is represented by Roseline Delisle's precisely striped blue and white vase. Although the contours are smooth and exact, the actual construction is complex. Its finial lid comes apart into two pieces.
Harrison McIntosh's version of perfection is a hand-thrown pot with flowing stripes of umber on beige. Although functional work had fallen into disfavor when it was formed in the 1960's, the vase could hold flowers with a quiet grace.
Beatrice Wood's "Chalice" has the brilliant gold luster of a medieval church vessel. Reflections of light and color add subtle nuances to the multiple curves of its massive form. This 101-year-old artist continues to amaze her admirers with a profusion of elegant, shimmering vessels and small erotic sculptures that she fashions for her two annual gallery shows in New York City and Los Angeles.
"Acorn Form" by Val Cushing is the other half of "Primal Pots" pairing. This large jar has a tall spinelike handle that thrusts upward on the top.
The show runs through Sept. 4. The Newark Museum is at 49 Washington Street. Hours are noon to 5 P.M. Wednesday through Sunday. Admission is free.

HEADLINE: The Booming, Bulging Tex-Mex Border

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
M. G. (Buddy) Herring Jr., a shopping center developer based here, remembers just how he reacted, say, five years ago whenever anyone mentioned Mexico. "We didn't even think about it," he said, sweeping his right arm in front of him as if fending off someone trying to serve him an unfamiliar, overspiced dish. "We had enough opportunities in the United States."
Today, an easel in his conference room holds a map of Mexico, with orange adhesive dots on Leon, Torreon, Chihuahua and Monterrey. He is so busy building shopping centers in these cities and making plans for more that he no longer even bothers with the United States. 
 When Mr. Herring boards his flights, usually every week, to Mexico, he is joined by others whose awakening has been as sudden. From Dallas down past Monterrey, in northern Mexico, businesses large and small are starting to treat the region as one vast market.
Call it the broadening border. Or, better yet, la frontera amplianda. Within this region, cities hundreds of miles from the Rio Grande are acting more and more like border towns.
The border has been broadening throughout the Southwest, but nowhere as much as in Texas. Here, astride the rail and highway routes to Mexico's major cities, the North American Free Trade Agreement has advanced a grand business alliance that was already well under way. Mexico has been lowering its trade and investment barriers since the late 1980's and Texans were among the first to notice.
Business people in El Paso and Laredo, Tex., Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and other border cities have long crossed the Rio Grande. Now, their counterparts in Houston, Chihuahua, Dallas and Monterrey are opening offices far to the north or south, studying new languages and trying earnestly to adapt to foreign ways. Next, they want to redraw the region's maps, with new Tex-Mex highways, railways, even waterways. [Page 6.]
Last year, Texas shipped $20.4 billion worth of goods to Mexico, 49 percent of the United States' Mexican exports and more than three times as much as any other state. Next came California, with $6.5 billion, followed by Arizona, Michigan, Illinois and New York. Although these Commerce Department figures might favor Texas slightly by including some goods made elsewhere but only stored here, few doubt that Texas is the overwhelming leader.
"The impact of Mexican trade on the American economy divides the United States neatly in two," said William A. Orme Jr. in his book "Continental Shift: Free Trade and the New North America" (The Washington Post Company). "Texas, and everywhere else." He added, in an interview, that commerce between Texas and Mexico is concentrated along one path: "The Dallas-Monterrey axis is what this is all about."
Dallas has the bankers, lawyers, consultants and financiers, as well as the rails, highways and airports, to speed Mexican commerce. Monterrey, 578 highway miles south in the state of Nuevo Leon, brings Mexico's largest manufacturers and a determination to face north no matter what the directives from Mexico City.
 
Coveting Across Borders
 Business people in these swaggering cities should know that a company across the border probably covets their customers.
Cinemark, based in Dallas, has battled Mexico's most powerful labor union and other movie houses to give Monterrey, and Mexico, its first chain of multiscreen theaters. A Monterrey-based upstart, Aeroejecutivo, has started a fare war to Houston with Continental. Among its weapons: beverage carts stocked, at least initially, with free Chivas Regal Scotch, Bacardi 1873 Solera rum and Sauza Conmemorativo tequila.
The Dallas-Monterrey axis also runs through San Antonio, the nation's largest city with an Hispanic majority, and Los Dos Laredos, or Laredo, Tex., and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, the busiest customs posts on the border. A parallel, coastal axis includes Houston, with its port and many oil service companies that are increasingly busy in Mexico.
But if San Antonio and Houston are finding that their well-developed skills in courting Mexican business are now having a greater payoff, it is Dallas, farther north, that has shown the most startling turn from ignoring Mexico to embracing it.
Dallas, a metropolitan area of 3.9 million people, has earnestly sought recognition as a world-class city. The city's promoters tout its direct flights to Paris, London and Frankfurt, with no contaminating stops in New York required.
About five years ago, a consulting firm delicately suggested that Dallas might find it easier to cultivate ties with Mexico than with Asia or Europe. The idea aroused more amusement than immediate action.
Wealthy Mexicans are still far more likely to have houses in Houston or San Antonio than Dallas, and race relations here remain sore.
But as the home of some world-class dealmakers, at least (Basses, Hunts, Richard Rainwater, Boone Pickens), Dallas and neighboring Fort Worth always have an eye for the main chance, however risky. While Dallas is the home of the trade agreement's leading opponent, Ross Perot, even Mr. Perot's computer services company searched late last year, without much success, for business in Monterrey.
IN Dallas 1994, saying you are just back from closing a deal in Monterrey or Mexico City, or from honing your accent in Cuernavaca, confers as much cachet as saying, in Dallas 1984, that you had just topped out your office building or bought your own frisky savings and loan.
Dallas's economic growth is once again outstripping the nation's, and many here credit the opening of Mexico's markets to the region's electronics and industrial supplies, and, increasingly, its business services and consumer goods.
Neiman Marcus, with its operations based here, has just made plans to issue its first catalogue for Mexico, and J. C. Penney, in nearby Plano, will open its first Mexican store, in Monterrey, next year. The Dallas Morning News, available at Monterrey airport and hotel newsstands, now has a bureau there.
Texas, and Dallas in particular, are developing their own foreign policies. You don't hear Gov. Ann W. Richards demanding a Constitutional amendment or National Guard patrols to help keep illegal aliens out, unlike the politicians in California. Instead, Texas and Nuevo Leon are joining in business research and trade missions, and issuing brochures titled either "Vacaciones en Dos Naciones" or "Two Nation Vacation."
Just last week, the Mexican Secretary of Commerce, Jaime Serra Puche, came to the Dallas World Trade Center to seek investments and push exports. Mayor Steve Bartlett handed him a key to the city and a string tie with a Dallas bolo clip, saying, "We in Dallas have staked our economic future on Nafta."
The next morning, down another trade center hallway, Jeffrey E. Garten, the United States Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, gathered Texas exporters around a table in part to keep trade flowing in the other direction.
Next Sunday, about 100 Dallas business people, based here and in Mexico, will go to Mexico City to entertain their clients, and hunt for more, at a preseason game between the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Oilers.
Many Dallas deals that don't seem Mexican still have a Latin accent. Last month, Thomas O. Hicks, chairman here of the Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst buyout firm, agreed to buy a little-known home furnishings and decorations business from Donald J. Carter, who also owns the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. Mr. Hicks cited sales prospects in Mexico, found on his frequent trips there, as helping to justify a price of $1 billion.
If El Paso, San Antonio, Laredo and Houston have also proclaimed themselves the centers of free trade -- Muleshoe (pop. 4,551) might be the largest Texas city that still hasn't -- Dallas is trying to drown them all out. In March, when Dallas won a new North American labor secretariat, with only 16 employees and uncertain powers, United States Representative John Bryant, a Dallas Democrat, reacted as if his town had just become New York, Toronto and Mexico City all rolled into one. "We are today announcing Dallas as the capital of North America," Mr. Bryant said at a ceremony.
Dallas just might meet its match in Monterrey. It has mountains and it has many more factories, but there Dallas visitors can find the familiar, forthright dedication to profit, similarly untainted by modesty.
Monterrey has named both its baseball teams -- Sultanes and Industriales, or the Sultans and the Industrialists -- to advertise its wealth, while it schemes to start Mexico's first teams in the American baseball and basketball leagues.
AT the center of the city, population 3 million, stands not a church or city hall, but a towering monolith, flame orange with a green laser shooting from the top. Its name: the Beacon of Commerce. The only question is whether the laser is meant to vaporize competing stores a two-and-a-half-hour drive away across the border in Laredo, or to zap meddlesome politicians up from Mexico City.
"I should not be the one to say this,' said Fernando Villarreal Palomo, the director of Nuevo Leon's chamber of industry. "But among Mexican states, we now have the most opportunities of success with Nafta."
A magazine on his desk features the Dallas Cowboys, Mr. Villarreal's other passion besides industry. He tries to get to five or six games a year. An expensive habit, but as he tells his wife, "I do not drink. I do not smoke. I do not play around with other girls. I just go to the Cowboys."
Mr. Villarreal, a former executive with some of Monterrey's largest companies, is now a partner in two Sirloin Stockade restaurants in town, and another in Guadalajara, franchised from a chain based in Hutchinson, Kan.
Monterrey's industrial conglomerates have been building plants and buying companies in the United States for years. A partnership between Vitro, Mexico's major glassmaker, and Corning fell apart early this year. But back in 1989, Vitro bought Anchor Glass, the second-largest maker of glass containers in the United States, outright for about $820 million.
To follow their American investments, Monterrey executives can open El Norte, the city's leading newspaper, to a full page of news translated from The Wall Street Journal. They say they leave worries about the Aug. 21 presidential election to politicians in Mexico City.
So many United States retailers are coming to Monterrey that Marcos Merino V., a Price Waterhouse consultant there, advised another interested American department store chain last month that the market is already crowded.
"They were just trying to find out, 'Where is Mexico?' " Mr. Merino laughed, during an interview. As if to answer, he glanced through his office window at the stores (Sears, Dillard's, J. C. Penney), offices and hotel going up around the Plaza Fiesta San Agustin mall, in one of Monterrey's wealthiest neighborhoods.
The mall expansion is a joint project between Monterrey developers and Mr. Herring, of Dallas. It was only two years ago, at a Las Vegas convention, that friends introduced him to business people from Monterrey. Impressed that they knew just what they wanted to build and where, he flew down after the convention. Now he has three more Mexican projects, and prospects in Mexico City.
Unexpected costs and bureaucratic rigmarole keep him down in Mexico at least half the time. In a country where even slight changes in construction plans require state approval, the Monterrey project became entangled in a feud between the Mayor and the Governor of Nuevo Leon. "Nobody can run down to Mexico and pick up a project right away," Mr. Herring said.
IT'S not that such rapidly increasing commerce is causing the border to vanish, as some scholars and writers have insisted. Language, laws, living standards and business practices remain vastly different along the world's longest boundary between an information-age nation and one still building its sewers, phone lines and roads.
Crossing this boundary for business involves risks, costs and frustrations far beyond those at home. In many ways, the new trade pact defines the border more sharply, requiring more detailed inspections there, especially to screen out goods from beyond North America.
One result has been more European and Asian businesses building plants in Texas or northern Mexico to serve the whole continent. Japanese auto companies are joining those from the United States to turn a broad swath below Monterrey into Detroit South.
Along this broadening border, a national boundary offers less and less protection from rivals.
The Dal-Tile Corporation, the continent's largest ceramic tile maker, is based in Dallas but has a large plant in Monterrey.
Interceramic, one of Mexico's largest tile makers, has meanwhile made plans to open a factory in the Dallas suburbs this fall. Last year, as the fight over the trade pact raged, Interceramic put up a billboard here saying, "Dallas just gained 400 new jobs . . . from a Mexican company. Interceramic supports Nafta."
AN Interceramic sales office, in the Dallas area since 1988, has already made the company the largest Mexican importer of floor tile, said David Hyland, president of Interceramic U.S.A. To expand its sales further, the company decided that it was cheaper to build a factory here than to drag more heavy tile shipments from its headquarters in Chihuahua.
Dallas has become much more friendly to Mexican companies. Now, local banks are vying for Mr. Hyland's attention. "A few years ago, if you were a Mexican company, they didn't care," he said.
Going to meetings in Chihuahua is no longer an all-day ordeal, with a switch down in Mexico City, since Lone Star Airlines began direct service from Dallas this April. At first, the plane was empty, Mr. Hyland said. "Now it's packed."
Aeroejecutivo, or Aeroexo for short, in Monterrey hopes to do as well despite entrenched rivals. Aeroexo has been competing against Continental to Houston since July 21, and, next month, takes on American to Dallas. Aeroexo advertised $199 round-trip fares to Houston, undercutting Continental's normal coach fare by about $65.
Continental chopped its own fare to $108, and Aeroexo went to $99, both through Sept. 4. Taxes add about $35.
A daily 6 P.M. Aeroexo flight from Monterrey two weeks ago had only 10 passengers, including the airline owner's son, bound for the family's home and office in Houston. The free drinks added conviviality. By last Thursday, the evening flight had about 30 passengers.
Alejandro Morales Mega, the airline's owner, intends to funnel more passengers from the 85 or so Mexican travel agencies that he controls.
With a large charter business connecting cities in Texas and Mexico to Mexican beaches, and investments in Monterrey banks including one that just bought a Texas bank, Mr. Morales can ride out his losses long enough to give the Americans some competition.
Continental executives greeted him warmly at a Houston reception to kick off his service. "Like gentlemen, they said, 'Go ahead,' " Mr. Morales recalled. "Maybe that's because they don't know me yet."
 
 
 
REMAKING THE ROAD MAP
 EVER since the transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, through the building of the interstates and the growth of air traffic, Washington has backed the creation of corridors between East and West. Now, from the broadening border come plans to draw more lines running from north to south.
It takes a good map to sort out all the rival highway schemes. The I-69 Mid-Continent Highway Coalition wants to extend an interstate, which runs from Michigan only into Indiana, down to the Mexican border. Freight that now rumbles through Dallas on I-35 toward Mexico would often go through Houston instead. Guess where this plan is popular?
Members of an I-35 Corridor Coalition have fought back by demanding improvements to their road -- perhaps special truck lanes, maybe high-speed rail -- and suggesting that Interstate 69 could be built in the next century, or two. Some who fantasize about bullet trains talk of a Dallas-to-Monterrey run.
From the tip of West Texas, El Pasoans have cooked up a Camino Real Economic Alliance to make a route from Sante Fe, N.M., through El Paso to Chihuahua the spine of North American trade.
On the rails, a new North-South trade route has been arranged just this year. Santa Fe Pacific opened a $100 million hub in Fort Worth this spring, speeding truck and rail traffic to the Mexican border. Then, in June, Burlington Northern, based in Fort Worth and with rail links to Canada but not Mexico, agreed to buy Santa Fe, in part to span the free trade zone.
Among the Gulf of Mexico ports, Houston and Veracruz, Mexico, intend to team up to send more ships between them.
But why stop there, when the United States and Mexico have no waterways inland? The Governor of the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas wants to trench through Matamoras, Mexico, and Brownsville, Tex., to link Mexican and American intercoastal waterways -- and a top American trade official has talked the plan up.
Though these ideas might seem like multibillion-dollar dreams, just remember that many Texas politicians, from Sam Rayburn to Lyndon Johnson to Lloyd Bentsen, have turned dreams into pork.

HEADLINE: In Supercomputers, Bigger and Faster Means Trouble

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
FIVE years ago the Defense Department gave $12 million to the Thinking Machines Corporation, an innovative start-up company in Cambridge, Mass. An assignment came with the seed money: take high-performance computing to new frontiers.
So Thinking Machines began a bold bid to design a new kind of computer that, by 1995, would probably cost $80 million and be more than a thousand times faster than the most powerful supercomputers available in 1989. It was a Government-subsidized effort to build the Ferrari of supercomputers. The initiative reflected Washington's high-tech policies and priorities in the late 80's, when the Cold War was still on, Star Wars spending flowed and computing firepower was considered a measure of national security. 
 How times have changed. Last week, the executives of Thinking Machines were shuttling across the country to talk to potential investors or buyers, in a desperate effort to avoid bankruptcy. Management mistakes and falling behind schedule in product-development plans certainly contributed to the company's fall.
But the plight of Thinking Machines also shows how much tougher the supercomputer market has become with the Government no longer spending freely and competition stiffening. Several companies in the $1.7 billion-a-year supercomputer business are struggling. The Intel Corporation's supercomputer division is losing money, and industry sources say the big chip maker may be looking to sell its business. Cray Research has seen the sales of its traditional supercomputers slip. The Maspar Computer Corporation has been kept afloat by a recent cash infusion from investors. And the Cray Computer Corporation, started five years ago by supercomputer inventor Seymour Cray after he left Cray Research, remains in business only because the founder has repeatedly dipped into his own pockets for funds.
"Supercomputing is just another victim of the end of the Cold War," said Danny Hillis, the cofounder of Thinking Machines and the company's chief scientist.
The Government programs, and Thinking Machines, did change the face of supercomputing. The company pioneered the use of so-called massively parallel design, lashing thousands of inexpensive microprocessors together to build a powerful machine. Massively parallel machines work by splitting complex scientific and mathematical equations into pieces and then solving the many parts at the same time, or in parallel.
By contrast, traditional supercomputers run on a few, costly processors and process complex equations a step at a time, or sequentially. For years, they were the workhorses for military research laboratories and were used by scientists and engineers to solve a wide variety of problems from weather prediction to molecular modeling.
But parallel machines, with their low-cost microprocessors, transformed the economics of supercomputing. Even Cray Research, leader in traditional supercomputers, has had to adopt parallel models to compete.
Still the early proponents of massively parallel processing, like Thinking Machines, have foundered as the market has shifted away from machines costing $15 million and more that the Government used to buy to far cheaper machines for the commercial market. Latecomers to parallel processing, like I.B.M. and Silicon Graphics, are doing better today by selling machines that start at $300,000 to $500,000 to research laboratories and corporate customers.
"Parallel computing has the potential to create a business segment that didn't exist before," said Irving Wladawsky-Berger, the executive who heads the International Business Machines Corporation's new effort.
The companies struggling in the supercomputer field are the ones who built their business in the 80's and took their cue from Washington. In position papers and budget requests, it was an inspiring vision -- ultra-fast supercomputers that would greatly improve mankind's capacity to do everything from predict the weather to design miracle drugs. Celebrated as the race to a "teraflop" -- jargon for computers that can calculate a trillion mathematical operations each second -- the goal was like going to the moon for the makers of the world's fastest computers.
Today, it looks like a high-end, even elitist technology policy. The Clinton Administration is fond of high-tech programs. But the Administration is more interested in funding projects that will give the American public access to the so-called information highway than spending on high-performance computing efforts that will be used mainly by a relative handful of the nation's scientists.
If Washington has lost interest in subisidizing ever-faster computers, Tokyo apparently has not. A year ago, only two of the world's 20 fastest supercomputers were made in Japan. By the end of June, 10 of the top 20 were Japanese, made by NEC, Fujitsu and Hitachi. Supercomputer purists warn that giving up leadership in the supercomputer speed race could dull the nation's high-tech advantage. But to others, including some computer experts, that argument sounds like special pleading from a niche business too long dependent on Government money.
The shift in American policy has caught the makers of big, multimillion-dollar supercomputers off balance -- and unable to really compete in the commercial market. Total spending by the Defense Department, the largest customer for big supercomputers, is slated to decline 60 percent over the next decade and that will inevitably mean buying fewer big machines, warns Anita K. Jones, director of defense research and engineering at the Pentagon.
Some industry executives say the Government is partly to blame for focusing its high-performance computing initiative narrowly on high-end machines, ignoring programs that might have been directed toward commercial markets.
"You have an industry that was built by the American taxpayer," said Howard A. Richmond, vice president for high performance computing at the Gartner Group, a consulting firm. "The Government programs should have had a little more wisdom and a little more guidance for these companies."
Supercomputer makers had hoped that they would convince corporations that the fastest computers could solve their engineering problems and save them money. For the most part, that has not happened. Like the declining market for mainframe computers, demand for big supercomputers is shrinking, by more than 9 percent annually the past five years, according to the International Data Corporation, a market research firm.
"There's no commercial market at the high-end of the supercomputer business," said Larry Smarr, director of the National Center for Supercomputer Applications, in Urbana, Ill.
One big obstacle to reaching the commercial market has been designing software for massively parallel computers, which has proved more difficult than the industry pioneers had hoped. Breaking big problems into little pieces may open the way to use low-cost microprocessors as hardware, but it created a programming nightmare, particularly in the commercial market, where the variety of business applications is enormous.
"The road to programming massively parallel computers is littered with the bodies of graduate students," said Steve Steinberg, a computer science graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley.
Still, the sales of smaller, less costly parallel computing machines are growing rapidly. Both research labs and companies want the advantages of the technology, but they do not want the huge pricetags and software headaches that go with the biggest massively parallel versions. American Express, Wal-mart and other large corporations use parallel computers to mine customer records for market trends, and smaller companies want to follow their lead.
And the increasingly powerful microprocessors are allowing more modest versions of parallel computing -- like machines that use so-called symmetric multiprocessing and workstations linked together -- to do chores that once could be handled only by the biggest supercomputers. High-performance computers are generally considered to be ones that can achieve speeds of 100 megaflops or more -- or 100 million mathematical operations a second. Today, a personal computer with Intel's Pentium microchip can reach speeds of 16 megaflops or more.
"One computer center after the other is lining up to put a cluster of microprocessors on the floor," said Eugene Brooks, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories in Livermore, Calif. "Their budgets are shrinking and these systems are much more cost effective."
The relentless advance of small-scale computing, which is dominated by big companies, at the expense of the supercomputer makers, traditionally the province of small specialists, shows no signs of letting up.
"This is the end of an era," said Nathan Myhrvold, vice president for advanced technology at the Microsoft Corporation, the largest software maker. "Huge computing problems are not going away, but it's tough to see how any supercomputer company is going to survive in the long-term."
Microsoft, in fact, is aiming for one market that supercomputer makers are hoping will be a promising new business for them.
Earlier this year, Microsoft announced its program called Tiger, intended to permit groups of microprocessor-based desktop machines to operate as video servers. If successful, the Tiger software will sharply reduce the cost of computers needed to run the video servers that will deliver movies-on-demand to American households before long.
With the market moving away from its big, costly computers, Thinking Machines has increasingly looked like an endangered species. In 1992, after a General Accounting Office study criticized its funding practices, the Pentagon's Advanced Projects Research Agency froze its spending on large massively parallel machines. Some money was eventually freed, but the shift was a setback for Thinking Machines.
The private company's sales fell from $92 million in 1992 to $83 million last year, while losses mounted from $17 million to $20 million. The company went through a management shake-up last fall when its cofounder Sheryl Handler stepped down as president; she left the company altogether last April. Richard Fishman, a corporate lawyer who became the company's president last year, acknowledges that Thinking Machines was slow to face up to its problems, adjust its strategy and go after the mainstream of the high-performance computing market.
"We didn't do what we should have done," he said. "There was a view that our technology was so superior that no one could challenge us. We were wrong."
For Mr. Hillis, the cofounder of Thinking Machines, the experience has proven to be a painful one, but not without rewards.
"The nation set a goal that was clear and specific and now they've changed the goal and we're left having made the investment," he said.
The technology the company pioneered has become an accepted standard in all segments of the computing industry.
"We may die, but we didn't fail," he said.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Foreigners Drive Tokyo's Movements

BYLINE: By James Sterngold 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
It may say Tokyo Stock Exchange over the entrance and the players are predominantly Japanese, but ask an analyst these days who is really controlling the fate of the stock market here, and the answer is likely to be the unexpected -- foreigners.
With overseas investors having loaded up on billions of dollars in Japanese equities in the first half of the year, the Japanese market was one of the strongest in the world. The Nikkei index of 225 issues shot up 18 percent to 20,521.70 on Friday from the beginning of 1994. 
 In dollar terms, the run looks even better. Since the yen rocketed in value against the dollar, the index here has risen about 31 percent on a dollar basis, making Japan, for all its economic woes, a hot investment play.
The past month, however, has been less kind, due in large part to concern over the yen and lack of progress in trade talks between Japan and the United States, which hit an impasse last weekend.
The market has drifted sideways, and several times threatened to break below 20,000. A key reason is that the foreigners, spooked by concerns over the yen, stopped buying. Government figures show foreign investors sold about $500 million more equities than they purchased last month.
Japanese institutions, among the richest in the world, just have not had the appetite to push up their own market. "The biggest question for me is, when are the Japanese going to buy?" said John Baldwin, an analyst here with Jardine Fleming Securities. "My view is they don't need to be buying their own market and they still have major balance sheet problems. If the foreigners are selling, there's nobody else to pick up the slack."
He added, "I see it as a supply and demand thing. There is still an awful lot of share disposal Japanese institutions need to do, and I don't see a lot of interest in picking that up. Some areas of the economy may be improving, but I see it as a kind of profitless prosperity."
Not everyone is that pessimistic, but it is clear that Japanese institutions -- commercial banks, trust banks and insurance companies -- are suffering from two major problems. The collapse of the stock market and the slowdown in the economy four years ago has left a potent residue of bad debts and battered balance sheets throughout corporate Japan. Most analysts say they believe it may take another several years to clean up the mess and restore confidence.
In addition, the recent steep rise in the value of the yen to a near record high of about 100 yen to the dollar, could have a harsh impact. The strong currency has hurt exporters, threatening profits and the recovery. Most expect the economy to grow only about 1 percent this year.
Every time trade talks with Washington get stuck, as they did a week ago, the yen tends to strengthen, because investors expect Japan's surplus to rise further. It does not help that the new prime minister, Tomiichi Murayama, is a Socialist whose party has traditionally tended to be protectionist.
Surprisingly, though, many analysts see this as a temporary lull. They generally expect foreigners to renew their buying because they tend to believe the yen has peaked. And, overall, few expect the economic recovery to get derailed.
"In my view, it's looking more and more like the yen's strength is over," said Jeff Bahrenburg, the strategist for Merrill Lynch Japan. "The economy is going to pick up, and that will do a lot to lower the trade surplus. If the market does decline a lot, I would see that as an opportunity to buy. This has been a bull market correction." However, he added, "It is still a problem that the domestic institutions have been so quiet."
Mr. Bahrenburg said he is forecasting that, within the next nine months or so, the market could well hit 24,000.
Kathy Matsui, the strategist at Goldman Sachs (Japan), is also confident, and has focused not on whether to buy but what to buy. She just returned from a trip to the United States, where, she said, she found many institutions neutral on Japan at the moment. She said, though, that that could be temporary.
"I think a lot of foreigners will be buying on weakness," she said. "The surprise could be on the upside." But Ms. Matsui added, "The domestic institutions are going to remain very cautious. They are still very skeptical. Foreigners are still the marginal players. They can swing things."
Ms. Matsui is focusing on second tier stocks and other shares left behind in the bull run earlier this year. She said she is recommending basic industries like chemical companies, steel companies and shipbuilders, in anticipation of a stronger economy. Ms. Matsui is even putting commercial real estate companies on her buy list.
Even Mr. Baldwin said he sees opportunities in selected areas. He said he will stay away from banks and financial stocks, but that telecommunications companies and selected retailers are benefiting not just from a slowly improving economy but a shift toward restructuring and new businesses.
Yuichi Matsushita, the strategist for Nikko Securities, said he thinks the worst is past because corporate Japan is already working hard to deal with the yen at 100 to the dollar.
"I'm relatively optimistic," he said, "because even if the yen went to 95 or so to the dollar, it wouldn't be a surprise."
He said that, while the Nikkei index might slip slightly below 20,000, it would be temporary, and that he expects the index to rise as high as 25,000 by year's end.

THE ECONOMY
 
July Employment Numbers Add Up to Higher Rates
Job growth is going up, up and away -- so that the inflation-fighting Fed is likely to act this month to raise interest rates a fifth time this year. President Clinton was quick to point out that more than four million new jobs -- the number he pledged to produce by the end of this year -- have been created since he took office. That's all well and good, but he can't take all the credit. Last spring, the economy proved it sometimes has a life of its own; before the Administration was able to present its ill-fated stimulus package to Congress, payrolls jumped in May. Labor Secretary Robert Reich warned then not to "put too much weight on a single month's numbers." Last week, he said figures for July are "further proof that job growth is continuing its solid, steady course." In July, the economy created 259,000 new jobs, about 60,000 more than consensus forecasts. Average hourly earnings rose by 4 cents, to $11.12.
 
Japan Trade Is a Sticky Situation
Talk about bad timing. The Clinton Administration has decided it's time to get tough with Japan on trade. Last week, it formally accused Japan of discriminating against American companies in awarding some contracts. But the Administration is putting on the gloves amid such dizzying political turmoil in Japan that the Asian target's outline is fuzzy: Japan has had four Prime Ministers in a little more than a year. A former United States trade official said prodding a decision out of the "collection of ministries" was like "punching a marshmallow." In the process, experts say, the dollar could spill the most blood -- if the United States gets so frustrated it drives down the dollar's value to sell more goods in Japan.
 
Paul Allen's Gizmo Search
Some Lollapalooza goers are getting more than they bargained for this year. Besides jamming to their favorite alternative-rock bands and hanging loose in the summer heat, some will likely help determine what will be the next gadget or two appearing on store shelves everywhere. Last week, Paul Allen -- a software billionaire who cofounded Microsoft and owns Ticketmaster and part of Egghead Software -- flew to Providence, R.I., to check out his $3 million technology exhibition roaming the country with the music fest. His goal is to discover the next big hit in consumer electronics. Among the computerized offerings the concertgoers experienced was the "Baby Maker" software program, which lets a couple -- regardless of sex -- combine their images digitally to see what their offspring would look like.
 
Clinton Wants R-E-S-P-E-C-T
Dissatisfied with the little bit of commendation he's getting for the economy's performance, President Clinton last week held a news conference to sing his own praises. The White House also brought out backup vocals: eight top economic officials who touted their agencies' successes in the last 18 months. Commerce Secretary Brown harmonized: "I don't think that the President has gotten the credit that he has deserved."
 
Dog Days of Retail
The Gap made a little money in July. The Limited lost a little. But Sears and Woolworth lapped up gains. "The trend in July is no trend," one retail analyst remarked. "Sales are really all over the board." Those erratic sales leave few clues about where sales are headed. The only thread of the retail story is that diversified retailers -- discounters and department stores -- are doing better than stores that simply sell clothing. Sometimes, much better. The merchandise group at Sears, Roebuck announced it sold more appliances the last week of July than in any other week in its history.
 
COMPANIES
 
Upjohn Pays its Probers
Did too! Did not! Did too! Did not! Whatever happened, Upjohn last week agreed to pay $650,000 to several state investigative agencies. In New York, the Attorney General said Upjohn violated state laws against deceptive and misleading business practices when, from September 1992 to March 1993, it paid pharmacists $8 every time a patient they consulted switched from one diabetes drug (Micronase, which lost its patent protection two years ago) to another (Glynase, which is still protected). Upjohn said last week it did nothing wrong in its marketing plan but it would pay eight states -- Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Texas and Wisconsin -- about $84,000 each for their investigative costs.
 
Time Out at Nasdaq
For 34 minutes one day last week, Nasdaq trading was interrupted after a squirrel chewed through a power line and the stock trading system's backup power system failed to kick in. The hapless squirrel can be forgiven. But can the nation's second-largest stock market? It has, after all, donned the garb of a technological leader and seduced leading high-tech companies -- Intel and Microsoft -- that look mighty alluring on its arm. And the outage was only one of three technological breakdowns at Nasdaq since July 14.
 
Cyanamid Gets the Looks
Not long ago, American Cyanamid's dance card was empty. (Earlier this decade, when the company's focus was on manufacturing chemicals, it was an outcast that watched its stock price slide for two dreadfully long years.) In came a new C.E.O., who in the last 18 months has transformed the concern into a health care and agricultural products company by cutting costs and shedding sorry divisions. The makeover worked. Last week, American Home Products presented American Cyanamid with a surprise, $8.5 billion cash takeover offer, causing the company's stock to soar more than 40 percent. Several more suitors may be lining up. Securities experts say European drug and chemical concerns like Bayer, Ciba-Geigy, Hoechst and Zenaca could offer even better propositions.
 
MGM Puts Faith in Vegas
How obsessed are Americans with gambling? Very, MGM and Primadonna Resorts suggested last week when they bet $300 million on yet another Vegas gambling center. (MGM itself just opened the nation's biggest casino resort there six months ago, at a cost of $1 billion.) The latest casino -- New York-New York -- is also one in a string of projects taking shape while Las Vegas luxuriates in a record summer. "This is a sign of confidence in the Las Vegas market," said a University of Las Vegas professor, "but this rush-ahead, rush-ahead philosophy is a gamble, and the fact that MGM cut someone else in indicates that they think it is something of a crap shoot, too."
 
What Now for Barry Diller?
It's a done deal -- unless a more generous offer surfaces in the next month. Barry Diller's QVC, the home shopping channel, is set to be taken over by the cable television giants Tele-Communications Inc. and Comcast. If a better bid does come along, QVC would pay TCI and Comcast a $55 million breakup fee. Otherwise, as agreed last week, the cable duo will snare QVC for $2.5 billion. Ever since Diller joined QVC as chairman about a year and a half ago, he has been seeking a partner. He also courted Home Shopping Network, Paramount Communications and CBS. The restless Diller is not expected to stay.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Out of (South) Africa, Still
Jailed, he inspired song and sit-ins. The personification of how blacks were persecuted under apartheid in South Africa, he was the torch investor activists and students carried to light fires under American companies to divest themselves of operations there. But now that Nelson Mandela is free and leading his country, he can't get investors' attention. Last week -- 10 months after he formally invited foreign business to return -- a snapshot of investment activity since April showed more foreign money flowing out than in, despite the fact that advance scouts of Western dough last year promised investment if peace prevailed and Mandela embraced the free market. Now, potential investors complain about things like a costly labor force and trade barriers.
 
China Market's Painful Start
 When the Chinese Communist Government held its reborn stock market by the feet and slapped its bottom to get it breathing in 1990, China was unprepared for the challenge -- and pains -- the market would bring once it started walking. While the market created quick fortunes for a handful of investors and hit record highs early last year, it wasn't long before it took a fall. Recent months brought a near collapse, and when many first-time Chinese investors panicked and sold off shares, they lost their life savings. Last week, however, the index for the Chinese-only A shares more than doubled. Some frustrated investors vowed to abandon the market and its vagaries. And others talked about "winning" back their losses.

HEADLINE: GARDENING;
The Bug Battle, With Natural Weapons

BYLINE: By JOAN LEE FAUST 

 BODY:
HOLES in leaves are discouraging evidence for any gardener. They indicate that some unwanted creature is about.
Time was that a pesticide was the solution. But times have changed. Creepy crawlers are still about, but instead of rushing for a quick solution, one seeks the identity of the enemy and a safe way to eradicate it. Quite often all-out war is not really necessary. 
 Take the slug problem, for instance. (Those who are squeamish can go on to the next paragraph.) One of the easiest ways to conquer the ubiquitous slug is to hunt it at night with a flashlight. Wear gloves and take along a deep can filled with heavily salted water. Turn over leaves of the slugs' favorite plants such as hosta, dahlias, lettuce -- well, almost anything. Pick off the slugs and drop them into the can of salted water. After a few nights of hunting, no more slugs.
Or try a less direct method: diatomaceous earth. Dust it over the plants, making sure to get under the leaves, and goodbye slugs. Two cautions, however. Be sure to wear a mask during application so the dust does not get into your lungs. Also, apply this dust after rains, and, as it will make the garden look as though someone spilled flour on the plants, do not use it in show areas.
Another common hunt-and-destroy mission involves the enormous tomato hornworm. These caterpillars, about the size of your thumb, devour tomato leaves. Usually tomato plants have just a few of these critters, and the caterpillars are so slow they are easy to pick off the plants and stomp.
Since these caterpillars are the color of the tomato plant stem, they sometimes are difficult to spot. Just look for the pepperlike frass they leave behind and follow their trail.
There are so many other natural weapons in pest warfare, there should be no need to resort to chemicals. A recent manual on natural enemies published by Cornell University states, "Pesticides should be used only to prevent an economic loss."
The Cornell manual, "Natural Enemies of Vegetable Insect Pests," offers an excellent in-depth look at the subject. Written by Michael P. Hoffmann and Anne C. Frodsham, it allows readers to learn about the concepts and uses of biological controls of insects.
It is well illustrated, with color photographs of many insects as well as a number of line drawings. It is available from Cornell University (NVP), Media Services Resource Center, 7 BTP, Ithaca, N.Y. 14850 at a price of $22.50 a copy.
Of biological controls now available for insects, one of the most popular in recent years has been the Safer Products. These are basically soaps derived from fatty acids and are available at most garden sales centers.
One of the appealing things about these sprays is that they are effective on so many of the soft-bodied pests and break down in two days' time.
The Safer spray is also recommended in fighting that devastator of the hemlocks, the woolly adelgid. The recommendation now is to use a dormant oil spray in the spring, usually April, followed by an application of the Safer spray in late May to mid-June. If the horticultural oil spray was missed this past spring, then an application of the Safer spray can be made in late September.
Another popular biological control is the chain of Bt products. The initial product, Bacillus thuringiensis, is specific for the caterpillar phase of many insect pests such as codling moths, cabbage loopers and many of the bagworms. A special strain of this specific bacteria, Bti, has been developed to control mosquito and black fly larvae. It, too, can be found at many supply centers, or by mail order from the Necessary Trading Company, New Castle, Va. 24127-0305.
For those who do not like to spray there are all sorts of traps. One of the most effective traps for white fly is the obvious-looking sticky yellow sheet that can be inserted in a metal holder and poked into the soil around favorite plants. These are especially popular with house plant enthusiasts who do not like to use sprays indoors. The traps are widely available in stores or by mail from Worm's Way, 3151 South Highway 446, Bloomington, Ind. 47401.
For those who have home orchards, Gardener's Supply (128 Intervale Road, Burlington Vt. 05401) sells a kit of traps developed by researchers at the University of Massachusetts. Chief item in this arsenal is the red sphere, which looks like a ripe apple, but controls apple maggots as well as cherry fruit flies. This catalogue also lists the hard-to-find netting for fruit trees and berry bushes.
With a little effort and knowledge, the creepy crawlers can be kept out of the garden without pesticides. It just takes a change of attitude and desire to keep things under control, safely.

HEADLINE: Blind Eye;
Africa Allows Its Tragedies to Take Their Own Course

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER 

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN

 BODY:
IF it takes the spectacle of open mass graves and children sobbing over their dead mothers to prick American interest in Africa, that is not so difficult to understand. Africans are far away. They don't supply American needs or threaten American interests. Their problems often seem beyond comprehension, let alone fixing. Even the sainted Mahatma Gandhi, who spent 21 years in Africa, was mainly concerned about justice for his own people, the Indian immigrants here, not about Africans. The outside world's usual indifference to Africa can be deplored, but at least it can be explained.
 How, though, to explain Africa's indifference to itself?
 
 For however inadequate critics may consider the White House airlift or the French peacekeeping mission called in after Rwanda's genocidal implosion, these are acts of bounteous compassion compared to what Africans themselves have done in this and other tragedies.
 The United Nations has elicited isolated acts of generosity from African countries -- some trucks here, some cash there -- but they are little and late. A few countries volunteered peacekeepers, but even that was not as altruistic as it seems; Zimbabwe, for example, has rented its restive, unemployed soldiers to the United Nations, pocketing much of their pay for the treasury. The Organization of African Unity, the collective voice of African states, has been "helpless and hopeless" on Rwanda, said a United Nations official in the field.
 The evisceration of Rwanda, the political paralysis of Nigeria, the anarchy of Somalia, the near collapse of Zaire, the hemorrhage of Angola -- these and other tragedies of the continent arouse mostly diplomatic tut-tuts from their African neighbors, rarely outrage, or ostracism, or aid, or intervention.
 Of course, inaction in the face of disaster can be explained by the fact that few African nations are in any condition to sort out the mess of their continent. Scarcely coherent states themselves, they have little money to spare and little power to project in the rescue of other failing nations. Nor do they have a mandate to do so.
 "In post-colonial Africa, people have become totally alienated from the state," said Peter Vale, professor of southern Africa Studies at the University of the Western Cape. "States are seen as partnerships of predatory elites. Part of that alienation is to withdraw."
 Even President Nelson Mandela, who presides over the continent's richest state and perhaps its most popular and legitimate one, decided his new Government was too fragile to play a direct role in Rwanda. (South Africa sent medical supplies and offered the loan of some armored police vehicles.)
 But pleas of poverty, however truthful, also can seem a short-sighted rationalization of inaction. It is not as if these horrid dramas are self-contained. The tribal civil wars and insurrections almost always spill across borders. If neighbors had invested some effort in halting the ethnic killing between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda, which has raged off and on for more than three decades, perhaps Zaire and Tanzania would not now be straining under the burden of two million refugees.
 Moreover, Africa had no trouble mustering an angry consensus when the offending nation was South Africa. During the decades of apartheid, African states provided funding and sanctuary for liberation groups, and helped make the apartheid Government a pariah state.
 
Choosing Not to Judge
 The difference was that the offenders were whites, who were brazen enough to elevate their claim of superiority to a civil religion and give it a name. For Africans (as, indeed, for many Americans), it was the last battle in the great crusade against colonial oppression, a satisfyingly clearcut choice.
 "Had it only been Mandela versus the Zulus, how many people would have been interested?" asks Robert Oakley, who was special envoy to Somalia for Presidents Bush and Clinton.
 When it comes to promoting human rights and ethnic equality when the offenders are black, however, few African leaders have much to say, because few have the comforting perspective of the moral high ground.
 "When they look at a Rwanda, it makes them all very nervous," said Mr. Oakley. "Because it's either happening or could happen to them."
 Indeed, said Kole Omotoso, a Nigerian professor of comparative literature and a writer on African politics, African leaders have actively promoted ethnic hatred when it served their interests of controlling their populations or destabilizing neighbors.
 In Rwanda, to take just the latest of many instances, it is fashionable to blame the French for formerly supporting the Hutu government that launched the slaughter of the Tutsi minority. Rarely mentioned is the fact that the Hutus' more intimate ally was neighboring Zaire (and the Tutsis' was Uganda). Zaire still fuels a partly ethnic civil bloodletting in Angola; Nigeria and Ivory Coast have helped carve up Liberia; the list goes on.
 "These governments have all been involved surreptitiously in the brewing of the problem," Mr. Omotoso said. "When tragedy breaks out, they cannot pretend they didn't know the final outcome of what they were doing, and come in posing as humanitarians. They have no moral authority."
 Paul Johnson, in an acid summation of post-colonial African history contained in his book "Modern Times," says that differences between apartheid and the practices of most African states "were more theoretical than real. All African states practiced racist policies." He recites a litany that includes the expulsion of Jews from north Africa, Tanzania's oppression of the Arabs, the widespread and sometimes brutal discrimination against Asians, and many instances of racism against whites, but the predominant form of official racism is manipulating hatreds among tribal groups.
 To Mr. Johnson, the worst example of the solidarity of thugs was the almost unanimous support of African leaders for Idi Amin while he savaged Uganda; even after his butchery was widely known, the Organization of African Unity elected him its president.
 Africa studied its cynicism at the knees of Western experts, Mr. Johnson adds. First the colonial powers established the practice of ethnic social engineering, playing tribe against tribe. Then, he charges, the United Nations, under the leadership of the ambitious idealist Dag Hammarskjold, pandered to Third World delegates by promoting "a characteristic U.N. double standard: that whereas the killing of Africans by whites (as at Sharpeville in South Africa on 21 March 1960) was of international concern and a threat to peace, the killing of Africans by Africans (or of whites by Africans, or of Asians by Africans or all three races by Africans) was a purely internal matter outside the purview of the U.N."
 The United Nations has moved decisively away from that double standard by demanding the world's attention in Somalia and Rwanda. Will African leaders follow?
 Mr. Vale believes that with the loss of its last unifying cause -- the white regime in Pretoria -- the see-no-evil pan-Africanist solidarity of the Organization of African Unity may be abandoned in favor of smaller, stronger, regional blocs that are more likely to police themselves.
 Mr. Omotoso hopes other African states will be shamed by the example of South Africa, which -- to the uneasy amazement of many countries that underwrote the liberation struggle -- has tried to overcome ethnic grievance and unite black and white in a coalition of common economic interest.
 "Many of those governments put resources at the aid of the black liberation movement in South Africa as a way of hiding the problems they had at home," he said. "Now the contradictions are coming out. Now everyone finds himself having to take lessons from South Africa."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Government Health Insurance;
An Idea Whose Time Has Come? It Came in 1965.

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
OF the many strange experiences in the health care struggle of 1994, several lawmakers have found this to be among the strangest: an angry encounter with an elderly constituent, railing against the idea of government involvement in the health care system, declaring categorically, as one woman did to Representative Louise Slaughter, "I don't want government messing in health insurance."
 The elderly are, of course, beneficiaries of a government health insurance program, one of the most popular domestic programs around, signed into law 29 years ago after a long debate on the very question of whether government should be involved in guaranteeing health care to a vast segment of the American people. Sometimes, a frustrated group of Democratic lawmakers say, it as if the debate over Medicare never happened; how else to explain why it is happening all over again?
 
 Many people do not even think of Medicare as a government program, according to the American Association of Retired Persons. Many people clearly do not see the argument over government involvement in health care -- or, for that matter, an array of other social needs, from unemployment to pensions -- as a settled issue, or even one with much of a history. And, judging from the polls, many people seem achingly vulnerable to slogans like "socialized medicine," "billion-dollar bureaucracies" and a "government takeover of the health care system." The past, as William Faulkner put it, is not dead. It isn't even past.
 The debate now raging on Capitol Hill is, to a striking extent, often simply variations on the themes set forth in the Medicare struggle of the 1960's, not to mention President Harry Truman's unsuccessful effort to win national health insurance in 1949 and the debate over Social Security in the 1930's. Shortly before the final passage of Medicare, the American Medical Association was warning in full-page newspaper ads of "long waiting lines at doctors' offices," of "mountains of red tape" and of "delays of weeks and months for needed surgery."
 The association concluded, with all the urgency and solemnity at its command: "Even at this late hour, we cannot -- in good faith to our patients -- stand silent as Congress prepares to start this nation on a dangerous adventure in government medicine, the end of which no one can see, and from which the patient is certain to be the ultimate sufferer."
 That was a trace more formal than the warnings of "Harry and Louise," the current television spokescouple for the Health Insurance Association of America, but the thoughts are much the same. "Long waits for health care and some services not even available," Louise fretted as she pored over a health care proposal in one commercial. Anxious Harry chimed in, "Government-controlled health care."
 Then as now, the role of government was central to the debate on Capitol Hill. In 1965, leading House Republicans also pushed for a "voluntary" approach to the problem, arguing that only those who wanted to participate in Medicare should be required to pay premiums. Democrats pushed for an all-inclusive system financed by a payroll tax. (In today's parlance, a mandate.) Conservatives in both parties warned that the country was poised at the crest of a slippery slope. "Let us not take this first step toward socialized medicine," Representative Joe R. Pool, Democrat of Texas, pleaded on the floor of the House.
 Last week, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, surrounded by several of his Republican colleagues, stood on the lawn of the Capitol and declared that if the advocates of universal health care rallying in Washington that day "want socialized medicine," they could have it. But Mr. Gramm vowed to fight it tooth and nail. "I know the First Lady is passionate about this," Mr. Gramm declared. "I know it's the President's dream to take over and run the health care system. The future of America is at stake in this bill."
 This debate dismays many advocates of health care restructuring, who had hoped by this point to be engaged in a discussion of alternative means to an agreed-upon end, rather than a replay of an ideological gutfight. Bob Blendon, an expert on public opinion and health issues at Harvard, said that the fears and the rhetoric about "socialized medicine" are not nearly as vehement nor as widespread as they were in the past, particularly in the jittery post-war America of 1949.
 But the fears about government have a rich and fertile context of their own in the current debate: Since the passage of Medicare, Mr. Blendon noted, there has been a 30-year trend of diminishing faith in government.
 Conservatives are keenly aware of this. "The liberal-social democratic agenda ultimately won the battle from the end of World War II through the mid-60's, and Medicare was part of that victory," said William Kristol, a conservative theoretician who has closely tracked the health care issue. "I think you could make the case that the liberal-social democratic agenda has been in retreat for the last 15 or 20 years. Clinton is trying to reverse it, and he is running into great skepticism."
 Mr. Kristol sees the health struggle as an opportunity to define the Republican Party "as a party that resists further advances of the welfare state, and ultimately of relimiting government."
 The flip side to this, of course, is the Democrats' struggle to reclaim their image as the party that uses government to deliver popular new benefits to the middle class. Given both parties' strategic imperatives, it was almost inevitable that this would become an ideological debate about government.
 Beneath the partisan positioning, though, some analysts see an enduring contradiction in the American psyche. Lawmakers fight these battles again and again because they can never be resolved.
 "Americans have in their heads a contradiction," said Stan Greenberg, the White House pollster, "disliking government and strongly supporting individualism, at the same time they're very strong supporters of a whole range of things we do together as a people, from Social Security to unemployment compensation."
 Even Mr. Gramm seems to harbor this contradiction. After railing about the evils of government involvement in health care last week, he was asked how he would have voted on Medicare in 1965.
 "I don't have the foggiest idea because I wasn't part of the debate," the former economics professor replied. "I would surely have been concerned about the costs, which turned out to be off by a factor of 10. But not having been there, I don't know."
 And yes, Mr. Gramm's mother is covered by Medicare.

HEADLINE: Questions of Conflict Sting Mutual Funds

SERIES: A Trust Betrayed: First of three articles.

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
For a decade, millions of Americans trying to avoid the pitfalls and predators of the stock market have turned to mutual funds, relying on the funds' professional managers to avoid the mistakes of an amateur investor.
Among those millions are many unsophisticated savers seeking higher returns than they can get from banks or Government bonds, now that interest rates are lower than they were for many years. 
 Those investors have helped turn the mutual fund industry into one of the deepest oceans of cash in the world, totaling more than $2 trillion at the end of June, up 100 percent in just three years. More money is controlled by mutual funds than by life insurance companies or savings and loan institutions.
But even as many less-savvy investors move into mutual funds, the investments that some of those funds make are becoming more exotic and complex.
Looking for a competitive edge in a business that has grown to about 4,900 funds, from 3,100 four years ago, some fund managers are plunging into the riskiest corners of the securities markets. They are buying the stocks and notes of very small companies whose prospects are much more uncertain than those of larger, more established businesses.
And in some cases, the fund managers are making investments that are not only risky, but are clouded by what seem to be conflicts of interest.
Research by The New York Times has found some cases in which fund managers, operating with little oversight by regulators, are investing in companies that employ executives, advisers or underwriters with whom they have close ties. Often, those deals have left the funds holding securities of dubious value.
For example, at least one high-profile fund manager bought stock that enriched one member of his family. When John J. Kaweske, who was one of the country's top-performing managers last year, bought more than 1.6 million shares in a tiny nutrition-supplement company for two Invesco mutual funds, the deal benefited the small firm, partly owned by his son, which arranged the sale.
An Invesco fund controlled by the elder Mr. Kaweske also bought a large stake in a private company whose executives included his sister.
For other fund managers, the potential conflicts involve business dealings with financiers in whose companies their funds have invested.
For example, Paul Stephens of San Francisco, who has become something of a celebrity in the fund industry for his leadership of the fast-growing Robertson Stephens Contrarian Fund, has invested the fund's money in a Vietnam gold concern formed by his company and Robert M. Friedland, a promoter affiliated with other companies whose stocks Mr. Stephens's fund has bought.
The issue of potential conflicts of interest has dominated the mutual fund world recently. Regulators and fund executives have focused on whether personal investments by fund managers have conflicted with their duties to their shareholders.
The Securities and Exchange Commission will soon release the results of a review of the personal investments of managers at a sampling of funds. The review was undertaken after reports last year of fund managers investing privately in deals promoted by a broker from whom they had bought stocks for their funds.
But the situations identified by The New York Times suggest that the potential for conflicts extends beyond what fund managers do with their own money, and into questions of how they spend shareholders' money.
 
A Reputation Threatened
 To be sure, conflicts of interest seem to be rare in the mutual fund industry. But the Investment Company Institute, the mutual fund trade group in Washington, has been quick to recognize the threat to the industry's reputation posed by conflicts.
The institute has urged fund companies to adopt stiff restrictions on personal trading by fund managers. And its leaders are blunt about the standards they expect fund companies to maintain.
"A mutual fund manager stands in a fiduciary relationship to the investors, and has to make all decisions solely in their best interest," said Paul Stevens, the general counsel of the institute. "If an investment is influenced by anything extraneous to that, it could expose the fund manager to substantial liabilities."
"The law is very clear," he added, "and if someone is doing that sort of thing, they're in a position where the S.E.C. could come down on them like a ton of bricks."
Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the S.E.C., was equally direct. "There are obviously opportunities for an abuse of power," he said. "I regard this as being of the utmost gravity. Anything which creates a diminution of public confidence in the safety and soundness of the marketplace must be eliminated."
"I'm not going to get sidetracked by legal interpretations of what constitutes a conflict," he added. "If it appears bad, and smells bad, and looks bad, they better attack it and eliminate it. And if they don't, we will."
The risk that fund managers would get too cozy with those whose stocks they buy has been part of the American fund industry since its inception in the early 1920's. After the market crashed in 1929, investigators found that many publicly traded investment trusts, an early form of mutual funds, had invested unwisely in companies whose underwriters, owners or directors were also involved in managing the trusts.
Thus, the reform-driven Investment Company Act of 1940 bars fund managers from buying stocks publicly underwritten by, or formally affiliated with, their firms.
But today, associations scarcely envisioned by those who framed the mutual fund laws are more common.
That is especially true among funds investing in start-up companies in the United States and loosely regulated markets abroad. As more of these hot-growth niche funds are established, regulators say, their managers are competing more fiercely for investors.
"And the only way you can compete is by getting above-average rates of return," said Wayne Klein, the securities director for the State of Idaho. "And how do you do that? You speculate. You buy penny stocks and hope you will hit some high flier that will give you a return that is higher than your rivals'."
 
Relying on Tips
 But finding high fliers is difficult. Few independent Wall Street analysts monitor the smallest of America's public companies. In markets abroad, reliable information about small companies can be scarce.
As a result, portfolio managers are relying heavily on stock tips provided by professional "stock boosters," aggressive brokers and company insiders -- whose chief goals are to sell stock, collect fees or increase the value of the shares they already own.
On the surface, these relationships seem to be symbiotic, said John Woods, editor of the Stockwatch market news service in Vancouver, British Columbia, who has documented a sharp increase in American mutual fund investments in that highly speculative market.
An investment by a big mutual fund lends credibility to a company, Mr. Woods said. The fund managers, in turn, are getting first crack at "invitation only" deals that allow them to buy a company's stock privately at discounts that can translate into big paper gains for their funds.
But the benefits to the funds can be illusory, because a fund that buys a big stake in a thinly traded security usually cannot sell those shares without driving down the price to levels that wipe out those paper profits.
Two cases identified by The Times illustrate the potential conflicts of interest that can cloud the judgment of fund managers.
 
Bloodlines
Deals Are Tinged By Family Ties
 John J. Kaweske's funds were among the industry's most successful. But in the case of Crown Laboratories, a tiny company in Las Vegas, Nev., the objectivity of this fund manager may have been compromised by his family connections with the company's investment banker.
Crown has been trying to establish itself for more than 12 years, but has not made a profit on its line of powdered dietary supplements. Until last spring, the company had traded only as a low-priced, speculative "penny stock," having registered its shares with the S.E.C. through a back-door process that sidestepped a full-dress review of its finances and business plan by the agency.
 
Enormous Paper Profits
 The company began trading on the small-company list at the American Stock Exchange for $5 a share last March 30. That price translated into enormous paper profits for anyone who had received stock in Crown for free -- a group that included Mr. Kaweske's son, John D. Kaweske, whose New York advisory company, First Atlantic Securities, got 200,000 shares as payment for helping Crown sell stock privately last August.
The largest buyer in that private sale was the elder Mr. Kaweske, who bought more than 1.6 million shares, at about $1.50 a share, for two Invesco mutual funds that he managed until last January.
However beneficial the deal has been for the younger Mr. Kaweske's fledgling company, it has not turned out well for the Invesco funds. Shares of Crown have plunged steadily, closing on Friday at $1.875, unchanged.
While that price is still above what the Invesco funds paid for the stock, Barry Kurokawa, the current manager of the funds, said it would fall even further if Invesco tried to sell even a few thousand of its shares.
Invesco said it had dismissed Mr. Kaweske in January because he failed to notify the company promptly about certain personal investments that were otherwise proper.
Until his dismissal, Mr. Kaweske ran the $1 billion Invesco Strategic Health Sciences Fund, and a cousin fund, the Global Health Sciences Fund, whose shares trade like stock on the New York Stock Exchange.
The senior Mr. Kaweske refused to comment for this article. His lawyer, Andrew Levander, said the funds' decision to invest in Crown had nothing to do with the younger Mr. Kaweske's links to the company, and Invesco had negotiated only with the son's partner, John Antretter, for the private stock purchase.
A spokesman for Invesco said the fund company had not known Mr. Kaweske's son worked for the firm arranging the transaction, and would not have allowed the purchase if it had known.
The younger Mr. Kaweske, who has left First Atlantic, said he had no involvement in the Crown stock sale to his father's funds, and the shares he received were in compensation for other services to the company.
 
Other Links Found
 Crown is not the only stock in Mr. Kaweske's portfolios that had links to his family. Since February 1992, the Invesco Strategic Health Sciences Fund has bought $1.6 million of convertible notes and $503,000 of stock issued by Medical Associates of America in Fort Lee, N.J., a developer of physician-owned pharmacies, whose executives included Mr. Kaweske's sister, Joan Goldstone.
Mr. Levander said others at Invesco were involved with Mr. Kaweske in assessing the company, and the purchase had nothing to do with his sister's employment there.
With no public market for the shares, it is difficult to know the value of the fund's 17 percent stake. In a recent amendment of its proposed S.E.C. prospectus, Medical Associates sharply revised its original financial statements to show a bleaker picture than it had portrayed late last year.
The Invesco spokesman said Invesco had not known that a relative of Mr. Kaweske's worked at Medical Associates until the fund company was asked about it for this article.
Fund industry executives say they are as much concerned about the appearance of conflicts as about the details of a specific deal.
"There is nothing more clear than that things like investing in a company that has hired your son, or any similar situation like that, are to be strictly avoided," said Mr. Stevens of the Investment Company Institute.
 
Friendships
A Stock Promoter Becomes a Mentor
 One of the hottest fund managers in the country this year is Paul Stephens of San Francisco, whose Robertson Stephens Contrarian Fund opened in February with $5 million, and had grown more than a hundredfold, to $630 million by last week.
His fund company was recently noted as a comer by Newsweek magazine, and, until recently, he had turned in superlative returns, in part by moving the new fund's money into gold-mining stocks.
One of the most controversial figures in Vancouver is Robert Friedland, a 43-year-old stock promoter, whose largest gold-mining project ended in an environmental disaster, and whose current business associates include a Texan who was convicted in a Federal currency-smuggling case in 1986.
Yet during the last two years, Mr. Stephens and Mr. Friedland have forged a remarkable bond. Mr. Stephens, who is 49, has bought more than $30 million of stock in companies associated with Mr. Friedland for the Contrarian Fund. That has provided market liquidity and supported the price of stocks that comprise part of Mr. Friedland's fortune, including Venezuelan Goldfields and Diamond Fields Resources.
In some foreign markets, including Vancouver, "stock promoter" is considered to be a formal occupation -- someone who controls a large, cheaply acquired stake in a company, either directly or through allies, and who directs the company's affairs to increase its stock price.
In its most professional form, stock promotion is simply an ad hoc form of venture capitalism. But in its least savory form, stock promotion can involve exaggerated or false claims about the prospects of a company, outright manipulation of the stock, and a blizzard of supposedly beneficial but quite meaningless mergers or acquisitions -- all meant to drive up stock prices so the promoters and their allied insiders can sell their shares at an enormous profit.
 
'An Excellent Investor'
 Mr. Stephens said he avoided the deals of some Vancouver promoters, but admired Mr. Friedland's skills. "Robert Friedland has been a mentor of mine," Mr. Stephens said. "He is an excellent investor, and one of the few visionaries in the global mining business."
But there is another side to Mr. Friedland's career that might unnerve some mutual fund managers. The Environmental Protection Agency is investigating whether he may be liable for environmental damage at a bankrupt gold mine in Summitville, Colo., that was developed by Galactic Resources Ltd., which he promoted and for many years controlled before it collapsed in late 1992.
The agency has estimated the cost of cleaning up Summitville to be as much as $100 million. If Mr. Friedland must contribute to the cleanup, he could be forced to sell some of his stock in various companies, depressing the prices.
Mr. Friedland said: "I deeply regret the present situation at Summitville. I was never aware of any improper activity by any employee which would compromise the environment."
He added that, because "litigation appears probable," he could not comment further, except to say that his role at the mining company was mainly financial and he had relied on the engineers and management to monitor the environmental impact.
Mr. Stephens said he did not hold Mr. Friedland responsible for the Summitville problem. "He is simply the deep pocket they're trying to dig into," Mr. Stephens said. "And he never sold a share of that stock, so he suffered along with everyone else."
"He's just gotten terrible press," he added. "But as long as I know someone isn't a crook, I don't worry about the reputation or the controversy."
But some of the people involved in Diamond Fields Resources, Mr. Friedland's latest promotional project and a stock held by the Contrarian Fund, have records stained by more than bad publicity.
 
A Smuggler's Stake
 A large shareholder is Jim Bob Hodge, a Texas diamond dealer who pleaded guilty in August 1986 to concealing a felony -- specifically, a currency-smuggling scheme.
Federal investigators had secretly recorded Mr. Hodge and a co-defendant explaining to an undercover agent how they could smuggle millions in cash to Panama.
(A tax agent's affidavit shows that, in one taped discussion, Mr. Hodge said he had used a trash compactor to compress the money, boasting that the method once allowed him to "get a million dollars in a briefcase.")
After pleading guilty in a plea bargain, Mr. Hodge was sentenced to two years in prison for his role.
Of course, if Mr. Hodge had bought his stake in Diamond Fields in the public market, Mr. Friedland and Mr. Stephens would not necessarily have been aware of his interest in the company. But Mr. Hodge acquired his stake with the company's knowledge and permission, through a deal detailed in company records.
In essence, the deal allowed Mr. Hodge to step in at the last minute and profit from Diamond Fields's purchase of a Namibian coastal diamond concession that analysts say is the jewel of the company's assets.
 
Background 'Disclosed'
 Mr. Hodge got 336,666 shares of Diamond Fields stock, which traded as high as $10 a share within a month of the deal, in exchange for a 40 percent stake in the coastal diamond business that he had just bought from the group that was selling the other 60 percent to Diamond Fields.
Mr. Hodge said his background "was fully disclosed" to Canadian regulators, who reviewed the deal. "Besides," he said, "that has absolutely nothing to do with the deal."
Mr. Stephens said he had never heard of Mr. Hodge, and was not familiar with the role he played in Diamond Fields.
Mr. Friedland said of Mr. Hodge: "All things considered, I'd prefer that he would not have that background. But the real question is whether the title is good and the exploration potential is sufficient. I don't see that his background has any relevance."
 
Partnerships
Fund Buys Interest In Manager's Deal
 Despite these and other controversies that surround Mr. Friedland's business operations, Mr. Stephens said his esteem for his mentor was so high that he had joined with Mr. Friedland in forming Indochina Goldfields, which has gold-mining interests in Vietnam. He said the company's other founders included Ed Flood, a geologist who works for Mr. Stephens and once worked as a consultant to Mr. Friedland's private investment firm, Ivanhoe Capital.
The latest portfolio for the Contrarian Fund includes 350,000 shares of Indochina Goldfields, valued at $1 a share. Mr. Stephens said Mr. Friedland was "the venture capital founder" of Indochina Goldfields, along with Mr. Flood.
"We were one of the co-founders in the private placement; we helped put the company together," Mr. Stephens said. "We were one of the catalysts for forming it."
The fine print of the Contrarian Fund prospectus notes that all the funds managed by Robertson Stephens "may co-invest" in companies in which partners, officers or employees of Robertson Stephens have invested, or for which they serve as directors or officers.
"We're allowed to make some private investments," Mr. Stephens said. "We have told our investors about it, in our shareholder letter."
But that letter did not disclose the role Mr. Stephens played in the formation of the company, only that the fund had invested in the company.
 
'A Stamp of Credibility'
 When Mr. Stephens first volunteered the details of his dealings with Mr. Friedland in an interview in May, he said he had "stuck my neck out on gold, and on Robert Friedland."
"Maybe I'm going to end up being embarrassed," he added. "But I will be a stamp of credibility for him. I am risking my personal reputation and my firm's reputation. I don't think I am going to get burned."
Since the end of June, the prices of the four publicly traded companies in the Contrarian Fund that are associated with Mr. Friedland have fallen 31 to 68 percent. There is no publicly traded price for Indochina Goldfields, which Mr. Stephens said was valued at his investment cost, or $350,000. The fund's per-share value has fallen 5 percent during the same period.
Mr. Stephens's dealings with Mr. Friedland have prompted questions from at least one former regulator.
"There is nothing wrong with a fund manager having a high regard for someone's expertise," said Marianne Smythe, a mutual fund lawyer who is a former top mutual fund regulator for the S.E.C. "But questions arise if that high regard starts to look like an actual business relationship."
"With mutual fund law, you have to listen to the music, not just the words," she added. "To the extent that a fund manager is doing anything that is not for the sole benefit of the investors in that fund, there may be a conflict. And disclosure cannot make a conflict go away."
TODAY: Fund managers are buying high-risk stocks of companies employing executives, advisers or underwriters with whom the managers have close ties.
 
TOMORROW: Many fund managers are investing in companies whose executives or advisers have repeatedly run afoul of stock-market rules.
 
TUESDAY: Securities regulators and investors are frustrated when they try to monitor the mutual fund industry.

HEADLINE: COST IS OBSCURED IN HEALTH DEBATE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton's health plan was inspired as much by a desire to control costs as by a passion to guarantee insurance for every American. But the goal of cost control has been eclipsed by the furor over universal coverage.
Consumer groups, business executives and labor leaders who joined the campaign for health care legislation in hopes of controlling costs are profoundly disappointed. This spreading sense of unease could have deep political consequences as Mr. Clinton nears the midpoint of a term in which health care has preoccupied him more than any other policy issue. 
 And there may be long-range implications for the economy if the debate over universal coverage continues to overshadow the issue of costs.
The nation will spend about $1 trillion on health care this year -- 14 percent of the gross domestic product, a proportion far higher than that of any other nation. And the Congressional Budget Office says the share will grow to 20 percent in the year 2003 under current law.
But the question of how to slow the growth of such spending has receded from the political debate. Politicians and political advertising have instead focused on the explosive question of whether to require employers to buy health insurance for their employees.
The health care and insurance industries have lobbied intensively against price controls and have given millions of dollars in campaign contributions to make sure their views will be heard by members of Congress. The lobbyists, pointing out that market forces have already reduced the rate of medical inflation, tell lawmakers that the Government should not intervene.
Advocates of cost controls worry that in the search for votes in Congress the restraints may be weakened further and benefits added -- raising the prospect of a system more costly than the current one.
Michael J. Rourke, senior vice president of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, which operates A.& P. supermarkets, said: "The real crisis in health care, from our point of view, was the cost. That was our primary motivation for getting involved in the health care reform movement."
 
Kerrey Sees More Trouble
 Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, said this week that the health care bills offered by the Democratic leaders of the Senate and the House would probably "add to the problem" of the Federal budget deficit and that he doubted that they would restrain health spending. "The whole battle cry of universal coverage is a cry to be relieved of the responsibility of paying the bills," he said.
Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, said: "Almost all the discussion has been about universal coverage, but the real issue, I think, the most important issue for the future of the country, is cost containment."
Republicans generally oppose price controls and favor the use of market forces to restrain health costs. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, boasts that his proposal to expand coverage contains "no mandates or price controls." He and other Republicans would finance their proposals through cutbacks in Medicare and Medicaid.
The House Democratic leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said the bill he introduced recently would control costs by imposing Federal fee limits on doctors and hospitals if market forces did not slow the growth of health spending to the rate of growth of the overall economy.
By contrast, the bill offered by the Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, contains no controls on health prices, costs or spending. It seeks to slow the growth of spending by imposing a new tax on health plans whose costs grow faster than a prescribed pace and by encouraging competition.
Experts on health policy, including economists, labor union leaders and executives, said cost control had faded from the debate for these reasons:
*Doctors, hospitals, drug companies and others in the health care industry have organized formidable campaigns against any measures that would significantly reduce their revenues. Drug companies, for example, say they would have to curtail research on cures for cancer or AIDS, and hospitals say they would have to lay off employees or shut down.
*The torrid pace of medical inflation has cooled. Companies in the health care industry, eager to fend off price controls, have been trying hard to curb costs. In the past, health prices moderated when the Government threatened action but shot back up when the threat disappeared. This time may be different. Fierce competition is transforming the industry as companies cut costs, gobble up one another and reorganize the delivery of medical care.
*Consumers' desire to have the widest choice of doctors, and the doctors' desire that patients have this choice, often run counter to the idea of cost control. Businesses and health maintenance organizations often control costs by limiting patients to a list of approved doctors and hospitals, which offer deep discounts in return for a large volume of patients. Mr. Gephardt's bill would restrict such forms of managed care.
President Clinton planted the seeds for such legislation when, in deference to public opinion polls, he enshrined "choice" as one of his six guiding principles.
 
'A Laudable Goal'
 James A. Klein, the executive director of the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans, a trade group composed mainly of Fortune 500 companies, said: "The idea of choice, a laudable goal laid out by the President, has been twisted. Any measure that structures choice in a way to contain costs is considered bad."
Michael Podhorzer, health policy director at Citizen Action, a consumer group with three million members, said the Administration and Congressional leaders were not emphasizing cost control now as much as they once did.
"They realized early on that they would not be able to beat the insurance industry and health care providers," Mr. Podhorzer said. "The health and insurance industries have contributed more than $26 million to members of Congress in the last 18 months to make sure that cost controls are not part of this legislation."
Opinion polls show that the public wants to rein in health costs, but effective measures to control costs are often unpopular. Congress rejected President Clinton's proposal to put annual limits on the growth of health insurance premiums after health insurers, doctors and hospitals attacked the proposal.
 
Other Problems Possible
 On the other hand, if Congress expands coverage without putting limits on costs, huge problems may result. The cost of Federal subsidies, to help poor people and small businesses buy health insurance, may soar. And if subsidies do not keep pace with premiums, many people will be unable to afford insurance, and some businesses will decide not to offer coverage.
In addition, health policy experts say, Congress is likely to finance health care legislation by cutting projected spending for Medicare and Medicaid. If private health costs are not also controlled, then the disparity between private insurance and Federal payments will grow, and doctors may be less willing to take elderly patients under Medicare.
Administration officials have repeatedly argued that "you can't do cost containment without universal coverage," in the words of Alice M. Rivlin, acting director of the Office of Management and Budget. When people are uninsured, she said, they do not get routine preventive care and end up in hospital emergency rooms.
But Senator Kerrey gently mocked the idea that the nation could save money in the long run by spending more on health care today. "All we have to do is spend more in order to spend less," he said. "That's essentially the conclusion that people have reached."
 
What Gephardt Proposes
 Under the Gephardt bill, the Government would, for the first time, set annual health spending goals for the nation as a whole and for each state. If a state exceeded its goal, the Federal Government would enforce price controls for doctors, hospitals, prescription drugs and the rest of the health care industry in that state, starting in the year 2001.
The Government would set "maximum payment rates" so that per capita private health spending would grow no faster than the economy as a whole.
Under the Mitchell bill, the Government would use tax policy to discourage insurance companies from raising premiums. The new tax would be 25 percent of the amount by which premiums exceeded a target amount set each year by the Internal Revenue Service for each market area. The targets would allow insurance premiums to rise slightly faster than the Consumer Price Index.


GRAPHIC: The plan proposed last year by President Clinton and the bills introduced recently by the Democratic leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives all include measures aimed at slowing the skyrocketing rise of health care spending. But those provisions differ sharply in their rigor and extent of Government involvement.
 
Clinton Plan:
 
* A national health board would establish national and regional spending limits and curb increases in insurance premiums.
 
* The creation of regional insurance-purchasing alliances is intended to control costs.
 
* Rate of growth in Medicare and Medicaid spending would be reduced.
 
* As long as they remained within the national budget, states would be given the flexibility to pursue their own strategies to limit costs.
 
House Leadership Plan:
 
* If greater competition in the health care market failed to control costs in five years, a system of cost containment would go into effect, with the Government imposing fee schedules for doctors and hospitals in states where health spending exceeded Federal targets.
 
* Costs of the new Medicare Part C program would be controlled by limiting the amounts hospitals, doctors and other providers could be reimbursed for services. These limits would be similar to those that apply to Medicare Part A and B, the Federal government's health insurance programs for the elderly people and those with disabilities.
 
Senator Mitchell's Proposal:
 
* A 25 percent tax would be imposed on those health insurance plans whose costs grow faster than a prescribed pace.
 
* A Federal commission would monitor health insurance costs and recommend ways to control costs. (pg. 24)

HEADLINE: BELGRADE APPEARS TO BE CUTTING OFF THE BOSNIA SERBS

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SREMSKA RACA, Yugoslavia, Aug. 6

 BODY:
Scores of heavily laden trucks were backed up at border posts between Yugoslavia and Bosnia today, suggesting that the embargo Serbian leaders in Belgrade said they were imposing on their Bosnian Serb brethren this week was being strictly enforced.
When the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, announced a similar embargo last year, border guards allowed many trucks through, and foreign leaders quickly concluded that Mr. Milosevic was not serious about his pledge to cut off supplies to the Bosnian Serbs. 
 But today, no cargo was crossing here. Angry drivers complained that even trucks carrying food to Serb-controlled regions of Bosnia were being stopped at the border.
"This time it looks really serious," said a Red Cross official who arrived at the Sremska Raca crossing at midday.
Mr. Milosevic announced the new embargo on Thursday after Bosnian Serb leaders rejected a peace plan devised by the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia. Under the plan, Bosnian Serb forces would be required to withdraw from some regions they now hold and return them to the Muslim-led Bosnian Government.
In announcing the embargo, Mr. Milosevic accused Bosnian Serb leaders of "insane political ambitions and greed." The move was an abrupt turnaround, because his Government has been the Bosnian Serbs' principal source of weapons, supplies and political support.
Western leaders have suggested that if Mr. Milosevic truly cuts his ties to the Bosnian Serbs, they will move to ease the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations that have isolated Yugoslavia, which now comprises Serbia and Montenegro, and crippled its economy. They say that if he does not do so, they will seek to tighten the sanctions.
The announcement of the embargo has been widely welcomed as a possible turning point in the Bosnian war, which began in April 1992. Senior officials in Washington and other capitals have said they will watch closely to see if the embargo is enforced.
Because the border between Yugoslavia and Bosnia is long and because parts of it have been off-limits to outsiders, it cannot be said for certain that no cargo is moving across. But at important crossing points today there was evidence that the Yugoslav police were turning back shipments of fuel, cement, lumber and other goods.
At the Sremska Raca border crossing, through which untold amounts of supplies for the Bosnian Serbs have been transported in the last two years, nearly 50 trucks, many of them carrying double-trailer loads, stood idle today. Drivers sat in their cabs or sought refuge in shady spots as the temperature soared past 100 degrees.
Asked what they now thought of Mr. Milosevic, two drivers, both of them Bosnian Serbs, replied in unison, "Nothing good!"
"What Slobo is doing is not right," said one of the drivers, using the President's nickname. "He's like a parent who gives his children chocolate and then takes it away."
The driver, who declined to give his name, said he was from the Bosnian town of Sanski Most, which is now controlled by Bosnian Serb forces but which would be turned over to Muslim control if the proposed peace plan were accepted. He said the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, was right to have rejected the plan.
"There's no way we can accept this plan," he said. "We have lost fathers and brothers fighting for this land. How can we allow it to be taken from us?"
Sixty miles up the Drina River, at the Zvornik border crossing, a dozen trucks were parked on the Yugoslav side. Border guards were allowing pedestrians and private autos to cross bridges into Bosnia, sometimes after inspecting what they were carrying, but they turned back all heavy vehicles.
"We are very disappointed with Milosevic," said a young Bosnian Serb who walked across a bridge from the Yugoslav town of Mali Zvornik to the Bosnian town of Zvornik. "We feel that he has betrayed us. He has even cut off our telephone lines to Belgrade. It's as if he is punishing us for winning the war. The controls have never been this tight before."
A few miles from Mali Zvornik, drivers whiled away the hours drinking coffee and playing cards at a cafe.
"I'm confused," said one driver, Chedo Djukic, whose oil tanker truck stood nearby. "I don't understand what happened. If our people in Bosnia are really cut off from the motherland, only God knows if we can survive."
The proprietor of the cafe, Milan Savic, said that on Friday he saw more than 100 trucks arrive at the border and then, after learning of the embargo, turn back toward Belgrade.
"It's as if someone took a pair of scissors and cut Serbia apart from Bosnia," Mr. Savic said. "Naturally people feel angry at Milosevic."
"If this keeps up, the Serbs in Bosnia are going to be in a very difficult situation," he said. "How are they going to get food or fuel? The problem is that so many people have died in the war, and nobody can imagine simply walking away from the towns those people died to capture."
"In Serbia, lots of people are desperate to have the sanctions lifted and to end the war as soon as possible," Mr. Savic continued. "That is why Milosevic is doing this. But in Bosnia, many people want to keep fighting, or at least not to give up what they have won. That is the core of this problem and this conflict."

HEADLINE: As Police Force Adds to Ranks, Some Promises Still Unfulfilled

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS 

 BODY:
Four summers ago, the Dinkins administration began a huge expansion of New York City's police forces and promoted its goal with a reassuring slogan: "The beat cop is back."
With an infusion of funds for a program that promised "Safe Streets, Safe City," the Police Department has expanded its force by nearly a quarter, to more than 31,000 officers. But while the hiring goals have largely been fulfilled, and some measurable gains in enforcement can be cited, the department appears to have diverged from the community-policing strategy that elected officials and even the police promised. 
 Officers are not being stationed on every subway train every night, as officials had pledged. Some beat officers are being dispersed over larger areas than they originally patrolled. Not as many additional officers have been assigned to some precincts as expected. And many who were hired are not being used on specific beats.
 
A Council Critic's View
 "The hiring of officers has, in fact, taken place," said Sheldon S. Leffler, chairman of the City Council's Public Safety Committee, largely echoing the assessment of the State Comptroller, H. Carl McCall. But Mr. Leffler added, "In terms of getting more police on the street as a result of civilianization, they have not delivered."
Indeed, juggling budget priorities in a recession, the Dinkins and Giuliani administrations failed to meet original goals for civilian hiring that would have freed more uniformed officers for enforcement. But if some goals are not being met, it is in part because new strategies have been forged.
Under new leadership at City Hall and at police headquarters, officers have been assigned to deal with shifting priorities, including domestic violence, drug sales, gun violence, begging and other street offenses, car thefts and crimes by and against youngsters.
It is a more flexible strategy than rigidly assigning officers to specific beats, and proponents say it may have a quicker impact on crime and the fear it engenders.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his Police Commissioner, William J. Bratton, have been pursuing their own version of community policing, re-engineering the force they inherited, in Mr. Bratton's words.
Precinct commanders are to have more latitude in using their troops, including beat officers, strategically -- if in ways that may not conform to the picture of community policing that officials painted four years ago when their stated, if somewhat vague, goal was "the deployment of officers to neighborhood patrol."
 
The Numbers
How Many Troops For How Much?
 As conceived by Mayor David N. Dinkins and the City Council from Police Department recommendations, the Safe Streets program coupled money for crime prevention and for other aspects of the criminal justice system with funds to expand the city's combined police forces -- transit police and housing police, as well as the larger New York Police Department -- to record strength.
The 1991 agreement set a target of 31,351 officers for city police, nearly 25 percent more than were then on the force.
That target was reached in February; since then, because of attrition, the ranks have thinned somewhat, but it is expected to be attained again this fall as another police academy class joins the force. At the same time, the combined uniformed strength of three police forces reached a record 38,498 in February -- about one officer for every 200 New Yorkers -- compared with 31,063 officers in August 1990.
Patrol strength, the annual daily average of officers and detectives assigned to the Patrol Services Bureau, grew from 6,259 in August 1990 to more than 7,700, a 23 percent increase, but still about 5 percent below the city Police Department's goal.
By the fall, average daily patrol strength is expected to reach 8,450, a 35 percent increase over that in 1990.
"They're going to be out there in a very obvious way," said Michael J. Farrell, the deputy commissioner for policy and planning.
Enforcement strength, a broader category that includes sergeants, detectives and drug-enforcement officers, has grown 22 percent, from 8,839 to 10,800, and is expected to reach 12,000 during the fiscal year that began on July 1.
What ultimately counts is the effect on crime. Beyond that, civic groups, public officials and some people associated with the department say the success of community policing will depend on the training and temperament of individual officers and on the sometimes conflicting priorities of precinct commanders and department brass.
Those mandates, often a consequence of public demands for somebody to do something, have stretched precinct ranks thin and, in some cases, reduced the number of beat officers available.
 
The Results
 Response Is Faster; Is It Fast Enough?

As Police Commissioner from the beginning of the Dinkins administration in 1990 until his resignation in August 1992, Lee P. Brown presided over the introduction of the Safe Streets plan. He suggested that community policing demanded new standards to gauge the effectiveness of problem solving, quality of service and beat coverage -- which was only one component of the Safe Streets strategy, but the most visible one.
"My vision for New York City," he said later, "was to have an officer or group of officers assigned to every block, or group of blocks, permanently -- to be there, know people, to know the problems."
Using Mr. Brown's standards for beat coverage, this is how the program has fared, according to the Police Department's latest accounting:
*In 1990, 786 community-policing unit officers were assigned to cover about 700 beats, which meant that, on average, beats were covered on one shift five days a week. Now, with 2,282 community-policing officers (plus 321 supervisors) and 1,267 beats, every beat is covered for at least one shift five days a week; some are covered for two shifts or for seven days.
*In 1990, 3.2 minutes elapsed between the time a call about a crime in progress was received and the time a patrol car was dispatched. Now, the average dispatch time is 2.7 minutes -- still more than Mr. Brown's goal of 1.5 minutes. The average response time -- the time it takes to reach the scene of a crime, once a radio car is dispatched -- improved slightly, dropping to 5.5 minutes last year, the police say, from 5.8 minutes in 1990.
*During the first five months of 1990, the police issued 16,384 desk-appearance tickets, the equivalent of a summons to appear in court, which was how 27 percent of misdemeanor arrests were handled. This year, during the same period, 34,604 desk-appearance tickets were issued, which represented about half the misdemeanor arrests.
*The average time between arrest and arraignment -- time that an officer usually spends waiting, on paperwork and on court appearances rather than on patrol -- shrank from nearly 38 hours during the first five months of 1990 to just under 26 hours this year.
In what may have been a financial imperative but a political miscalculation by a Mayor planning to seek re-election, 71 percent of the expanded police hiring was delayed until the Safe Streets program's third full fiscal year, which ended June 30 -- a year in which Mr. Dinkins was defeated.
 
Appearance and Reality
 And, for some reasons that the department hopes to address and others beyond its control, as few as one in nine members of the force may be performing enforcement duties at any given time.
"It narrows down to a number that looks fairly paltry," Deputy Commissioner Farrell said.
Measures like patrol strength may not reflect the efficacy of the department's latest strategies. Abraham M. Lackman, the city's Budget Director, said last month, "A number of these vital initiatives will not increase either patrol or enforcement strength, demonstrating the limitation of these definitions as measures of police activity to address crime."
And hundreds of officers are filling jobs that could be performed by civilians.
Another mayoral study found that only about 500 more civilians work for the Police Department today than before the Safe Streets program began, or about 1,500 fewer than the department asked for in order to fully deploy the additional Safe Streets program officers to crime-fighting.
The city's Office of Management and Budget found that with 36 more civilians to be hired this year, technically the department will have reached the goal of hiring 1,220 "civilianization positions," although attrition and other variables have reduced the number who have actually relieved police officers for enforcement.
Under an agreement reached with Congress last month, the city would be eligible to use Federal funds allocated for police hiring to hire more civilians and acquire the technology to free officers already on the force for patrol.
 
The Future
 Bratton Creating His Own Imprint

An appendix to the Safe Streets plan, signed by top city and state officials, included a precinct-by-precinct projection of how the expanded force would be assigned, and it specified that the commissioner "shall endeavor to insure" that the officers are deployed in a way consistent with that projection. But the mayoral committee concluded earlier this year that the law itself "does not contain any such express requirement."
Nor does the law specifically require that officers be used on neighborhood patrol, the mayoral committee said. But the committee challenged the Mayor and the Police Commissioner to manage the department "in a way that will make police officers a visible presence on the streets and so make real the spirit of this law."
Seeking to place his own imprint on the department, Commissioner Bratton has granted more leeway to precinct commanders, and is likely to create more part-time mini-beats near schools, commercial blocks and other crime-prone locations.
"Commissioner Bratton's concern is that the expectations about an individual beat officer to solve persistent community problems -- that part of it may have been overly ambitious," Mr. Farrell acknowledged.
 
Above All, Results
 Michael Julian, the department's chief of personnel, agreed that Mr. Bratton is "committed to the ideal of community policing." But describing the Bratton philosophy, Mr. Julian said: "'When we're riding in a sector car servicing calls, it's community policing. And the reality is, moving a police car to respond to a call for service is still the No. 1 priority. The real focus is not on numbers, but on results."
Raymond W. Kelly, who succeeded Mr. Brown as Commissioner but was not retained by Mr. Giuliani in January, implies that the results would have been even better if the department adopted the community-policing model formulated under Mr. Brown and which he continued and refined.
"If you look at our strategy for precincts, some had as many as 70 beat officers," he said. "The strategy was to have community beat officers who we envisioned as generalists responsible for every street in the city and a means for people to communicate with that officer. That's been backed away from."
Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, said the overarching goal of community policing is less about precisely how many officers are performing which role as about stabilizing neighborhoods and restoring order.
"How close are we?" he said. "We weren't cheated on the numbers.
"Do we have community policing? We have the beginnings."

HEADLINE: Colombia's New Leader Vows To Crack Down on Cali Cartel

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Aug. 6

 BODY:
With Washington worried about Colombia's commitment to keep battling the export of cocaine, President-elect Ernesto Samper vowed today to "pressure the cartel leaders until they surrender or are captured."
"The way Gaviria fought against drug terrorism, my goal is to fight against drug corruption," Mr. Samper said in an interview a day before his inauguration for a four-year term. Mr. Samper was referring to Cesar Gaviria Trujillo, the departing President, who worked closely with the United States to destroy the Medellin cartel. 
 "The Cali cartel is surrounded by enormous corruption, so the fight is not only to search and capture them but to dismantle all the corruption of police and judges around the Cali cartel," Mr. Samper, a 44-year-old economist, said, referring to a loose group that is believed to control the bulk of the world cocaine trade.
 
Drug Penalties
 As President, he said, he will introduce legislation to make drug laundering a crime, and to raise prison penalties for cartel chiefs who surrender through plea bargaining. He would also renew evidence sharing and intelligence gathering with the United States.
Mr. Samper's aggressive stand contrasts with statements he made shortly after winning the June 19 election here. Talking to foreign reporters, Mr. Samper said that he had no specific plans to pursue the Cali cartel and he placed much of the blame for drug trafficking on consumer countries unwilling to repress demand. About 80 percent of the world's cocaine passes through Colombia.
But since then, relations between United States and Colombia, the largest Andean ally in the drug war, passed through what Mr. Samper called today their "black month." A low point occurred when Andres Pastrana, the losing presidential candidate, made public tapes in which leaders of the Cali cartel were heard offering millions of dollars, through an intermediary, to Mr. Samper's campaign chest. The President-elect has maintained that his campaign never knowingly received contributions from drug traffickers. A preliminary Colombian investigation concluded that the tapes had been edited.
"What they took out of the tapes is that we did not accept any money," said Mr. Samper, who often reminds interviewers that he still carries four bullets in his body from a 1989 attack on his life by a cartel assassin.
 
'No One' Knows the Answer
 But the innuendo surrounding the tapes came after weeks of deteriorating relations.
"No one will ever know the answer to the big question," Morris D. Busby, who retired as United States Ambassador here one month ago, said on Friday about the campaign contribution allegations. "The most important and most frightening thing about those tapes is that narcotic traffickers felt that they could do it."
In March, the Clinton Administration stopped sharing judicial evidence with Colombia on the ground that the Prosecutor General, an advocate of drug decriminalization, would use it to allow drug kingpins to plea bargain light sentences.
In May, the United States abruptly stopped sharing information with Colombia about drug over-flights on the ground that Colombia's air force might use the intelligence to shoot down the planes. Also in May, Colombia's constitutional court depenalized the possession of "personal doses" of cocaine and marijuana.
 
Disasters in Relationships
 The bad feelings worsened when the director of Colombia's National Police, Gen. Octavio Vargas Silva, traveled to Washington on July 10 for a series of meetings with top American law enforcement officials, including Thomas Constantine, director of the Drug Enforcement Administration. In what was seen here as a deliberate slap at Colombia, Americans abruptly canceled all the meetings after General Vargas had arrived in Washington.
"We have been through a period where the relationship has been very close throughout the Gaviria Administration," said Mr. Busby, the former Ambassador here. "Now, on both sides, you have whole new teams. What we are going through is a mating dance."

HEADLINE: United Way Contributions Rise Slightly

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH 

 BODY:
Donations to the United Way last year were up only one-half of 1 percent, to a total of $3 billion, United Way officials said last week, which is not enough to offset the 3 percent rise in inflation.
Elaine L. Chao, president of the United Way of America, said the continued economic weakness in many parts of the country and layoffs at major companies had held down donations. Ninety percent of the gifts are raised through United Way campaigns in factories and offices, mainly from employee contributions made through payroll deductions. 
 United Way officials said there was little, if any, effect on donations from the scandal two years ago in which the association's president, William Aramony, was forced out after disclosures about his hefty expense accounts and financial dealings that created a series of profit-making spinoff organizations.
Ms. Chao said United Ways in the Southeast reported the greatest increase in revenue, while south-central and Midwestern states experienced more modest growth. Campaigns in the West and Northeast trailed those in other regions, she said, reflecting the weaker economic conditions in those areas.
 
New York Numbers
 The United Way of New York City increased revenue to $95.3 million last year, from $91.4 million in 1992. The 4 percent rise was achieved in part by attracting state and city government money and foundation gifts to help pay for specific activities like programs against drugs and projects to reduce school dropout rates.
The United Way of New York City persuaded additional companies to run fund drives, many of them in the banking and retail trades, said George Friedman, a Manhattan businessman and board chairman of the United Way of New York City.
The United Way of Tri-State, which solicits donations at 152 major companies in New York State, New Jersey and Connecticut, reported results similar to those of most of the country's 2,100 United Ways: collections were up about two-tenths of 1 percent. The membership in the three states raised $108.4 million, despite the loss of an estimated 25,000 jobs by participating companies.
"These results were possible because the people remaining on the job were more generous than ever," said Betty Beene, president of the United Way of Tri-State. For example, she said, at I.B.M. sites in the area covered by her group, which have experienced major cuts in the work force, per capita giving jumped 10 percent in 1993.

HEADLINE: Top Woe: Health or Crime

BYLINE: By MIKE KAGAY 

 BODY:
Health care and crime are clearly the priorities on the American public's agenda. But which ranks first, and which second, depends on how the question is asked, according to the latest poll by Louis Harris & Associates.
When asked to name the "most serious problems facing the country," 46 percent said crime, while 23 percent said health care. Other problems like drugs, jobs and the economy followed. 
 But when asked to name "the most important issues for the Government to address," the order reversed, with 55 percent citing health care and 24 percent nominating crime. Jobs and the economy were the next issues mentioned.
Thus, the public apparently sees health care as more tractable than crime, more amenable to Government action.
The telephone poll of 1,255 adults nationwide was taken Aug. 2 through 4 for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a nonprofit group that concentrates on health care issues. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
The poll also found that an increasing number of people said they thought health care should be the Government's biggest priority; 42 percent said so in May, while 55 percent do in the latest poll.
When asked which specific health care issues are most important to themselves and their families, people most frequently cited costs and cost control (38 percent), followed by universal coverage (23 percent), other references to access (15 percent) and choice of doctors (11 percent). All other aspects of health care were mentioned by less than 10 percent.
Most gave the news media negative marks for explaining the difference between health care proposals and their likely impact on the public. Only 5 percent said the news media had done an excellent job, 27 percent said pretty good, 41 percent said fair and 23 percent said poor.
Seventy-six percent in the poll said there should be live television coverage of the debate and vote in Congress on health care.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Another Chapter Unfolds For Banks

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., Aug. 6

 BODY:
Carl Banks returned home tonight. Well, not really.
From 1984 through 1992, his first nine seasons in the National Football League, he played strong-side outside linebacker for the Giants. Last year, he played that position for the Washington Redskins. Tonight, when the Giants met the Cleveland Browns in a preseason game at Giants Stadium, he played there for the Browns. 
 So Banks was back where he had won two Super Bowls, a Pro Bowl trip and a reputation for being perhaps pro football's toughest linebacker against the run. But home?
Home, he said, is where you are appreciated. And he felt that in 1991 and 1992, when the Giants floundered under Ray Handley as the head coach and Rod Rust as the defensive coordinator, he was unfairly criticized by the coaches. And last year, he heard people say that even if he was all right as a 3-4 linebacker for the Giants, he could not succeed as a 4-3 linebacker for the Redskins.
 
Lost Season With Redskins
 "I didn't get offended by the Washington thing," Banks said before the game. "No one asked me what the situation was. People assume I didn't adjust well, but the Giants' 3-4 was really a 4-3 because Lawrence Taylor almost always rushed the passer.
"The problem with the Redskins was the defense played so bad. We all played bad, but a lot of people wouldn't take the blame for what was going on. I'm not bitter. That's just the way it was."
In the good-news, bad-news world of unrestricted free agency, which came to the N.F.L. last year, Banks had known both extremes. In 1992, the last year before free agency, his salary with the Giants was $1.15 million. Last year, he left the Giants and signed with the Redskins for $5.4 million over three years. That included a $1.5-million salary and a $600,000 signing bonus.
But this winter, the Redskins cut loose older and high-salaried players like Mark Rypien, Charles Mann, Tim McGee, Ricky Sanders, Al Noga -- and Banks. But for Banks, unemployment was brief.
 
Direct Dial to Belichick
 He called Bill Belichick, his original defensive coordinator with the Giants and now the head coach of the Browns. Belichick was interested. So were several other teams, but as Banks said, "I thought Cleveland would be a good situation for me."
What he really meant was that Belichick would be a good situation for him. In their years with the Giants, Belichick appreciated Banks's ability to tie up the tight end on a pass play and beat the tight end's block on running plays. He also knew that Banks played hard.
"You know how badly he wanted to play for us?" said Kevin Byrne, a Browns vice president. "He came to mini-camp without a contract so we could see he was in shape."
The Browns liked what they saw, but they had little room under the salary cap. No problem. Banks accepted a one-year contract for $225,000.
 
Better Environment
 Now they have Banks and Frank Stams at outside linebacker and Pepper Johnson, a former Giant, as the middle linebacker. Banks is enthusiastic, and he took off 10 pounds, down to 235, to improve his quickness.
"I'm having a good time again," he said. "I'm enjoying football. I feel more at home. It's not necessarily the people running the system, but the system itself. And the whole environment is better.
"To play for Bill Belichick, you have to prove yourself every day, every practice. But it's the type of pressure you want to be in because it makes for a very competitive team and it makes you a very competitive person."

HEADLINE: No Free Market

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
While the rest of the world turns to free-market principles to generate economic progress, baseball owners turn to discredited socialist principles to solve their business problems. They don't believe that baseball wages should be conducted in free and open competition among those wishing to retain workers who can hit, throw or catch a baseball. 
 That standard may apply to owners of factories, stores, railroads and airlines, but certainly not to the owners of baseball.
The reason for this, of course, dates back to a misguided legal concept that said baseball is not a business. This enabled the owners to write their own rules making the players indentured servants unable to exercise the most basic of rights, the right to quit and get a similar job elsewhere.
Over time, the players have banded together and negotiated a measure of freedom. But the owners don't like the way it has worked out and want to limit player income with salary caps. It is difficult to imagine General Electric, General Motors or any of the other generals getting away with that sort of thing.
While the owners have been losing ground in the salary struggle with workers, they have made tremendous progress in dealing with municipal governments.
Long ago, if an owner thought he needed a new stadium, he built one. That has become an outmoded concept, nowhere more than in New York City where the government has financed separate facilities for the Yankees and the Mets.
Now, the question shouldn't be whether New York should build a new stadium for George Steinbrenner and the Yankees or repair the old one. The question is: Why should we do anything for him?
As for the players and their salaries, why can't labor and management work it out without the reserve clause or salary caps or other artificial -- and otherwise illegal -- devices? If they can't, we can all read a few more books this summer.

Dreaming of the Way It Used to Be

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
LAMBASTE me for being mired in the past, for refusing to remove my scratchy mono Beatles LP's from the turntable with the dust all over its plastic cover, but I just can't seem to feel anything but overwhelming indifference for these baby-faced millionaires whose collective title I find difficult even tapping into my trusty lap top.
I admit this is journalistically juvenile, but as I type my stories, I'm avoiding using the unofficial brand name, Dream Team II. The first day up here, I called it the Next Generation and winced when I saw that in print, so now I resort to U.S. and Team USA and Americans and American pros and N.B.A. stars and Coach Don Nelson's team. 
 This has nothing to do with moral opposition to their being here at the world basketball championships, to defend Our Game from four and a half million Croats and a billion or so Chinese. Coach Nelson's team just doesn't glow, doesn't have anything remotely dreamy about it. His players shoot innumerable 3's and get a lot of dunks and often follow them up by emitting these unbearable primal screams. Other than Shaquille O'Neal's Hasidic sideburns, however, there is almost nothing beguiling, or endearing, about this bunch.
When the Americans meet at midcourt to address the fans before and after games, their waves are limp, apathetic, and when you witness a rare signing of a kid's autograph, you can't help noticing the player almost never looks at or talks to the kid. And what are we to do about Coach Nelson's persistent sour puss and blathering on about 10-man rotations in a tournament filled with teams that have less operating capital than the sum of the American pros' per diem?
I wish Isiah Thomas hadn't ruptured his heel and could bound off the bench with that wicked little smile, burst into the lane and dish off to Joe Dumars, his longtime Detroit Pistons' running mate, for a 20-foot jumper. Thomas and Dumars don't have much to say to each other, but, that's exactly what I'm talking about. There was an edge to those Pistons' teams, unmistakable identity.
The problem with Team USA is that it's filled with generic stars from generic teams. Forget about international competitions, there are, sadly, no Dream Teams inside the N.B.A. right now, no Bostons, no Showtimes, no Jordanaires, no Bad Boys, nobody to love or love to hate, no teams to define a formless, diluted product.
No matter what the basketball shoe executives -- and Michael Jordan, for that matter -- think, N.B.A. stars extract a considerable portion of their identity from the uniforms they wear. Ask Larry Bird, sometime, if he could have imagined being drafted by the Sacramento Kings, or Magic Johnson by the Utah Jazz. How memorable would the halcyon 1980's be right now if the best player Bird got to play with was Wayman Tisdale, as opposed to Robert Parish, Dennis Johnson and Kevin McHale? If the Houston Rockets and Dallas Mavericks and not Magic's and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's and James Worthy's Lakers dominated the West?
There are too many markets and too many network and cable television slots to fill now for this league to want clusters of stars gathered under one roof. In Commissioner David Stern's Utopian N.B.A., there would be one superstar for every spanking new, luxury-boxed building, and even a Nets-Clippers matchup would draw ratings for TNT.
That's never going to happen because there aren't enough stars who are good and charismatic enough to create box office bonanzas. There will always be dumb management, and bad teams. The N.B.A. can, and has, lived with that. It can't, and won't, thrive with an overwhelming majority of mediocrity it has right now.
Stern and the other bright N.B.A. lawyers have fallen too much in love with their press clippings. They really believe that a salary cap, among other economic innovations, put the N.B.A. where it was until Jordan quit. They would rather defend their beloved cap than have Horace Grant with O'Neal and Anfernee Hardaway next season in Orlando, where they could form another desperately needed super team. The league is fighting the Magic's use of a cap loophole to sign Grant, and they will likely contest Phoenix should it exploit the loophole to add Danny Manning to Charles Barkley and Kevin Johnson.
After 10 years of these cap shenanigans, my advice to baseball and football writers is to not get sucked into the debate, no matter whose side you think you're on. Cap talk gives everyone a headache. Fans don't care any more than they care about how much health coverage deductible unionized journalists have to pay.
They want their games. They want their star-studded teams. The N.B.A. became a hot marketing ticket when it promised, and often delivered, a presummer showdown between Magic, Kareem, Worthy and Byron Scott and Bird, Parish, D. J., McHale and Danny Ainge. Or Philly's Julius Erving, Moses Malone, Bobby Jones, Andrew Toney and Maurice Cheeks.
Those were real Dream Teams, whose foundations were built before the cap took hold. Mark me as an aging cynic, but in a seven-game series, I'd take any of those teams over these N.B.A. stars. In six.

Orioles' Owner: Man With A Plan

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
Peter Angelos thinks big. That's not surprising for a man who, with his partners, paid a big price -- $173 million -- for the Baltimore Orioles. Peter Angelos wants to Camdenize the major leagues. "Let's build a Camden Yards facility in every major league locale," he said, referring to the Orioles' wonderfully successful home.
To achieve his plan, he wants major league baseball to join forces with local governmental entities to build the parks. But that's a long-range project that has to wait its turn. Before getting to ball parks, Angelos has another plan that he wants major league baseball to undertake, this one in conjunction with the players. This one, he said, would eradicate once and for all the ongoing war between the game's management and labor teams. 
 "I don't think salary caps and revenue sharing are the ultimate, final, permanent solution to the problems of baseball," Angelos said in a telephone interview Friday.
Angelos's idea is worth hearing and considering, especially with the two sides' marching stridently toward a strike after Thursday night's games. Perhaps the idea stemmed from a comment by Mike Mussina, an economics major at Stanford before he became an Orioles pitcher.
"The owners are making tons of money," Angelos quoted Mussina as saying.
"I say to our side," the $173 million man said, "if this young man, with his academic background and high level of intelligence, believes that, and we're losing $100 million a year, we've dropped the ball. The key is to inform the players; let them really understand what the facts are financially. If baseball has a problem, let the owners prove it. The owners should put their books on the table."
But Angelos doesn't want to put the books on just any table; he wants them to be placed on a table surrounded by distinguished members of a Presidential commission, a blue-ribbon panel headed by "a person perceived to have complete integrity, a member of the Supreme Court or somebody like that."
Representatives of both sides would participate, Angelos said, and major accounting firms could be hired to lend their expertise.
"Let this become a sensible, quiet, intellectual inquiry," he said. "The only way to push aside doubts is to prove it with a process that if it is proved is finished business and we can move on to the next stage -- how to establish the financial viability of baseball."
Angelos went on.
"It seems to me," he said, "the first obligation the owners have is to prove, without any fear of refutation, that there is a $100 million shortfall in 1994 and there will be that plus in '95. Based on what I've been shown in owners meetings, I'm convinced there's a shortfall, a crisis, and I support the owners' position 100 percent.
"But let the chips fall where they may. If that turns out not to be the case, I'd have to reassess my position and others would, too. If it's established that losses and claims of losses are artificial, obviously there would be owners who wouldn't support the position advanced by the owners. Then we'd have to take another road."
At least, Angelos added, the owners and the players would be done with the part of the dispute in which one side makes claims and the other dismisses them as being untrue. "That portion has been with us for 25 years," he said. "A long-term solution or approach is needed to eliminate the acrimony."
The last negotiations, in 1990, produced an economic study committee that seemed to spend forever scrutinizing baseball's economic health. But that committee was run by representatives of the players and the owners. The Angelos commission would be more independent.
"Another study committee isn't going to do anything but update those statistics," Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, said. "They'll find what we've described."
Not if the panel looked deeply enough, union officials believe. They say that the owners' books don't tell enough about the game's financial state. Fine. Let them tell the panel members where to look and what to look for to get at the truth if the truth isn't what the owners are expressing. The idea is to get to the core of the dispute and resolve it.
Angelos recognizes that his idea wouldn't be sufficient to deter the players from walking out Friday. Ravitch said the suggestion is "a disguised way of saying once again defer dealing with the cost issue in baseball." The owners, he added, "have said unequivocally we will not defer the issue any longer.
Is a season-ending strike better? Would the owners rather have the playoffs and World Series wiped out? Would they want to take a chance that they won't start next season on time or even play next season?
If the Angelos idea could settle the issue, as he thinks it could, the owners would benefit in the long run from agreeing not to implement their salary cap in the off season so that the players wouldn't strike now.
Angelos's commission certainly could finish its work before the end of next season. If the owners are concerned about the economic stability of the poorer clubs, take the money the richer clubs would have lost during a strike -- Angelos says the Orioles alone will lose $10 million to $15 million -- and give it to their poorer brethren for 1995 in the name of revenue sharing.

HEADLINE: Health Care and the Generation Chasm

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article promotes a divisiveness that impedes a real overhaul of our cumbersome and expensive health care system. Statistics indicate that activities often associated with young people -- sports, hazardous driving, drinking, drug abuse, promiscuity -- are responsible for a great share of very expensive serious diseases and traumatic injuries. 
 But the young are no more affected by the capriciousness and escalating cost of health care coverage than are other groups. When insurance rates keep rising, a job is lost or employers reduce or drop coverage, there is no difference in the calamity.
There are only two ways to streamline the system and cut costs: universal coverage and uniform rates. Everyone will benefit from the resulting reduction of paperwork and insurance-related bureaucracy. If instead of set premiums payments could be graded by income, as in some countries, that would help young people who have not reached their income potential.
The young should not be encouraged to be angry about supporting a health care system but urged, instead, to participate in efforts to establish an equitable plan for the good of the economy and the country.

HEADLINE: When Politics Hide Behind Islam

 BODY:
The burning of books leads ineluctably to the burning of heretics. Freedom of conscience is a protection for all believers, to the disadvantage of none. When preachers enter politics, scruple sometimes flies out the door. It has taken centuries for Western societies to absorb these lessons, whose value is periodically underscored here at home by an outburst of religious zealotry -- such as the killing in Florida of a physician by a foe of abortion rights, to demonstrate the sanctity of life.
Similar acts, in other parts of the world, have been inspired by what is too sweepingly called Islamic fundamentalism. Every great religion derives its strength from fundamentals, and in that sense every believer is a fundamentalist. Rather call it crafty fanaticism when clergymen with a political agenda agitate to execute alleged blasphemers, now including Christians. And in countries where this is happening -- Bangladesh, Pakistan and Iran -- religious bigotry is in fact a deadly weapon in a worldly power struggle. 
In Bangladesh, which once prided itself on traditions of tolerance, the most conspicuous target is a feminist novelist, Taslima Nasrin, who is threatened with death by Islamic radicals and with a blasphemy trial by a rattled Government. The less-publicized targets are non-conforming newspaper editors and aid groups like the renowned Grameen Bank, whose offense is to give small loans to rural women. Scores of journalists have been jailed for "un-Islamic practices," while mobs take direct action, bombing houses and wrecking offices, as related in a report by Human Rights Watch/Asia.
In Pakistan, prosecutors use blasphemy laws, carrying capital sentences, against Christians and adherents of the Ahmadiyya, a minority faith. Some Christians have died in custody; others face execution, according to a detailed Amnesty International report. As in Bangladesh, a moderate Government, also led by a politically vulnerable woman, is challenged by militant religious radicals claiming a divine right to rule and threatened by women's newfound access to power, whether political or literary. Rather than fight, both Governments have gone along with blasphemy prosecutions.
Granted, compared with Iran, these sanctions are mild. Since seizing power in 1979, Iran's clerical rulers have executed tens of thousands, and made life miserable for 350,000 followers of the Bahai faith. Ayatollah Khomeini has been succeeded as spiritual dictator by Ayatollah Khameini, whose hard-line zealotry prevails over the cautious pragmatism of President Rafsanjani. Ominously, Islamic radicals elsewhere -- especially in the Sudan, Egypt and Algeria -- take their cue from Teheran's ayatollahs.
Hence the sinister implications of a new wave of repression directed against 80,000 Iranian Christians, three of whose leaders have been killed this year. The search for new victims and fresh heresies has been a proven means in Iran of deflecting discontent with joblessness, inflation and clerical corruption. The savage mistreatment of Christians conflicts with guarantees in Iran's Constitution, just as obligatory bribes for mullahs shame the religious pretensions of the Islamic Republic.
President Rafsanjani needs to know that these persecutions are noticed, that there is deep concern about the perilous example Iran is setting, and that Iran cannot hope for more normal relations with the West by showing such flagrant contempt for universal norms of tolerance.

HEADLINE: Poverty Is Unfairly Defined

 BODY:
The cost of food, rent and other consumer goods can be twice as high in Manhattan as in Little Rock, Ark. Yet the income cutoff for poverty programs is the same in both places, $14,764 for a family of four. That produces the ridiculous and unfair result that a Manhattan family earning $15,000 does not qualify for Federal nutrition or education programs while an Arkansas family earning $14,500 -- the equivalent of $29,000 in Manhattan -- does.
The Federal definition of poverty is blind to the real costs paid by people struggling to purchase the necessities of life. That is why Senator Joseph Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, and Representative Dean Gallo, Republican of New Jersey, have proposed bills that would adjust poverty levels for state differences in the cost of living. That way poor families in Los Angeles and Philadelphia will get their fair share of the $20 billion or more that Congress spends on need-based programs. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, an expert on poverty, says that adjusting poverty levels for living costs will produce poverty rates in New York nearly as high as those in the Deep South. 
 The only argument against the bills is that high-income states like New York and California can afford to pay more to help their poor than can low-income states like Mississippi and South Carolina. But the poor in New York are not just the responsibility of taxpayers in New York; helping the poor is every American's duty, best carried out by Federal payments that take account of differences in the cost of living. Of course, wealthy states like New York will pay a disproportionate share of the taxes that support such payments.
The argument for letting rich states take care of "their" own poor fails for another reason: they will shirk. If state governments try to finance generous welfare, they trigger in-migration of the poor and out-migration of wealthy taxpayers. Therefore they underfinance welfare; over the past two decades, state welfare benefits have dwindled.
Federal poverty levels are supposed to identify families that cannot buy minimally decent food, clothes and shelter. To act as if living costs do not matter, or as if financially strapped states will pick up where Washington leaves off, amounts to a vicious attack on the poor who happen to live in high-cost states.

HEADLINE: July 31-Aug. 6: Unclear Intentions;
The North Koreans Return to the Table For Nuclear Bargaining

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

 BODY:
Four weeks after the death of President Kim Il Sung, North Korea resumed negotiations with the United States on its nuclear program last week in Geneva. It could be read as a positive sign, but not necessarily. No one knows what Mr. Kim really intended when he agreed to the talks. And no one can be sure that Pyongyang's new regime really wants a deal.
 The United States is offering an end to North Korea's economic and political isolation, but the price is high: North Korea must renounce all hope of becoming a nuclear power and, since its word cannot be trusted, it must also open all its nuclear installations to international inspection and place any stocks of weapons-grade plutonium under international control. 
 North Korea, meanwhile, is demanding a new light-water nuclear reactor to replace its current graphite reactors. This interests Washington because light-water reactors produce far less plutonium than graphite technology.
 After eight hours of talks on Friday, the two sides agreed that they had been "businesslike" and had covered most outstanding issues, but no important breakthrough was achieved. They are to meet again Monday. Perhaps then Pyongyang will reveal whether it truly wants to join the world. Perhaps not. ALAN RIDING

HEADLINE: Time for U.S. to Sit Down With the New Japan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Clinton Administration is still at a loss about how to deal with Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama of Japan and his new coalition regime. 
 In July 1993, Japan's general election ended the 38-year rule of the old Liberal Democratic Party. The anti-Liberal Democratic coalition, including the Socialists without their most doctrinaire leftist segment, was controlled by Ichiro Ozawa, who split away with many of his party's most nationalistic and corrupt elements.
On June 29, the new Liberal Democratic Party, the new Socialists and the leading reform group, the Harbinger Party, combined to defeat Mr. Ozawa's candidate for prime minister and elected instead Mr. Murayama of the new Socialists. Mr. Ozawa was forced out of power for the first time in his political career.
President Clinton's hesitancy toward the Murayama administration has shown how much America took for granted the "Ozawa lever," the secret tool to manipulate Japan. Presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton all counted on Mr. Ozawa, the fixer of Japanese politics. Just as President Clinton has harped on trade deficits as if they were mainly caused by Japan, one President after another has loudly blamed Japan for America's economic and political problems.
They have used American anger against Japan as the pretext for threatening trade sanctions. Unfortunately, Japan was cowed by this posturing. Mr. Ozawa goaded the Japanese Government into capitulating to American demands for the sake of "improving" the relationship with the United States.
In 1987, 1989 and again in 1994, Mr. Ozawa had the United States impose on Japan Motorola's cellular telephone system, which is technically incompatible with Japan's system. From 1990 to 1991, Mr. Ozawa, not even a cabinet member, forced Japan, without any debate in Parliament, to make a $13 billion contribution for the Persian Gulf war.
Mr. Ozawa has converted all these deals into kickback and influence-peddling machines. His source of political power was money. The United States has become a partner of Japan's corrupt money politics.
The Clinton Administration used Mr. Ozawa to enlist Japan in the American-led confrontation with North Korea over nuclear issues. Mr. Ozawa, in turn, found the United States-hyped fear of North Korea useful in paving the way to send Japanese military forces abroad.
Late in April, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata tried to distance himself from Mr. Ozawa and restrain the United States from the misguided confrontation with North Korea. Mr. Hata was also alarmed by Ozawa-led piecemeal cedings of auto, semiconductor and other markets to the United States. Unfortunately, Mr. Ozawa reined in Mr. Hata.
The Murayama administration is solidifying its hold on Japanese politics. Mr. Ozawa's record as the hidden American agent is being exposed, increasing Japanese public anger at the United States. Accordingly, the United States is well advised to open forthright contacts with the new administration and start discussing United States-Japan cooperation on global issues from the North Korean nuclear threats to the World Trade Organization.

Studying America

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re Michael Armacost's "Japan Goes to Business School" (Op-Ed, July 28): I have taught political economy to many Japanese as a professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business. The behavior of these students, whatever reasons underlie their sponsorship, suggests they are much more interested in learning about American society than American production techniques. 
 When they drive across the United States during breaks between terms, as many do, it is not to study high-tech manufacturing in Silicon Valley but to explore a country with a culture that is highly attractive to them.
I'm certain we send back better-trained students who will contribute to reform of Japanese management practices. I'm also certain that as these students become influential in Japanese business and government, they will give Japan a more informed and sympathetic view of American society.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
Mosque's Quest for New Building Becomes a Plan for Urban Renewal

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY 

 BODY:
When Izak-el M. Pasha looks south these days from his third-floor office window in the Malcolm Shabazz mosque on West 116th Street, he sees a vacant red-dirt lot strewn with broken glass and discarded toys.
But if Mr. Pasha and a group of Harlem business leaders have their way in the next several years, 85 units of federally subsidized housing for the elderly will spring up on the site. 
 And across the street from the mosque, on two long, mostly barren blocks between 115th and 115th Streets, from Lenox Avenue to Fifth, they hope to see not only a massive new mosque but also hundreds of three-story town-house apartments for low- and middle-income families, a clinic and an international marketplace.
The plans, which have reached the stage of preliminary blueprints and tentative talks with the city, are being put together by the mosque with the help of the Harlem Business Alliance, the Harlem Real Estate Board and the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce. They are an attempt to revitalize an area of central Harlem the leaders say has been left behind in recent revitalization efforts of churches and community groups in Harlem and the Bronx.
"It's really the last area left in Harlem with no major development going on," said Mr. Pasha, the imam, or leader, of the mosque. He cited the sprawling Bradhurst development project and the rehabilitation near Striver's Row in north Harlem. "This is an area where you still can't even find automated teller machines, where whole blocks are vacant," he said.
The development would be the mosque's first foray into working to get city, state and Federal money to rehabilitate a neighborhood. But Donald Cogsville, chief executive of the Harlem Urban Development League, which is providing assistance to the developers, said officials had confidence in the religious leaders and their partners.
"The mosque has been there so long," he said. "They have so much respect."
The mosque, or masjid, is the center of worship in the city for mostly black followers of Sunni Islam, who broke from the Nation of Islam in the early 1970's because it taught racial separatism.
In recent years, Mr. Pasha said, the sect has outgrown its quarters on the southwest corner of West 116th Street and Lenox Avenue, a mosque founded by Malcolm X, and has sought to build a new one nearby. Those plans eventually expanded to include helping redevelop the entire area.
Whether the project will get off the ground depends mostly on community support and encouraging retailers to get on board, said Max Bond Jr., an architect who has been involved. Two other efforts to develop the site in the late 1980's and early 1990's failed, he said.
"But I'm really optimistic that we can see something happen here this time," Mr. Bond said. "The area is ripe for it."

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
For Chinatown Job Seekers, a Tenuous Lifeline

SERIES: THE BOTTOM RUNG -- A periodic look at new immigrant's struggles to gain an economic foothold in New York

BYLINE: By JANE H. LII 

 BODY:
LAST Saturday, shortly after he was dismissed from a job he got through the Singapore Employment Agency in Chinatown, Xie Jing Xu went to the agency for a partial refund of the referral fee, or deposit. Edging up to the windows with their steel bars, he slipped the receipt through an opening.
Neither employee behind the counter acknowledged him. 
 "Please. . ." he begged, pushing the receipt further inside, "please."
"No refund today," a counselor said and shoved the receipt back.
"But you owe me $85 and I need it," Mr. Xie persisted. "I paid you a fee to find me a job. Now I have no job and you said you would give me back half of the money."
"Not on Saturdays and Sundays," another woman barked. "Now get out!" She threatened to call the police.
Outside, in the shadow of the red-brick building on Forsyth Street near Division Street that houses a dozen employment agencies, other applicants listened as Mr. Xie calculated his losses: $195 in agency fees and bus fare for a cook's job in Florida that earned him $60 for one day's work.
It is in places like the Singapore Employment Agency that many Chinese immigrants are forced to make their first struggling economic steps in America, and find themselves caught between their desperation for jobs and the potential for exploitation. In response to details about the practices of some of the agencies brought to its attention by The New York Times, the city's Department of Consumer Affairs started an investigation and on Thursday cited 10 Chinatown agencies for illegal refund policies and operating without a license.
Like Mr. Xie, most of the men who flock to such agencies -- and the overwhelming majority are men -- are immigrants from Fujian Province, on the southern coast of China. Most have been in this country less than two years, and they live crowded together in small apartments; many arrived here illegally on smugglers' boats.
For these immigrants, who are on the lowest rung of the already poor Chinatown working class, a few hundred dollars in fees, penalties and travel expenses are a crucial matter. As they struggle to meet the monthly installments of exorbitant smuggling fees that can range from $30,000 to $50,000, this money could help save them from being kidnapped and tortured by smugglers.
To these immigrants, the most important thing is to find a job that pays in the region of $2,000 a month, a good salary by Chinatown standards. But the job market they face is a desperate one. Competition has pushed the low wages in the unskilled Chinese labor market down even further as the recession has lessened demand for workers.
"It's unconscionable that these agencies take advantage of desperate people," said William Chiu, the chairman of the American Fujian Association of Commerce and Industry. "These agencies are worse than gangsters who pull out guns and rob people."
But still, the agencies are the lifeline for many newcomers who know so little about America. Many could not find jobs on their own or read the newspaper advertisements and are unable to find addresses because they cannot read street signs.
In addition, Fujianese workers are perceived as undesirable by some Cantonese-speaking business owners. Some say the Fujianese workers' traditional diet of rice porridge makes them too weak to endure long hours or carry heavy boxes. Others complain they cannot understand the local dialect of the Fujianese and say they are afraid Fujianese are likely to have gang connections. In some agencies, the words "No Fujianese" are written in parentheses next to job orders.
But job orders from Alaska to Texas and even as far away as the Bahamas fill the agencies' boards. Counselors coax employers to hire Fujianese workers.
But many of these establishments, like the Singapore Employment Agency, are not licensed, according to the city investigation. For example, only 5 of the 12 agencies at the Forsyth Street building are licensed.
For these immigrants, the low-wage calculus goes like this: To apply for a job, an applicant puts down a deposit, 10 percent of a month's projected earnings. If the agency fails to find a job, it must refund the entire amount on demand. Now, according to the accounts of applicants, many agencies hold the amount for up to three days.
If a job is found and a worker is dismissed for reasons other than incompetence, the agency is entitled to 10 percent of the wages actually earned, which, in Mr. Xie's case, as he tells it, the fee would have been $6.
If the dismissal is a result of incompetence, the agency can keep 50 percent of the actual wages earned. In practice, many agencies ignore rules and -- no matter what the reason for the dismissal is -- simply keep half the deposit, which is usually much higher than the amount allowed by the law.
Many agencies also violate the Immigration and Nationality Act by not properly screening applicants on their immigration status. Of the six agencies visited by The Times last week, only one asked applicants to show proof of legal residency before offering jobs, and even then only occasionally. Several applicants at the Forsyth Street building say that only after they seek their deposits back are they asked about their immigration status and then are accused of having lied and are denied their money.
The Singapore and other agencies owned by Jackson Lee, a Chinatown businessman, were among those cited by the city. Attempts to speak to Mr. Lee, and most other agency owners, were unsuccessful. But one owner, who insisted on anonymity, said the agencies must protect themselves. She said the applicants try to cheat the agencies out of commissions, saying they were dismissed from jobs and demanding their deposits even when they were still employed. She said the penalties insure that applicants do not simply walk away from jobs.
"When that happens, I lose customers," she said. "They don't want to give me business again."
For the immigrants, life at the agencies is a revolving door. They come, they find jobs and soon return, often within a month.
"I try hard to make a decent living," said Mr. Xie. "But I can't win. I don't want to become a criminal. Why are they pushing me in that direction?"
 
GETTING STARTED
THE JOB LADDER
 
These are the jobs mostly posted on bulletin boards in the approximately 30 emplyment agencies in Chinatown that deal in unskilled and manual labor sought by the new Fugianese immigrants. Mant workers are paid in cash. All generally work at least 12 hours a day, six or seven days a week.
 
STORE CLERK -- $900 a month. Considered the least desirable work. Tough work, very low pay. Duties include hauling goods off trucks and sweeping floors.
 
DISHWASHER -- $1,200 a month. Better than clerk but still considered tough and tedious.
 
Cook's Assistant -- $1,500 a month. Cut vegetables, chop meats and prepare sauces. Considered one of the desirable jobs but don't generally last because employers are extremely precise and demanding.
 
HOST -- $1,800 a month. Considered a very good job. Seats customers and takes phone orders. Most Fujianese don't qualify because functional english is required.
 
COOK -- Up to $2,000 a month. The top of the bottom rung. But demands of owners make job longevity rare.

HEADLINE: What Makes Us Angry

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

 BODY:
NO one ever questions the quantity of life in New York City.
No one could, in the place that has long defined national notions of biggest, tallest, fastest, fiercest. Yet lately such a civic consensus as ever emerges in this city of "So's your old man!" seems to have settled implacably on the conviction that the quality of life is sadly broken -- and has been for a long time. 
 The secular leader of the crusade is Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who campaigned for City Hall -- and won it -- as a new broom. He has been busy sweeping since, vowing cleanups of squeegee pests and errant peddlers and miscellaneous misdemeanants of every stripe, and his credo is simple: Little things mean a lot.
Or as Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center and a former Deputy Mayor, puts it: "It is only the tip of the iceberg. But you're starting to deal with it, and serving notice on the entire iceberg."
Ask any New Yorker (not just your cabdriver) for an opinion on the city's quality of life, and you'll get a passionate one -- or two or three. They'll be widely divergent, maybe even contradictory, and the problems will be big and small. Some of those problems may actually be smaller problems than they used to be. (Take the subways: No graffiti, and air-conditioning in all but every car, though that just makes the platforms hotter.)
At the root of this unease are questions of order and disorder, and however people define their own lines, they seem increasingly willing to draw them. Indeed, in a New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll taken the month before last year's mayoral election, more than 60 percent of those surveyed said the quality of life had declined in the previous four years. A mayor is a catalyst (and a politician), and for better or worse, this one has tapped into the mood.
Like most new ideas, of course, this one is partly old. Mayors and ministers have ordered periodic purges of affronts to common life since the days when 19th-century saloons teemed with gangs of toughs, and citizens have occasionally taken matters into their own hands, swinging hammers and sledges in illicit dives. One anonymous diarist in 1888 wrote of finding Hester Street so crowded with teen-age prostitutes that he was forced off the sidewalk.
Not so very long ago, there were no one-way streets or traffic signs (or alternate side parking!), and the problems of haphazard adherence to the pooper-scooper law pale beside the effluvia of the animals that pulled the drays and streetcars of gaslight Gotham.
Today's complaints are as sticky as the posters plastered on street lamps, as visceral as the fish guts discarded on the sidewalks of Chinatown, as loud as the busted car alarms that never stop wailing. They are also as ominous as the beeper on a teen-ager's belt, the gun in his hand, the bills in his fist. Each generation redefines the limits of tolerance.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a scholar of urban society, suggests that what may make this generation different is its grim acceptance of ever greater assaults on the psyche and senses, its propensity for "defining deviancy down." Such dulled sensibilities have consequences, criminologists argue, since if a neighborhood is unkempt, it will feel dangerous and be dangerous.
If some once-big things now seem littler, it may be because the biggest things are so much worse: Four times as many felonies a year as in 1960 -- so many more that three straight years of decline in reported crime have produced no discernible increase in perceived safety.
This anxiety in the face of menace and dirt may help explain why so many tempers have snapped, why the Woodstock generation of West Side liberals now fears for its children stepping over crack vials and panhandlers on upper Broadway and just wants something done.
"We're talking about crime -- all the aspects that make life ugly," said Edward I. Koch, who tried his own share of crackdowns as Mayor, establishing a low-security prison camp on Hart Island for vandals and miscreants, to which, he complained, judges refused to sentence anyone. "It's the thing uppermost in people's minds. They're so angry they'd like to kill. Maybe the good old days were never good, but you remember them as so much better."
Crime may be at once the hardest problem to solve, and the easiest to agree on. Concepts of order, control and appearance are more elusive. Are street peddlers a bother or a blessing, with their $3 umbrellas on rainy days and wool mittens in winter? Are noisy nightclubs a nuisance, or an ebullient sign of life? What qualities? Whose lives?
In fact, according to "Safire's Political Dictionary," the phrase "quality of life" was coined in the political sense by Eric Sevareid, who used it to contrast Adlai E. Stevenson's approach in his 1956 campaign with the Depression-era liberalism that sought more quantities for every group. And since then, many politicians have used it to transcend simply material goals.
"Some say quality of life is best defined by spotless parks and litter-free roadways," David N. Dinkins said four years ago, announcing his first budget as Mayor. "But for me, it is best exemplified by a happy, healthy baby, or by a teen-ager with diploma in hand and a sparkle in the eye."
Gordon J. Davis, a former Parks Commissioner under Mr. Koch, acknowledges the delicate balances involved.
"Of course, if you grew up black in this country in the 40's and 50's, you had a very different taste for rule enforcement than a lot of people," recalled Mr. Davis, who grew up black in Chicago, where his access to resplendent parks was limited by their effective segregation.
"I'm not one of those who believes that you stop murder and rape and mayhem by enforcing the littering laws," added Mr. Davis, whose fondest visions of the quality of urban life involve the diversity and accessibility of a city's open spaces. "But I know there is something important about the kinds of laws and rules that one can and should enforce, and it is important not to forget them and let them slide."
Mr. Dinkins's Police Commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, may have best summed up the challenge, and the changing sentiments, when he warned last year that the "No Radio" signs that had sprouted in car windows were "flags of urban surrender."
"Rather than express outrage, or even annoyance at the possibility of a car break-in," Mr. Kelly said in a speech, "people tried to communicate with the potential thief in conciliatory terms." He added: "They are handwritten capitulations. Instead of 'No Radio' we need new signs that say 'No Surrender.' "
 
IT may be the political mantra of the year. But what does it mean? What exactly are we worried about? In a decidedly unscientific attempt to answer these questions, The City asked dozens of Manhattanites -- police officers, local officials, community workers and men and women on the street -- what they saw as the quality-of-life issues in their neighborhoods. Their answers show remarkable differences, remarkable similarities. Nor is the picture they offer all gloom and doom. What follows is a selection of their responses -- an impressionistic map, if you will, of what we think ails us. In the coming weeks, The City will take the measure of neighborhoods in the other boroughs.
 
UPPER MANHATTAN
 
1. TRAFFIC Congestion, noise and litter, especially on Seaman Avenue, as drivers avoid paying the recently increased toll on the Henry Hudson Bridge.
 
2. DRUGS Though police enforcement has thinned the ranks of street dealers, problems continue at two intersections in Inwood -- Thayer and Vermillion and Sherman and Dyckman.
 
3. CAR RADIOS Throughout Washington Heights, the big-boom radios have proliferated. In response, the police are conducting sweeps, ticketing drivers and seizing cars.
 
4. STREET DRINKING A problem throughout Washington Heights. A hot spot: around George Washington High, 193d and Audubon, especially when school is in session.
 
5. UNLICENSED VENDORS Near the entrances to the George Washington Bridge, unlicensed vendors sell everything from cellular phones to stuffed animals. Also, window washers and panhandlers pose a problem on 178th Street.
 
6. DRUGS Street sales at 159th Street and Broadway. Drug supermarket in building at 540 West 165th Street, near Amsterdam
Avenue.
 
7. SEWAGE PLANT The North River plant, at 145th Street and the Hudson, is a frequent source of complaints about foul odors and respiratory problems.
 
8. UNLICENSED VENDORS In Hamilton Heights, in the West 150's, vendors selling homemade food and other items are heavily patronized by drug dealers.
 
9. RATS On and around Lenox Avenue from 110th Street north.
 
10. VACANT LOTS These lots attract the illegal dumping of abandoned cars and other garbage. The cars, in turn, attract drug trafficking, while the refuse attracts rats. Hot spots: 126th Street between Eighth and St. Nicholas Avenues; 117th Street and Eighth Avenue.
 
11. DRUGS Two of the biggest drug bazaars in East Harlem: 110th Street and Lexington Avenue and 119th Street and Second
Avenue.
 
12. PROSTITUTION Women, many of them crack addicts, solicit passing motorists under the Park Avenue elevated tracks.
 
13. VACANT LOTS At 105th Street and First Avenue, an empty lot has become a heroin-trafficking site and a garbage dump. Unlicensed vendors have taken over another lot at 127th Street and Second Avenue.
 
14. PANHANDLING Though window washers have become less of a problem, beggars tie up traffic at the 125th Street entrance to the Triborough Bridge.
 
UPPER WEST SIDE
 
1. CAR BREAK-INS A frequent complaint in Morningside Heights, especially along Morningside and Riverside Drives.
 
2. TRAFFIC Riverside Drive from 110th Street north is used by city buses as a layover zone; the generally quiet Clermont Avenue is used as a bus route and a stopover for drivers.
 
3. VACANT LOTS Garbage is dumped in vacant lots east of Amsterdam Avenue from 96th to 110th Street, and especially in front of the old Towers Nursing Home at 106th Street and Central Park West.
 
4. SOCIAL-SERVICE PROGRAMS The area between 96th and 101st Streets, largely on Broadway, has roughly a half-dozen hotels for the formerly homeless and former mental patients. Many are drug users, say the police, who add that the Midway and the Marion Hotels have presented the largest problems.
 
5. DRUGS Crack sales along Broadway, near the hotels, and along Amsterdam Avenue from 86th to 96th Streets. Hot spots: for crack, 87th and Amsterdam; for marijuana, 94th and West End.
 
6. PROSTITUTION Streetwalkers congregate on Broadway and West End Avenue in the upper 80's and lower 90's. Over the last year, the police say, a crackdown has lessened the problem markedly.
 
7. PANHANDLING All along Broadway, from 72d Street to 116th Street.
 
8. POSTING BILLS All over the Upper West Side, notices are posted on telephone poles, bus shelters and lampposts.
 
MIDTOWN
 
1. TRAFFIC Continued closing of the 48th Street ramp to the F.D.R. Drive causes rush-hour congestion of First Avenue. Diplomatic occasions frequently snarl traffic near the United Nations.
 
2. HOMELESS ENCLAVE An encampment has sprung up around First Avenue in the lower 40's, concentrated in Tudor City Park.
 
3. DOGS More specifically, their owners' failure to pick up after them.
 
4. DRUGS Sales along Eighth and Ninth Avenues, 34th to 57th Street.
 
5. HOMELESS ENCLAVES The encampment in Columbus Circle is gone, but enclaves exist in DeWitt Clinton Park, on 11th Avenue between 52d and 54th Streets, and in Sheffield Plaza, 57th Street and Ninth Avenue.
 
6. GARBAGE In front of restaurants on Eighth Avenue between 53d and 57th Streets.
 
THE VILLAGES
 
1. PROBLEM PARKS Several West Village parks -- Bleecker (Bleecker Street from 11th to Bank), Jackson Square (Eighth Avenue between 13th and Horatio) and Washington Square -- are the focus of complaints about drug dealers, homeless encampments and other problems.
 
2. PUBLIC DRINKING Though a police crackdown has reduced drinking and rowdiness around Eighth Street, this remains a dominant complaint throughout the Village, especially on Christopher Street, Bleecker Street, 14th Street and Avenue of the Americas.
 
3. STOLEN GOODS MARKET Locals call it "Thieves R Us," a market that appears at about 10 o'clock nightly, with everything from computers to leather coats sold from car trunks.
 
4. SANITATION POLICE On Second Avenue, from Sixth to 12th Street, merchants complain of being ticketed for trash they say they did not produce.
 
5. WINDOW WASHERS Along Houston Street.
 
6. UNLICENSED VENDORS Along Broadway from Eighth Street to Houston, peddlers, many of them unlicensed, compete with merchants. Also, along 14th Street, from Avenue of the Americas to University Place.
 
7. DRUGS Street sales, mostly of crack, on the southeast corner of 14th Street and Third Avenue. The Regina Hotel, an S.R.O. at 13th and Third, also attracts drug dealers and prostitutes.
 
UPPER EAST SIDE
 
1. CAR THEFT The biggest problem in the area, says Nancy Wackstein, the executive director of Lenox Hill Neighborhood House; according to the police, the Upper East Side has among the highest rates of car theft and break-ins in the city.
 
2. PARKING Or the lack thereof, especially because of the number of places reserved for diplomatic parking.
 
3. PANHANDLING Along Madison Avenue. The expensive shops draw the well-to-do, who, in turn, draw the beggars.
 
4. HOMELESS ENCLAVES People sleep in Carl Schurz and John Jay Parks, along the East River, as well as on the benches along Fifth Avenue, in the wake of the 1 A.M. curfew in Central Park.
 
5. TRAFFIC Construction at New York Hospital and along York Avenue has brought congestion on York, First and Second Avenues.
 
6. NIGHTCLUB NOISE Bars and restaurants along First and Second Avenues in the 80's draw frequent complaints of noise and
rowdiness.
 
7. ROBBERIES OF CHILDREN Many people complain that older children steal their children's money and other items. (The police say, however, that while there have been some robberies, they are not a major
problem.)
 
CHELSEA/GRAMERCY
 
1. HOMELESS ENCLAVE Homeless people and drug dealing have pushed children and their parents out of most of Phipps Plaza and Bellevue South Park, between First and Second Avenues, 27th to 29th Street.
 
2. STOLEN SIGNS On Fifth Avenue from 14th to 20th Street, drivers steal "No Parking" and "No Standing" signs to avoid being
ticketed.
 
3. HOMELESS ENCLAVES Scaffolding at Washington Irving High School, 16th Street and Irving Place, has become a home for street people. Also, with a curfew periodically enforced, the homeless sometimes sleep in Union Square Park.
 
4. DRUGS Sales in buildings on 17th Street, between Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas.
 
5. PROSTITUTION Street solicitation, along Madison Avenue and Park Avenue South, 27th to 29th Street.
 
6. TRUCKS Trucks trying to avoid 14th Street traffic use 13th and 15th Streets, from the Hudson to Union Square, causing noise and congestion on these side streets.
 
LOWER MANHATTAN
 
1. UNLICENSED CAFES Throughout SoHo, many restaurants have opened sidewalk cafes, many of them without licenses.
 
2. STREET VENDORS Throughout SoHo, especially street artists, booksellers and food vendors.
 
3. GRAFFITI Throughout TriBeCa. A hot spot: Broadway, just north of Chambers Street, where residents now mount a weekly cleaning detail.
 
4. STREET VENDORS Along Canal Street, and especially from Avenue of the Americas to Broadway, where car-stereo dealers spread out onto the sidewalks. Also in Chinatown, where fish and vegetable stores spill out of doors.
 
5. MOTORCYCLE NOISE Along Mercer Street and Broadway up to Eighth Street, groups of bikers who have remove the baffling inside their mufflers.
 
6. STREET VENDORS In the financial district, but especially along Wall Street.
 
7. BUILDING MAINTENANCE In the housing projects of the Lower East Side -- Seward Park, La Guardia, Rutgers and Alfred E. Smith -- residents tell of broken elevators, unreliable heating and the like. They also complain of drug dealing and muggings.
 
8. IN-LINE SKATERS On the Promenade at Battery Park City.

HEADLINE: Boredom Mixed With Danger

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
If, in the pathology of scandal, Watergate was a cancer on the Presidency and the Iran-contra affair a hemorrhage, Whitewater has shown itself this week to be something else. It is a fever, not fatal, maybe, but politically wasting and beyond a simple cure.
The Arkansas land deal that Bill Clinton first mocked 29 months ago as "nothing but a big money loser" is now a metaphor for qualms about the President and the way he leads. True, nobody quite understands it; the two weeks of Congressional hearings that ended on Friday could be eye-glazing, and it seems unlikely to sap support for immediate projects like health insurance or welfare reform. 
 But neither will it go away. It is the long run -- November's midterm elections, and the Presidential campaign starting a year or so from now -- that will decide Mr. Clinton's political fate, and there the news on Whitewater is not good.
Boring as they might have been, the hearings left an ugly impression of integrity running a poor second to political expedience. And the decision on Friday to replace the Justice Department's Whitewater investigator with an independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, can only prolong the inquiry and the images it has evoked.
In a poll of 600 people on Thursday by Time magazine and CNN, 39 percent of respondents said they believed Mr. Clinton did something illegal in the Whitewater affair, compared with 28 percent who held that view three months ago.
Rightly or wrongly, with each new element of the story -- from disclosure to special prosecutor to new disclosure to hearings to independent counsel -- the notion that the White House is somehow not playing by accepted rules becomes more embedded in the public's mind.
"People basically think people in politics are liars," said the chief aide to a senior Democratic Senator, speaking on condition of anonymity. "And there's nothing worse than a photo of your entire Administration standing there with their right arms raised. Nothing worse."
The White House and its Democratic political advisers do not entirely agree. Officially, at least, they regard the drip of Whitewater disclosures, denials and recantations as annoying background noise in a Presidency with more historic issues on its agenda.
 
The Optimistic View
 Mr. Clinton's prime-time news conference this week was not dominated by Whitewater but devoted mostly to questions about health care and other policy matters, a ratio that "reflects the fundamental weakness of the Whitewater issue," said Robert Shrum, a Democratic political consultant who has been advising the White House. Indeed, the Democrats' polls suggest that voters' greatest doubts about Mr. Clinton revolve not around Arkansas real estate, but his ability to deliver on his many campaign pledges.
In that view, the low buzz about Whitewater will fade if the President can string together victories on, say, health insurance and crime legislation and a new world trade pact. And in fact, it faded last summer, when Mr. Clinton pushed a tough-minded budget and the North American trade agreement through a balky Congress.
Even Democrats concede, however, that such predictions rest on the rosy premise of an untroubled Presidency: that Mr. Clinton will carry off this summer's legislative coups and master a visibly more Republican Congress next year; that the economy will remain upright through the 1996 elections; that he will not become mired in any messy foreign crises.
Perhaps most unlikely of all, it also assumes that some aspect of Whitewater will not boil back into the news once or twice more in the next year, and that if it does, no one will care.
 
Dragging On
 That was plausible in early 1992, when the public image of the affair was that Mr. Clinton and his wife had made a bad investment with a man whose savings and loan later went belly up.
But since then, inquiries have raised questions about the flow of cash into and out of the venture, about ties to Arkansas politics and Mr. Clinton's campaign for governor, about the handling of a Federal inquiry into potential fraud at the savings and loan, and about whether the Clinton Administration tried to contain the inquiry.
For the Administration, the abiding worry of Whitewater may not be the unlikely prospect that it conceals some devastating misdeed -- although that surely would be damaging -- but the growing likelihood that it will take a long time for the public to conclude whether any such misdeeds exist. For the longer voters remain skeptical of Mr. Clinton, the less likely they are to credit him for genuine achievements, whether trade pacts or insurance laws or welfare overhaul.
In that respect, Whitewater is truly the political equivalent of a fever: the overheated brow does not kill by itself, but it does signal a more serious malady within.
The Republicans seem to know that, and they view Mr. Starr's elevation to independent counsel as an opportunity to exploit it. The Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, said in an interview on Friday that Mr. Starr's appointment puts Whitewater "right back on the front burner."
Mr. Dole suggested that he may seek broader Whitewater hearings, or even a select committee on the affair, now that the Justice Department's prosecutor, Robert B. Fiske Jr., is departing. Mr. Fiske agreed with Congressional Democrats' view that the legislative inquiry should be limited to accusations of impropriety that he had already investigated; whether Mr. Starr will seek similar limits is unclear.
 
No Welcome Mat
 Some of Mr. Clinton's supporters assert that the latest burst of bad publicity about the affair may actually help the President. They say it will weaken the influence of senior aides whose efforts to hush up the matter got Mr. Clinton into trouble to begin with; that it will finally grant a veteran, Lloyd Bentsen, sole control of the Treasury Department; that it gives the President's new chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, a golden opportunity to impose discipline on the hyperkinetic President and his staff.
But others worry that Democrats will continue to suffer until the issue is finally laid to rest.
"It's a long-term effect," said one Democratic member of the House, a solid Clinton supporter who asked not to be named. "It shows up when members start becoming uneasy with the President's campaign visits and other photo ops with him. Already, I've had a Congressional candidate come to see me, saying he's only worried about one thing in his race: is the President going to show up in my district?"

CORRECTION-DATE: August 14, 1994, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
A chart last Sunday summarizing the findings of Congressional hearings involving the Whitewater Development Company incorrectly reported a detail of discussions between the White House and the Treasury Department, which conducted an investigation of Whitewater. Jean Hanson, the Treasury Department's general counsel, did not rebuff a request from Deputy Secretary Roger C. Altman to brief White House aides about the investigation. Ms. Hanson did provide such a briefing; she said she did so at Mr. Altman's request, although he said he never asked her to.


GRAPHIC: AGENDA
Chart: "Whitewater: What Was Learned, and What Wasn't"
 For two weeks the Banking Committees of the House and Senate heard from a parade of current and former Administration officials concerning discussions between the White House and Treasury about the handling of the investigation into a savings and loan owned by the Clinton's Whitewater partner, in which the Clintons were mentioned as possible beneficiaries of illegal actions.
Little new ground was broken on the question that had prompted Congressional Democrats to reluctantly agree to the hearings -- whether any laws had been broken. But the hearings cast a sharp light on the inner workings of the White House and its anxieties as the Whitewater story returned to public view last fall.
The underlying questions of Whitewater -- whether the Clintons or their campaigns benefited from misappropriated funds from the savings and loan -- await later hearings.
 
MAIN TOPICS:
 
White House-Treasury contacts
Staff members of the Resolution Trust Corporation and the Treasury Department said they had warned against the sharing of confidential information about the Whitewater investigation with the White House as inappropriate. But the people involved in the contacts, like General Counsel Jean E. Hanson and Deputy Secretary Roger C. Altman, defended those contacts as legitimate, meant merely to prepare the Clintons' aides for possible press inquiries.
 There were, however, bitter contraditions in the testimony. Ms. Hanson said Mr. Altman had asked her to brief White House aides -- a request she rebuffed -- and that she had briefed Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen on the matter. Mr. Altman denied making such a request, and Mr. Bentsen denied having been briefed.
 
Roger Altman's recusal
Testimony revealed that Mr. Altman decided not to disqualify himself from R.T.C. matters that involved Madison after Bernard W. Nussbaum, then the White House Counsel, argued against it.(Mr. Altman did recuse himself a few weeks later.)
 A diary kept by the Treasury chief of staff, Joshua Steiner's diary described "intense pressure" from the White House -- although Mr. Steiner disavowed the accuracy of his musings. Mr. Altman, Mr. Nussbaum and the other White House aides all denied that pressure was applied, but Lloyd N. Cutler, who succeeded Mr. Nussbaum as White House Counsel, said Mr. Altman should have withdrawn immediately.
 In a stinging exchange, Senator Donald W. Riegle, Democrat of Michigan, chastised Mr. Nussbaum for "crossing the line."
 
Roger Altman's truthfulness
At a hearing in late February, Mr. Altman told senators there had been only one "substantive" contact about Madison between Treasury and White House officials. The Treasury's inspector general counted 40 contacts. Mr. Altman maintained that any omissions were inadvertant, but he was harshly criticized by members of both parties both for failing to testify fully.
 
LEAST ANSWERED QUESTION
Members of Congress devoted many futile hours to learning more about what role, if any, the Clintons themselves played in the discussions. They drew primarily on two entries in Mr. Altman's diary quoting Hillary Rodham Clinton's chief of staff, Margaret Williams. The entries quoted her as saying that Mrs. Clinton was "paralyzed" by Whitewater and suggested that the White House had tried to limit the scope of an indepedent prosecutor's inquiry. Ms. Williams denied she had ever said either.
 Mr. Steiner's diary related that "BC was furious" that Mr. Altman had recused himself; the supposed sources of that bad news, George Stephanopoulos and Harold Ickes, top White House aides, said any irritation was over the fact that Mr. Altman had told the editorial page editor of The New York Times first.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CO-OP CITY;
State Offers $3 Million in Loans to Help Stem Vacancy Tide

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

 BODY:
After years of watching moving vans going in a single direction -- away -- officials at Co-op City have begun to reverse that trend. And with a $3 million grant from the state, announced last week, they hope to attract more newcomers to the 15,372-unit, middle-income complex in the northeast Bronx.
The State of New York Mortgage Agency plans to earmark $3 million in mortgage loans for Co-op City, enabling buyers to take advantage of lower interest rates and longer amortization periods of 20 to 30 years, said John G. Martinez, the agency's president. The agency was asked for help, he said, after the vacancy rate rose last summer to an all-time high of about 1,500 apartments, about 10 percent of the total. 
 Chiefly by cutting the price per room from $2,800 to $1,750, officials of Co-op City have already halved the vacancy rate, to about 790 units. But the price of apartments still averages $10,000. The state mortgage loans are expected to fill 300 more apartments, said Steven Gold, director of residential sales at Riverbay Corporation, which runs the complex.
"That's going to help people who have the monthly income to pay for a three-bedroom apartment, but may not have the initial amount," he said. To qualify for the state loans, buyers in one- or two-person households must have an annual income under $44,100, and those in large households must have less than $50,710.
Residents of the apartments, which have from three to six and a half rooms, must also pay a monthly maintenance fee of about $140 a room, which covers most utilities and central air-conditioning.
Co-op City was the largest of the middle-income apartment complexes built under the Mitchell-Lama housing law in the 1960's and early 1970's. Across its 300 acres, residents can find shopping malls and community centers. Though originally its population was overwhelmingly white, with a large Jewish contingent, black and Hispanic residents today account for almost 60 percent. As in the past, Co-op City is drawing most of its new dwellers from other parts of the Bronx, Mr. Gold said.
The complex has experienced a high vacancy rate in recent years as many of its early residents, now elderly, have died or retired to Florida. The poor economy aggravated the problem, making it difficult for potential buyers to come up with the initial payment.
Subletting is illegal at Co-op City, but it happens. Residents who move sell their units back to the cooperative, and regain their initial payments after the apartments are resold. But with the high vacancy rates, resale has been slow, and some residents have simply sublet.
The vacancies, and the shrinking base of maintenance fees, also forced Riverbay to cut services last fall. About 100 janitors, gardeners and other employees have been laid off.
"We've stopped the hemorrhage of people moving out," said Iris Baez, president of the residents' board of directors. "People are happier that they are not alone on their floors anymore." N.O.

HEADLINE: Votech That Works

BYLINE: By John Holusha 

DATELINE: Willow Street, Pa

 BODY:
Every year, vocational education students at Lancaster County schools in Pennsylvania take classroom training in carpentry, plumbing, electrical wiring and masonry and build several houses priced in the $150,000 to $200,000 range.
 This showcases the students for local builders, who inspect the work and have usually hired all of them by the time classes end in June. But more importantly, the process of building the houses, under the watchful eye of an experienced builder, gives them a taste of what it is like to work for a living.
 The program is part of a broad effort, driven to a large degree by the economic and industrial needs of the nation, to strengthen the work force, improve the quality of vocational training in high schools, develop specialized training after high school for those who do not go on to college, and offer some hands-on training for engineering and science students who do go on.
As matters stand, a gap has widened between what traditional vocational training offers and what workers in high-technology industry need. "Students are often not prepared for work," said Richard C. Burley, director of the three-school vocational technical program in south-central Pennsylvania. "So we try to put students in the atmosphere they will face when they leave."
 One fact that makes the Lancaster program of double interest is that it guarantees its students jobs if they successfully complete their programs. "We've been guaranteeing jobs for five years, " Mr. Burley said. "We say that if a student comes to school 95 percent of the time, maintains a C average or better and graduates, we guarantee a job in their specialty or they can come to school for free until we find a job for them." He said a few had come back for a few months, but were eventually placed.
 
Graduates Often Lacked Basic Skills
 This intensely practical approach evolved after employers complained that high school graduates in America often lacked basic verbal and mathematics skills, let alone the specialized knowledge needed to operate complicated, computer-controlled machines and instruments. This has been an important theme for the Clinton Administration, which has proposed developing improved national standards for secondary education and launched a program to link up students with prospective employers before graduation.
 One reason for the Administration's interest is the growing international economic competition. "The United States is unique among industrial countries in that it does not have an organized postsecondary education system for the noncollege-bound," said Lester Thurow, a prominent economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Countries like Germany and Japan use their edcucation systems as competitive weapons, Mr. Thurow said, with the Japanese talking about training workers to 'add to effective battle strength."'
 Education specialist and business groups say there are jobs available for people without four-year college degrees, but increasingly they require specialized training. "I've got jobs I can't fill," Mr. Burley said. "They include diesel mechanics, computer repair, welders, machinists, electricians, masons and refrigeration."
 But even where the demand for technically trained people is apparent, vocational programs still struggle against the notion that a four-year college education is the only proper goal for students other than those with the most limited ability. Indeed, specialists in the vocational education field say that the practices of almost automatic promotion and grade inflation have left employers largely distrustful of the value of a high school diploma. As a result, after graduation many of the non-college-bound "Flounder in the job market for six or eight years while they mature," said Alfred Pautler, a professor of education at the State University of New York at Buffalo. "Finally at about the age of 26 to 28 they begin to get real jobs."
One of the goals of the Administration's education initiative is to help change employer attitudes toward the noncollege-bound by setting national standards for vocational education.
Part of the problem for the noncollege-bound, Professor Pautler said, is that most secondary schools send their graduates into the unknown without a mechanism to assist them in the next phase of their lives. "If a child goes from high school to college, that is a successful handoff," he said. "But others have nowhere to go, and the schools do not track them. Most districts do not know where their graduates go."
To help provide hands-on skills, the Lancaster vocational schools are also offering some courses for the college-bound. On certain mornings during the school year, pre-engineering students come to the vocational schools to experiment in a laboratory for computer-aided design. "These are kids who are going to four-year engineering schools," Mr. Burley said. "We bring them in here and familiarize them with top-of-the-line C.A.D. equipment." The students design simple products on the C.A.D. terminals and then transfer the designs to computer-controlled cutting machines. "They watch the part they designed get manufactured," Mr. Burley said. "That gets the good academic student interested." It is also useful for them, since even top-ranked engineering schools are requiring students to participate in projects where they design and build real products.
 
Increasing Complexity of Jobs
 A recent report by the American Society for Training and Development predicts that both industrial and service jobs will grow increasingly complex and technically demanding. The report, "Quality Education: School Reform for the New American Economy," said the result would be that people with postsecondary education would tend to supplant those with only high school diplomas.
Like many other vocational schools, Lancaster County's have relationships with community colleges in the area, where graduates can go on to get a two-year associate's degree, which is valuable in many technical fields. Today's work force is like an hourglass that is being pulled apart, Mr. Burley said. "It is being separated into the skilled and nonskilled. The skilled jobs pay salaries and benefits that can support a family. About all an unskilled person can do is work two jobs and go without benefits."
There are, of course, limits even to greatly improved vocational education. All workers are simply not trainable for work on the high-tech equipment of today's workplace. But with improved specialized training in high school and with the encouragement to continue on in some noncollege training afterward, many can move into the skilled world. They and the nation as a whole will be the beneficiaries.

Harnessing an Underground Source of Electricity

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: MOUNT HOPE, N.J.

 BODY:
PEOPLE have been poking holes in the ground here since 1710, mostly in search of the rich iron ore that lies under the gentle hills of New Jersey's Highlands area, about 35 miles west of New York City.
Indeed, local lore has it that when Washington visited the area during the Revolution, he urged the iron forgers to produce more weapons and provided Hessian soldiers captured in battle at Trenton as additional labor. 
 Now a pair of Scandinavian companies want to dig the biggest hole of all, and it has nothing to do with iron. The Kvaerner Group, a Norwegian industrial company with extensive experience in hydro-electric power, and Asea Brown Boveri, an electrical equipment maker with Swedish roots, are the principal owners of Mount Hope Hydro Inc., an American company that is seeking to build a pumped storage electric generating plant here, taking advantage of the area's industrial heritage, its proximity to New York and the hard, monolithic rock below the ground.
The leaders of the project say that technological advances in generating equipment, particularly the ability of generators to go from a standing start to full power in less than 15 seconds, compared with 3 to 5 minutes for standard combustion turbines, means the plant could provide reserves and balance for the electrical grids in the mid-Atlantic area.
"Most existing pumped storage units were designed in the 1950's and 1960's, and technology has moved on," said Frank S. Fisher, the president of Mount Hope Hydro. "There are machines now capable of working at much greater pressures and with a much faster response capability."
The Mount Hope project has been pending in one form or another since 1972, when it became clear that deep-pit mining was losing out to lower-cost open-pit mines.
Pumped storage plants are a means of dealing with the troublesome nature of electricity: it must be consumed as it is generated and is difficult to store. Because the demand for power varies during the day, a pumped storage plant uses cheap, nighttime electricity to pump water uphill and then lets it flow downhill, spinning generators to produce electricity during demand peaks.
Such a plant is a net consumer of electricity because not all the energy in the falling water is converted into electricity and power must be imported to pump it uphill. Studies of the Mount Hope project predict that for every 78 kilowatt hours of electricity produced, 100 kilowatt hours will have to be imported for pumping. A kilowatt will power a thousand 100-watt lightbulbs at once.
But utilities often strain to meet demand on summer afternoons, while big generators operate at inefficiently low levels at night; so the energy imbalance is considered tolerable.
THE problem with many pumped storage units is they often involve rivers or lakes, where big variations in the water levels interfere with recreation and can have a harmful impact on the environment. Consolidated Edison struggled for 17 years to build a pumped storage plant on the Hudson River at Storm King Mountain in Cornwall, N.Y., before bowing to public and government resistance in 1980.
Mount Hope is designed to overcome environmental and asthetic objections by being situated almost entirely underground. When it is filled, it will be a closed-loop system, with the same water used over and over, so there should be no impact on surface waterways.
Mount Hope Hydro has a license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Agency to build the plant, which will cost about $2 billion. But it still lacks an important element for any industrial undertaking: customers. No electric utility has signed up to buy power from the project, though several are studying it.
And the economics have been questioned by Jeffrey Williams, strategist with the PJM Interconnect Association, the regional pool that coordinates power generation for eight utilities in the mid-Atlantic area. "Pumped storage shifts costs from day to night," he said. "But right now, the difference in cost between night and day are not that great."
Mr. Fisher of Mount Hope Hydro said talks were under way with several potential power users as well as utilities and that some announcements might be made soon. He must begin construction by August 1996, after which the Federal permit will expire.
The original design incorporated the 2,400-foot-deep main shaft of the New Leonard iron mine, abandoned in 1979, as access for power cables. But a revision was forced by environmental and community objections to another part of the plan: use of the artificial Mount Hope Lake as the upper reservoir. The current design calls for the construction of a 55-acre, 1.6 billion-gallon reservoir at a nearby rock quarry. It would be connected to underground generating equipment through a 2,800-foot vertical shaft -- the equivalent of two and a quarter Empire State buildings stacked on top of each other.
The half-mile plunge would give the water enough energy to drive six turbines and generators putting out at maximum of 2,000 megawatts -- the equivalent of nuclear power plant. Because the system would be closed, it could be turned on and off as needed, a luxury not enjoyed by most pumped storage units.
THE lower reservoir would be a series of tunnels in the dense granite rock at the 2,500-foot level that would have the same capacity as the upper reservoir. The turbines and generators would be reversible, acting as both motors and pumps.
The developers said the location close to New York gave them an opportunity to sell power in an area with relatively high rates. And they said Mount Hope's long industrial history was essential to overcoming the local objections that had made it difficult to find sites for power plants.
The water in the upper reservoir could run the plant at full power for about five hours, but Mr. Fisher doubted it would be run at full power steadily. A more efficient way would be to operate intermittently, he said. That way, the plant would be available to provide power quickly if a conventional plant shut down.
But the hydro-electric plant could also increase the operating efficiency of utilities by feeding power into grids until demand increased enough to justify starting a conventional plant. Similarly, as demand declined, Mount Hope could supply electricity so that generating plants did not have to operate at inefficiently low levels.

HEADLINE: Head Start Expanding Despite Problems

BYLINE: By PHILLIP LUTZ 

 BODY:
HEAD START, the Federal program for preschoolers that began in the 1960's, is expanding. Despite problems nationally and on Long Island, Head Start, unlike many other Great Society programs, is serving growing numbers of people with a greater variety of services.
This summer plans are moving forward for continuing expansion. 
 But the demand for services is so strong that nearly half the children who qualify will not find places in the program in the fall, and many of those who do will attend sessions in crowded, rundown buildings.
For those children, many of whom already suffer from drugs, disease and homelessness, the benefits of Head Start could be blunted, experts in the field say.
"Head Start might be less effective than in the 1960's, because the problems are more severe," said Linda Devin-Sheehan, executive director of L.I. Head Start Child Development Services, the largest operator of Head Start programs on the Island. "Obviously there's only so much we can do, and we don't do as much as needs to be done. But we do have a tremendous impact."
The number of children in the four federally designated Head Start agencies on the Island increased 11 percent over the last two years, to more than 2,100, according to officials in the Manhattan office of the Administration for Children and Families, the bureau of the Department of Health and Human Services that oversees the programs in New York and New Jersey and on Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
The four agencies' combined operating budgets from the Health and Human Services Department increased 23 percent, to a total of more than $12 million in the 1994 fiscal year, the officials said.
The increases locally mirrored those of the program nationally. Over the last two years Head Start's budget increased nearly 20 percent, to $3.3 billion in the 1994 fiscal year. In that period, the number of children enrolled increased, to 750,000 from 621,000.
In May, President Clinton signed legislation reauthorizing Head Start for the next four years. His Head Start budget proposal for the 1995 fiscal year is $4 billion, also a 20 percent increase. The number of participants would grow, to 840,000 nationally, an increase that would be reflected on the Island, officials said.
At the two major agencies in Nassau and Suffolk Counties the number of classrooms and employees have each expanded over the last two years, to a total of 92 and 358, respectively, officials said. Those figures would increase under Mr. Clinton's proposals, as well. The program is also growing in diversity. Head Start sites, where children receive early education, social skills and improved nutrition, are increasingly being used to deliver medical services. Under a $151,000 grant from the State Health Department up to 1,300 children in Suffolk this year will receive screenings, immunizations and other services, as well as referrals to the University Medical Center at Stony Brook.
The services will be provided or arranged by a diagnostic and treatment center, Just Kids of Middle Island, which plans to modify Head Start centers, hire two nurse-practitioners and train staff members.
Children in Head Start generally come from households with incomes below the poverty line, which is $14,800 for a family of four.
The parents of Head Start children will begin to receive medical services at program sites under an agreement between Just Kids and the Suffolk Health Services Department, said Dr. Virginia M. Barry, a consultant to Just Kids.
Nassau Head Start is expected to begin a program offering mental-health services with the North Shore Child and Family Guidance Center in Roslyn Heights, said Jean Davis, deputy director of Head Start under the Nassau Economic Opportunity Commission.
Educational services are also scheduled to expand in the fall under a program placing disabled and nondisabled children in the classroom. About 12 percent of the Head Start enrollment on the Island is classified as disabled.
Under the program, in which an affiliated preschool of Just Kids trains teachers, the number of sites with formally integrated classrooms, which increased from three to five in the last two years, is scheduled to grow to seven next month.
Head Start is also planning to provide services at a drug-treatment center for women and children that Apple, the largest drug-treatment operator on the Island, is developing in Lake Ronkonkoma.
That would be one of the first ventures into caring for infants and toddlers. About 3 percent of the budget is being devoted to the youngest children. Most programs now serve children from 3 to 5.
The growth of Head Start is partly a response to increased demands to help the children of the working poor and the influx of Haitian and Hispanic immigrants, Ms. Davis said.
Perceptions that the program is successful have generated many enrollment applications, said Junius Scott, director of program coordination and planning for the Children and Families Administration in Manhattan.
In Suffolk the program operates from September through the end of June, with some sessions split because of overcrowding. But in Nassau the program operates full-day sessions from September through early August.
Long waiting lists have become common, spurring a difficult search for new locations. "Our biggest problem is finding space," Ms. Davis said.
In Nassau the program administered by the Economic Opportunity Commission supervises nine sites that delegated agencies operate. Another agency, the Glen Cove Child Day Care Center, operates a site under a separate Federal grant.
In the last four years Nassau has added classrooms in Roosevelt and Hempstead, where the waiting list of 180 is twice the length of the enrollment list, Ms. Davis said. Waiting lists on the Island average about 40 a site, officials said.
By next month Head Start hopes to end talks for a site in Elmont, where it would add three classrooms for 45 youngsters, Ms. Davis said.
In Suffolk, L.I. Head Start operates all 14 of its sites. Another agency, Children's Community Head Start, operates two sites under a separate Federal grant.
Workers from a contractor in Port Jefferson, Construction Consultants/ L.I., have been assembling modular units for a six-room center in Brentwood. The center, being built on land on Wicks Road donated by the school district, will be a definite improvement over the last three centers that the program has had, officials said.
Between April and the end of the school year in June the 122 children in the program occupied a Hispanic social club to which they moved after encountering mice in a church-owned building that had been their home. Before that the Brentwood children were bused to Central Islip, where they shared space with children in the program there.
At least five programs in Suffolk have to move because of deteriorating conditions like leaky roofs, crowded basements and the sharing of kitchens and bathrooms with homeless adults, Ms. Devin-Sheehan said.
She declined to specify which sites had problems, but Roberta Turner, a member of the Parents Policy Council, which represents parents and guardians in negotiations, said the centers in Patchogue and Bay Shore were too small.
Ms. Devin-Sheehan said that she wanted to move the children in two years, but that could depend on obtaining a long-term lease or a donation of space. "We need an angel," she said.
The buildings in Nassau also suffer from problems like leaky roofs, broken windows and lack of parking, Ms. Davis said. "Maintenance and upkeep of a facility is difficult," she added.
Despite the conditions, the expansion of services represents a rebound from labor and financial problems in September 1990 that delayed the opening in Suffolk.
Federal officials faulted the Suffolk program then for poor record keeping, a lack of bidding documents to buy carpeting and a platform for the Brentwood center and improper documentation of travel expenses. After a review the Federal officials ordered Suffolk Head Start to resolve the problems, with assistance from the Health and Human Services Department, Mr. Scott said. There was no reason to take legal action, he added.
With the corrections in force and the program under new leadership -- Ms. Devin-Sheehan has been in her post since May 1993 -- the problems have been resolved, Mr. Scott said.
The agency was also faulted in 1990 for holding back nearly $40,000 of money from the State Social Services Department that was supposed to increase the salaries of teachers and other workers. Twenty percent of local Head Start financing has to come from sources other than the Federal Government.
"During that period there was some tension," said Ragland George, a spokesman for District Council 1707 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents the Head Start workers. "Some money was held because they were in the trauma of negotiating."
"People were trying to unionize," Mr. Scott said. "Conflict arose."
After the delay in opening the program workers obtained a union contract, and the agency gave them lump-sum payments of $312 to $632 an employee. The situation is stable, Mr. George added.
Although Suffolk workers are now unionized, those in Nassau are not. "We've been able not to get involved in that," Ms. Davis said. Organizers "were at our door a couple of years ago, but it does not work well in our kind of environment."
The Health and Human Services Department does not favor or oppose unionization, Mr. Scott said.
Programs have run into other problems like charges of child abuse and mismanagement. In January 1993 a program in Farmingdale was criticized for poor management. The local director was disorganized, Ms. Davis said, and was replaced. The problem has been resolved, Mr. Scott said.
But staffing remains a problem. The salaries are low, and turnover is high. Although pay has increased, teachers in the Nassau program earn $18,000 a year, Ms. Davis said. Those in Suffolk earn $16,000, according to Ms. Devin-Sheehan.
Most of nearly $1 million in supplemental Federal grants that might be available for the four agencies this year would go to increase the salaries in an attempt to retain the best workers, officials said.
Under the reauthorization bill local programs are under pressure to maintain or improve the quality of their staffs. By Sept. 30, 1996, all classroom teachers have to have a Child Development Associate credential or another appropriate qualification.
With comprehensive training in place, Ms. Devin-Sheehan said, all the teachers in L.I. Head Start have that credential. More than half in the Nassau Economic Opportunity Commission programs have it, too, Ms. Davis said.
To improve efficiency and workers' skills Head Start has introduced technology like fully computerizing the Suffolk program. Four of the nine Nassau sites are also computerized.
But even as the program makes strides, experts say, the condition of the average enrollee is poorer.
"Today," said a report released in December by a advisory committee named by the Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Donna E. Shalala, "the needs of families and children who live in poverty are more complicated and urgent than ever before -- from children who have lived with violence and substance abuse to families with interrelated problems of homelessness, lack of education and unemployment."
"We've seen a decline in the condition of the kids," said Ms. Devin-Sheehan, who was the principal planner for youth services in Suffolk before moving to Head Start. "The recession has completely eroded social services. Nonprofit child-care agencies have suffered tremendously in the last five years."
"It increases the work Head Start has to do," Ms. Davis said. "Kids are coming in frightened and hungry."
That is one reason that some critics question the effectiveness of certain elements of the program and whether the growth should be limited until quality standards are more firmly in place.
Some studies of Head Start show that although children appear to make immediate intellectual gains, the effects fade quickly, and they do not score consistently better on intelligence tests than children from similarly disadvantaged backgrounds who have not been in Head Start.
Other studies show that Head Start children are less likely to be placed in special classes or to be classified as disabled than children with similar backgrounds who have not been in the program.
Few long-term studies of Head Start children have been conducted. But one widely known study, at the Perry Preschool Project in Ypslanti, Mich., showed that 20 years after leaving Head Start the children, now young adults, were more likely to have finished high school, held a job and avoided teen-age pregnancy and troubles with law enforcement.
That result is reflected in the history of Wendy Oyebode, 26, of Hempstead. Ms. Oyebode, who is married, said that when she participated in Freeport Head Start more than 20 years ago she had had a variety of experiences that she might not have had without the program, living with her aunt on very little money.
She credits good work habits in part to her early exposure to teaching materials at Head Start. While many people of her age and socioeconomic status became victims of social problems, Ms. Oyebode graduated from Rutgers University, entered a master's program at Dowling College and is looking forward to a career in special education.
"I probably wouldn't have done as well," she said.

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
Betting on the Sympathy Vote

BYLINE: By Andrea Adelson 

 BODY:
RANDALL D. HUBBARD, a 30-year horse breeder and chairman of Hollywood Park Inc., is making some big bets these days.
In the last year, Mr. Hubbard has begun to assemble a national race track empire, acquiring tracks in states where he hopes casino-style gambling will be legalized. His ambitious strategy is to replicate at those tracks the sort of entertainment complex that is taking shape alongside Hollywood Park's track in Inglewood, Calif., where a cavernous card parlor opened last month. 
 For investors in Hollywood Park, clearly horses are only part of a broader play on the fortunes of the gambling economy, which is growing explosively. Analysts say Mr. Hubbard is adapting to today's gambling environment by building alliances between tracks and other types of gambling, a strategy they say will make Hollywood Park's stock outperform the industry.
While Mr. Hubbard's strategy does play well on some parts of Wall Street, investors would do well to gauge political sentiment in Kansas, California and Arizona before making their own bets. Hollywood Park now has track interests in those states. But regulators say there is little chance casino-style gambling there will expand outside tribal lands. And without the casinos at the track, where bettors could play the horses or the slot machines, Mr. Hubbard's idea is in trouble.
"There are big problems in all three states," said I. Nelson Rose, a gambling law expert and professor at the Whittier Law School in Los Angeles. "I would not put my money on that."
Hollywood Park had a $2.6 million loss in the quarter ended March 31. Last year, revenue was $63 million, a 5.4 percent decline from the comparable period a year ago.
Despite these problems, Hollywood's stock has held up, especially compared to other gambling shares, which have dropped sharply since Spring.
The company's stock closed Friday at $22.75 up 1/8. That is well below its high of $35 last September. But it is still over its recent low of $15.75. At the same time, the CBOE Gaming Index has given back all its gains of the last year and a half. The sell-off began in March after President Clinton suggested a casino revenue tax and Missouri voters said no to slot machines.
The importance of the political outlook for Hollywood Park is seen in its earnings forecasts. Jason N. Ader, Smith Barney Shearson's gaming analyst, predicted earnings will jump 2.5 times to $1.20 a share next year, up from 48 cents in 1994.
But he concedes that "the company's earnings growth is dependent on uncertain legislation and it is possible that earnings could grow at a meaningfully slower pace."
Mr. Hubbard is going for the sympathy vote. His bet is that lawmakers will help track owners who have been hurt by the new gambling parlors. But they may not be sympathetic to an outsider who bought race tracks with his eyes wide open, knowing that revenues were in danger.
Overall wagering increased last year by 17 percent to $394 billion and poured $34.7 billion into the coffers of gaming companies, according to Gaming & Wagering Business magazine. But horse racing revenue declined. States that permit Indian casinos and riverboat gambling as a fiscal panacea are also seeing lottery and racing revenue decline as bettors ante up elsewhere. To keep tracks from closing, some states have helped out by allowing slot machines at the tracks.
And that is Mr. Hubbard's aim. In a $20 million deal mostly involving stock, Hollywood Park in March acquired The Woodlands, a dog and horse track in Kansas City, Kan., across the river from Missouri's floating casinos. Shareholder approval is expected this month for the company's $34 million stock acquisition of Turf Paradise, a race track in Arizona, where Indian gaming has blossomed on 10 reservations.
"I think it's a safe bet, very shrewd," said Thomas M. Ryan of Ladenburg, Thalman.
State gaming officials think otherwise. In Kansas, where lawmakers have disapproved of Indian gambling, a bill to permit casino gambling beside tracks died for lack of support during the recent session.
In Arizona, as gambling compacts were being signed with Indian tribes in 1991, four tracks, including Turf Paradise, pleaded for slot machines to offset expected losses. "It didn't go anywhere," said Gary C. Fitzsimmons, assistant to the director of the state Department of Racing. Even the closure of a track in Yuma has not softened Gov. Fife Symington's opposition to non-reservation gambling.
But if the politicians go against gambling in Arizona and Kansas, Mr. Hubbard may get a small return on his bet in California. While there is not a whisper about legalizing casinos in California, there is a proposal for a state gambling commission and a chance for a law that would allow Mr. Hubbard to reap the full profits from the card parlor opened last month at Hollywood Park.
That proposal is supported by Mr. Hubbard, who made more than $10,000 in contributions to state politicians in 1992. The bill would also revise current laws to permit the licensing of public companies for card clubs. That change would open the door to Las Vegas operators, Mr. Ryan said, and make Hollywood Park a takeover candidate.
Unless state laws are changed, Hollywood Park will be forced to continue to license its $20 million, 140 table card club through a third-party, which means Mr. Hubbard must settle for a flat lease fee and only a portion of the $25 million in projected annual operating profits. Clubs differ from casinos in that players bet against each other, rather than the house, and pay a fee per hand.
"I thought it was a terrific idea," said Michael Steiniger, one of 12,000 poker players who came to the club's opening. "Gamblers never get enough."
That may be so. But if Hollywood Park doesn't have better luck in Arizona and Kansas, what is good for the gambler may not be so good for the investor.

HEADLINE: Who Pays the Price Of a Nuclear Plant?

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
IF you owned a 1989 Buick Century and your tax bill went up because of a revaluation, you might write the check and not give it a second thought. But suppose you also owned a 1993 Century in another town nearby, and your taxes were less than one-third as much?
That's the situation facing Northeast Utilities with its Connecticut Yankee nuclear plant in Haddam. In a 1991 revaluation in which the company expected to see its assessment drop considerably, it saw it increase sharply instead. The property tax dispute, the largest in Connecticut history, is being now played out in court. Haddam says an appraisal by Dean & Associates, an engineering consulting company in McMurray, Pa., determined the nuclear plant, which cost $109 million to build in 1969, is worth about $840 million today. 
 Northeast has introduced as evidence in its behalf appraisals from two assessors that it hired: $219.4 million and $230 million.
The utility company's supervisor for property taxes, Richard S. Zajack, said an appraisal is supposed to reflect fair market value, and that anyone buying the plant would have to recover the purchase price plus $339 million in decommissioning costs for the remaining 13 years that the plant is able to be operated under its current license. "Any reasonable buyer would consider that up front, and walk away from it," Mr. Zajack said.
Marjorie W. Debold, whose election as First Selectman last year came after the dispute started, said the town stands by its appraisal, and has hired the Hartford law firm of Robinson & Cole to defend it in court.
"The town feels that it's acted in good faith and has done what was appropriate," Ms. Debold said. "The town based its findings on the information available to it."
Northeast contends the suit will have dire consequences whichever way it turns out. If Northeast wins, Haddam will be in a position where it will have to pay back millions of dollars in overbilled taxes, perhaps more than $20 million, which would be devastating for a small town. "Do they go issue bonds? Go seek some kind of legislative relief? Maybe they raise taxes?" pondered Robert A. Bersak, an assistant general counsel for Northeast. "I suppose they could even consider bankruptcy, although the state has been opposed to allowing towns to go that route."
"Certainly if I was a property owner in Haddam, I'd be concerned," Mr. Bersak said. "They'd go from having one of the three lowest tax rates in the state to one of the highest, virtually overnight."
If Haddam wins, Northeast officials say, it would mean dramatically higher tax bills for the utility's property elsewhere, as towns where 100 other generating plants are situated appraise them under the new criteria.
"We're in 168 of the state's 169 towns, and you can rest assured every one of them would be lining up already if this decision wasn't challenged," said Northeast's manager of plant accounting, David G. Lenihan. And, he said, since the law allows Northeast to pass the property taxes on to its customers via higher rates, it would mean ratepayers in all those other towns would be subsidizing taxpayers in Haddam if the tax is too high.
"Probably what they were told by Dean was that somewhere down the road we'd settle, we'd split the difference and they'd be ahead of the game," Mr. Lenihan said. "But we can't."
A spokesman for Northeast, Anthony J. Castagno, said Haddam's appraisal is particularly troubling because it is based in part on the value of modern nuclear plants, instead of 25-year-old technology.
"This argument could be used to increase the assessment on any industrial facility," Mr. Castagno said. "If it were to prevail in Haddam, every town around the state would be doing a revaluation."
"The difference is, if they did this to an industrial taxpayer, the industrial taxpayer would move out of state," Mr. Castagno said. "Obviously, we can't do that with a nuclear plant."
Mr. Zajack noted that high utility rates also hurt all businesses.
"If we can't keep our rates low we're not going to attract business to Connecticut," Mr. Zajack said. "In fact, if the rates go up we're going to drive business out of state."
Lawyers for both sides in the case are analyzing the two new appraisals done for Northeast, and will continue taking depositions until early next year. Mr. Bersak said he expected it could be 1996 or 1997 before a decision is rendered.
Connecticut Yankee has been the mainstay of the Haddam tax base since it began generating electricity on Jan. 1, 1968. In fact, the town recently formed an economic development commission to develop other industry in town to help the town though 2007, the year the plant is scheduled to be shut down, although Ms. Debold acknowledges, "It is going to be difficult to find anything to take its place."
Until the end of 1991 the plant accounted for 51 percent of the value of all taxable property in town, but because it is getting old its value was expected to drop. Instead, the value increased, to 57 percent of the taxable property in town, because of the appraisal method used by Dean & Associates.
Stephen R. Dean, managing principal of Dean & Associates, declined to comment while the assessment is in litigation, but he outlined his appraisal methods in an article he wrote with Robert S. Wilson, a lawyer for Dean & Associates, published in the September-October 1993 issue of Assessment Digest, the professional journal of the International Association of Assessing Officers.
The article said 30 percent of the appraisal was based on what it would cost to build a similar plant today, which yielded an appraisal of $987.5 million. Half the new appraisal was based on what the firm estimated the plant would earn during its remaining life, which yielded a value of $749 million, and the remainder of the assessment was based on the sale of shares in other nuclear plants, which yielded a value of $830 million.
The blended value, therefore, is $840 million, according to the Dean assessment. In the Assessment Digest, they said they rejected the company's offer to use the plant's net book value, which is used by most towns and is the value regulators use to set the company's electric rates.
"In our opinion, the utility's net book value method is improper because Connecticut law states all property is to be assessed at fair market value, and industrial property is sold every week at more than net book value," they wrote.
But Mr. Castagno said Dean's appraisal was faulty in other respects. For instance, he said, you can't set a nuclear plant's value based on what it would bring on the open market, because no one would be interested in buying it.
"Nowadays there's such a surplus of electricity I don't know of any utility that's building a plant, or in the market for a plant," Mr. Castagno said. "And even without that excess, if we were to build another plant it's highly unlikely that it would be a nuclear plant," because of the regulation, the risk and the cost.
Mr. Bersak said Northeast was going to challenge Dean's credentials in court. The Pennsylvania company had to obtain a temporary appraisal certificate in Connecticut, had never handled a nuclear plant appraisal before Haddam, and was not even familiar with some of the designations for professional appraisers, he said.
Mr. Bersak noted that the appraisers hired by Northeast -- AUS Consultants and Stone & Webster, which builds nuclear plants -- have national reputations in the utility appraisal field, and that their valuations came in within about 5 percent of each other. "It gives you some confidence that the value is meaningful," he said.
Mr. Bersak said the Ocean State Power Company in Rhode Island recently built a gas-powered plant that generates more than 500 megawatts, similar to Connecticut Yankee's 591 megawatts. It cost $406.5 million.
Also by comparison, the town of Waterford has appraised Northeast's Millstone 1 nuclear plant for $250 million, and Millstone 2 for $450 million. Those plants are both newer, and considerably larger, than Connecticut Yankee, but their combined appraisal is less than what Haddam has said Connecticut Yankee is worth.
"Something's wrong with this picture," Mr. Bersak said. "Primarily, it's a matter of economics. Towns are trying to find revenues at a time when growth has stopped, and we're an attractive target."
At Northeast, company officials are worried about the public image the company will project if it wins the case, and is forced to collect millions of dollars back from Haddam. But he said Northeast must also look out for its customers, who pay any extra taxes in the form of higher rates.
"We've always worked with every town we've done business in," Mr. Bersak said. "We've attempted to do that in Haddam. But they didn't listen. It's not us putting them in this position, it's them putting them in this position."

HEADLINE: The Boom in M.R.I.'s: Concerns Grow on Costs and Overuse

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW 

 BODY:
THE growth of magnetic-resonance imaging as a diagnostic tool is generating intense competition for patients, as well as concern about overuse.
M.R.I. makes images of any soft tissue in the body. Unlike conventional X-rays or CAT scans, M.R.I. does not use ionizing radiation. Instead, magnetic fields and computers provide the images, clear and precise pictures of specific areas. Bones stop X-rays, but are transparent in magnetic imaging, making it easier to examine the brain and spinal cord. 
 Magnetic imaging has been used in the United States for a decade. Its power as a diagnostic tool has led to increases in referrals for the procedure by neurologists, neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons.
Medical authorities generally say noninvasive and painless magnetic imaging is safe. But it is an expensive outpatient diagnostic procedure. The cost of a full-body system ranges from $1.2 million to $2.5 million. The average charge for a session of 30 to 45 minutes is $1,000, including a radiologist's interpretation.
Many insurers require prior approvals for magnetic images.
Critics contend that less expensive tests can help obtain similar results.
At the Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park the imaging machine has been operating at its full capacity of 3,500 procedures a year since the hospital acquired it in 1984.
North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset gave 6,600 patients magnetic images on its two machines last year. In the first six months of this year it administered 4,000.
At Stony Brook University Hospital, 4,963 magnetic images were administered in the year ending June 30, an increase of 1,000 over the previous year.
 
Declines in Other Procedures
 Michael Cortegiano, administrative officer of the radiology department at the Stony Brook Medical School, said many standard radiographic procedures had declined in the last few years coupled with the growing use of M.R.I.'s. "For a look at the abdomen," Mr. Cortegiano said, "M.R.I. has replaced the barium enema, because it gives more information. But is it necessary? Can we get the same results with a cheaper exam? The driving factor here is cost."
At Stony Brook Hospital, Mr. Cortegiano said, guidelines indicate to referring physicians the most appropriate examinations for different sets of symptoms. For some symptoms, he added, it may be better to order an ultrasound examination, which is usually far less costly than a magnetic image.
Dr. David Katz, a radiologist at Advanced Medical Imaging of Long Island, a radiology and imaging center in Great Neck, said the public might often be misled about magnetic images. It is not a screening procedure like mammography or a chest X-ray, Dr. Katz said. Its intended use is solely for a clinical indication of a specific problem that has not been resolved by X-rays or basic diagnostic tests like a physical or laboratory examination.
"As an example, one should not use M.R.I. to locate kidney stones," Dr. Katz said. "This would be a tremendous waste of health-care dollars, in that almost 95 percent of kidney stones can be easily located with X-ray or low-cost ultrasound units. Similarly, while M.R.I. breast imaging is being developed, it is still limited in its effectiveness and cannot yet replace mammography as our best screening test for breast cancer."
A neurosurgeon with Long Island Neurological Associates in New Hyde Park, Dr. Joseph Epstein, said overuse of magnetic imaging was an example of protective medicine, in which physicians try to protect themselves against claims of malpractice.
"If they miss something in a diagnosis they're hit with a malpractice suit," Dr. Epstein said. "Sometimes with an M.R.I. you do pick up something that you never suspected. The question is, 'Does it justify the overuse of the procedure for fear of missing something?'
"As long as we're forced to practice defensive medicine you'll continue to see the overuse of diagnostic studies. It's noninvasive. All it is is money. The abuse of M.R.I. overuse is most evident when doctors prescribe an M.R.I. before even seeing a patient in order to save the time of an extra office visit."
In addition to concerns about overuse, Dr. Epstein said, new research indicates a problem with overinterpretation of images, often erroneously. An M.R.I. can show changes that can stem from the normal aging process or arthritic deformities, he said, adding: "Sometimes this is interpreted as pathology to be operated on or treated vigorously, when it's actually a normal variance. We have to remember that you don't treat the test.You treat the patient's symptoms."
A neurologist in Great Neck, Dr. Dwight Rosenstein, said he had not seen overinterpretation as a problem. "We're very cautious about surgery," Dr. Rosenstein said. "Along with an M.R.I., we always examine the patient and discuss the symptoms. All of the pieces of the puzzle must fit together before there's any surgery."
Critics also point to partnership arrangements, under which referring physicians used to have ownership interest in imaging centers and made profits from referring patients to them. New Federal and state laws prohibit such contracts.
The chief of radiology at North Shore, Dr. Roger A. Hyman, acknowledged that there had been some abuses in imaging procedures, but said that "should not negate the powerful tool we have to diagnose human disease."
"The big picture," Dr. Hyman said, "is that M.R.I. is probably the most important breakthrough in the history of medicine since 1895, when X-ray was first discovered. The phenomenal technology has changed the way we image the face of the human body. If we overreact to the abuses and the high costs, it will bring us back to the Middle Ages, when costs were low and everybody died."
As imaging technology has improved, its uses have expanded. The comptroller of East River Medical Imaging Associates in New York City, John Walczuk, said aside from the primary imaging of the brain and spinal cord, followed by joints, muscles, bones, chest, abdomen and pelvis, new areas include checking blood vessels in the neck and head, arteries in the lower extremities and detecting leaks from breast implants.
Most technology is expensive at first and then comes down in price, said Dr. Lawrence Minkoff, co-founder and chairman of Magna-Lab Inc. of Hicksville, a manufacturer of magnetic imagers. Magna-Lab has produced a lower-cost compact magnetic scanner for extremities like hands, elbows, knees and feet that is awaiting approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
Dr. Minkoff said the smaller unit would allow doctors to produce a greater variety of images of extremities, and possibly heads, at one-half to one-third the cost of whole body scanners.
"Arguments that M.R.I. is overused is not a matter of technology, but one of economics," he said. "In my opinion M.R.I. is not overused, but underutilized. We're now looking at less expensive ways to produce equipment that can do accurate medical diagnoses without invasive surgery."
Competition is growing among imaging centers.
There are basically two types of full-body scanners. In an "open" machine a patient is positioned in a partly enclosed rectangular or oval structure that contains a low- strength magnet. In a conventional, or "closed," machine, a patient is placed in a more tunnel-like enclosure with a much more powerful magnet.
Centers with open machines appeal to patient comfort, because the machines have more space and are less claustrophobic.
Dr. Epstein said 20 percent of his patients could not tolerate a closed machine. "While the magnet is weaker in an open M.R.I.," he said, "for these patients it's a better alternative, because in a closed tunnel they're jumping out of their skin. And because they're moving, the reading is useless."
Dr. Rosenstein said up to half of his patients were claustrophobic and could not tolerate a closed machine. "For much of what we need to see," he said, "open M.R.I. is O.K. But it is not as accurate for fine detail."
Carlos Rivera, manager of M.R.I. of Smithtown, one of 13 sites affiliated with Advanced Diagnostic Imaging of Suffolk County, said open machines were a marketing scheme catering to fears of people who might be claustrophobic. Open machines, he added, do not have the strength to give the clearest pictures with the best contrast. They often take 5 to 15 times as long as conventional machines.
"Unfortunately," Mr. Rivera said. "we end up repeating many M.R.I.'s from patients who go for open M.R.I.'s first and then have to have them redone."
There are differences between centers in hospitals and private offices, Dr. Peter Herman, chairman of radiology at Long Island Jewish, said, adding: "Large teaching hospitals tend to have more subspecialists. But choosing an imaging center is like choosing your internist. You have to go by reputation and recommendation."
No accreditations cover magnetic imaging. The lone board- certified subspecialty of radiology is mammography. Dr. Hyman said the American College of Radiology was studying an accreditation process for magnetic imaging.
Dr. Katz said many radiologists had limited training in magnetic imaging, because the procedure is relatively new.
"An educated consumer is a must," he said. "It's critical to get imaging done by a board-certified radiologist who has been specially trained in M.R.I., who is there not only to oversee the testing procedure and interpret the M.R.I. results, but also to greet the patient, examine him, take a brief medical history and is present during the performance of the M.R.I. itself, so that if additional views are necessary they can be performed on the spot, saving the patient time, money and stress."

HEADLINE: Seeking Protection For Wetland Areas

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: CHAPPAQUA

 BODY:
CONCERN about proposed weakening of Federal protection of national wetlands with the 1972 Clean Water Act scheduled for re-authorization in Congress last month, as well as threats to the county's wetlands from potential developments, prompted 40 environmentalists to attend a recent meeting at the Chappaqua Public Library to learn more about the role of wetlands in maintaining water quality.
"Wetlands issues are really happening in Westchester now," said David Osterman, co-chairman of Wetlands Watch, a committee of the Lower Hudson Group of the Sierra Club, which sponsored the Chappaqua lecture. "Some wetlands that shouldn't be developed are, like the Somers Golf Course, which is at the headwaters of the Plum Brook River and the Muscoot River. 
 "One of the ideas behind this meeting is to get out the message that it's important for local villages to get involved in wetlands regulation," Mr. Osterman added. "The only control the county has over the wetlands is persuading local town boards to have their own wetlands protection."
 
South County Losses
 Because the county can play only an advisory role in protecting wetlands, community protections can be especially important.
"The issue of wetlands and water quality is the vehicle by which local governments can recognize the need to protect wetlands," said Laura Tessier, director of environmental planning for the County Environmental Management Council, based in White Plains, who was the speaker at this meeting. "All wetlands are not created equal, but we tend to regulate them as if they were exactly alike."
Wetlands, which are defined as swamps, marshes, bogs or similar areas, play a significant role in purifying water by filtering pollutants before they reach the reservoir watersheds. Wetlands can also help reduce floods by storing water. According to the Wetlands Watch committee, 300,000 acres of wetlands are destroyed yearly in the United States. In Westchester, 25,000 acres are classified as wetlands. Total acreage in the county is 288,000.
"South county losses have been much greater then the north county," Ms. Tessier said. "Development has a negative impact on wetlands. Westchester has lost a significant number of amphibians and reptiles as an indirect impact of storm-water systems. They are the 'canary of the coal mines' for wetlands systems because these creatures are extremely sensitive to nonpoint-source pollution. The south county streams are very degraded, but our trends countywide show degradation of the wetlands."
 
Protecting by Deed or Covenant
 As a result of development, including the increase in automobile exhaust, Ms. Tessier said, the water quality in the Long Island Sound has diminished considerably from the increased presence of nitrogen in its waters. Other problems the county's wetlands face include economic pressures to develop around them, the erosion to wetlands in Rye along Long Island Sound, fertilizer and other chemical runoff from area golf courses and other sites and the lack of consistent policy on protecting remaining wetlands.
"There are significant wetland protection issues in Westchester County," Ms. Tessier said. "There's a tendency to develop in and around wetlands. Even when setbacks of 100 feet are required, over time an owner may want a deck or a swimming pool, and the buffer between the property and the wetland area is lost. There isn't any consistency of regulations. When local planning boards change, the philosophy toward protection of wetlands may change. It's very frustrating."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE HOUSE;
Health Care Issue Raises Anxiety In Most Anxious Month for House

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
August in an election year is, by definition, an anxious time on the floor of the House. The balance of politics and policy at the heart of every vote, conscious or not, becomes all the more complicated.
"All those concerns increase exponentially this year, with the biggest social legislation to ever come down the pike hanging out there, completely unresolved," said Representative Bob Wise, Democrat of West Virginia. Indeed, one week before the House takes up the health care bill, the August angst could hardly be heavier for the Democrats, weighed down by every imaginable interest group, an ever more partisan Republican opposition, an ever more unpredictable Senate. 
 Most of these forces push toward caution. Yet House Democrats still seem haunted by the need to do something on health care. Many of them have held dozens of town meetings on the issue, heard the stories of the failings of the current system and had constituents write to them or approach them in shopping malls.
Representative Jim Chapman, a 49-year-old Democrat whose district covers the northeast corner of Texas, remembers how the uninsured or the underinsured would sometimes speak to him after the town meetings, having waited until the doctors and other officials who usually dominated those sessions had left.
Then, Mr. Chapman said, people would tell him their stories and say things like: "Follow your heart, Congressman. Do what's right." Mr. Chapman added, "It tends to make you realize that the people who are the least able to influence you need you the most." Moments like that, members say, help to balance the organized lobbying and carefully structured grass-roots outcry.
Representative Charles Wilson, another Texas Democrat, categorizes himself as "miserable" over the health care issue, in part because of the idea of requiring companies to contribute to the cost of their workers' insurance. The potential economic impact of that requirement, or employer mandate, has been driven home to members by the National Federation of Independent Business and other groups, and Mr. Wilson said, "I've got thousands of Wal-Marts and Pizza Huts and dealerships in my district."
But, Mr. Wilson said, he sees some faces in the political calculations.
"The Treasury Department estimates that 23.9 percent of my constituents do not have any coverage," he said. "My district is a blue-collar, hard-working constituency. I have thousands of young couples where the husband is a mechanic and works hard in a small auto shop, and the wife is a waitress, and they've got two or three kids and no insurance."
He added, "They don't go to the doctors and if a kid's got asthma, the first time you see him is when he can't breathe."
Like many other Democrats these days, Mr. Wilson characterizes himself as undecided on how he will vote. But, he said, at the end of the day "I'm going to make it possible for those young families to get some coverage."
The Administration and its allies in the House Democratic leadership are doing their best to keep the faces of the uninsured in the political equation. Hillary Rodham Clinton, among others, has turned the Treasury Department analysis of the uninsured, by Congressional district, into one of the most heavily consulted documents on Capitol Hill.
Members of the leadership, like Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a chief deputy whip, keep nudging their colleagues along. Mr. Lewis, a veteran of the civil rights movement, makes the analogy again and again that imposing a mandate on employers to achieve universal coverage is no more difficult, and no less right, than the mandates applied to achieve civil and voting rights.
Many, though, flatly reject the idea. Representative Gene Taylor, a Democrat with a district on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi, asserted, "I've lost three garment factories in my district as a direct result of Nafta." Mr. Taylor said he simply could not support a bill with an employer mandate -- or abortion -- in it.
 
Mismatched Plans
 It is August, and it is impossible to ignore the timing, the procedural mechanics and the pure politics of the issue. Democrats in the House get frustrated, especially moderates and conservatives. Why do they have to vote on a plan with a much greater level of employer contributions than the plan put forward in the Senate? (The leadership plan in the House, proposed by Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the majority leader, would require most employers to pay 80 percent of the cost of their workers' insurance; the leadership plan in the Senate, proposed by Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, applies only a delayed and conditional mandate, with only a 50 percent employer share.)
"I'm not blaming the leadership, but they know the Gephardt plan has as much chance of passage in the Senate as aid to Cuba," Mr. Wilson said.
This, of course, is hardly the first time that the House will vote on a more liberal -- or just very different -- version of legislation than the Senate does. Allies of the leadership, like Mr. Wise, suggest that this is what conference committees were made for. "With some members, particularly the more skittish ones, it can make a difference," Mr. Wise said of the Senate factor. "But I think there's a realization among other members that Mitchell's going to do what Mitchell's got to do. It's politics going into the conference and substance coming out.'
Moreover, the current schedule makes it likely that the Senate will have to vote first on the basic issue of putting new requirements on employers. The old bulls of the House, like Representative John D. Dingell, scoff at the notion of deferring to the Senate on a hard vote -- "I've been afflicted with the Senate for 38 years," Mr. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, barked when asked about the matter -- but the average member has no desire to take unnecessary risks so close to Election Day.
 
Concern for Repercussions
 Lawmakers worry, too, over the sheer scale of what they are about to do. "Members are genuinely concerned that once the fine print is written, there will be sleepers that come back and haunt us," said Representative Dan Glickman, Democrat of Kansas. "This is a bill that's going to affect every single American intimately. Most things we work on don't."
"Do something, but be careful" comes through again and again from House Democrats. "Each thing that happens as you go along causes concern and questions," Mr. Gephardt acknowledged in an interview. "But I must tell you I've been amazed and heartened in this whole thing at the willingness of members to hang in there and really want to figure out how to get this done." On Friday morning, the turnout was good at sessions to walk House Democrats through the Gephardt bill, hypothetical family by hypothetical family.
This instinct toward caution, however, raises the potential appeal of the bipartisan plan under development by Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, and Representative Fred Grandy, Republican of Iowa. Representative Michael A. Andrews of Texas, one of many Democrats who argue that the Gephardt plan relies too much on government -- instead of the market -- to expand coverage, says that being concerned for the uninsured "doesn't mean just voting for everything."
The reception afforded the bipartisan plan, which is finally expected to be unveiled this week after much delay and reported difficulty in reaching agreement, should give some clues to the fate of the Gephardt plan. In the meantime, members are slouching through August.
"Crankiness comes," Mr. Chapman said philosophically. "It's all part of the process. Sometimes it works to a positive end."
 
DIARY
Health Care Developments
 
OVER THE WEEKEND With the House and Senate nearing showdown votes on health care bills, President Clinton is trying to mobilize support for legislation that would insure coverage for all, or nearly all, Americans.
 
WHITE HOUSE
The White House is battling critics who say the bills offered by leading Democrats in the House and Senate are too bureaucratic and too hard on business. In an advertisement broadcast on CNN, the President said the legislation had been altered to take account of the concerns of business, especially small business. And in brief remarks in Detroit on Saturday, he accused critics of Democratic health care plans of trying to deny all Americans the benefits that the critics already enjoy. "Most of them have health care and most of them have parents on Medicare," Mr. Clinton said. "Why do they not want you to have the same thing that they have?"
 
CONGRESS
 Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, noted that there were many differences between the bills Democratic leaders of the House and Senate had introduced and said that they would not be easy to reconcile. But he said he was optimistic of success. Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said Republicans would divide up for study the Senate bill proposed by the majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, before they started to try to amend the Democratic proposals.
 
WHAT'S NEXT
Senate debate on the Mitchell bill begins on Tuesday. There is no telling when it will end; Senator Mitchell has said he will keep the Senate in session six days a week and into the Congressional recess originally scheduled to start at the end of next week until it acts on a health insurance bill. The House, whose regulations on debate allow members less time to speak, will take up its leadership's proposal on Aug. 15 and vote by Aug. 19, Mr. Foley has said.

HEADLINE: Giuliani's Patronage Power Helps Reshape Government

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL with ALAN FINDER 

 BODY:
Before Rudolph W. Giuliani was elected Mayor, Albert L. Buzzeo was a caterer in Queens and serving as a Republican district leader. Leonard B. Guttman was a rabbi close to Mr. Giuliani who ran for City Council as a Republican in 1991 and lost. Today they are assistant commissioners in the Department for the Aging, making $73,500 a year.
Rosemarie O'Keefe, a Republican district leader from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, was working as a $26,000-a-year aide to Representative Susan Molinari. Now she is an assistant commissioner of recreation at a salary of $73,500. 
 The three are part of the new face that Mr. Giuliani is putting on city government as his administration weeds out middle-level managers from the Dinkins and Koch years and replaces them with appointees selected to carry out the Mayor's priorities.
It is common for new mayors to bring with them scores of aides, deputies and new commissioners and to award jobs to campaign workers and party officials who helped get them elected. But former and current city officials say that at the middle levels of government, the Giuliani administration is carrying out the largest political housecleaning in years, with the Republican Mayor unbound by ties to the Democratic establishment.
Mr. Giuliani has said that he is selecting managers who understand his vision for the city. And he says he has put together an unusually diverse government. Democrats outnumber Republicans, 27 to 18, in his Cabinet.
Moreover, an examination of payroll records does not show that patronage is rampant under Mr. Giuliani. At least one Republican leader complains that the Mayor has forgotten the party's foot soldiers. And many of the people hired have impressive credentials.
But in scores of cases, the Mayor has given jobs to campaign supporters and officials of the parties that backed him. He has hired at least three dozen members of his paid campaign staff, 16 district leaders from the Republican and Liberal Parties, assorted campaign volunteers, and relatives and in-laws of the Mayor himself or his political allies.
Mr. Giuliani, whose battle against political corruption helped propel him to prominence as a prosecutor, called for a "dramatic break" with patronage in his first campaign for mayor in 1989. And he vowed across two campaigns to appoint people solely on merit. Earlier this year, he called it inappropriate to use the word patronage to describe any of his appointments.
"To me patronage is -- and I know it has lots of definitions -- is that some political leader has 20 jobs and gets to fill those 20 jobs and there is not any thought being given to qualifications and to the job," Mr. Giuliani said in an interview. He said that while his administration takes resumes from political leaders, "we say no as often as we say yes." And he added that his Cabinet and his political support were "so diverse that there's no danger of an outside force taking over an agency."
But Gene Russianoff, a staff attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit advocacy organization, said of the Mayor, "I think his record on patronage is disappointing because he as a candidate projected himself as a break with past bad old ways, and it turns out that he's pretty much in the same mold as his predecessors."
 
With New Mayors, New Approaches
 Each new administration has its own approach to filling the approximately 1,500 jobs that are under a mayor's direct control or that make up the management ranks of city agencies.
Mayor Edward I. Koch began his political career as a reformer against political patronage. But by the middle of his three terms, the political appointments grew, and some produced its biggest scandals. They included kickbacks and extortion in the Parking Violations Bureau and a broad patronage operation that had been billed as a "talent bank" to recruit minority laborers.
Mayor David N. Dinkins largely bucked the Democratic Party establishment, using his hiring to increase the number of women and minorities in government.
He brought in longtime aides from the Borough President's office as well as appointees from labor unions and nonprofit advocacy groups. The hiring left Democratic county leaders with so little influence that they threatened to sit out the next election, and some indeed provided lackluster support.
The Giuliani administration has created a centrally controlled appointments office for handling resumes, run by Anthony Carbonetti, a former campaign aide, and overseen by Randy M. Mastro, the Mayor's chief of staff. Mr. Mastro said the office had been established to insure an orderly hiring process. Mr. Giuliani said he became personally involved in mid-level personnel decisions only when there were disagreements among his senior staff.
Mr. Mastro said that of the 7,000 resumes collected by Mr. Giuliani's transition team, several hundred had been circulated to agency heads. Resumes submitted to the transition teams were accompanied by cover forms, party officials said, that indicated who the applicant's sponsor was and whether the sponsor knew the job-seeker personally.
As is customary, many of Mr. Giuliani's campaign staffers were hired into the Mayor's office to work directly for Mr. Giuliani. In city agencies, Mr. Mastro said, 550 people have received jobs since January. Of those jobs, he said, 100 require special technical skills. Of the remaining 450, he estimated that a quarter were given to people recommended by City Hall.
The figures did not include more autonomous agencies, like the Off-Track Betting Corporation, the Housing Authority and the Economic Development Corporation, which have dismissed dozens of employees and hired supporters of the Mayor.
 
How Much Pressure On Commissioners?
 Mr. Mastro described the hiring decisions as a "collaborative process" between City Hall and the commissioners, with some candidates identified by the appointments office and some by the commissioners themselves. He said he could not think of an instance in which he rejected a candidate over a commissioner's "ongoing objection."
Commissioners' accounts varied. "I've said no to City Hall," said Nora Chang Wang, the Commissioner of Employment. "There's no pressure."
Lilliam Barrios-Paoli, the Commissioner of Personnel, said she had reviewed 10 resumes sent by City Hall and selected two of the candidates "because I really liked them."
Several other agency heads, who would speak only when guaranteed anonymity, said the pressure to take candidates submitted by City Hall was strong, and five said that a commissioner's ability to reject such candidates varied according to how technical the agency was and how much independent standing the commissioner was thought to have.
One struggle took place in the Probation Department, city officials said, after City Hall recommended that Louis Gelormino, an attorney who had been a supporter of Mr. Giuliani, be hired for a deputy commissioner's job that was already filled.
The officials said that the Probation Commissioner, Michael P. Jacobson, a holdover from the Dinkins administration, objected, and after a bitter exchange with City Hall, the commissioner was told to find a job for Mr. Gelormino. Ultimately, Mr. Gelormino was named to a newly created $90,500-a-year position in charge of efforts to find jobs for people on probation.
Mr. Jacobson declined to comment on Mr. Gelormino's appointment. Mr. Mastro said the administration had wanted Mr. Gelormino to be hired because he had a special interest in probation and had been considered for the department's top job. He said there had been no acrimony and that it was Mr. Jacobson who found the position for Mr. Gelormino.
The city's payroll records, which were released to The New York Times only after it filed formal requests under the Freedom of Information law, showed wide variations among the departments in the number of political appointments. Some departments, like Health, appear not to have made hiring decisions that could be considered political.
In the Housing Preservation Department, Mara Neville, a spokeswoman for Commissioner Deborah C. Wright, said the department's top staff was chosen by Ms. Wright, and she cited substantial backgrounds in government or in housing policy. One official, however, had been a campaign worker: Miguel Ponce, a $70,000-a-year assistant commissioner. And Christopher Halligan, the son of one of Mr. Giuliani's cousins, was named a community coordinator with a salary of nearly $40,000 a year.
Other departments whose missions are less technical, like Parks or General Services, have taken on larger numbers of political appointees.
In General Services, which oversees office space and supplies for the government, 13 campaign workers and Republican and Liberal Party district leaders have been hired.
They include Kevin Brawley, the Liberal Party's Manhattan vice chairman, who makes $64,900 a year as director of purchase; Ronald Perry, a Harlem Republican district leader, as a $45,000-a-year associate staff analyst; Stuart Wershub, another Republican district leader from Manhattan, as a $50,000-a-year associate staff analyst, and James Najdek, a Liberal Party district leader from Queens, as a $26,000-a-year driver.
In the Parks Department, in addition to Ms. O'Keefe, Representative Molinari's former aide, at least seven politically connected applicants recommended by City Hall have been hired. They include Robert Adamenko, a Liberal Party district leader in Brooklyn, and Roberta Koeppel, a distant relative of William Koeppel, the real-estate executive who was a major Giuliani fund-raiser.
The Parks Commissioner, Henry J. Stern, said he had rejected other names sent by City Hall and was satisfied with his staff. Mr. Stern, a Liberal, added: "In the Liberal Party everybody's a district leader. To say because these were district leaders that they are of political importance, would be overreaching."
 
Appointees Defended As Well-Qualified
 Mr. Giuliani said that Ms. O'Keefe had originally been hired to be the parks official in charge of Brooklyn, which would have drawn on her experience as a Brooklyn constituent representative for Ms. Molinari. He said Mr. Stern promoted her to assistant commissioner. Mr. Mastro said she had proven herself in the public and private sector and had once run a "resort inn."
Mr. Mastro said that both Mr. Buzzeo and Mr. Guttman, who serve in the Department for the Aging, had a special interest in the elderly. Mr. Mastro said that as a caterer Mr. Buzzeo had served 100 to 500 meals a day to the elderly.
Mr. Mastro said that Mr. Guttman, a rabbi, lawyer and professor at Touro College, had worked with the elderly in community-based organizations. He said Mr. Guttman had been a board member of the Midwood Child Development Center, a director of adult-education programs and an editor of publications for the elderly, and had been involved in youth programs.
Other political figures are sprinkled throughout the agencies. At the Department of Business Services, Gilbert Klaperman, the husband of Mr. Giuliani's running mate, Susan Alter, was named an administrative attorney. At the Department of Employment, Elaine S. Reiss, the unsuccessful Republican candidate last year for Manhattan borough president, is an $80,000-a-year administrative attorney. Commissioner Wang said that Ms. Reiss had been recommended by City Hall, and that she had found her to be the most impressive candidate for the job. Ms. Reiss had previously been a general counsel and senior executive in the advertising industry.
Despite the political appointments made by the administration, several political leaders said they had not had the success they would like. State Senator Guy J. Velella, the Bronx County Republican leader, said he had forwarded 60 resumes, but only a few of his candidates had been hired.
The Queens Republican chairwoman, Fran Werner, complained that the Liberal Party was doing better than the Republicans in landing administration jobs. "Anybody who is a member of the Liberal party and in the hierarchy of the party has a job, and I don't think that's fair," she said.
Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal party leader, whose two sons have been hired into the administration, declined to comment. But asked whether his party had been rewarded for giving Mr. Giuliani its ballot line, he said, "To the extent that Giuliani is a superb Mayor, all New Yorkers have been rewarded."

Lollapalooza, as Usual, Goes Its Own Way

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
Lollapalooza is an alternative rock roadshow that mutates as it travels. On Saturday at the very pungent Downing Stadium on Randalls Island (there's a sewage treatment plant nearby), 6 of the 12 bands that performed at the tour's opening concert in Las Vegas, Nev., a month ago had been replaced. On the main stage, Green Day took the Japanese band the Boredoms' slot opening for the Lollapalooza stalwarts the Smashing Pumpkins, the Beastie Boys, George Clinton, A Tribe Called Quest, Nick Cave and L7. On the second stage, all five bands were new additions, and the music ranged from rap to jazz to country to rock.
What made this wide array of music alternative was its performers' relationship with the audience. Where popular acts of the last two decades swaggered like untouchable stars, culminating in the wall Pink Floyd performed behind 15 years ago on one tour, alternative acts try to break down the wall. 
 "This looks like arena rock," the Green Day singer Billie Joe complained during the band's midday set. The young California trio, which is leading a commercial renaissance of punk rock, spent much of its show sending up classic-rock cliches by asking the audience to do the wave, raise its lighters and pretend it was at Woodstock. Though three other main-stage bands made similar references, Green Day expressed the contradictions of successful alternative rock best when it brought members of the audience on stage and instructed them to sing hackneyed 80's anthems like "Eye of the Tiger" and "We're Not Gonna Take It."
When the Boredoms opened Lollapalooza, they prepared the audience for the festival's mind-opening atmosphere with incorrigible noise. Green Day, however, played accessible pop-punk songs that prepared the audience for fun. Its lyrics about being bored, unemployed, apathetic and disillusioned embraced the stereotypes that plague the Lollapalooza generation.
At the second stage, concertgoers were exposed to more diverse and challenging music, beginning with the sweet, off-kilter pop of Blast-Off Country Style and ending with an unannounced music and dance performance by the Tibetan Ganden Jangtse Monks. In between, the Charlie Hunter Trio formed slick, post-bop jazz out of guitar, drums and sax; Fu-Schnickens let loose lighthearted raps that fell flat on top of the muddy beats and canned music played by their disk jockey; Lambchop, an 11-member band, injected lap-steel guitar, washboard, saxophone and piano into beguiling country and quirky rock and Stereolab harnessed the chugging of early synthesizers to simple pop songs, adding sweetly sung and cleverly plagiarized lyrics.
After a solid and cynical performance by the singer, songwriter and doomsayer Nick Cave, a teasingly shambling rock show by the Breeders, a quick funk lesson from George Clinton (with the special guest Flavor Flav of Public Enemy) and an energetic Beastie Boys show that spanned the trio's rock and rap career, the Smashing Pumpkins closed the fourth annual Lollapalooza smorgasbord with just the right wrong attitude. Billy Corgan, the frontman, talked as if he was insecure about his success and misunderstood by his audience. But when he sang, he transformed the slippery spirit of the alternative nation into easy-to-grasp slogans: "I don't believe in God," he intoned in his set opener. "I don't believe in America, I don't believe in rock-and-roll. I believe in me."

HEADLINE: Forced to Flee -- A special report.;
U.N. Faces Refugee Crisis That Never Ends

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GENEVA

 BODY:
The exodus of two million refugees from Rwanda was not an aberration but part of a trend in which increasing millions of people worldwide are being put to flight by war and famine.
The number of refugees has mushroomed during the last two decades, from 2.4 million in 1974 to 10.5 million by 1984 to close to 23 million today. 
 When added to an estimated 26 million "internally displaced" people -- those who have abandoned their home areas but have not crossed an international boundary -- it reaches the staggering level of 49 million.
That means, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, that one of every 114 people in the world has been uprooted by conflict and forced to move somewhere else to search for security or sustenance.
For the United Nations agency supposed to deal with the problem, the numbers add up to an unending crisis. The office of the High Commissioner was founded at the outset of the cold war with a mandate to enshrine the principle of political asylum for the few who managed to slip through the Iron Curtain, not to provide truckloads of food and water for camps as large as American cities.
"We can't cope," said Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman for the refugee agency. "We used to be a bunch of lawyers working on protection. Our function was legalistic. Now it's emergency response. We're a SWAT team and we're working against the odds."
What has also grown is the realization that the problem of forced flight, which for decades had been viewed as a byproduct of the cold war, is not diminishing now that the cold war is over.
Indeed, aside from the settlement of some regional conflicts that has led to the repatriation of refugees to places like Cambodia and Mozambique, the problem has gotten almost immeasurably worse.
The high-water mark for repatriation was 1992, when some 2.4 million refugees returned home. But that number has been dwarfed by the number of new refugees.
And even the occasional success story turned sour. In Afghanistan, where some 1.5 million people came back in 1992 alone, after more than a decade of exile in Pakistan and Iran, renewed fighting broke out among the Muslim factions who ousted the Soviet troops. This has devastated Kabul, the capital, which survived intact the "holy war" against the Soviets, and led to a new flight of hundreds of thousands. But because Pakistan has closed its border, most of them are stuck in miserably hot tent camps on the outskirts of the provincial capital of Jalalabad. And there are more than 3 million Afghan refugees who are still in Pakistan and Iran.
 
Ethnic Conflicts Proliferating
 Old wars have continued, often with a frightening savagery. New wars have broken out, many with an ugly ethnic dimension in which entire groups are targeted for ouster or liquidation.
In addition to Rwanda, ethnic conflicts in Africa have occurred in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Angola and Somalia. Elsewhere, they have broken out in the volatile republics that once belonged to the Soviet Union -- Georgia, Tajikistan, Armenia and Azerbaijan -- and in a range of countries from Iraq to Sri Lanka and Burma. Palestinians, the group with the longest history of displacement, have been continually uprooted by regional wars since the creation of Israel in 1948. They are assisted by a separate United Nations agency, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.
"Right after the cold war we thought all the problems would be solved," noted Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. "We didn't realize that the cold war had another aspect to it -- that the superpowers provided order or pressed order on their respective zones of influence. And so ethnic or religious or national conflicts, whether within the Communist bloc or the Western bloc, had little chance of exploding.
"So now, post-cold war, we are seeing the explosion of much more traditional, dormant, maybe pre-World War I kinds of ethnic conflict."
 
A New Breed of Conflicts
 The new conflicts that occur inside countries rather than between countries have several distinct aspects:
*Since the conflict is often ethnic or religious, the killing tends to be widespread and aimed at a specific civilian population. The realization of this alone is enough to cause mass panic and flight.
*In some of the conflicts, as a United Nations report issued last year put it, "displacement of people is not the byproduct of war but one of its primary purposes." This is seen, for example, in the "ethnic cleansing" campaign by Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
*In others, like those in Bosnia, Somalia and Afghanistan, the state has virtually withered away, leaving the field to warlords who plunder the countryside with medieval abandon, chasing out large groups of people.
*The weaponry involved, some of it pumped in by the superpowers during years of proxy warfare, is highly destructive, consisting of multiple-rocket launchers, missiles, artillery, mortars and -- most pernicious from the point of view of repatriation -- land mines. The indiscriminate carnage speeds the exodus.
*The combatants do not shrink from using food as a weapon, either by blocking relief convoys or engaging in "slash and burn" techniques of warfare. In places like the Horn of Africa, the combination of drought and war has so savaged the land that it can no longer provide a livelihood. Whether the hundreds of thousands who leave are fleeing starvation or war is academic.
*If the state itself is a party to the conflict it may use the media to fan the flames. In Rwanda, Government-controlled radio whipped up hatred in April to bring about the Hutu massacres of Tutsi and afterward sowed fears among the Hutu that they would be killed in retaliation.
Another characteristic of the new conflicts is that they can rise up quickly or suddenly ignite after simmering for long periods, catching international rescue agencies and the United Nations off guard.
 
The Crisis
Strife Simmers For Decades
 The Rwanda crisis has its roots in 1959, when about half a million refugees, largely from the minority Tutsi tribe, fled to escape the Hutu-led "social revolution" before independence in 1962. Clustered mostly in Uganda, they constituted one of the oldest refugee populations on the continent and were a constant source of unrest, culminating in 1990 when many of them invaded their homeland under the guise of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the Tutsi-dominated rebel force.
Despite various international attempts to mediate the conflict and come up with a plan for power-sharing between the two groups, it flared again in April. Most African experts were not really surprised. Rwanda, which is the most over-populated country in Africa, has long been a powder keg, especially since it lies next to Burundi, where Hutu-Tutsi violence has been endemic for years.
The trigger was the still-unsolved shooting-down of a plane that carried the Hutu President, Juvenal Habyarimana, which set off apparently planned massacres of Tutsi by Hutu militias. Though refugees started flowing out right away and many people expected their numbers would grow, the speed and size of the flood, when it finally reached its peak, surpassed any prediction.
By the end of the third week in June, roughly five million of Rwanda's eight million people had abandoned their homes. The country seemed to turn itself inside out overnight, emptying 10,000 people an hour across the border into Zaire. The catastrophe, which President Clinton called the "worst humanitarian crisis in a generation," came from the sheer volume of people crowded together without safe drinking water or sanitation facilities to check the spread of cholera.
 
From Asylum to Mass Relief
 The office of the High Commissioner, while it has been forced to develop a level of expertise in supplying large numbers of destitute people, was not created to do so. It was established in 1951, at the time of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and its original purpose was to uphold the sanctity of the concept of international protection for people who fled their countries from a "well-founded fear of persecution."
As such, it became primarily an instrument of the cold war, aiding people who escaped from Communist countries to resettle in the West. Over the years, with mass flights from Cambodia, Vietnam and elsewhere, that mission broadened: the agency -- with the help of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children and other organizations -- provided assistance in the form of food and shelter to huge encampments of people who had fled with no belongings.
Throughout, the agency was handicapped by a contradiction. It stemmed from the fact that it was supposed to help only refugees, who were by definition people who managed to escape into another country. This restriction ignored the many millions uprooted by a conflict who moved to a different region within the same country and whose needs were every bit as desperate.
Over time the restriction was side-stepped. With a request from the United Nations Secretary General, the agency can now set up and supply camps for internally displaced people, as it is doing in Bosnia, where they now number 2.7 million. But when it does so, it finds itself at cross-purposes: setting up a camp inside a country usually means de-emphasizing the right of the displaced to cross a border into another country. This goes against the agency's original reason for existing, which was to defend the principle that asylum is an international right that supersedes checkpoints and boundaries.
In Afghanistan, for example, factional fighting broke out with a new ferocity in Kabul on Jan. 1 this year. Twelve days later Pakistan closed its border, the preferred escape route, so that a new wave of refugees could not cross into Peshawar, where camps have existed since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.
Instead, the office of the High Commissioner has set up camps on the outskirts of Jalalabad in southern Afghanistan to receive the many thousands flowing out of the capital. The main camp, with 118,000 people, is located on a desolate, scorching-hot plateau filled with rocks and scorpions and devoid of water. Days are spent in listless waiting for distribution of food.
Although the United Nations is unlikely to acknowledge it publicly, the establishment of the camp has reduced pressure on Pakistan to accept the displaced as refugees. While condemning Pakistan's decision to close the border, the agency has in effect acquiesced to it.
 
The Agency
End of Cold War Alters Mission
 Because it was founded as a temporary agency at the time of the cold war, (its life span in 1951 was supposed to be three years, and it has been renewed in five-year intervals), the High Commissioner's office evolved an arcane method of financing. Its budget -- $1.3 billion for 1993 -- is raised by making appeals for specific causes to donor governments, usually the United States, the European Union and Japan.
Contributions can be earmarked for particular countries. As a result, donations for a cause such as repatriation in Cambodia, where the suffering under the Pol Pot regime touched a sympathetic chord around the world, ends up being over-subscribed. And repatriation in Mozambique, where a long-fought war is winding down in obscurity, does not raise enough money.
The system of financing also means that the agency is a hostage to publicity. It needs extensive coverage of a catastrophe by the international media in order to exert pressure on governments to contribute. The problem is that the coverage is usually effective only after the catastrophe is out of hand and television screens are filled with footage of ragged, starving children. And by then, of course, it is too late.
International aid officials also point out that they are often left to deal with diplomatic failures when ethnic conflicts arise and the world stands by unable or unwilling to intervene militarily. The reluctance of the United States to become involved in Rwanda, for example, stemmed in part from the debacle of its intervention in Somalia, where American troops, deployed to fight famine, eventually withdrew ignominiously with the image of hostile interlopers.
Aid officials say privately that in the case of Rwanda, one problem in meeting Secretary General Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali's appeal for $400 million in emergency assistance was that news broadcasts in the United States were preoccupied with the situation in Haiti and the tribulations of O. J. Simpson.
When donations finally came, many were inappropriate. What was needed urgently in Rwanda was not money nor bulk foodstuffs but drinking water and latrines. The profusion of irrelevant aid sometimes got in the way.
The agency has an emergency budget of $25 million and in some trouble spots around the world has stocks of food and medicines to prepare for emergencies. But the disaster in Rwanda was so great that such precautions were pitifully inadequate.
The method of financing also leads to a sense that the emergencies are competing with one another and, since there is almost always a shortfall, perhaps exaggerating the sum the sponsors say is required. The greatest fear of all is what Mrs. Ogata calls "donor fatigue," although she says that she is satisfied with the results so far. "We were fully funded last year," she said.
Supporters of the policy of working inside countries like Afghanistan and Bosnia assert that it is an effective way of trying to deal with the problem of dislocated people closer to the source, before they become a full-scale international burden. But critics charge that the internal camps do not allow the people to integrate easily into a local economy, that they are often less provided for and that the people are not always out of harm's way.
It is a way of accommodating the world's unwillingness to accept more refugees, they say.
"The move to assist internally displaced is an attempt to reduce these huge refugee flows and I think it's failed," said Mark Duffield, a senior lecturer in the School of Public Policy at the University of Birmingham, England. "Look at Bosnia. Up to 50 percent of Bosnians are internally displaced now but the U.N. has been unable to protect them."
 
Warfare for Resources
 Mr. Duffield said that the tide of refugees is caused by what he terms "resource wars," a scramble for dwindling assets as the gulf between rich and poor countries widens.
"Resource wars often have a heightened ethnic character," he said. "There is frequently a cold logic at work. What appears at a distance to be inexplicable barbaric acts is the systematic purging of one group by another to rob them of their assets. There are winners and there are losers."
In some parts of the third world, like the southern Sudan, he sees what calls a "permanent emergency," meaning "an area with end-to-end emergencies where the government has learned to survive from the situation and even to thrive" because of the vast amounts of assistance pouring in.
How best to distribute the assistance is another bone of contention. Some critics, like Barbara Harrell-Bond, director of the Refugees Studies Program at Oxford, says that camps are dehumanizing, foster dependency and make a normal life virtually impossible. "The camp approach is for the convenience of donors, to help them contribute and distribute aid," she said. "I think aid should follow the refugees rather than vice versa."
 
The Alternatives
Keeping Refugees Close to Home
 While many experts agree that it is better to integrate refugees into a surrounding society than to stick them all together in an isolated area, the host countries often insist upon camps for the same reason -- out of the conviction that it will make it easier for the refugees to return en masse to their own country someday. That way they will not compete for jobs or become a burden on the local economy, they say.
Another problem with the camp structure is that it seems to work better for peasants or farmers but it seems doubly harsh for displaced urban professionals, who seem to make up an ever-growing proportion of the displaced. Lawyers and taxi drivers are not adept at expanding makeshift structures to make them more homey or at planting vegetables to supplement their families' diet.
"They want us to all grow food," said Manuel Almeida, a well-known former soccer player in Angola, as he presided over a food distribution center in the war-torn town of Huambo. "I'm a petroleum engineer and my wife's a doctor. What do you want me to do? I'm no farmer."
A logical extension of building camps inside countries of conflict is to establish so-called "safe havens." In Somalia, beginning in January 1993, the United Nations set up "preventive zones" to give assistance inside the country in an effort to stem the outflow of people.
One danger in the concept is illustrated by Bosnia, where the safe havens set up to protect Muslims are viewed as partisan enclaves and thus legitimate targets by the Serbs. And if they function properly, and are truly "safe," they serve as magnets and actually assist in "ethnic cleansing" by drawing in people from less secure areas.
Safe havens involve an intrusion upon the sovereignty of the country in conflict, something that most experts feel is necessary if concerted international action is to be undertaken to nip the refugee-producing conflicts in the bud.
The most outstanding example to date was the creation of a vast safety zone in northern Iraq in 1991 to prevent the Government of Saddam Hussein from exacting reprisals from the Kurdish population after the Persian Gulf war. That move was possible because the military machine to back it up was already in place once the Western alliance defeated Iraq.
All of the fears of aid officials -- that the numbers of refugees and displaced will keep rising, that new and more adventuresome techniques to cope may backfire and that someday people in donor countries will simply throw up their hands and turn their backs -- come from a conviction that the developed world is getting tired of the problem.
Ever since the recession of the early 1970's, when immigration to Europe was cut back, economic migrants have have exploited political asylum as a means to enter a country of opportunity. Partly as a reaction to this, and partly out of a rising tide of xenophobia, European countries are raising barriers to newcomers. Though aimed at people who want to enter to better their lives economically, the tighter restrictions have made entry harder for people fleeing from real danger.

HEADLINE: A Confusion of Competition Cools Florida's Casino Fever

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
It sounds like a gambling industry dream. After turning sinful Las Vegas into a family resort, what better place to open casinos than Florida, the land of sun-splashed beaches, Mickey and millions of card-playing retirees?
Earlier this year, voter approval of casinos in the Sunshine State looked like a sure bet. But it is now in danger, thanks to infighting more reminiscent of a barroom brawl than board room behavior among the companies vying for a potential $5 billion a year in gambling profits. 
 The spectacle has disheartened one-time casino supporters in the state and could portend problems elsewhere as the industry seeks to tap a shrinking number of lucrative new locations.
Fueled by more than $5 million in contributions from corporate giants, opposing camps representing Las Vegas casinos, riverboat owners, parimutuel operators and hotel associations have accused one another of greed or carpetbagging and have filed lawsuits seeking to block competitors' proposals from reaching the ballot in November. State authorities also recently discovered that some petitions to get referendum proposals on the ballot contained thousands of forgeries, including the names of dead voters. The last day to file petitions is Aug. 9.
"It is a major league mess," said Henry Silverman, the chairman and chief executive of Hospitality Franchise Systems, a company in Parsipanny, N.J., that is supporting riverboat interests.
 
A Field of Four
 There are four proposals, which would take the form of amendments to the state Constitution, vying to get on the ballot. One called Safe Bet for Florida would allow up to 21 riverboat casinos statewide. Another, the Proposition for Limited Casinos, would allow 12 hotel casinos in specific counties as well as casinos at the state's parimutuel operations and on five riverboats. A third, Florida Locally Approved Gaming, would permit a total of 20 casinos statewide, at hotels and on riverboats. And the Proposition for County Choice Gaming would allow each county to approve gambling in hotels, on riverboats and at parimutuel operations.
More than one of the proposals can make the ballot.
The melange of options has been further spiced by the presence of a German developer with a tangled financial past and controversial present who has teamed with Mirage Resorts in a bid to build a huge gambling complex near Miami Beach's trendy Art Deco district.
The carnival atmosphere seems to have cooled the public's ardor for casinos. A survey in June by the Florida Opinion Poll, a service of The New York Times regional newspaper group, found that 50 percent of the 553 voters interviewed statewide opposed a casino in their county. The poll's margin of sampling error was four percentage points.
 
'It Doesn't Portend Well'
 Even gambling company officials and their supporters acknowledge that Florida does not represent their finest hour.
"It has poisoned the well in Florida, and it doesn't portend well for the gaming industry," said Michael Levine, a lobbyist for the Proposition for County Choice Gaming.
Many gambling industry executives still believe that a casino proposal will be approved. But for gambling interests, the possibility of defeat is bitter because Floridians had appeared eager to embrace casinos.
Though state voters turned down a casino proposal in 1986, a poll conducted in February by Mason Dixon Political/Media Research found that two-thirds of those questioned believed that continuing such a ban was unrealistic given that Florida has long had parimutuel operations and that the state approved a lottery in 1988. Two Indian tribes operate high-stakes bingo halls.
Most analysts view expansion as vital if the casino industry is to continue to thrive. Florida, with its millions of visitors and retirees with time on their hands, represents one of the nation's biggest prizes. Jason Ader, an analyst for Smith Barney Shearson who follows gambling companies, estimated that annual casino revenue in Florida could run just behind Las Vegas and well ahead of Atlantic City.
The pro-casino movement received a big boost in January when C. Patrick Roberts, a lobbyist who had spearheaded the 1986 campaign against casinos, switched his position to head one of the pro-casino factions.
"The reality is that we have parimutuels, you can play the lottery in every convenience store in the state, and we have Indian bingo," said Mr. Roberts, the president of the Florida Association of Broadcasters, a trade group based in Tallahassee.
 
The Schism
 As elsewhere, the battle lines between pro- and anti-casino forces in Florida quickly formed around such bread-and-butter issues as gambling's effect on the state economy, tourism and crime. But in Florida, competing gambling interests fractured into four parties, each pushing a different agenda.
The Proposition for Limited Casinos, headed by Mr. Roberts, represents major Las Vegas casino operators, parimutuel owners and Thomas Kramer, a German developer. Bally Entertainment is the force behind Florida Locally Approved Gaming. Safe Bet for Florida is underwritten by riverboat interests, among others, as well as Hospitality Franchise Systems. Motel and hotel owners are the prime movers behind the Proposition for County Choice Gaming.
To get a proposition on the Florida ballot this year, each group must gather at least 429,428 signatures by Aug. 9. The proposal then goes to the Florida Supreme Court, which decides whether its language and intent are clear.
Each pro-casino group maintains that it tried to broker a compromise. But failing that, each then retreated to the moral high ground of its own choosing and began to fire away.
Mr. Roberts, for example, accused Bally of playing "spoiler" out of fear of competition for lucrative Miami casino sites. Arthur Goldberg, Bally's chairman and chief executive, countered that Bally would never have joined Mr. Roberts's group because putting casinos into parimutuel operations would give Florida more gambling halls than Nevada.
Mr. Levine said, "The public has been totally confused by what has been happening."
If the public needed any further confusion, it came in the form of a barrage of competing mailings and requests to sign petitions. Some of those circulating petitions, who are paid $2 for each signature they submit, have apparently not limited their efforts to the living. Recently, Collier County officials threw out about 90 percent of the 12,000 signatures submitted there for the Limited Casinos proposition. The petitions included forgeries or used the names of dead people, the officials said.
 
An Entrepreneur's Influence
 The Limited Casinos group, which has amassed the biggest war chest, has been challenged by the Florida State Attorney, as well as by its competitors, who say that the wording of its petition is legally flawed. In an interview, Mr. Roberts made it no secret that his group's proposal was written in part to accommodate the concerns of Mr. Kramer, a man who has made controversy a frequent companion and who is one of the proposal's biggest financial backers.
Since his arrival in Miami two years ago, the 37-year-old German entrepreneur has built a reputation for flamboyance and fast dealing. He spent more than $100 million to buy real estate, including 45 acres in a rundown area known as South Pointe, near the Art Deco district of Miami Beach.
In 1989, before German reunification, Mr. Kramer started a fund to invest in East German real estate. But the fund soon went bankrupt.
Bruce Rubin, a spokesman for Mr. Kramer, said that Mr. Kramer repaid anyone who lost money in the real estate venture. Mr. Kramer declined to be interviewed for this article.
Mr. Roberts said that he was approached by Mr. Kramer in the spring and told by the German investor that if Kramer interests in South Pointe were not included in the Limited Casinos proposal, he would mount his own campaign.
"He came in with an army of lawyers and consultants," Mr. Roberts said. "It was like he had the whole world on his payroll."
The Limited Casinos proposal was soon rewritten to permit a casino at South Pointe.
While the hotel owners' group has effectively conceded defeat, Bally, the riverboat interests and Mr. Roberts's group all maintain that they will make it to the ballot and win. But should voters face more than one proposal come November, most gamblers may want to cash in their chips, industry experts said.
"All the major casino companies are salivating," said William Thompson, a professor of public administration at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. "But if they can't come down to one proposition, they will fail."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE SENATE;
Am Emphasis on Subsidies and Assuring Insurance Coverage in Mitchell's Health Plan

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
When the Congressional debate on national health insurance legislation formally begins on Tuesday, the Senate will be considering a bill that relies mostly on subsidies to cover more people and on enhanced competition to control costs.
The bill, proposed by the majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, would provide the most new help to children and pregnant women. It would also initiate two programs that advocates for the elderly have sought for years: prescription drug coverage under Medicare and Federal support for home and community-based long-term care. 
 But the parts of his bill that would affect the most Americans, if something like it becomes law, are a variety of changes in insurance law. They are intended to make the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance more secure that they will not lose it or find its price suddenly doubling or tripling.
 
'Frustrations of the Debate'
 "It's one of the frustrations of the debate," Mr. Mitchell complained in an interview today, "that those who have insurance are unfortunately being persuaded by some that there is nothing in it for them."
The legislation that the House will consider, starting next week but probably finishing sooner than the Senate, has many of these same provisions.
But it also requires employers to pay 80 percent of the cost of their workers' insurance policies and puts the unemployed and workers for small companies into a new branch of Medicare, not into insurance purchasing cooperatives that would buy commercial policies as in the Senate plan. If each house passes something like the legislation proposed by its Democratic leaders, a House-Senate conference to reconcile their differences will "be a fairly tough conference," Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, said today on the CBS News program "Face the Nation."
But in the Senate, when debate actually focuses on the legislation itself -- and avoids the partisan heights and depths that will turn up on the evening news -- there will be little direct quarrel with any of Mr. Mitchell's objectives.
 
Criticisms of Bill
 There will be complaints, both genuine and political, that the bill tries to do too much and risks too much Government involvement in health care. At its extreme, the argument was made today as Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, contended on the same CBS News program that with Mr. Mitchell's bill "we are moving the Government into the position of actually running the health care system."
Specific changes in insurance law, in one form or another, are in most bills from either party. Indeed Republicans often suggest that Congress should be satisfied with them and leave the harder problems for later.
At higher or lower levels, insurance subsidies are a part of some Republican bills and all the Democratic measures. The case against them and against new benefits like prescription drug plans will basically be that the country cannot afford them, although the Mitchell bill has a budgetary fail-safe mechanism that should cut spending and with it additional coverage if costs seem about to outrun estimates.
The argument over cost control will probably be institutionally disingenuous. One senator after another will express disappointment that firmer measures were not included. But the insurance premium limits that President Clinton proposed fell to conservative opposition.
 
Tax on Some Policies
 For cost controls the Mitchell bill relies first on a modest tax on insurance policies whose rates go up much more quickly than the national average.
Then it hopes that by standardizing health insurance benefits it can promote competition among insurers that is based on price. And by requiring employers to offer workers different kinds of policies -- from traditional fee-for-service plans to membership in health maintainance organizations -- at different prices it will make consumers price-conscious.
This kind of price competition has already started curbing increases in the costs of health care as big employers and insurance companies insist on what are effectively volume discounts.
Mr. Mitchell said today that he agreed with the theory that "competition would serve to hold down the rate of increase in health costs," although no one could be sure how much.
And his bill establishes health insurance purchasing cooperatives for small employers, so they could get some of the bargaining power of big ones. It denies insurance companies the right to pick and choose to get healthy customers. That will save millions.
The first big argument is likely to be over the provision that, by a thread, has enabled both Senator Mitchell and President Clinton to describe this bill as one assuring universal coverage. It would require employers to pay 50 percent of cost of premiums for their workers and families, starting in 2002.
 
Intermediate Steps
 But it would take effect only if the earlier subsidy and insurance moves had not raised insurance coverage from its current 85 percent to 95 percent by the year 2000. Even then, the employer requirement would not be automatic. A commission would first recommend to Congress legislative steps to "cover the remaining uninsured population." Only if Congress did not enact such legislation would the 50 percent payment requirement take effect, and then only in states where 95 percent coverage had not been achieved.
The commission is also charged with recommending what to do to reach universal coverage if the percentage does reach 95 percent. But in that case, if Congress does not act, there is no fallback requirement.
But most of the increased coverage is expected to come from these four subsidy programs, which would take effect in 1997:
*Low-income families would receive a subsidy for the full cost of an average health insurance policy in their area if they have incomes of up to the Federal poverty level, or $14,764 for a family of four. The subsidy would be gradually phased out, stopping at twice the poverty level, or $29,528.
*Children under 19 and pregnant women would have full subsidies up to 185 percent of the poverty level, or $27,313, gradually phased out and stopping at three times the poverty level, or $44,292.
*Temporarily unemployed workers would be eligible for up to six months of subsidies if they have been insured for six months before losing their jobs by not having most of their unemployment benefits counted as income.
*Employers who expand their insurance coverage of their workers could be eligible for up to five years of subsidies so they would pay no more than 50 percent of the premium or 8 percent of a worker's wage, whichever is less.
The new benefits for the elderly would take effect later. But starting on Oct. 1, 1997, the Federal Government would help states pay for services that would enable the disabled and mentally impaired to live at home. By the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 2001, the total provided to the states would rise to $15.4 billion annually.
The Medicare prescription drug benefit would begin on Jan. 1, 1999. After paying a deductible of about $500, Medicare recipients would be reimbursed for 80 percent of their prescription costs. Once their payments in a year reached $1,275, Medicare would pay the entire bill. The bill calls for the exact figure of the deductible to be determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
 
Changes in Insurance Law
 The insurance law changes would be the first go into force. As soon as the bill became law, insurance companies would be required to guarantee that policies could be renewed.
On Jan. 1, 1995, they would be required to issue policies to all applicants and barred from dropping customers or raising their rates if they get sick.
Starting Jan. 1, 1995, the bill would impose increasingly tight limits on the ability of insurers to exclude from coverage pre-existing conditions, like a trick knee or a cancer. At that time, conditions that had been diagnosed or treated in the previous six months could be excluded for another six months. On Jan. 1, 1997, only conditions diagnosed or treated in the previous three months could be excluded, and on Jan. 1, 2002, no pre-existing condition exclusions would be allowed.
Moreover, starting in 1995, someone who had been continuously insured under one policy for at least three months could not have a pre-existing condition excluded when signing up for a new insurance plan.
Many health insurance policies now carry lifetime limits on reimbursement, often at $1 million. Lifetime limits would be prohibited, effective Jan. 1, 1997.
Beginning six months after the law is enacted, a system of "community rating" would be established that would charge all individuals in a region the same premium, except that premiums for people 65 years old could be twice as much as those for 18-year-olds. Age differentials now sometimes reach four times as much for the elderly as for the young. These age differentials would be gradually phased out and eliminated in 2002.

HEADLINE: Inventory rise Piques Wall Street

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Last week's Government figures showed that more than two-thirds of the nation's economic growth in the second quarter came from rising inventories, and that spooked Wall Street more than Main Street.
Rising inventories have often been an early warning sign of downturns in production and general economic trouble to come, and that is just how Wall Street interpreted the figures. Bond prices rose sharply as investors bet that the economy would weaken and undercut pressures to raise interest rates. 
 But some economists and a wide range of businesses say the inventory increases tell a more cheerful story.
Yes, the growth rate of new purchases fell to 1.5 percent from 2.2 percent in the first quarter and 6.4 percent in the last three months of 1993. Yes, that slowdown in sales growth left some businesses saddled with more goods than they had projected. Nonetheless many other businesses were building inventories based on confidence that the economy was set to continue to expand.
 
Afraid of Running Short
 "The anecdotes we hear and our business suggest the buildup was voluntary," said Richard Stuckey, chief economist for E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. He said many companies seemed to be buying more inventory because they were afraid of running short or of price increases from companies like Du Pont.
Ultratech Stepper Inc., a supplier of lithography systems that electronics companies use to manufacture microchips and disk drive heads, had a secondary stock offering in April that raised $29 million, in part to finance an expansion of component inventories. Those inventories grew more than 40 percent in the quarter that ended June 30, while sales expanded just over 10 percent.
Arthur Zafiropoulo, chairman and chief executive of Ultratech, in Santa Clara, Calif., said he thought his customers were embarking on a huge expansion of their industry and he wanted to be ready.
"There are lead times of nine months on some of our components," Mr. Zafiropoulo said. "The only question I have is whether I'm getting enough material in to meet growth."
Imports are another important element of the recent figures that pessimists have missed, said David Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. Wholesalers, which include importers like the companies that distribute foreign cars and electronics to dealers, are the only sector in which inventories are growing as fast as in previous post-World War II recoveries. The import share of their business has risen steadily as the economy has become more global.
Because the import spigot cannot be quickly adjusted, wholesalers are less nimble than either manufacturers or retailers in managing inventories. It is no surprise, Mr. Hale said, that wholesalers accounted for 40 percent of the second-quarter increase, compared with 25 percent for retailers and 14 percent for manufacturers.
The statistics suggest that any slowdown in the future to correct inventory imbalances will fall more heavily on foreign manufacturers than in the past, and hurt the American economy less.
Yet Wall Street analysts insist their nervousness about the inventory statistics is justified. Business executives are too prone to believe that anything making sales come in below projections is temporary, they caution. Letting inventories creep up is often easier than cutting production schedules. Executives put off cutbacks by telling themselves it could cost money to catch up if they reduce output and sales rebound, or worse still, that they could lose orders to better-stocked competitors.
"Every business that experiences inventory growth wants to believe they did it on purpose," said Edward Weller, who follows retailers for the stockbroking firm of Robertson, Stephens & Company in San Francisco.
Analysts also warn against taking too much comfort from the knowledge that inventories are still unusually low in many sectors compared with past economic expansions, especially in manufacturing.
Rising inventories are already a problem in some sectors of the economy. Some retailers and wholesalers have slowed new orders or held up payments for unsold products with painful results.
Bausch & Lomb, an eye care company in Rochester, is eliminating hundreds of jobs as part of its effort to work off $75 million in excess worldwide inventories of sunglasses and contact lens, Barbara Kelly, a spokeswoman, said. About half the excess inventories are in the United States, she said, and the layoffs will reduce operating profits $17 million this year.
 
Overstock Is Common
 Many furniture retailers and manufacturers noticed an unexpectedly sharp downturn in April as consumers confronted higher tax bills and rising interest rates. But slowdowns are a routine part of late spring and summer, and they are not especially worried yet.
"Our inventory rose 10 percent more than planned this spring, but we don't view that as major," said Lawrence Webb, chief operating officer of the Stanley Furniture Company, a private manufacturer of furniture in Stanleytown, Va. "It's not uncommon to have 30 percent to 40 percent overstock in a cyclical industry like ours."
Stanley typically whittles its overstock by slowing the rate at which it replaces departing workers, who leave the low-wage industry at relatively high rates. Mr. Webb said demand and production had come back into balance in July.
Some retailing experts said they were not surprised that makers of big-ticket items like furniture felt pinched this spring. "People were fooled by the extent of sales when interest rates were low last year," said William Rowe, a partner in the St. Louis office of KPMG Peat Marwick. "More of the pent-up demand was spent than some people realized."
 
New Designs and Lines
 But inventory increases in some big-ticket segments of the economy are not necessarily signs of a slowdown. The Whirlpool Corporation, for instance, said its inventory of refrigerators had been growing but not because of lower-than-projected sales.
Instead the company is building as many units as possible to tide it over when it closes production lines later this year for the switchover to new designs that operate without chlorofluorocarbons, or CFC's. The chemicals are being phased out of a wide variety of industrial products because they are thought to play a big role in ozone loss in the atmosphere, thus increasing the amount of dangerous solar radiation reaching the surface of the earth.
In other sectors, inventory problems may be less a sign of a slowing economy than of changes in the structure of an industry. Specialty apparel retailers are suffering from disappointing sales and poorer inventory-to-sales ratios primarily because they are losing business to the anchor stores in major malls, from companies like J. C. Penney and Sears on up to more expensive stores like Nordstrom, said Mr. Weller of Robertson, Stephens.
 
Sometimes Cancellations
 Some businesses are experiencing both the positive and negative forms of inventory buildup. Frederick's of Hollywood, a Los Angeles-based retailer of women's clothing, had its inventory-to-sales ratio in the 10 months of its fiscal year to June 30 rise to 12.9 percent from last year's 12.5 percent.
Part of the rise was attributable to disappointing sales in recent months at the company's 209 boutiques but another contributor was the decision to buy more inventory for its catalogue operations because levels had been too low last year.
"It costs more to fill out-of-stock orders, and sometimes customers cancel," said John B. Hatfield, the company's chief financial officer.

HEADLINE: One Grange Cultivates Farm Life

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEARSBURG, N.Y.

 BODY:
The cedar-shingled meeting hall for Searsburg Grange No. 494 is a reminder of a time when such halls were as common as one-room schools and general stores in villages and hamlets across the Northeast and much of rural America.
And in spite of evidence of roof leaks and mice, the Searsburg Grange -- unlike hundreds of others -- still has members and still holds meetings. 
 The Searsburg Grange is emblematic of how the organization and the rural culture it represents have changed over the decades. A retired Cornell University economist, John W. McConnell, has observed, "The history of the Grange is the history of agriculture in this country." But as the farmers have dwindled and farming ways have changed, so has the Grange, both nationally and in New York State.
Organized in 1885, the Searsburg Grange began with 19 charter members. Today, most Searsburg members are 70 or older and have been farmers or come from farming families. Of the 30 or so remaining members, about a dozen pay dues. The rest, by virtue of 50 or more years of membership, have been relieved of that obligation, joining the "Golden Sheaf." Searsburg even counts one 75-year member.
New York State has always been a major component of the Grange. One of the organization's seven founders was a grape grower from Steuben County. The first active local unit in the country was established in Fredonia, on April 16, 1868, and designated Fredonia No. 1. By 1933, New York had more members than any other state.
William S. Benson, 62, who is the Grange Master in the Empire State, has been a member for 20 years but has never been a farmer.
"The Grange began as an organization serving the rural area," Mr. Benson said, "and the people there happened to be farmers. It's not that way anymore."
A handful of men and women make up the Searsburg Grange's active core in this rural area about 60 miles southwest of Syracuse. Among them is Charles Lounsbery, 79 and one of the newest members. Born on a local farm, he spent most of his working life in Manhattan. But when he retired to central New York about 12 years ago, he joined the Grange.
A gardener and orchid enthusiast, he said he appreciated the organization's ties to the earth.
During an informal tour of the Grange Hall, he said, "There aren't many places like this left anymore, and once they were everywhere."
On a dirt road in this tiny hamlet, the aging Grange building has neither insulation nor plumbing, so Searsburg Grangers often hold meetings around potluck suppers in one another's homes. Talk at a recent meeting was accompanied by crockpot goulash and homemade rhubarb pies.
Several members brought plates of molasses drop cookies for a baking contest. After dinner, two guests at the meeting used detailed forms to score the cookies on shape, texture and taste. For her trouble, each judge received a $5 honorarium.
Part of the evening was also taken up by officers' reports and short readings and presentations, organized by an officer called the Lecturer and intended to educate and edify. Among the readings: a newsletter from a national church group warning of the emergence of a strong lesbian-feminist contingent in its midst. Afterward, some members said privately that the conservative tone of the reading did not necessarily represent everyone's view.
When Oliver H. Kelley and six acquaintances founded the National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry in 1867, they intended education of farmers as one of their purposes. The Grange was radical for its time, admitting men and women as equals and stressing common sense rather than religion and politics; like some other such groups it employed so-called secret rituals.
"The secrecy doesn't have the same meaning as when the Grange was formed," Mr. Benson said. "Some say, 'Throw that whole thing out.' But if we did, I think we'd be just another organization. So why don't we fold up all together and be another organization? We should respect where we come from. It gives us some kind of character."

HEADLINE: Electric Utilities Brace for an End to Monopolies

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
The electric utility industry, one of the last monopolies in the American economy, is bracing for competition, a change that is likely to eventually lower rates across the country.
Companies are scrambling to prepare by cutting their costs, diversifying and looking for partners. Late last month, two utilities in the Midwest announced a merger, citing "the advent of deregulation and increasing competition." 
 Other companies are trying to lock in customers with long-term contracts; last week, for example, Detroit Edison signed unusual 10-year contracts with the Big Three auto makers, cutting their rates in exchange for keeping them as customers until the year 2004.
What spurred all this activity is the expectation that the California Public Utilities Commission will let utilities compete for customers. The commission's plan has been widely interpreted in the industry as a sign that the days of government regulation and protected markets are coming to an end, just as they did for the long-distance telephone industry when court intervention broke up the Bell System and opened the long-distance telephone market to competition a decade ago.
"The transition is full of uncertainty," said Eugene R. McGrath, chairman, president and chief executive of Consolidated Edison, which provides power to the New York City area. "Is management capable? Can it adjust?"
The utilities are getting ready for a world that will seem very different, not only to themselves but also to their customers and the millions of Americans who own utilities shares.
In the future, large industrial users looking for lower electric rates will be able to shop around and even buy it from a plant a few states away. Residential customers and small businesses will also be allowed to shop around, eventually.
Electric utility companies will cut costs sharply to become more competitive, look for new markets outside their old service areas and enter new businesses like building power plants overseas. This cost-cutting will lead to more mergers.
One result of all the change is that utility stocks and bonds, long regarded as stable investments, will become much riskier because of the competition and the greater risks the companies take to deal with it. Indeed, some utilities, fixtures of American life for most of the century but unable to adapt, could go out of business.
Some experts inside and outside the industry say competition could also drive newly cost-conscious utilities to cut back on service and on programs like those that reduce costs for low-income customers. Environmentalists worry that progress in using power more efficiently and in developing alternative sources of energy, like the sun, wind and waste, will be slowed.
But many in the industry say they have no choice but to change.
"Just standing still is not only risky but suicidal," said Roger W. Hale, chairman and chief executive of the LG&E Energy Corporation in Louisville, Ky. The transmission system "used to be a wall that prevented everyone else from getting into your territory," he said.
"That's just no longer going to be possible," he continued. "That means that whoever can put together the lowest-cost supply of power is going to have the best access to the emerging market."
 
California Yet to Rule
 The coming changes seem much more imminent since the California commission announced in April that it would rule this year on whether to let out-of-state utilities sell power directly to industrial and commercial users in the state starting in 1996 and to residential users six years later.
Industry executives expect California to approve the plan -- and then, they say, the revolution will begin. Competition would drive down electricity rates in California and give the state an advantage in keeping its own industries and attracting new ones.
Weaker utilities, with high operating costs, could not afford to lower rates and would probably lose their best customers, the large industrial users. To make up for that lost business, the utilities would probably raise rates for their other customers, until they, too, were free to take their business elsewhere.
The threat of competition is also making some utilities ask state regulators for permission to pay off the bills for their nuclear plants more quickly, a move that could result in years of higher rates for consumers. The utilities hope that by the time competition comes the plants will be paid off and the companies will then have more freedom to lower rates.
The issue of paying for generating plants could slow some states from moving toward competition. Alfred E. Kahn, economics professor emeritus at Cornell University, said it would take New York, for example, at least five to seven years to allow competition because utilities in the state, which has some of the highest electricity rates in the country, still need to pay for the generating plants they built in the 1970's and 80's. State officials will "try to look at the benefits of competition, but they also have to find ways for the utilities to recover their costs," he said.
Investors in utility stocks, which usually pay high dividends, are also feeling shocks from the California proposal. A few weeks after the California announcement, the FPL Group, a utility holding company in Juno Beach, Fla., said it would slash its quarterly dividend 30 percent and use the money saved to position itself better for competition. The stock fell 14 percent.
 
Impact on Portfolios
 "That was the single most important event that galvanized investors," recalled Barry M. Abramson, an analyst for Prudential Securities. "They had been aware that the industry was changing for months and months. This showed that the changes could directly impact their portfolios."
In the last decade, through a combination of Federal laws and the utility industry's own reluctance to build plants because of their cost, a whole new industry of independent power producers has grown up. Companies like the U.S. Generating Company of Bethesda, Md., produce power at much lower rates than many regulated utilities, which, under Federal law, must buy some of the power that the independents produce. Federal law also requires the regulated utilities to transmit the power that the independents sell to wholesale customers like municipal utilities.
The independent producers have been responsible for 53 percent of the new generating capacity in the last four years. About 7 percent of the electricity produced in this country comes from independents. The independents have been clamoring to sell this power more easily to consumers but have not been able to because the transmission system is controlled by the regulated utilities. The utilities do not have to give the independents access to their retail customers.
Under the California plan, the state's three major investor-owned utilities would have to transmit over their lines the power that customers bought from other utilities. This, for the first time, would strip the three of their monopoly.
Although the details are far from complete, analysts envision that utilities would post their rates on electronic bulletin boards that customers could view on a cable television channel. After a customer chose a provider, the power would be delivered over existing lines and the customer would be billed by the utility that produced the power.
The independents have won support from big industrial customers, which want to shop around for cheaper power. Some industrial giants, including General Motors and Dow Chemical, have formed a group that is lobbying both the states and the Federal Government to let industrial customers shop for power.
Many in the utility industry think change is inevitable.
"Utilities who are looking to legislators and regulators to turn back the clock to protect them from competition would do better to prepare to meet the challenge," said James E. Rodgers Jr., chairman and chief executive of PSI Resources, a big utility in Indiana. "Policy makers at both the state and Federal level are recognizing that the advent of competition is not only inevitable but beneficial."
Some utilities are not waiting for deregulation to seek new markets. Mission Energy, a subsidiary of SCEcorp, which owns Southern California Edison, has built power plants in Australia, Indonesia and China.
Many industry analysts think the new era could lead to the bankruptcies of weaker utilities and force managers to focus almost exclusively on becoming low-cost producers.
Analysts say that Central Maine Power, the Long Island Lighting Company and Orange and Rockland Utilities may have a tough time under competition. They have high rates, a large base of industrial customers and little room to make up revenue if they lose those customers.
These three utilities largely rejected the analysts' perceptions, each contending that it had a diversified customer base and would compete as well as any other utility in a deregulated environment. Central Maine and Long Island Lighting said that their high rates were a result of taxes or state policies and that they were relatively efficient producers of energy. Orange and Rockland said its rates were not high compared with those of other utilities in New York.
 
Mergers Are Expected
 Analysts also expect a wave of mergers. Last week, for instance, the Iowa-Illinois Gas and Electric Company and Midwest Resources announced that they would merge. And Cincinnati Gas and Electric accepted a buyout bid last year from PSI Resources. PSI, however, had to fend off a hostile takeover bid for itself made by Ipalco, the parent company of Indianapolis Power and Light.
This preoccupation with size and with becoming more competitive worries some industry executives. S. David Freeman, president and chief executive of the New York Power Authority, a state utility that produces about 25 percent of New York's power, said at a recent meeting of about 500 utility executives in Albany, "If we just pay attention to price, the irony is that the consumer will pay the price."
He is afraid that in their attempt to reduce costs, utilities may cut back on things like service and programs to help low-income customers.
Environmentalists are concerned that utilities will work less hard to find ways to develop alternative sources of energy.
"If utilities are going to live or die solely by how low they can drive the short-term commodity price of electricity, they will have every reason to resist investments to reduce pollution or to help customers save energy," said Ralph Cavanagh, director of the energy program of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. He said he feared that utilities, instead of stressing conservation, would just try to sell as much power as they could to increase their revenues and profits.

HEADLINE: No Breakthrough in Syria, Christopher Says, but He Is Upbeat

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to the New York Times 

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Aug. 7

 BODY:
After his first face-to-face talks with Syria's leaders since Jordan and Israel signed their landmark friendship pact two weeks ago, Secretary of State Warren Christopher indicated tonight that there was still no breakthrough in the indirect peace talks between Israel and Syria.
Nonetheless, Mr. Christopher said that in his unusually long five-hour meeting tonight with President Hafez al-Assad, the two men were "laying the basis for future progress" in the drawn-out negotiations in which Israel has signaled that it would withdraw from the Golan Heights in exchange for a comprehensive peace with Syria. 
 American and Israeli officials said they did not expect an imminent breakthrough in the Syria talks, but several predicted that the Jordan-Israel accord would push Mr. Assad to move with more urgency to sign a peace agreement.
"In the immediate aftermath of the agreement, Mr. Assad won't want to be seen as walking in the footsteps of King Hussein of Jordan," a senior Israeli official said. "But Assad has always been known to be a very shrewd reader of the geopolitical environment, and as such he must realize that the environment has changed."
After tonight's meeting between Mr. Christopher and Mr. Assad, a senior Administration official said the indirect Syria-Israel talks had entered a new phase in which the two countries were explaining the security and political needs behind their proposals and then fashioning counterproposals that searched for common ground.
Mr. Christopher said the atmosphere had grown more upbeat. He noted that Syrian television had broadcast live the speeches of King Hussein of Jordan and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel when they signed their declaration in Washington. He also noted that in a speech last week Mr. Assad had talked about the importance of peace.
"We're seeing some positive things in the area of public diplomacy," Mr. Christopher said. His aides say President Assad's has been psychologically preparing the Syrian people for peace with their longtime enemy.
On Saturday night, Mr. Christopher met with Prime Minister Rabin in Jerusalem, and today he presented some of the Israeli's peace ideas to Mr. Assad.
On Monday, Mr. Christopher will meet with Mr. Rabin to report the results of tonight's meeting. He will join the Israeli Prime Minister in the Jordanian port city of Aqaba, where Mr. Rabin will meet with King Hussein and become the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit Jordan publicly after decades of secret contacts.
After a week in which Israel attacked southern Lebanon and Iranian-backed Party of God guerrillas fired rockets into Israel, Mr. Christopher said he had conveyed, not just on his own part but also on Israel's, a request that Syria press the Party of God to stop attacking Israel and end all terrorist activities.
In Washington's view, Iran has more sway over the Party of God than does Syria, but American officials say Syria, the dominant power in Lebanon, could suppress the militant Shiite Muslim group.
American officials accompanying Mr. Christopher indicated today that Martin Indyk, the National Security Council's chief specialist on the Middle East, had emerged as the leading candidate to be the new Ambassador to Israel.
To help entice Syria and other Arab countries to make peace with Israel, American officials announced in Jerusalem today that a conference would be held in Casablanca from Oct. 30 to Nov. 1 to promote economic development throughout the Middle East.
President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia will co-sponsor the conference, which will bring together officials and business leaders from more than a dozen countries. King Hassan of Morocco will be the host.
