Rule on Political Giving Delayed

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The rule-writing group for municipal bond dealers announced yesterday that it was delaying for at least two months the effective date of its rule on campaign contributions from bond underwriters to government officials who can award them municipal-bond business.
The basic proposal will remain unchanged. The rule bans an underwriting firm from doing business for two years with a state, local or other issuer of municipal bonds, if disallowed political contributions have been made. Contributions cannot be made to an official with a role in choosing a bond underwriter by the firm, employees of the firm's municipal bond department or top executives. 
 The group, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, said it had yet to finish writing its formal proposal and needed a delay, to at least March 1.
The board plans to submit the proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission by mid-January, according to Christopher Taylor, the group's executive director. The S.E.C. must give final approval to the rule.
Mr. Taylor said the board would pick an effective date at a meeting Monday, when the board would also discuss other possible changes in the proposed rule.
 
More Join in Ban
 In another development, the S.E.C. released a list showing that 23 firms doing municipal bond business have joined the 17 big Wall Street firms that initially endorsed a voluntary ban on political contributions in October.
The list of these additional firms, which was gathered by the Public Securities Association and given to the S.E.C. yesterday, includes mostly medium-sized and small firms.
The report of the new list comes as representatives from the original 17 firms are scheduled to meet today with the chairman of the S.E.C., Arthur Levitt Jr., to present their final rules for carrying out the ban they adopted in October. The meeting is in the New York office of the S.E.C.
One of the most closely examined parts of the voluntary ban will be how it deals with consultants that firms hire to help them get underwriting business. Many executives in the municipal bond business contend that the use of consultants is a way to get around a ban on political contributions.
Some executives and analysts have argued that the use of consultants should be further limited because they are often a way to win business by hiring the friends of bond issuers even if political contributions are never made. But it is not yet clear if either the voluntary ban or the separate rule being written by the municipal bond dealers board will expand the restraints on the use of consultants.
People involved in the writing of the voluntary ban have said that the ban will prohibit contributions made through consultants. And one said that there would be procedures outlined to make sure a firm could not just "close its eyes" and let the consulting firm do what it wanted.
The two-year business ban would also apply if the underwriting firm hired a consultant that had made political contributions. But it is possible that the municipal bond dealers Monday will consider further changes in the rules applying to consultants and on public disclosure of political contributions.
 
New York City
 The demand for New York City bonds yesterday was another sign of a sudden takeoff in the tax-exempt municipal bond market, which has been outperforming the Treasury market in the last several trading days.
Some analysts had thought this could be a difficult week for new bonds from New York City and New York State because several other issues were scheduled and there had been a rush of other New York paper recently. In addition, a recent report by a commission appointed by Mayor David N. Dinkins painted a grim picture of New York City's long-term budget problems, concluding that they were more serious than previously thought.
But some year-end buying, a new focus on how this year's rise in the top income tax rate makes the yield on municipal bonds even more attractive and some relief that the supply of new issues next year will be slowing has suddenly made tax-exempt bonds the thing to buy.
Because of the interest from buyers, the underwriters, lead by Prudential Securities, were able to cut the yields on the issue significantly when they repriced the issue in the afternoon.
For example, the long-term bonds due in 2015, 2016, and 2017 were priced to yield 5.90 percent after being initially priced to yield 5.98 percent. the yields on other maturities were lowered by about five basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
 
Treasury Market
 Treasury prices and yields were little changed yesterday as traders and investors awaited the two key inflation reports for November, which are due tomorrow and Friday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond due in August 2023 was unchanged as the yield remained at 6.16 percent. The price of the two-year Treasury note was off 1/32 as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.17 percent, from 4.15 percent Monday.

HEADLINE: Seeing Poor in Greater Need, Donors Give More

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Charities in New York City see a spontaneous increase in donations this time of year. For some people, the gifts are as integral to their Christmas or Hanukkah traditions as trimming the tree or lighting the candles of the menorah. Others give in remembrance of a mother, a father or even a teacher whose absence is felt more acutely during the holidays.
Still others donate because they see the gap between the haves and have-nots yawning wider at this time. 
 With the latter in mind, many people have begun to contribute to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, making its 82d annual appeal. In dozens of letters accompanying checks, contributors say they are giving because the plight of the poor seems worse than in the past.
"During previous campaigns I have read of the start of the fund, decades ago," wrote Arthur D. Tenenholtz of Brooklyn, who sent $75, marking his eighth year of giving. "Of late, I am beginning to believe that New York more closely resembles those years than the city of my youth. Surely, the Neediest Cases Fund is more necessary now than it was a few years ago."
 
Origins of the Campaign
 The campaign began when the city was experiencing many of the same problems as in the recent recession: widespread unemployment, growing numbers of homeless people and a large population of poor immigrants. One such immigrant, an orphan from Denmark, made an impression on Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The New York Times, on Christmas Day in 1911, when the man asked Mr. Ochs for money for food and shelter.
Mr. Ochs helped the man and decided the following year to begin a campaign publicizing the city's "100 Neediest Cases," reasoning that if readers were more aware of the conditions of the poor they would give money to help. That year, $3,630.88 was distributed by three social-service agencies. This year, seven agencies will depend on the campaign for millions of dollars in help. The Times pays all of the campaign's expenses so that all of the money is given directly to the charities.
Ruth A. Unterberg of Manhattan sent a note saying she was increasing her gift to $200 because of what she sees on the streets. "I'm very concerned with the growing number of men, women and children who need financial assistance with housing, food and clothing," she wrote.
Others, like Mary Pierce of Wilton, Conn., gave despite their own economic pressures. "I felt badly that my own income was so low last year that I was unable to give as I had been each year since my beloved redheads were born Dec. 25, 1987," she wrote, referring to her twin granddaughters. This year, Mrs. Pierce gave $30 for each of the five years that her granddaughters have graced her life, or $150 in all. "In the hopes that it will ease the lives of some other children in New York City," she said.
Other contributors give with the boundless hope that the future will be better. "I am 9 years old and I am lucky to have a lot of things I could possibly want," wrote Jeremy Schwartz of Brooklyn, in a letter with his donation. "I decided to give $20 to the Fund to help kids that can't get anything they possibly want."

Cocoa Prices Fall as Traders Study Ivory Coast Situation

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Cocoa prices declined yesterday despite worries that supply might be reduced by political uncertainty after the death of the Ivory Coast's President.
March cocoa briefly jumped to a new high of $1,318 a metric ton but then sank as investors took profits. The contract closed $12 lower at $1,281 a ton on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. 
 The Ivory Coast is a leading cocoa supplier. But Judith Ganes, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, said it was too early to determine the impact of the death of President Felix Houphouet-Boigny on the market.
"The only thing that could cause a problem is civil unrest, but otherwise cocoa is too important for their economy and they need the money from its exports," Ms. Ganes said.
 Cocoa prices have risen from a low of $984 in August because of poor crops in the Ivory Coast and Brazil.
Mr. Houphouet-Boigny, Africa's longest-serving head of state, will likely be succeeded by either the Speaker of Parliament, Henri Konan-Bedie, or Prime Minister Alassane Ouattara.
At the same commodity exchange, coffee prices soared and dipped violently. March coffee reached an early high of 76.95 cents a pound, then fell to a low of 75.50 cents before closing 0.80 cent higher at 76.75 cents a pound.
 Meanwhile, oil prices posted small gains in volatile trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange. January crude oil ended 13 cents higher at $14.70 a barrel. It hit a new five-year low of $14.51 during the session and then rose to $15.03.
 The president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Abdullah al-Attiyah of Qatar, dashed any remaining hopes for an emergency meeting or any OPEC output cuts yesterday, saying that the organization would stay with its September agreement.
 January heating oil fell 0.02 cent, to 44.54 cents a gallon, and January unleaded gas rose 0.39 cent, to 40.77 cents a gallon.
 In Chicago, rice prices posted another advance. At the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, January delivery rough rice was up another 37 cents per hundred pounds at $12.81 -- double the $6.34 level seen in September.

Ignoring Economic Gains, The Dollar Barely Moves

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar ended narrowly mixed yesterday as investors remained on the sidelines, apparently worried that the dollar had not been able to capitalize on evidence of gains in the broader United States economy.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery, the most actively traded futures contract, gained $1.50 in late trading, settling at $379.30 an ounce. The Republic National Bank quoted the spot price of gold at $377.50 an ounce, up $1.50 from Monday. 
 David Durst, a vice president at Bear, Stearns, said the market was assessing the dollar's surprising weakness over the last few sessions in spite of a variety of positive American economic news.
Many dealers who had been positioned for a dollar rally were particularly frustrated with the dollar's inability to make headway after a report on Friday of a robust gain in payrolls in November and a decrease in the nation's unemployment.
"People are really trying to determine what Friday's reversal meant to the big picture," Mr. Durst said, "and whether it broke the back of the dollar's rally."
Dealers also said that activity slowed with the approach of the holidays, and as many traders have begun squaring their books in anticipapation of the year's end.
In foreign-currency dealings, the dollar rose slightly to 1.7018 German marks late yesterday in New York from 1.7005 marks late Monday. But it slid to 107.53 Japanese yen, from 107.96 yen Monday. Dealers said that a large speculative purchase of yen from an overseas buyer helped depress the dollar against the yen.
The British pound closed in New York at $1.4930, down from $1.5040 late Monday. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late quotes, included: 1.4593 Swiss francs, down from 1.4600; 5.8560 French francs, up from 5.8430; 1,676 Italian lire, down from 1,681, and 1.3231 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3221.

HEADLINE: Brazil Plans Price Index

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso disclosed plans today to stabilize the economy through an anti-inflation price index that could lead to a new currency.
Mr. Cardoso warned of chaos in Brazil, Latin America's biggest country, if Congress blocked the Government's proposals aimed at curbing inflation of 35 percent a month. 
 Mr. Cardoso said at a news conference that his program to stabilize the economy was based on a balanced 1994 budget, a price index pegging the cruzeiro real to the dollar and the creation of a new currency.
The moves were "steps that are going to put Brazil on the road to eliminating the deficit, driving down inflation and giving Brazilians a strong currency," he said.
A single price index would peg Brazil's currency to the United States dollar and would be called the "real value unit." Mr. Cardoso said its imposition would be gradual and would occur only after Congress had approved a balanced budget and constitutional changes.
The index would calculate Government increases for things like interest rates, prices and utility rates. Its use by the private sector would be voluntary.
The index would eventually form the basis for a "strong currency with stable purchasing power," replacing the cruzeiro real, he said.

Yankees Find Roster Holes That Might Be Hard to Fill

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
Left field is barren, the closer seat belongs to a novice and the starting rotation will remain unchanged unless some expensive contracts are trimmed. Welcome to another wacky off season with the Yankees.
Dion James has left New York to play baseball in Japan, Lee Smith was not offered salary arbitration yesterday so he has left for a place that will be determined later and the players the Yankees would like to discard are not moving via trades. 
 The latest problem to blindside the Yankees is the void in left field. Will they find a capable left-handed hitting reserve to replace James? Should they consider Rickey Henderson? Should they scrap their $45 million budget to chase Rafael Palmeiro and convert him into an outfielder? Are they still sour on Tim Raines?
While James fled to play for twice the amount New York had offered him and unearthed new questions about the outfield, the Yankees did answer one question by declining to offer Smith arbitration and thus losing their right to negotiate with him until May 1. Basically, the Yankees ended their association with the career saves leader because he will surely sign a contract before then.
 
Hernandez the Yankee Closer?
 Because Smith saved 43 games for the St. Louis Cardinals and three more after being traded to New York, the Yankees were worried that he could receive as much as $4 million in arbitration and disrupt their budget. Since they passed on Smith and have shown scant interest in re-signing Steve Farr, the Yankees seem prepared to enter the season with Xavier Hernandez as their closer. The 28-year-old has never been a full-time closer.
In an off season that has been dominated by their futile attempts to secure another quality starting pitcher, the latest problem appeared after James agreed to a two-year contract for almost $4 million with the Chunichi Dragons of the Japanese League. It was about $2 million more than the Yankees offered. Although James was not the full-time left fielder, he was a superb reserve who hit .332 in 343 at-bats.
Michael did not return telephone messages, but he has previously declined comment on Henderson. The career stolen-bases leader turns 35 on Christmas Day, and teams have so far been hesitant to pursue him. So hesitant that Dennis Gilbert, his agent, called selected sportswriters last week to interview Henderson and try to arouse interest.
 
'A Logical Fit'
 "I think he's always felt that the Yankees were a logical fit," Ken Gurnick, one of Gilbert's associates, said of Henderson. "He's played there before. He's handled the New York media. Without Dion James, it would make it even more likely."
Although speculation about Henderson returning to New York has been rampant, George Steinbrenner told Yankee officials after the season that he was not interested. But that was before James left.
"Going into 1994, I heard they were talking about getting Rickey or Palmeiro," James said. "If that would have happened, Dion James would have been back on the bench and not getting any publicity at all."
Because of the substantial offer from Chunichi and the guarantee of playing every day, the 31-year-old James happily departed.
"You're talking to a man who was unemployed three years ago and whose career was over," James said. "Then Gene Michael gave me an opportunity and I got back on my feet. I made a business decision. I got two years of security. This was the chance of a lifetime."
 
INSIDE PITCH
 The Yanks did not offer arbitration to MIKE WITT and had already not offered it to STEVE FARR and FRANK TANANA, free agent repeaters, in October. Interestingly, they offered arbitration to DION JAMES as a precaution in case his Japanese contract hits a snag.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
China and Global Warming

BYLINE: By PHILIP M. BOFFEY

 BODY:
If global warming materializes as the threat many scientists predict, the world's ability to head it off may well be determined by China. The United States is currently the world's leading emitter of carbon dioxide, the chief man-made contributor to global warming. But rapid economic growth and heavy reliance on dirty fuel may soon propel China toward that unenviable distinction.
China's pell-mell industrialization is powered largely by huge reserves of coal, the dirtiest of fuels in carbon emissions. Three-quarters of China's energy needs, from factories to home heating, are now met by burning coal. The result is all too palpable, as I found on a visit to several provinces late this summer. Noxious fumes sting the eyes of city dwellers, haze obscures the views, and acid rain falls as far as Japan in one direction and southwest China in another. More worrisome for the rest of the world, China's smokestacks spew tons of carbon into the atmosphere, increasing the buildup of heat-trapping gases. 
 China already ranks third in carbon dioxide emissions, behind the U.S. and the former Soviet Union, and when Soviet emissions are split among the newly independent republics, China may well be second. Emissions will almost certainly climb higher as China's economy expands and its population grows bigger and richer. Chinese consumers will inevitably seek a higher standard of living, with more cars, more refrigerators, more home heating, more consumer goods, all requiring more energy to produce and operate.
Chinese energy and environmental officials expect coal consumption to rise from the current level of 1.1 billion tons a year to more than 1.4 billion tons by the year 2000 -- and carbon emissions are expected to rise sharply as a consequence. One American projection even suggests that China could pass the U.S. in carbon emissions by the year 2025, though China's own projections suggest the U.S. will still lead the pack.
The outlook would be even worse had China not done an exemplary job of controlling its energy appetite despite furious economic expansion. The Chinese have made astonishing gains in industrial efficiency over the past decade, thereby holding energy growth to half the rate of economic growth. But most analysts think the easy part has been accomplished and that further gains will be much harder.
Chinese officials, though not fully convinced of the global warming threat, recognize the need to head it off. Qu Geping, the Government's top environmental official, said in an interview that even before global warming is fully proved all countries should take steps to control carbon dioxide emissions.
In a wide-ranging effort to boost its economy and clean its environment, China is already taking steps that will have the beneficial side effect of reducing carbon emissions. Such programs include a big hydroelectric project in the Three Gorges area of the Yangtze River that will produce power without emitting carbon dioxide; a tree-planting program that has increased forest coverage for the first time in years; the building of large generating plants for greater efficiency, and experiments with cleaner approaches to home heating. Zha Keming, Vice Minister of Electric Power, believes that nuclear power, which emits no carbon dioxide, could become the chief energy source 50 years from now.
Global warming, if it occurs, could harm China itself, an added reason for curbing emissions. But China's leaders do not appear to give the threat high priority. They point out, correctly, that industrialized nations emit far more carbon dioxide per capita than China and have done so for a very long time. Those nations, they imply, should bear the brunt of cleaning up the mess. And when Chinese officials are asked what environmental problems are most acute, they invariably cite urban air pollution, population growth, clean water or soil erosion. No one cites the distant prospect of global warming.
There is no doubt that the nations of the world will need to enlist China if they ever unite to head off global warming. That could pose some very hard questions for the West, such as whether to subsidize China's conversion to cleaner fuels and more efficient factories, or whether to allow Western companies to meet emissions goals through investments in China. But without forceful action, whatever progress is made elsewhere in curbing carbon emissions could be undercut by an enormous increase in emissions from China. PHILIP M. BOFFEY

HEADLINE: Help Welfare Clients, Not Their Employers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President Clinton's plan to aid employers who hire welfare recipients is not a new idea (front page, Nov. 28). Unfortunately, such efforts have a long history of failure. 
 Our welfare system is based on the English Poor Laws. England's Speenhamland Law of the 1800's was started as an aid-in-wages, ostensibly benefiting employees, but actually using public means to subsidize employers. The primary result was to depress wages. In some geographic areas only those people covered by welfare had a chance of employment and those who tried to keep off the dole were hardly able to secure work.
Between 1815 and 1830 the Speenhamland scale was reduced by one-third. It was not simply the rise in welfare costs that caused calamity but rather the economic effect of a subsidy to employers in reducing the productivity of labor that was the root of the trouble.
The Clinton Presidential campaign devoted considerable attention to the notion of a "high-wage, high-skill work force." The subsidy of a low-wage, low-skill work force will not achieve that goal. Such a strategy will instead reduce productivity as the Speenhamland law did.
Welfare reform is indeed long overdue. Expansion of special programs like the Jobs Corps, to assist the long-term unemployed, is essential. But we must bear in mind the history of the Speenhamland Law if we are not to repeat the mistakes of the past. To "end welfare as we know it" we should help recipients, not subsidize employers.

HEADLINE: International Report Card Shows U.S. Schools Work

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
In contrast to studies that have painted grim portraits of American education, a new report finds that compared with other industrialized nations, the United States does a reasonably good job of educating its citizens and preparing them for work.
The report, issued yesterday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, based in Paris, indicated that American students lag only slightly behind their counterparts around the world in math and science and that a higher than average percentage of American students get college educations. 
 The United States spends more per student on higher education each year than any other nation -- about $13,000 compared with the average of $6,000 to $7,000 for the 24 countries surveyed. Thirty-six percent of Americans between the ages of 25 and 64 have college degrees -- among the highest percentage in the world. In addition, the percentage of women enrolled in colleges or universities is higher in the United States than in other countries.
 
Public-Private Ties
 At a time when all industrialized nations are grappling with how to train a work force for the future, the report calls for stronger ties between employers and educational systems. It notes in particular "the need for sound initial education," for "better integration between academic and vocational studies" and for "an adult training system adapted to the needs of employers, workers and nonworkers."
Although American colleges and universities are improving their efforts to prepare students for the workplace, much of the real training is being done by two-year community colleges, a long tradition that is being strengthened through Federal, state and local grants.
The report offers a statistical portrait of American education that is far more favorable than several studies undertaken in recent years by American educators. Much previous research indicated that American students lagged their counterparts elsewhere in core academic subjects and that scores on standardized college entrance exams have been sliding in recent years.
 
Scores Are Stabilizing
 But in recent years, the free fall in entrance exams has stopped, and scores in math and science have stabilized. The study released today finds, for example, that American students score above average in reading comprehension and about average in science.
The study also showed that, despite criticism of early childhood education in the United States, 90.2 percent of all 5-year-olds attend public or private early childhood programs, a percentage that places the United States among the top 5 of the 24 nations surveyed.
Describing the report as "full of pluses and minuses," Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said yesterday that the study "illustrates why the American habit of being comfortable with just being average comes up short in the new global economic environment." Mr. Riley said the report "confirms why there is an urgent need to press ahead in our continuing efforts to give every American child a world-class education."
The United States' proportion of science graduates in the labor force -- 653 per 100,000 -- is slightly higher than the proportion in other nations. While lagging behind Britain and Japan, it is about the same as Germany.
Although only 15.3 percent of all college degrees awarded in 1991 in the United States were in the sciences -- math, computer science, engineering or natural science -- more people attended college, producing more science graduates for the work force.
In Germany, 32 percent of all degrees are in the sciences, but the percentage of people attending college is less than half that of the United States. In Japan, 25.7 percent of degrees are in the sciences, but the percentage of people attending college is only two-thirds the rate in the United States.
 
Competing Pressures
 On the whole, American colleges and universities continue to outstrip competing systems, not only in the total number of graduates but in dollars spent for education. The United States spends $13,639 on each college and university student. The vast majority of other countries spend between $6,000 to $7,000 per student, the study indicated.
Not surprisingly, the study indicated, the more educated a worker is, the better his or her financial rewards. This is especially true in free-market systems.
Among the educational strengths and weaknesses cited in the report, France and Finland had the highest literacy rates, Belgium had the lowest student-teacher ratio, and Portugal, which recently expanded its public education, ranked lowest in math achievement, behind the United States and Spain.
The report is a systematic comparison of education in the industrialized world by what is essentially an international research center specializing in the economies of its member nations. The first such study by the 33-year-old organization, which includes the European Community and the G-7 nations, was done last year. This year's study is more encompassing, taking into account different structures in educational systems.
While the report calls for increased attention to linking educational systems with employment, United States educators have a history of resisting what they perceive as the vocationalizing of academic studies.
"There's pressure pushing the university to emphasize occupational education, and there's counterpressure to offer all kids a liberal arts education," said Michael W. Kirst, a professor of education at Stanford University and an expert on the politics of education. "The way American colleges and universities have dealt with this is specialized institutions."
Some institutions, particularly comprehensive state university systems, have established schools in engineering, nursing, medicine and other professions. "The question is whether you want to standardize higher education in America," Mr. Kirst said. "Our response in America has been pluralism."
The report and its authors also helped explain some of the shortcomings of American public schools, in which high school students spend about 25 hours a week in actual course work, compared with 38 hours for Finnish students.
 
Difference in Focus
 "In the United States, schools are given a wider mandate than almost all of your competitive countries," said Albert Tuijnman, an economist and one of three authors of the study. "The health, social services and sports functions are considered important, but there is a distinct difference in the focus of an American school."
Mr. Tuijnman also suggested that inefficiencies in spending, on everything from books to buildings, and little involvement by teachers in decisions involving schools contributed to the mixed academic performance by American students.
The United States spent $5,177 per student in primary grades for the 1990-91 academic year, the highest of any nation, and $6,472 per student in secondary grades, the third highest, Mr. Tuijnman said.
In reading, American 14-year-olds outperformed students in 12 other nations. (Not all comparisons covered all 24 member nations because of incompatible data.)
In math, American students scored at the bottom of the scale, just behind Spanish students and ahead of only Portuguese students.
In science, American students scored about the same as their counterparts in Canada, England, France, Scotland and Spain.
The United States' scores were compiled from 16 public school systems, a representative sampling that included suburban and rural systems as well as schools in New York City, Washington, Chicago, Atlanta and Dallas.
While the United States spends considerable sums for public education, the authors of the report said many of the extra dollars went not into the classroom but to workers other than teachers.
Teachers make up 2.6 percent of the American work force. Custodians, bus drivers, cafeteria workers and maintenance workers represent 2.9 percent of the work force, and they are typically paid from school budgets. In other nations, such services are supported by private enterprise, an idea just beginning to find favor in the United States as evidence grows that private companies can provide services like transportation and cleaning for less money than school systems spend.
The center is part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of the world's industrialized nations that was formed in 1960 to study common issues. The organization measures unemployment rates, tracks trade volume and studies how the economic decisions of individual nations affect the world economy.

HEADLINE: CLINTON PROPOSES TOUGH NEW RULES ON BIAS BY BANKS

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration proposed tough new tests today that are intended to insure that banks end discrimination in their lending to members of minority groups and to people with low and moderate incomes.
The changes are the latest effort by the Administration to broaden access to credit, financial services and investments. Officials predicted that people and businesses in these groups would gain access that they might not otherwise get to billions of dollars in credit once the proposals take effect in 1995. 
 The regulations, which set higher standards for banks, for the first time apply objective measurements on three levels. Banks would be tested in several ways to determine if their overall pattern of lending in specific neighborhoods was biased, when compared to their overall lending and those of competitors. They would also be judged on whether they were making investments in a community's growth, like grants for economic redevelopment, and whether they were providing a full array of customer services.
 
Concrete Penalties
 Although Federal examiners would still have a fair amount of leeway in determining whether an institution was complying with the law, banks could for the first time face sanctions like binding orders or fines to change their practices.
That would give regulators additional power. Now, a bank's poor record in this area can affect whether the Government will permit bank acquisitions or mergers, and institutions that fall short have been sued by community groups or regulators. Lately, Federal regulators have blocked bank acquisitions when they regarded a lending pattern unfavorably.
The proposal is the most important modification of equal-lending enforcement since 1977, when Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act. That law was intended to force banks to make loans to individuals, businesses and groups in neighborhoods that many large financial institutions had shunned.
While the law has been effective in some ways, there were growing complaints from consumer groups that the method for evaluating a bank's lending activity was too lenient. While it has been hard to measure how much discrimination has gone on, numerous studies, including one from bank regulators, reported that minority-group applicants for home mortgages, for instance, were denied loans at a higher rate than whites were offered even when other social factors were considered.
Banks did not like the law and its regulations because compliance required excessive paper work.
Under the newly proposed standards, regulators would evaluate banks based on specific lending and market-share data that would measure actual lending. But they would not set fixed credit quotas. The proposal is subject to further review and debate for two months, but faces no major opposition and requires no Congressional action.
Today, consumer groups and banking organizations, which have not seen eye to eye on lending regulations, praised the central elements of the Administration's plan, although each side found something to criticize in the details.
The Administration, which promised the changes months ago, has been pressing on several fronts to increase lending in poor and ethnic-minority communities. The issue of fair credit has been increasingly prominent in recent years, as several studies have shown that banks have persistently failed to provide equal credit opportunities, despite laws and regulations.
Eugene A. Ludwig, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Administration's leading advocate of fairer lending practices, said the new approach emphasized "performance over paper work."
All four Federal banking agencies are expected to issue similar rules. But some members of the Federal Reserve Board, which plays a crucial role in enforcing the law, are less enthusiastic than some of the other agencies about the new approach, something that is likely to emerge at the board's meeting on its proposed regulations on Friday.
In particular, the Fed has opposed the collection of racial data on small-business loans, as is done already with mortgage loans. Advocates of more aggressive enforcement of the fair lending law called this an important gap in the proposed new rules.
"The Fed appears to have won many of the key battles in the fights among agencies over these rules," said Deepak Bhargava of Acorn, a national group that lobbies for lending and housing reform. "I would almost characterize their efforts here as obstruction of the President's efforts. I would call them the George Wallace of C.R.A. reform, blocking the door to getting something done."
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a governor of the Federal Reserve, who appeared with other officials at the White House to discuss the proposal, said in a telephone interview that he and his colleagues had some concerns about the proposals, but were not at odds with the other banking agencies.
"This is a very radical proposal; there is no question about it," said Mr. Lindsey, who heads the board's committee on the Community Reinvestment Act. "It will benefit at this stage from public comment. We are going where no man has gone before, and if you do that, I think you want to do it right."
Among bankers, Leo F. Mullin, president of the First Chicago Corporation, said, "The proposal represents a positive and promising step toward improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the Community Reinvestment Act."
Michelle Meier, counsel for government affairs at Consumers Union, said, "The Clinton Administration is on the right track."
 
Banks Like Some Changes
 Banks welcomed the fact that smaller institutions, with assets of less than $250 million, would be eligible for streamlined examinations, and that banks would have the option of developing pre-approved plans for compliance, so that they could then be evaluated against those plans.
For the first time, banks would have to publish data detailing where in their marketing areas they provided services like checking accounts and automated teller machines, and what types of community investments they had made.
In the past, they had to document their efforts to expand operations throughout their local markets, but these might not be good indications of actual lending.
In the end, regulators based assessments on 12 factors, a time-consuming process that often resulted in subjective judgments..
The new rules set three evaluation standards for banks to meet. If a banks was given relatively low ratings on the tests, it would have time to improve before facing sanctions.
The lending test would evaluate direct lending as well as indirect lending through participation in loan pools or credit subsidiaries.
The service test would evaluate the bank's branch network in low- and moderate-income areas, and the availability of credit services like counseling.
An investment test would take into account investments in groups that foster community development, minority ownership of businesses, and affordable housing. It would also look at, for example, whether the bank is buying community bonds for housing or hospital financing.
Under the lending test, a bank would be evaluated in two ways.
First, its loans would be assessed to see how its lending patterns compared with other banks operating in the same local markets.
In a second and separate test, its loans would be analyzed without regard to how other institutions were performing, but on whether its loans were concentrated in one part of its market. Agencies would examine the ratio of the bank's loans made in neighborhoods of low and moderate income in comparison to loans throughout its service area.
The regulations would not require a bank to offer specific types of loans, to make any particular loan or investment, or to make loans or investments that were expected to lose money or otherwise undermine the bank's safety or soundness.

HEADLINE: Court Weighs Abortion Protest Curbs

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
The argument that abortion clinics can invoke the Federal racketeering law to sue violent anti-abortion protest groups got a receptive hearing at the Supreme Court today. As their past decisions indicated, the Justices appeared reluctant to write into the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act any limits that Congress did not put there when it passed the law in 1970.
The question for the Court today was whether the racketeering law, known as RICO, requires proof that the defendants -- in this case, Operation Rescue and a coalition of clinic protest groups called the Pro-Life Action League -- were motivated by a desire for economic gain. 
 Two lower Federal courts, finding that the groups' actions were aimed at driving abortion clinics out of business rather than making money for themselves, held that RICO did not apply and dismissed a suit brought by the National Organization for Women on behalf of two abortion clinics.
But "Congress didn't say a word about economic motive" when it wrote the law, Fay Clayton, a lawyer for NOW, said at the beginning of her argument. It was a simple argument that the Justices, well versed in RICO's intricacies from a series of Supreme Court decisions interpreting the law broadly, appeared to find compelling.
 
Lawyer in Uphill Battle
 The lawyer for the anti-abortion groups, G. Robert Blakey, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame who wrote much of the RICO legislation while serving as a Senate staff counsel, had an uphill battle before a skeptical Court.
The question of whether the law requires economic motive, and whether it can apply to abortion clinic protests, has been alive in the lower courts for years. This case, which began in 1986, assumed particular significance earlier this year after the Supreme Court ruled in an unrelated case that Federal judges did not have authority to protect abortion clinics from violent protests.
The Court based that decision on a section of a 19th-century law, the Ku Klux Klan Act, which numerous Federal courts had invoked for that purpose. The ruling, in Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, appeared to leave RICO as the only Federal law available to the clinics.
Since then the landscape has changed considerably. Both houses of Congress have passed similar versions of a bill known as the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which makes it a Federal crime to damage an abortion clinic or to use force or intimidation against the clinic's patients. The bill, which has the Clinton Administration's support, is expected to receive final passage next year.
The Ku Klux Klan Act has also been revived as a potential source of protection for the clinics. In a ruling in October, a Federal appellate court permitted a suit under a section of the law that the Supreme Court did not address in the Bray decision.
But even if RICO is not the only law in the Federal arsenal available to abortion clinics, this case, NOW v. Scheidler, No. 92-780, is still important. The racketeering law is a powerful tool under which successful plaintiffs receive triple damages. The clinic protest groups have argued that its application to what they describe as a social protest movement would threaten their constitutional right to free speech.
 
A 'Campaign of Terror'
 Ms. Clayton, arguing for NOW, sought to deflect that concern, describing the protest groups as conducting a "nationwide campaign of terror."
When Justice Antonin Scalia offered an analogy between the clinic protests and a campaign to persuade supermarkets to stop selling grapes, Ms. Clayton said there was a difference between peaceful picketing and the violent incidents at abortion clinics.
"We treasure the defendants' First Amendment rights like we treasure our own," she said, adding that abortion protesters are constitutionally protected "when they picket, when they pray, when they leaflet, when they petition Congress." The racketeering law would apply only when advocacy becomes force and violence, she added.
The law makes it a crime to conduct the "affairs" of an "enterprise" through a "pattern of racketeering activity." In dismissing the NOW lawsuit, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, ruled that the clinics' allegations, if proved at trial, would show that the protesters had engaged in a pattern of extortion, a crime listed in the law's definition of "racketeering activity." But the appellate court ruled that the word "enterprise" indicated that Congress meant RICO to apply only to economically motivated crimes.
 
Emphasis on Illicit Gain
 Mr. Blakey, representing the anti-abortion groups, offered several arguments based on the text of the law. "This statute can be summed up in two words: illicit gain," he said, adding, "The common, everyday meaning of 'enterprise' is a business venture."
He also said the Hobbs Act, the Federal extortion law cited by the appeals court, did not cover the clinic protests. And he said the law's reference to conducting the "affairs" of an enterprise implicitly meant business affairs.
All Mr. Blakey's arguments met with a skeptical response from the Court, particularly the last.
"Affairs cover all sizes and shapes," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told Mr. Blakey. "There are private affairs, family affairs," she said, noting that Congress could have said "business affairs" if that was what it meant.
Finally, Mr. Blakey asked the Justices to read the law as a whole, rather than focus on any particular word. "Interpretation of this statute is a holistic endeavor," he said.
The Clinton Administration argued on behalf of the abortion clinics. Miguel A. Estrada, a lawyer in the Solicitor General's office, said that reading an economic motive requirement into the law "would really cripple the role Congress thought RICO would play."

HEADLINE: Can Unions Run United Airlines?

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
As the unions for United Airlines strive to conclude their six-year effort to buy the company with negotiations this week in New York and wrap up the host of financial questions, one overarching question remains: Can employees really take over a business that is so big and so complex?
 While there are few parallels in the airline industry, workers have taken over companies in a variety of industries. And as those experiences suggest, making employee ownership work is difficult, but possible.
Some of the employee-owned companies, like the Avis car-rental company, have prospered. But in the case of United, skeptical investors and analysts fear, as Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst at Kidder, Peabody, said, that "the interest of minority shareholders would get lost to job preservation issues." 
 The ideal of employee ownership is that workers will care more about their company and managers will involve them more in the company's affairs. Several recent studies have found that employee ownership alone does not affect large companies' performance, but when the workers are drawn into day-to-day management, those companies do markedly better.
 
'Culture Change' Held Needed
 And there is a hurdle for United, which has had its share of battles with labor. "Only a real culture change can bring this about," said Joseph R. Blasi, a professor of management and labor relations at Rutgers University.
Still, it has been done before. Although Avis is private, it is often held up as a standard.
After workers took over the company in 1987, Avis created what were called employee empowerment groups that meet monthly with management to make suggestions about running the company. The success of Avis's Employee Stock Ownership Plan is perhaps best measured by the rise in the company's stock value, as appraised by outsiders, from just over $5 a share at the time of the buyout to $18 a share recently.
Avis employees were not required to sacrifice anything personally to help finance the transaction. In contrast, many E.S.O.P.'s like the one at the Weirton Steel Corporation, were formed in exchange for large concessions from workers -- as would be the case at United.
When Weirton's workers took over the company in 1984, their interests appeared aligned with management. The worker-owners accepted layoffs and wage and benefit cuts of 32 percent. In 1989, the company sold 4.5 million shares to the public, letting Weirton invest $550 million to modernize its plant and buy back shares from some of Weirton's 6,100 employees.
But then the recession hit, Weirton started losing money, and the workers began pointing fingers at management and directors. They were the target in workers' recent protests of a stock offering intended to help pay down debt.
"While you're making money, nobody cares," Rick Garan, a company spokesman, said. "Once things go awry, blame is always easy to dish out."
The airline industry offers a mixed record on employee ownership, which was used in the early 1980's to help win concessions at carriers including Pan Am, Eastern, Western, Republic and Trans World Airlines. Employees were awarded stakes ranging from 12 percent to 32 percent with seats on the board of directors.
 
T.W.A.'s Unions Quarreled
 Indeed, even at T.W.A., which is in its second round of swapping concessions for equity, employee ownership has had different results.
To help restructure itself to get out of bankruptcy, T.W.A. gave its workers 45 percent of the company last year in exchange for $660 million in concessions.
Since then, pilots have spent their own money on billboard and radio advertisements urging consumers to try the airline. Flight attendants, machinists and pilots have frequently visited travel agents to pitch the airline's service, which now includes extra leg room in all classes of seats.
Their extra effort, especially during flights, has apparently paid off. In a recent survey by J. D. Power & Associates, the research firm best known for its car surveys, business travelers rated T.W.A. as the best airline on long flights, and second only to Delta on short flights.
But T.W.A.'s three largest labor groups -- pilots, mechanics and flight attendants -- have not always pulled together.
 
A Pilot Initiative Generally
 Typically the pilots initiate concessions-for-equity swaps because, with many pilots at major carriers earning over $100,000 a year, they are best able to absorb the cuts. They also have the most to lose if they are laid off, because getting bumped to the bottom of the seniority list at another carrier results in a sharp pay cut.
The pilots initiated the stock ownership proposal at T.W.A. in the mid-1980's, in return for concessions that enabled Carl C. Icahn to buy the company. The machinists reluctantly agreed, but the flight attendants struck.
A principal reason that labor groups at Northwest Airlines disagreed on swapping concessions for a big minority stake concerned shared sacrifice. Pilots said that all workers should give up an equal percentage in salary, benefits and work rules; the flight attendants and machinists argued that because pilots' salaries were so much higher, they should pay a higher percentage.
The split led to fractured negotiations that were resolved only hours before Northwest planned to file for bankruptcy last summer.
 
Northwest Machinists Critical
 Since the swap, the machinists' union at Northwest has been a lone and vocal critic of airline management, sending out frequent news releases boasting of a "steady barrage of attacks" on Northwest executives who "still very much like the indentured servant management model."
Martin Shugrue, the trustee for Eastern Airlines who also led concessionary bargaining in the early 1980's while at Pan Am, said, "What the unions need to do is to bury and put behind them their historic animosity toward each other." But, he added, "History tells you that has yet to happen in the airline business."
Will it happen at United if the unions take over, particularly when the employee owners are confronted years from now by the need for more sacrifices?
"That," said Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst at Salomon Brothers, "is the $64 question."
 
Rohatyn an Adviser
 Before that question can be answered, however, the unions must gain control of the company, and history makes many industry analysts skeptical. But consider the current momentum. United has hired Felix G. Rohatyn -- a Wall Street deal maker who served on the President Clinton's airline commission this year -- to help revive talks that broke off in mid-November when the unions offered $5.5 billion for the airline.
As last month's strike by American Airlines' flight attendants showed, President Clinton is taking an interest in such matters. United executives met recently with Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich to discuss the buyout's prospects.
For the first time, the company put forth its own proposal last week, rather than reacting to union suggestions. And United's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, also became involved personally for the first time in the talks.

HEADLINE: New Analysis Finds Higher Costs in Health Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
A comprehensive analysis of President Clinton's health plan finds that it would reduce the Federal budget deficit, as Mr. Clinton said, but that the costs to Government and business would be higher than advertised by the White House.
In the most complete independent analysis of Mr. Clinton's plan, Lewin-VHI, a respected nonpartisan consulting concern, said today that insurance premiums for the wide range of health benefits promised by Mr. Clinton would be higher than estimated by the White House. Under the Clinton plan, employers would pay at least 80 percent of such premiums, and consumers would generally pay the remainder. 
 The study accepts Mr. Clinton's assumption that the Federal Government can slow the rate of increase in health care spending by regulating insurance premiums and by increasing competition among doctors and hospitals.
Using this assumption, Lawrence S. Lewin, chairman of Lewin-VHI, said: "The Administration's cost estimates are overly optimistic, but the Clinton plan still reduces the Federal budget deficit, and it holds together logically. It meets the President's requirement of providing universal coverage, and it does so without relying on an increase in broad-based income taxes."
The study is probably as authoritative as any by a private company and could set the tone for public debate until the Congressional Budget Office issues its analysis early next year.
John F. Sheils, chief author of the Lewin study, said that from 1995 to the year 2000 the Clinton proposal would cost the Government $78 billion more than the Administration's estimate of $286 billion. It would reduce the Federal budget deficit by a cumulative total of $25 billion in that period, rather than the $103 billion predicted by the Administration, he said.
 
Vindication Is Seen
 Alice M. Rivlin, Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, welcomed Mr. Lewin's report as a form of vindication. It "essentially verifies our estimates and the soundness of the financing of our proposal," she said. She asserted that Mr. Lewin's cost estimates were "roughly the same" as President Clinton's.
A major premise of Mr. Clinton's plan is that the Government can save money by slowing medical inflation and by forcing employers to pay some costs now paid by Medicare and Medicaid, the programs for the elderly and the poor.
Kenneth E. Thorpe, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said: "Most people out there don't believe there will be any deficit reduction. The Lewin report shows the President's plan will indeed reduce the deficit by billions of dollars. Our numbers are conservative, and the Lewin study confirms that."
Mr. Sheils said insurance premiums for employers and consumers would, on the average, had to be 17 percent higher than the President estimated to pay for the health benefits proposed under the Clinton plan.
To pay for the benefits, the Lewin study says premiums in 1998 would average $2,732 a year for a single people, $5,172 for one-parent families and $5,975 for two-parent families with children.
Lewin-VHI, a subsidiary of Value Health Inc., is respected by Federal officials and has done work for a wide range of businesses, labor unions, consumer groups and Government agencies. Mr. Lewin is a Democrat, but his company includes people who served as health and budget officials in the Reagan and Bush Administrations.
Under President Clinton's proposal, the Government would pay subsidies to small businesses and low-income people to help them buy insurance coverage. The Lewin study said such subsidies would cost the Government $153 billion in the first six years, about one-third more than the $116 billion estimated by the White House.
Because of the need for higher premiums to pay for all the benefits promised by Mr. Clinton, the Lewin report shows a net increase in employer spending for health insurance through the year 2000, while the President predicts a net reduction in such spending.
If private employers continued spending on health care as they currently do, the study says, they would spend $254 billion on health care in 1998. Under the Clinton plan, it says, they would spend $283 billion. Under the Clinton plan, "employer health spending would remain well above currently projected levels into the next century," but it would grow more slowly, the report says.
Mr. Clinton said his plan would increase Federal tax collections because employers, with lower health insurance costs, would have higher profits and pay higher wages. Both forms of income are taxable.
But the Lewin study said the requirement for employers to provide health insurance would reduce their profits. As a result, it said, Federal tax collections from 1995 to 2000 would be $18 billion lower than expected under current law. The White House, by contrast, said tax collections for those years would be $23 billion higher than projected under current law.

HEADLINE: Energy Dept. Will Spur Search for Oil and Gas

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
In a proposal to spur the domestic energy industry and reduce dependence on foreign oil, the Department of Energy will announce initiatives today to encourage greater use of natural gas, the opening of Federal lands for oil and gas exploration, and expanded drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary acknowledged in an interview yesterday that the plan contained no quick fixes for an industry that has lost about 400,000 jobs in the last decade and that is spending less money at home and more overseas on exploration and production. 
 She said her aim was to set off a debate that would make Congress and the public more aware that a growing dependence on imported oil would cost jobs in an industry that now employs 380,000 Americans. About 50 percent of the oil consumed in this country is imported.
Secretary O'Leary said that while the current drop in the price of crude oil, to less than $15 a barrel, meant lower prices for gasoline and home heating oil, it would also make the United States more vulnerable to supply disruptions from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
"Over time the cartel will capture more and more of the U.S. market," she warned, "and will be in a position to impose a dramatic price spike."
Ms. O'Leary said that cheaper imported oil also caused a decline in the output of natural gas, the use of which, she said, must be encouraged to reduce pollution as well as lessening dependence on foreign oil. "It sends the wrong signals," she added.
Ms. O'Leary said that Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt would issue a statement soon on the opening of Federal lands to exploration. This has been a touchy issue with environmentalists, who have been able to keep much of the East and West Coasts closed to new drilling.
Ralph Cavanagh, energy program director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental lobby, said yesterday that "in responding to the clamor of the domestic oil industry, one loses sight of the broader objectives of society."
He added that the Clinton Administration had "not put forth a strong initiative on fuel economy for automobiles," adding, "We ought to be hearing more about that before we hear about plans to expand drilling and production."
Anna Aurilio, a Public Interest Research Group scientist, said, "I don't see the justification for opening up new areas for exploration to get more oil until we figure out how to use the oil we consume more efficiently."
Much of the plan to be announced today speeds up existing energy efforts and coordinates Federal agencies in simplifying regulation while not compromising the environment. The plan calls for the formation of task forces to study the various proposals. One of those proposals is to increase production in the deep-water outer continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. It has vast oil and gas deposits, but has been difficult to develop because of technological challenges in very deep water.
The plan indicated that the Interior Department had set up a group to study incentives for companies to develop these fields. The department is expected to make a recommendation by the end of the month.
Theodore Eck, senior economist at the Amoco Corporation, said that while the plan was full of good ideas, such as the strategy to encourage more natural gas use, there were few real incentives to get basic energy users like utilities to switch to gas.

HEADLINE: 2 HOSPITALS FELT PRESSURE TO UNITE

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Under great economic and political pressures to overhaul health care, two prestigious teaching hospitals here, the Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Massachusetts General Hospital, said today that they had agreed to merge.
The merger was approved by a vote of the boards of both hospitals today. 
 The joining of two of the nation's oldest hospitals, with origins dating to the early 1800's, is arguably the most striking example of the effects of the Clinton Administration's health-care reform program on teaching hospitals.
The two nonprofit hospitals have been fierce competitors for many decades and have many duplicated specialized services. Now they have become the latest to join a wave of mergers of hospitals. About 1,000 hospitals have closed or merged since 1980, but they were mostly for-profit hospitals that are not teaching institutions.
The wave is expected to continue as the Administration presses for more economy in the health care system. Leaders of the two Boston hospitals said they wanted to try to influence the changes as best they could now, without waiting for Congress to pass legislation, and did not want to stand by idly, watching the parade.
 
Largest Boston Employer
 Dr. J. Robert Buchanan, the head of the Massachusetts General, said at a news conference, "There is no real claim today to leadership on the part of an academic health center if it does not assert its leadership in reforming and modernizing the health care delivery system."
With a payroll of 17,500 employees, the leaders said, the merged hospital would be the largest employer in Boston and the third largest employer in Massachusetts, behind the Raytheon Company and the Digital Equipment Corporation. The merger will also create what one hospital official said he believed would be the largest teaching hospital in the country. Both hospitals are major teaching hospitals of Harvard Medical School and have a combined faculty of 2,200 doctors and an additional 2,900 doctors-in-training.
Leaders of the two hospitals said the principal reason for the merger was to serve the needs of the community better, not to cut costs.
But in reading the mission statement, Dr. H. Richard Nesson, the head of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, said, "We recognize that we can maintain excellence and leadership only by reducing costs of services and by attaining ever superior quality of care."
 
20% Budget Cut Planned
 Dr. Nesson and Dr. Buchanan also said they expected to cut the $1.2 billion annual budget of the two hospitals by at least 20 percent over the next few years. They said they had not yet begun to determine where the cuts would come.
The merged hospital is expected to be the hub of a new integrated health care delivery system for Massachusetts and the New England region, the leaders of the two hospitals said. The two hospitals have been leaders in the high-technology brand of specialized medicine known as tertiary care, which deals with the sickest patients and those with the most complicated illnesses.
But such hospitals are now being forced to move into the community and expand primary care. They are doing so by allying with networks of primary care doctors like family practitioners, pediatricians and internists. The leaders of the two hospitals said they expected to form alliances with community-based hospitals and managed-care programs to improve primary health care.
Such alliances might decrease the number of primary care patients treated at either of the two merged hospitals but would increase the number of referrals of patients needing tertiary care in the merged medical center, Dr. Nesson said in an interview.
In recent years, hospital stays have been cut, occupancy rates have dropped and many hospitals have concentrated on expensive and lucrative high-technology medicine. But as Jack Connors Jr. a trustee of the Brigham and Women's Hospital, said of the merger: "The need is great because we have a significant overcapacity in terms of hospital beds and the ratio of specialists to primary care physicians."

HEADLINE: Proposed Coal Industry Pact Would Give Miners More Say

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HUNTINGTON, W.Va., Dec. 8

 BODY:
A proposed coal industry contract could change the relationship between management and labor, allowing them to work together to resolve problems early on, officials said today.
Richard Trumka, president of the United Mine Workers, said the union had achieved "better wages and pensions while protecting our health care and our working conditions." He also said the proposed contract "drew the line against double-breasting" -- the practice of closing union mines and setting up nonunion subsidiaries. 
 An estimated 60,000 working and laid-off United Mine Workers who would be covered by the agreement will vote next week. A selective strike, which began on May 10 and expanded to 17,500 miners in seven states, will not end until a new contract is in place.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said in a statement that the contract included "provisions that further strengthen workplace democracy and provide for miners to have a real say in the way work is performed."
 
'A Neutral Forum'
 The proposal calls for the establishment of "a neutral forum -- an industrywide, labor-management cooperative committee," Mr. Reich said. The committee will allow miners and managers to resolve problems "before they face the urgency of an expiring contract," he said.
Coal companies, mediators and union leaders refused to give details of the proposed five-year contract. But people who have seen the agreement said its main points indicated that both the U.M.W. and the members of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, the industry bargaining group, achieved many, though certainly not all, of the goals enumerated at the start of talks a year ago.
The U.M.W. sought future jobs for its members. They could otherwise expect to be unemployed within the next seven years when existing mines are depleted.
Mr. Trumka had demanded 100 percent of the jobs created by the union's employers, even if they were created at nonunion subsidiaries.
 
60% of New Jobs
 People familiar with the talks said today that the proposed agreement gave the union 60 percent of the newly created jobs at all existing, new or newly acquired mines, even covering parent companies and related subsidiaries.
A similar proposal in the contract that expired in May fell apart because its language only covered the companies that actually signed the agreement, not their parents or subsidiaries.
The union has promoted changes in the labor-management relationship similar to those in the proposed contract, and it included them in an agreement signed earlier this year with four independent companies.
That contract allows managements to adopt radical new work rules if they are approved by members of the local union and if they will increase the number of jobs available to union members.
 
Still a Blacksmithing Clause
 That could spell significant change in a union where the contract still contains references to "blacksmithing" and "checkweighman." The latter is a holdover from the era when miners were paid by the amount of coal they loaded. Miners, believing that employers short-weighed their coal, demanded independent verification of weights.
The people close to the talks said the contract includes wage increases of more than $1.30 per hour. Under the old agreement, wages ranged up to $16.61 an hour.
Most retirement and health care issues were resolved by Congressional action last year in a bill supported by both the industry and the union. It requires every company that employed U.M.W. miners after 1950 to take responsibility for retirees' health care benefits. Previously, retirees were covered by industry-financed trust funds into which only a few companies had continued to pay.
At the start of talks, employers said they needed language that would help contain rising health care costs. Under the 1988 contract, employers pay 100 percent of health insurance premiums; employees are responsible for up to $200 a year in co-payments for prescription drugs and doctors' charges.
Under the proposal, miners would receive a $1,000 yearly bonus to cover their deductibles and co-payments.

HEADLINE: DEATH ON THE L.I.R.R.: The Suspect;
In Notes and Past of Accused, Portrait of Boiling Resentment

BYLINE: By CHARISSE JONES

 BODY:
The Brooklyn man accused of opening fire on a Long Island Rail Road train Tuesday was an unemployed loner who, within the time of three years, had gone from making the dean's list at a Long Island college to surviving on odd jobs in his Brooklyn neighborhood.
Notes that the police said Colin Ferguson carried in his pocket at the time of his rampage offer a portrait of a man filled with seething resentment: toward the whites and Asians he met and believed were racist; to the black attorneys he said refused to help him, to the elderly woman who rented him a room inside her Brooklyn home. 
 In February 1992, he was arrested and charged with harassing a woman on the subway. The case never went to trial, but he later sent letters to New York City's Police Commissioner and others complaining that his arrest was "viscous and racist." In September or October, a lawyer said, he threatened members of a law firm, telling them of a massacre that had happened in California. And in the last several months, he would call state workers compensation officials and the offices of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine to complain about his compensation case stemming from a job injury in 1989.
Yesterday, police officials, neighbors and acquaintances tried to understand what compelled the 35-year-old Mr. Ferguson to carry out the shootings. But the most telling clues may have been in the four pieces of notebook paper that investigators said he carried in his pocket Tuesday night, scribbled with a rambling explanation for the shootings.
He wrote in one of the notes of the "sloppy running of the #2 train," and "so-called civil right leaders such as the Rev. Herbert Daughtry, C. Vernon Mason, and Calvin Butts."
He also cited "racism by Caucasians and Uncle Tom Negroes."
Included in the notes were the names and telephone numbers of the state's Lieutenant Governor, the Attorney General's office, and a Manhattan law firm where lawyers were compelled to lock the door of an inner office after Mr. Ferguson called and threatened them, a lawyer with the firm said.
 
'I Felt Uncomfortable'
 The attorney, Lauren Abramson, remembered when Mr. Ferguson asked for a consultation about a year ago. She said that from the beginning she felt something was wrong. "I brought in a law clerk because I did not want to be alone with him," she said. "I've never done that before. I felt uncomfortable."
Though Mr. Ferguson was neatly dressed, be behaved oddly, giving her a false name before telling his real one, she said. Months later, he called and threatened the firm, she said.
"He feels discriminated against by everything and everyone," she said.
Yesterday, in a Long Island courtroom, Mr. Ferguson said nothing. As he was arraigned, he stood quietly, and did not enter a plea. He is being held without bail.
For the last two years, Mr. Ferguson had rented a room in Brooklyn from an elderly Haitian woman. But he began his life in Kingston, Jamaica, where he was born Jan. 14, 1958.
The son of a pharmacist, Mr. Ferguson was a well-rounded student who played cricket and soccer, said Joseph Earle, principal of Calabar High School in Kingston, which Mr. Ferguson attended.
While Mr. Ferguson was still a teen-ager, his father was killed in a car crash, Mr. Earle said, and his mother died soon after.
 
Difficulties in Class
 Mr. Ferguson made his way to the United States in 1982, and enrolled in Nassau Community College, where he made the dean's list in 1990. But Mr. Ferguson was forced to leave a class after a disciplinary hearing found that he had been overly aggressive toward the teacher, said a county official who insisted on anonymity. Mr. Ferguson later took the class again and received an A. He transferred to Adelphi in the fall of 1990.
There he majored in business administration, school officials said. But in June 1991, he was suspended for disciplinary reasons that officials declined to explain because of confidentiality rules. An official added that Mr. Ferguson was welcome to reapply after his suspension expired, but that he had not chosen to do so.
Mr. Ferguson also did clerical work for a company called Ademco Security Group in Syosset, L.I., but filed a workers compensation claim in April 1989, after he injured his head, neck and back by falling off a stool, said Barbara Patton, chairwoman of the New York State Workers Compensation Board. In September 1992, he was awarded $26,250, but last April, he tried to reopen the case, claiming the money was not enough.
"This agency bent over backwards for Mr. Ferguson," Ms. Patton said, noting that the agency had re-examined the case because of his persistence. "There is nothing that we ever saw in this man to lead us to think he would do something like this."
In Flatbush, the working-class Brooklyn neighborhood where he lived among many other West Indian immigrants, neighbors spoke of Mr. Ferguson as a quiet loner who seldom spoke. When he did, he said little more than a hello.
For a year, Catherine Workman and her six children lived next door to him. She recalled how neat he was, always dressed in a sweatsuit and crisp white T-shirt. She remembered standing in her doorway, seeing him walk down the street. And she remembered his silence.
"He never talked to me," she said. "He never smiled. He never looked at me. I'd look at him and he'd turn the other way."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
As a cost-cutter, General Motors consolidates most of its media buying at one group of agencies.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
THE General Motors Corporation, in one of the largest consolidations ever of the media functions on an account, has named the Interpublic Group of Companies to handle the buying of about $800 million of the $1.3 billion it spends annually on advertising.
G.M., the nation's third-largest advertiser behind Procter & Gamble and Philip Morris, said yesterday that it would assign all national television and radio buying, with billings around $500 million, to a new dedicated unit in New York to be headed by Marc Goldstein, who is now a leading media services executive at the Interpublic agency Lintas U.S.A. 
 And all print buying, with billings estimated at $300 million, will be consolidated at a new dedicated unit in the Detroit suburb of Warren, Mich. That unit is to be headed by Karen Ritchie, a top media services executive at the Interpublic agency McCann-Erickson Detroit in Troy, Mich., the agency for G.M.'s Buick division and a partner in McCann/ SAS in Troy, the agency for G.M.C. trucks.
Mr. Goldstein and Ms. Ritchie, whose titles have not been determined, will report to Richard D. O'Connor, the chairman and chief executive of Lintas Campbell-Ewald in Warren, a sibling of Lintas U.S.A. that is the agency on G.M.'s Chevrolet car and truck account. G.M. has also not decided on names for the new units or staffing levels.
The units, which G.M. hopes will open by March 1, are emblematic of a trend among large marketers to seek additional efficiencies and economies in how their agencies buy advertising time and space. Among others that recently combined media functions are Anheuser-Busch, the Chrysler Corporation and Johnson & Johnson.
"We have a very strong belief that in order to effect and create opportunity, you have to do a damn good job getting price and quality right," Philip Guarascio, the general manager of marketing and advertising for G.M.'s North American Operations division, said yesterday in a telephone interview from Detroit.
Another crucial consideration, he said, was "creating proprietary advantages for our brands" -- in other words, the consolidation must avoid blurring the identities of G.M.'s six car lines and two truck lines. That was the reason media planning will remain unconsolidated, he said, as will functions like outdoor ad buying and direct marketing.
The decision ended an extensive review that had been followed closely by advertising and media executives since word began circulating in February that G.M. might make a further round of media consolidations. In 1986, the auto maker combined duties for various broadcast assignments at three shops: Leo Burnett U.S.A., the agency for Oldsmobile; D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles, which handles Pontiac and Cadillac, and Lintas Campbell-Ewald.
Interpublic, asked to participate in the review, developed a strategy of teaming two of its three agency networks, offering to combine the services of McCann-Erickson, which had no large G.M. media responsibilities, with those of Lintas, which has bought time for G.M. on cable television networks and during sports programming. The other two review participants went it alone: Burnett, which has bought time for G.M. during network prime-time and syndicated programming, and D.M.B.& B., which has bought time for G.M. during television news programming and on network radio.
If those divisions of labor seem confusing, they are models of clarity compared with the complexities of G.M.'s print-buying assignments among six agencies. For instance, rather than a single agency negotiating the best rates and placements with the three national weekly news magazines, three did. (Burnett has handled Newsweek; Lintas, Time, and McCann-Erickson, U.S. News & World Report.)
"Now, instead of having three people in the news weekly category, we'll have one person looking to put it all together with a consistency of point of view," said Louis M. Schultz, executive vice president, director of media services and chairman of the worldwide media council at Lintas U.S.A. He spearheaded Interpublic's presentation to G.M., which, like those of Burnett and D.M.B. B., were made last week.
Mr. Guarascio stressed that in deciding among the three, "it was not a question of A being better than B or C, but of which package best fits our needs." Still, the selection was a blow to Burnett, because its role as the buyer of prime time for G.M. was a significant one. A spokesman for Burnett in Chicago, Wally Petersen, said that the six employees handling the duties being ceded to the new national broadcast unit would be reassigned to other accounts.
The selection was a significant morale booster for both Interpublic agencies. McCann-Erickson is still morose over losing the lead creative role on its important Coca-Cola Classic account to the Creative Artists Agency, while Lintas's New York office has been battered by account losses including Diet Coke and the IBM PC Company.
How much of a boost the decision will provide to Interpublic's bottom line, though, is unclear. The trade publication Mediaweek reported last week that the presentations the three agencies made included "a description of a new compensation formula" because "G.M.'s cost-carving knife likely will slice into the winning shop's current commission" of 9 percent of total billings.
Mr. Schultz said he could not talk about details, "but it's safe to say G.M. understands people are in business to make money."

GRAPHIC: Photos: G.M. has consolidated much of its media buying with the Interpublic Group, which will set up new units for the work. Karen Ritchie, now of McCann-Erickson Detroit (McCann-Erickson Worldwide), will handle print and Marc Goldstein, now of Lintas U.S.A. (Lintas Worldwide), will make national television and radio assignments.

HEADLINE: Belgium;
A High School Teacher For Every 6.8 Students

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK

 BODY:
If the sheer number of primary and secondary public school teachers is an indicator of good education, Belgium ought to be a standout.
The small Northern European country, with a population of about 10 million, employs 5.3 percent of its work force as teachers, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That is more than twice the 2.6 percent for the United States and much higher than figures for the 11 other members of the European Community, which range from 2.4 percent in Britain to 3.6 percent in Ireland. 
 But there are extenuating factors behind the number of Belgian teachers, the most important being jobs.
Like most of the rest of Europe, Belgium faces growing unemployment, now in the politically uncomfortable neighborhood of 10 percent. This has helped produce an education system that seems designed to create teaching jobs. For example, school is compulsory from ages 6 to 18 -- longer than in the United States -- and children may start school as young as 2 1/2.
"Raising the age to 18 was done partly to keep students in school so they wouldn't wind up on the unemployment roll," said Lorette Moureau, a spokeswoman at the Belgian Consulate in New York. She agreed that it also increased demand for teachers.
In addition, Belgium's limits on class sizes result in one of the lowest student-teacher ratios in the world: 9.3 primary students and 6.8 secondary students per teacher. This compares with 15.5 and 15.9 students per teacher, respectively, in the United States. The comparable figures for Britain are 22.2 and 15.3 students per teacher.
What is more, Belgium's linguistic division has resulted in separate education ministries for French and Flemish speakers. This results in some duplication but also creates more jobs. Even so, Belgium spends less per student than the United States and the rest of Europe spend, an indication of its low teacher salaries.
On balance, however, the Belgian education system gets high marks from educators and parents.
Barbara Wellborn, an American librarian and teacher who has lived in Belgium for 11 years, sends her 12-year-old daughter, Laura, to the public schools in Waterloo, where instruction is in French, instead of to a private international school that caters to expatriates.
"I place a high value on a neighborhood school and continuity of friends and teachers," Ms. Wellborn said. "And we wanted Laura to be truly bilingual. Also, the basic academic instruction is ahead of the American system. She was taught the multiplication tables in the second grade." FRED BROCK

HEADLINE: PORTUGAL;
A Lack of Discipline Keeps Math Scores Low

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Like the United States, Portugal is trying to improve its students' achievement in mathematics. In both nations, scores on standardized math tests are significantly lower than they are in other developed countries.
Some reasons given by Portuguese high school teachers and university professors for the nation's low math grades echo those cited by their counterparts in the United States: a lack of discipline among students and teachers and very little support in the home. 
 Maria Idalia Silva, a consultant in the Ministry of Education, added that until recently math instruction in Portugal had concentrated on abstract skills like calculation and had failed to relate theory to practical uses.
Under an overhaul of the nation's mathematics curriculum introduced in 1991, a far greater emphasis is being placed on ways of applying math skills. The new curriculum for eighth grade, for example, includes statistics as well as functions, geometry as well as equations. Efforts are also being made to individualize teaching and to introduce computers into classrooms.
While many of Portugal's problems with math education are similar to the challenges faced by American educators, some of the causes are uniquely Portuguese.
In the 1960's, after generations of elitist education and widespread illiteracy, schools were finally made universally accessible, causing an explosion in enrollments. But Portugal's leftist revolution in 1974 was followed by social and political upheavals that were reflected in volatile curriculums and a lack of direction in the schools. At the same time, financing remained low.
In the 1987-88 school year, compulsory schooling was extended to nine years from six, resulting in overcrowded public schools, scarce money for books and equipment and a shortage of teachers.
"We've been trying out reforms for years," said Jaime Reis, a former economics professor at the New University in Lisbon, "but Portugal still spends less per capita on education than other European countries." Among the problems he cited were a serious shortage of math teachers, particularly in the provinces, and poor management of public schools.
"It is common knowledge that private schools in Portugal function infinitely better than public schools," Mr. Reis said.
In 1990, the Government declared education reform a top priority. With the economy generally improving and with support from the European Community, new primary and secondary schools have been built, but teacher training has not improved, and average levels of education have continued to drop.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Ads Attack Democrats on Tax Rise

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Radio advertisements paid for by the Republican National Committee in 15 Congressional districts on Wednesday attack House Democrats who voted for President Clinton's tax increases but against $90 billion in spending cuts.
The party also unveiled another radio advertisement singling out Representative Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, a Pennsylvania Democrat who cast the deciding House vote for Mr. Clinton's budget and deficit-reduction package. 
 The advertisement is timed to discredit Ms. Margolies-Mezvinsky as Mr. Clinton prepares to visit her suburban Philadelphia district on Monday for an economic forum, a visit that he promised to make in exchange for her vote.
Democrats wasted no time in counterattacking. In a letter to the Republican national chairman, Haley Barbour, the Democratic national chairman, David Wilhelm, cited an array of improving economic statistics and suggested that Republicans were desperate.
The advertisement said the House Democrats had voted for $260 billion in new taxes as part of Mr. Clinton's deficit reduction legislation. "But spending went up, not down," the commercial said.
All 15 of those targeted by the advertisement voted for Mr. Clinton's budget package and against $90 billion in cuts proposed late in the Congressional session by Representatives Timothy J. Penny, Democrat of Minnesota, and John R. Kasich Republican of Ohio.

HEADLINE: DEATH ON THE L.I.R.R.: The White House;
Moved by Killings, Clinton Urges Action on Gun Legislation

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that he had instructed the Attorney General to review a proposal by Mayor-Elect Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York that would set up a national uniform licensing system for gun buyers that would include background checks, tests and required renewals every two years.
Talking about the New Yorkers shot at random by a gunman on a Long Island Rail Road train on Tuesday night, Mr. Clinton said that he hoped that this "terrible human tragedy" would "give some more impetus to the need to act urgently to deal with the unnecessary problems of gun violence in the country." 
 The President himself raised the chilling Long Island shootings at the start of a lunch at Blair House with reporters and talked about it again in the White House driveway afterward. Saying there are more licensed gun dealers than service station owners in America, the President said, "Let's get about the business of making our country safer."
A Justice Department official had called the District Attorney's Office in Nassau County to gather facts for the President about the make, manufacture and purchase of the 9-millimeter semiautomatic gun used in the random shootings. And Mr. Clinton said he had told Janet Reno, the Attorney General, to give him a recommendation after she reviewed ideas for tougher gun licensing suggested by both Mr. Giuliani and Richard Riordan, Los Angeles' Mayor-Elect.
He said he was intrigued with Mr. Giuliani's idea, which the two men talked about in a meeting at the White House earlier on Tuesday, that guns could be handled like cars at the state level, but with national standards.
"It is interesting that, you know, we regularly have requirements, for example, for driving cars that don't apply to the use of guns," Mr. Clinton said. "When I was a boy and first started to hunt, one of the first things I was told was that you have to learn how to use a gun safely and responsibly and it's something I think we ought to look it.
"And in a state like New York, a city like New York City where there are quite restrictive licensing requirements locally that may affect who can open a big store, but it doesn't have anything to do with the Federal licensing. So one of the things we need to look at is whether this should become more like some other forms of regulations like clean air regulations, where the state and local regulations are on top of the Federal regulations and all have to be complied with."
Mr. Clinton has clearly taken to heart polls that show a surge of concern about violent crime, as well as the lesson of the recent mayoral elections in New York and Los Angeles in which voters favored two Republicans who made curbing crime a central element of their campaigns.
A new poll by CBS News on crime showed that 64 percent of Americans did not believe that gun control laws could reduce violent crime, compared with 34 percent who said such laws could. But at the same time, nearly half of those polled, or 49 percent, said they approved of banning the sale of handguns, while 49 percent still oppose a ban. This is a distinct shift from a similar poll in March in which 41 percent favored a ban and 55 percent opposed one.
The President reiterated his support for the crime bill in Congress that features an amendment sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, that would ban 19 semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity feeding devices that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition at a time. The amendment has passed in the Senate, but has not yet been voted on in the House; President Clinton noted that the House "has generally been more reluctant" on assault weapons bans.
 
For Shooting Faster
 "They're not necessary for hunting or sports purposes," Mr. Clinton said of the multiround clips. "It simply allows you to shoot and wound more people more quickly."
The 9-millimeter handgun used by the gunman on the Long Island Rail Road held 15 shots. The man, who had bought the gun in California, had fired two clips and was loading a third when he was jumped and stopped by some passengers.
Mr. Clinton said the Feinstein amendment, had it been made law, might have saved some lives on the train.
"If you read the accounts, apparently, the rapid fire of the gun was something that almost paralyzed all the people on the car, but eventually when the guy had to change clips and was wrestled to the ground, that seems to me to be a pretty good argument for the Feinstein amendment," he said. "And I hope very much that when the Congress comes back, they will pass it."
But the President acknowledged that America might never be able to protect itself from the madness of someone with a weapon going berserk, as he put it.
"No one believes that there's anything we can ever do to solve every problem of someone who snaps mentally -- about something terrible like this," he said. "I mean we have to acknowledge that honestly. There are a lot of things that we're going to have to do in this country to get violence under control that relate to rebuilding our communities and healing across racial lines and economic lines, but we need to start with public safety."

HEADLINE: Dow Hits a High Again on Healthy Volume

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average set another record yesterday, pushed higher by big price jumps in shares of companies whose fortunes are tied to an improving economy.
Aside from these cyclical stocks, rising prices for a range of industrial materials were a boon for mining and commodity stocks. 
 "This was definitely a blue-chip, industrial metal-oriented market," said Thom Brown, chairman of Walnut Asset Management in Philadelphia. "The Dow went out and celebrated the basic-industry companies with a really sterling gain."
The 15.65-point rise in the Dow put the index at 3,734.53, surpassing Tuesday's previous all-time high of 3,718.88. Volume was a healthy 314.5 million shares, up from 285.7 million in the previous session.
 
Advances Outnumber Declines
 On the Big Board, advancing issues narrowly outnumbered declines. Prices were generally higher on the American Stock Exchange, but moved lower on the Nasdaq's over-the-counter trading system.
Among broader market averages, the S.& P. 500 fell 0.47, to 466.29. And the Nasdaq's composite index dropped 1.46, to 767.89.
With the exception of J. P. Morgan, the financial-services company, the rise in commodity prices like gold and silver sent prices of stocks sensitive to rising interest rates lower.
Morgan, one of the Dow's 30 blue-chip components, announced an increase in its dividend and a stock buyback yesterday. Its stock was up 1 1/2, to 72 3/4.
Other Dow stars were the Aluminum Company of America, up 3 1/4, to 72 1/2, and Caterpillar, the heavy-machinery manufacturer, which was up 1 1/8, to 85 1/8. Eastman Kodak also had a good day, rising by 1 1/8, to 62 1/2.
The rise in the price of precious metals and other commodities was somewhat anomalous, because oil prices, often seen as the bellwether indicator of inflation, fell again yesterday.
Holders of oil company shares reacted more predictably to the drop in oil prices, and sold the stocks.
Exxon fell 3/8, to 62 1/4. Amoco dropped 1, to 52 1/8. And Atlantic Richfield was off 1/8, to 103 1/2.
The rise in commodity prices failed to send shivers through the bond market, as interest rates moved a tad lower in advance of Government reports on inflation expected today and tomorrow. And analysts said the commodity price increases should not necessarily be equated with a coming surge in inflation.
"I think inflation will be somewhat higher next year than we have had this year," said James Solloway, director of research at Argus Research. "But this shift to cyclical stocks has more to do with a comeback for companies tied more closely to a turn in the economy."
Mr. Brown noted that "articles in the press have been talking about the coming boom in commodities. And prices in these companies have been so depressed that in theory they will pick back up, once the world economy starts to recover."
Other winners yesterday included Xerox, which rose 5 1/4, to 86, after the copier maker announced it would eliminate about 10,000 workers, or roughly 10 percent of its worldwide work force over the next couple of years to cut costs and improve productivity. USX, the steel and oil company, was up 1, to 38 3/4.
 
President's Signing of Trade Pact
 And on the day President Clinton signed legislation to put the North American Free Trade Agreement into effect, investors bid up shares in Telefonos de Mexico, the telephone company, to 61 1/4, up 1 3/4 on the day.
Gold mining stocks did well. Echo Bay Mines, traded on the American Stock Exchange, was up 3/4, to 13 1/2.
A big loser on the Nasdaq market was Microsoft, whose stock price fell 2, to 83 1/2, after reports that Goldman, Sachs had lowered earnings estimates for the company, citing concerns that a major project introduction may be delayed.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Names Albany Adviser As Budget Chief

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday named as his budget director Abraham M. Lackman, a man with a broad knowledge of New York City's finances gained from previous encounters with city administrations -- most of them adversarial.
For the last decade, Mr. Lackman has been a senior fiscal adviser to the Republican-controlled State Senate, which has often jousted with the Democrats who have long dominated City Hall. Now he will be the main official dealing with perhaps the most difficult problem facing the Republican-Liberal Mayor-elect -- how to close future budget deficits estimated at $2 billion a year. 
 Mr. Lackman said yesterday that he hoped to bring some new approaches to budget balancing. Among other things, he said, he wants to collect more unpaid parking fines so the city can avoid tax increases.
 
Working Out Solutions
 Mr. Lackman has long taken a skeptical view of Democratic solutions to the city's fiscal problems. When city officials went to Albany nearly three years ago, for example, to press for passage of Mayor David N. Dinkins's ambitious police expansion program, they met with Mr. Lackman. He told representatives of Mr. Dinkins and the City Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, both Democrats, that to win support from the Republican senators they would have to promise to do precisely what the Mayor had said he would do in an earlier press release: hire a specific number of new police officers by a specific series of dates.
The deadlines, and the hiring targets, became part of the legislation that eventually authorized the program.
"Abe successfully made the city put its money where its mouth was," recalled Mark V. Shaw, the City Council's top fiscal adviser. "I thought that was a brilliant stroke on his part, an incredibly smart move by someone representing the Republican senators from New York City."
Among the many intriguing paradoxes in Mr. Giuliani's announcement yesterday afternoon that he had selected Mr. Lackman for the critical post of city budget director was that it would now be up to Mr. Lackman to help find the money to meet the hiring deadlines embedded in the state law he helped craft early in 1991.
And among Mr. Lackman's foremost political and governmental adversaries when he becomes the budget director on Jan. 1 will be Mr. Shaw, the director of the Council's Finance Division, its chief architect of fiscal policy and -- not insignificantly -- the other finalist in Mr. Giuliani's search for budget director. That Mr. Lackman and Mr. Shaw worked together for the State Senate for eight years in Albany and are very close friends just adds to the unusual complexities of the Mayor-elect's selection.
Many people familiar with the arcane world of fiscal politics said yesterday that Mr. Giuliani had made a good choice, and they described Mr. Lackman as energetic and knowledgeable. But some officials also cautioned that Mr. Lackman had not previously held an executive position with the huge responsibilities of budget director, who oversees the fiscal planning for dozens of city agencies and who often wields a power over commissioners and other agency heads second only to the mayor's. In an implicit acknowledgement of that authority, Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Lackman would report directly to him.
Many officials also noted the odd transformation that Mr. Lackman will now undergo. As director of the fiscal studies for the Senate Finance Committee, he often drafted the Republican strategy that sought to counter efforts by New York City Democrats to funnel more state resources to the city. Soon Mr. Lackman will be among those leading the Giuliani administration efforts in Albany, arguing the city's case to skeptical legislators.
"This removes from Albany a person whose primary function has been to limit the benefits for New York City," said Assemblyman Sheldon Silver, the Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and who described Mr. Lackman as bright and personable. "He's going to now find out what it's like to have to deal with the Senate, from the perspective of the city."
At the same time, other officials said, his relationship with many lawmakers could serve Mr. Lackman well when he lobbies for the city in Albany.
Mr. Lackman said in an interview that he thought his standing as an outsider who was familiar with the city budget would serve him well in his new job. Because he is not an insider at City Hall, Mr. Lackman said, he might be more inclined to change the way the city budget is put together.
 
Broad Priorities
 Mr. Lackman declined to offer many details. He reiterated many of Mr. Giuliani's broad priorities -- eliminating the city's long-term structural deficit and stimulating the local economy by phasing out some taxes -- and he ruled out tax increases.
He said he hoped to find creative ways to close future budget gaps. One possibility, he said, was to collect more of the city's unpaid parking fines. Mr. Lackman also said he hoped to prevent the elimination of city jobs to balance the budget, but he did not rule that out.
"My first step will be to see how far I can get with creative ideas to close the gaps without the more difficult solutions," he said.
Mr. Lackman, who is 45 years old, was born in Belgium of parents who had survived Nazi concentration camps. The family came to the United States when he was 2 1/2 years old, and he was raised in the South Bronx, Far Rockaway and Flushing. He attended public schools and graduated from Flushing High School.
 
An N.Y.U. Graduate
 Mr. Lackman then graduated from New York University, majoring in sociology and religion. Later he earned a master's degree in economics from the State University of New York at Albany. He went to work in 1979 as an analyst for the Senate Finance Committee, and he was named director of fiscal studies in 1984.
Mr. Lackman's wife, Jeanne, is a first grade teacher, and the couple has two children, Jonathan and Aaron. Mrs. Lackman and Aaron, who is 15, were with Mr. Lackman at Mr. Giuliani's transition headquarters yesterday for the announcement of his selection.
Mr. Giuliani said that he was glad to meet the family, and, noting the rigors of the budget tasks ahead, he added, "This is a tremendous opportunity for them to see you for the last time."

HEADLINE: Productivity Up Sharply

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8

 BODY:
American productivity increased at a 4.3 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the biggest jump in more than six years, the Labor Department reported today. The report was issued shortly after the Xerox Corporation announced that it would eliminate more than 10,000 jobs -- about 10 percent of its work force.
"The dark side of the scenario is that a lot of the productivity gains are coming through layoffs," said Stephen S. Roach, a Morgan Stanley & Company economist in New York. 
 The revised, seasonally adjusted increase in nonfarm productivity -- output per hour worked -- was the largest since it rose 4.3 percent in the second quarter of 1987, the Labor Department said. It was also the first increase since a 4.2 percent rise in the final three months of 1992 and was stronger than the department's initial 3.9 percent estimate last month. It followed drops of 1.8 percent in the first quarter of 1993 and four-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter.
Output in the quarter increased 4.4 percent, up from a 4 percent gain three months earlier. Total hours worked rose one-tenth of 1 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in the second quarter.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said today that supplies of unsold goods at wholesalers fell five-tenths of 1 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted $214.13 billion. The drop was the sharpest since April 1991. Sales by wholesalers also fell five-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $159.9 billion. In September, supplies were flat and sales fell a similar five-tenths of 1 percent.

ITT Plans to Spin Off Forest Products Subsidiary

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Seeking to rid itself of a volatile business that was dragging down earnings, the ITT Corporation announced yesterday that it would spin off its forest products subsidiary to the company's shareholders.
ITT said the subsidiary, ITT Rayonier Inc., would become an independent company worth $700 million to $800 million. The division, which produces and sells timber, wood products and pulp, had income of $112 million on revenues of $719 million -- about 5 percent of ITT's total revenues -- for the first nine months of 1993. 
 The spinoff is part of a new direction at ITT, which had long typified the conglomerate, diversifying by buying up interests in automotive products, forest products, hotels, insurance and military operations in the 1960's and 1970's. ITT acquired Rayonier, founded in 1926, in 1968.
Analysts said that by shedding Rayonier, ITT would take another step in its campaign to increase return on equity to 16 percent or 17 percent by 1995 from 11 percent or 12 percent this year.
 
Concrete Programs
 Phua K. Young, an analyst at Lehman Brothers, said Rayonier's return on equity was less than 10 percent.
"There has been a long history at ITT of wanting to improve returns but not being able to," he said. "Now they have very concrete programs. They are taking the approach that nothing is sacred."
Under the plan approved by ITT's board, ITT shareholders will get a special dividend of one share of Rayonier common stock for every four shares of ITT common stock or one share of Rayonier common stock for every 3.1595 shares of ITT series N preferred stock. Shares of ITT rose $2.375, to $91.125, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday.
ITT said it expected that neither the shareholders nor the company would have to pay taxes on the transaction. About 30 million shares would be created in the new company, which will apply for listing on the New York Stock Exchange and change its name to Rayonier Inc. ITT, based in New York City, will have no ownership stake in the new company, which will be based in Stamford, Conn.
 
Improved Standing
 Rand V. Araskog, the chairman, chief executive and president of ITT, said in an interview yesterday that the spinoff would improve the standing of ITT on Wall Street because its earnings would no longer be linked to the forest products industry, which is very capital intensive and tends to undergo sharp swings in revenues.
"Rayonier is in a very cyclical business," Mr. Araskog said. "Our casualty insurance business is cyclical, but our other businesses are not particularly cyclical. They don't go the way Rayonier does, where all of a sudden you are producing pulp at a loss and you have to keep the pulp mill running."
He added that ITT had decided to spin off Rayonier, rather than sell it outright, because the forest products industry was just coming out of a prolonged recession and the price for the division might have been too low.
"Our most important goal is serving the shareholders of this company," he said. "There is a lot of residual value in Rayonier that is not being recognized in the ITT overall position. This is a way of putting that value out into the overall market."
 
Announcements Planned
 Mr. Araskog declined to identify the executives who would lead the independent Rayonier, saying they would be announced in the coming weeks. He said he first had the idea of spinning off Rayonier last summer. The company was advised by Lazard Freres & Company.
ITT, which has 106,000 employees in 63 countries, had total income in that period of $1.3 billion, on revenues of $15.4 billion.
Mr. Young at Lehman Brothers said ITT, like some other major conglomerates, was becoming more concerned with keeping shareholders happy.
"Competition now is a lot more global," he said. "To defend market share takes a lot more effort in terms of money and management time. ITT has eight businesses and it's tough to manage all that."

A Quick Slide From a Good Job to a Soup Kitchen

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
When David R. worked in Manhattan as a data processing auditor, he used to feel a gulf between himself and the hungry, shabby, often desperate people he saw sleeping on the sidewalks or holding out their hands.
No longer. 
 "I used to be there, walking down the street and looking at these poor, poor people and thinking that there must be something wrong with them, that it must be their fault," he said recently in a room upstairs from a midtown soup kitchen where he eats breakfast and lunch.
"Now," he said, "I am one of them."
David R. is one of 330,000 New York City residents facing the holidays without a job. He is one of a growing number of people whose once solid economic security has been eroded by recession-driven layoffs and corporate relocations.
While the employment picture is beginning to improve nationwide, 10.2 percent of New York City's work force is unemployed. The number of jobless people in the city has remained higher than elsewhere in the region for more than a year, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. David, 34, has been unemployed for nearly two years, relieved only briefly by stints in part-time jobs.
 
Jobs Once Easy to Find
 After graduating from Brooklyn College with an accounting degree in the early 1980's, he moved from job to job with ease, eventually landing at the Mobil Corporation, where he was taking home $990 a week, he said. Long-term unemployment was about as far from his mind, as being drafted into the Army, he said.
"They flew me all over," David said. "To Dallas one day, then Virginia, then New Jersey. I once lived in Dallas for several months in a hotel suite."
But when Mobil told him that he would have to move to Fairfax, Va., where the company was relocating its headquarters, he decided to take a chance and stay in New York. It was a fateful decision.
After dozens of unfruitful interviews and dead-end, part-time jobs, David lost his apartment in Forest Hills, Queens. He sold his stereo, his television and his furniture. He lived with friends until he could no longer impose on them. He even sold some of the jewelry once owned by his parents, who died when he was younger.
Finally, he turned to the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services in Manhattan, a beneficiary of the UJA-Federation of New York. The UJA-Federation is one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which has begun its 82nd annual appeal for donations.
 
Help With Welfare
 The fund helps the charities provide help not only to the unemployed but also to others like women in abusive relationships, children in gun-ridden neighborhoods and homeless families. This year's campaign ends on Feb. 28.
Because The Times pays for the fund's overhead, all contributions go directly to the charities.
The Jewish Board has helped get David a 7-by-15-foot room at a Y.M.C.A. in Queens and assisted him in negotiating the welfare maze. The board has also helped him pay small expenses that he can no longer cover, like repairing his glasses.
The longer he goes without a job, the harder it is to find one, he said. "People look at my resume and they think there must be something wrong with me," he said. "It's funny how I'm on the other side now."
But David still believes that as long as he is able and willing to work in any job offered him, he will eventually regain his footing. "I'm just 34," he said. "I can be trained to do anything. And I'm willing to do anything, any time. If they had an eighth day in the week, I'd work the midnight shift that day."

The Federal Reserve System issued an improved assessment of economic strength today, reporting a strong beginning of holiday shopping but warning of increases in the prices of raw materials in a few regions.
"Reports were generally more optimistic than those of this summer," the central bank said in its "beige book," a look at regional business activity. The report summarizes anecdotal material collected from the Fed's 12 regional banks before Nov. 29. It will be used by monetary policy makers when they meet on Dec. 21. 
 The Fed noted that California still suffered economically and that conditions in the Northeast were mixed. But over all, the economy "continued to expand at a moderate pace," it said.
That is an improvement over the "slow to moderate" phrase used by the Fed since June. Such slight changes in wording are regarded by economists as telling hints of the central bank's thinking.
The Fed report said consumer spending picked up in most parts of the country, particularly for automobiles and other durable goods like appliances.
"The holiday shopping season got off to a good start over the long Thanksgiving weekend with sales at or exceeding expectations," it said. Manufacturing activity was improving in most places, it added, "but few businesses reported new hiring."
Residential real estate was reported strong, and long-moribund commercial real estate markets "have begun to show a few signs of improvement," it said.
The report also reflected slightly more concern about inflation than previous assessments have.
"Wage increases and prices for final goods generally were said to be stable," the Fed declared. But it noted that the Chicago district bank reported signs that increases in raw-material prices were becoming more common. The Boston and Richmond banks said some manufacturers had increased prices.
 
Speculation on Interest Rates
 Some economists said that the report, coupled with recent remarks of top Fed officials, laid the groundwork for a slight increase in short-term interest rates to squelch any possibility of more inflation.
"We're closer to the day when the Fed will begin tightening again," said one of the economists, Mark Zandi of Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. "They want to be out ahead of any significant inflationary pressures."
The report said that overall economic growth, which slumped to 1.4 percent in the first half of the year, improved to 2.7 percent in the third quarter and was expected to approach 4 percent in the fourth quarter.

HEADLINE: Whitman Seeks Extra Month to Prepare a Budget

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAWRENCE, N.J., Dec. 8

 BODY:
Gov.-elect Christine Todd Whitman said today that she would ask the Legislature for an extra month to introduce her first budget, giving her more time to find the more than $500 million in budget savings she will need to finance her promised tax cuts.
State law requires the Governor to give the budget to the Legislature by Feb. 15. But a delay until March 15 has become routine for new governors and was granted to both Gov. Jim Florio and former Gov. Thomas H. Kean. 
 "If Jim Florio can take an extra month to decide how to raise your taxes by $2.8 billion, I can certainly take an extra month to decide how to cut them," Mrs. Whitman said during a speech to employees at Bristol-Myers Squibb, a pharmaceutical company that has research laboratories in Lawrence Township.
Mrs. Whitman also said she would conduct a series of town meetings, radio and television call-in shows and round-table discussions over the next six weeks to find out from taxpayers what services they want protected and what they are willing to have cut.
"I am going to cut the state budget the same way I am going to govern," she said. "By consensus, not by decree."
The first television program will be broadcast live at 7 P.M. Dec. 15 on the Cable Television Network of New Jersey. On Dec. 22 Mrs. Whitman will be host of a second call-in program on WKXW 101.5, the radio station in Trenton that helped spawn the tax revolt against Governor Florio.
Mrs. Whitman has pledged to cut the state income tax for most taxpayers by 10 percent a year for the next three years, totaling about $1.4 billion over three years. The first cut would require trimming about $500 billion in the first 18 months of her administration, a combination of the final six months of the current budget and the budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1994. The state's annual budget is now $15.7 billion a year.
Mrs. Whitman said she intended to fulfill her campaign promise to cut taxes by reducing the size of state government and by asking taxpayers to rate state services.
"What is most important to you?" she asked. "If you had only 10 dollars to spend, would you spend it on roads or health care, emergency management or employment training?"
Mrs. Whitman said she would meet with state legislators from both parties on Friday to discuss the budget. Beginning next week, she said, she will have a series of round-table discussions on topics like economic development, human services and the environment. The town meetings will be scheduled for January.
Mrs. Whitman also asked taxpayers to send her suggestions for cutting the state budget. They should be mailed to: Our Tax Dollars, care of Gov.-Elect Whitman, CN 096, Trenton, N. J. 08625.

Dollar Surges Against Yen On Fed Official's Remarks

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar surged against the Japanese yen yesterday after a Federal Reserve official urged the Bank of Japan to aim for a weaker yen to spur domestic growth.
Wayne D. Angell, a Federal Reserve governor, said at a conference in London that the stronger yen was hurting the Japanese economy. He said its central bank should aim for a rate of 120 yen to the dollar -- far weaker than the dollar's recent range of 107.50 to 109.50 yen. 
 "His comments were not taken lightly," said Michael McKeever, assistant vice president at the Fuji Bank. "The dollar had a nice little rally."
Dealers said Mr. Angell's comments, which appeared sharply at odds with what many still perceive as an American desire for a weaker dollar against the yen, caught the market by surprise.
"They were the first comments from the Fed calling for a stronger dollar," a Japanese bank dealer in New York said.
The dollar drifted off its highs after Mr. Angell clarified his remarks, saying that 120 yen to the dollar was not an official American target. Still, in late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 108.95 yen, up from 107.53 yen on Tuesday
 
Remarks Are Discounted
Some analysts discounted Mr. Angell's remarks. "They were words of advice from a hawk on the way out," said Angelo Evangelista, vice president at the Bank of Boston. Mr. Angell, who will retire from the Federal Reserve early next year, is considered an "inflation hawk" and has repeatedly warned of the inflationary effects of a weaker dollar.
Mr. Evangelista said inflationary fears had accelerated now that the economy was growing more quickly.
European currencies were sidelined, with most attention focused on the yen. But the French franc firmed after Prime Minister Edouard Balladur indicated that Paris was inclined to accept a world trade pact under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
France is seen as a major stumbling block to a GATT pact and any progress is good for the franc, dealers said. The dollar slipped to 5.8395 French francs in New York, from 5.8560 francs on Tuesday. But it rose to 1.7052 marks from 1.7018 marks.
The British pound closed in New York at $1.4970, up from $1.4930 late Tuesday.

Silver Hits a 4-Month High; Gold and Platinum Also Up

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Silver prices climbed yesterday to their highest levels in four months amid signs of strong economic growth.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver for March delivery, the most actively traded contract, rose 6.8 cents, to $5.013 an ounce. 
 The buying spilled into gold, with the February contract jumping $6.40, to $385.70 an ounce on the Comex.
Silver, widely used by the electronics and photography industries, has been bolstered by strong physical purchases of the metal, analysts said. It has risen about 12 percent in the last week; since the middle of September it has rallied more than 25 percent from less than $4 an ounce.
"It has been encountering tremendous interest from the funds and its low unit price as a metal makes it even more attractive than gold," said Rhona O'Connell, an analyst at T. Hoare & Company, brokers in London.
Investors have been buying silver on the heels of recent data showing that the American economy, after one of its slowest recoveries in memory, has finally been gathering strength. Ms. O'Connell said that investment funds began to take a special interest in silver last month when physical purchases by Saudi Arabia increased sharply.
 
Shipped to Saudi Arabia

"An enormous amount of physical silver was shipped to Saudi Arabia at the time, underpinning an already semi-speculative rally and giving it a more solid physical undertone," Ms. O'Connell said.
Platinum, another metal favored by industry, also rose at the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the January contract up $5.30 at $383.70 an ounce.
Also at the Nymex, oil prices eased and natural gas prices fell steeply. January crude closed 11 cents lower at $14.59 a barrel, while January natural gas fell 7.2 cents, to $1.982 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Inaction by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in curtailing output continued to depress the market, which has slid down to five-year lows. And the American Petroleum Institute trade group late Tuesday reported a rise in crude and oil product inventories in the last week, indicating domestic supplies remain ample.
"The market is just continuing in its downtrend and there is nothing to suggest a turnaround right now," said Shannon Burchett, an analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Success for Vietnam may depend on how well it copies China.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
BY most accounts -- including the World Bank's -- Vietnam is an odds-on bet to be the next Asian economy to wow the world with double-digit growth. Apparently the only unanswered question is whether embargo-hobbled American investors will be shut out by Japanese and European rivals.
But a panel of conservative American economists and Vietnamese expatriates, recruited by the Pacific Basin Research Institute and the Donner Foundation, aren't so sure. Their newly published report offers a cool-eyed view of a nation and economy hobbled by bureaucracy and divided by region. "The basis for a truly free market is not yet there," said Bui Diem, the director of the institute and once South Vietnam's ambassador to America. 
 Who has the better case? Much depends on whether Vietnam has the right stuff to mimic the Chinese, decentralizing the economy without freeing the political system.
While United States air power failed to return Vietnam to the Stone Age, the country's Marxist economic managers inadvertently made a good run at the task on their own. Vietnam currently ranks among the world's poorest countries, in the same league as Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Mozambique. It even shared a dubious honor with sub-Saharan Africa as one of the last places on earth in the 1980's where masses of people were at risk of starvation.
How could a nation that threw off the French colonial yoke and wore out the world's mightiest military machine find itself in such a fix? The panel's report makes it all too clear that an indefatigable will to sacrifice in the name of nationalism doesn't necessarily translate into economic success.
After unification in 1975, Vietnam collectivized agriculture in the south along with nationalizing all manufacturing and most services. By even the Government's admission, though, "socialism building" was a disaster that left the war-devastated economy barely able to feed the nation.
Economic liberalization followed in the early 1980's; price controls were eased and enterprises permitted to sell to private markets once they fulfilled state quotas. But while the reforms led to growth -- Vietnam has become a major exporter of rice -- they also widened income differences between the north and the commerce-minded south, leaving the warrior half of the country with little to show for decades of suffering.
According to the Pacific Basin Research Institute, average incomes in Ho Chi Minh City (once known as Saigon) are two and a half times greater than in Hanoi. What's more, the Government's inability to collect a big share of the bounty in taxes created runaway inflation that impoverished the nation's ponderous bureaucracy.
By the late 1980's, Vietnam's rulers found themselves in a trap not unlike that faced by the Soviet leadership. Going backward was unthinkable, given the utter failure of state ownership and central planning. Plunging ahead, however, was almost as perilous a prospect for the military and bureaucratic elites, who were not unaware of the fate of their counterparts in the Soviet Union. That is where the Chinese model, one in which the go-go south is given license to grow rich in return for political acquiescence and a financial tithe to the north, fits in.
Can Hanoi pull it off? David Dollar, the senior economist working on Vietnam for the World Bank (and one of the few dollars the World Bank has ever lent to Vietnam), is "cautiously optimistic." As in China, he said, liberalization of agriculture has produced gratifyingly rapid results. The unproductive state-owned industrial sector actually represents a lesser drag than in China since it employs a smaller fraction of the population. What's more, foreign investment is likely to make a tangible difference very quickly in a country with a relatively educated and disciplined work force. "It's not hard to grow if you are starting at $200 per capita," Mr. Dollar said.
But the Pacific Basin Panel suggests weakness in the parallels. Unlike China, Vietnam has yet to guarantee property rights or create a passably efficient commercial banking system. Unlike the Chinese, Vietnamese save relatively little; hence the rapid investment required for an economic miracle will depend on foreign capital as well as foreign technology. And unlike China's, the Vietnamese economy was until very recently closely integrated with (and dependent on aid from) the Soviet economy.
Last but not least, Vietnam starts in a position of relative fiscal weakness. While the Government managed to reduce the budget deficit to a modest 2 percent of national income in 1992 by savagely cutting enterprise subsidies, failure to keep state enterprise deficits in check or to collect revenue from the booming cities of the south could once again let the inflation genie out of the bottle.
The great imponderable here is the same one faced by China in the 1980's: whether liberal economics can coexist with authoritarian politics. "The root of the problem is political legitimacy," Mr. Diem said -- whether the country can tolerate the shock of rapid economic transformation without government of and by the people.

HEADLINE: NORTH KOREA SHIFT STIRS SPECULATION

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Dec. 9

 BODY:
In the midst of its nuclear standoff with the United States, North Korea said Wednesday that it had removed its most prominent advocate of opening its economy to the West.
By some accounts, the official, Kim Dal Hyon, is in line to become the country's next Prime Minister when the country's Supreme People's Assembly meets in Pyongyang beginning today. His ascendency would suggest a new direction for the country, one that moves away from the national mythology of "juche," a philosophy of self-reliance that has spurned contact with or help from abroad. 
 But other analysts, particularly in Japan, said they feared that his removal as chief of state planning and Deputy Prime Minister could indicate that Mr. Kim is being blamed for the economic contraction that has left factories closed and its workers hungry.
This morning, in a rare departure from the country's usually glowing propaganda about its economic performance, a communique issued from the ruling party's Central Committee concede that the economy faced a "grave situation" after "grim trials."
 
Failed to Reach Targets
 It said that the state had failed to achieve its industrial output targets -- a vast understatement, most outside economists would argue -- because of "international events and the acute situation created in Korea."
That appeared to be a reference to the end of barter trade with Russia and the disputes surrounding international efforts to investigate its nuclear program.
The North also announced that the younger brother of the "Great Leader," President Kim Il Sung, was appointed to the party's politburo, one of the country's highest offices. That was a surprise because the brother, Kim Yong Ju, has scarcely been mentioned for 17 years, and was long ago eclipsed by the "Dear Leader," Kim Jong Il, the son of Kim Il Sung and his designated successor as the nation's leader. In a directory of hundreds of North Korean officials published last year by the Central Intelligence Agency, Kim Yong Ju is not even listed.
The conflicting theories about Kim Dal Hyon's removal suggest how little is known about the inner workings of the North Korean Government, which has been under close scrutiny in recent months as the United States and other nations try to find out what it is doing at its nuclear plants. Western officials suspect that it is trying to build a nuclear weapon.
 
New Offer Studied
 The Clinton Administration is said to be preparing a response to last Friday's offer by North Korea to provide a limited opening to its nuclear complex at Yongbyon. Officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors nuclear plants worldwide, have said the offer is insufficient, and American officials said it would do little to allay fears about how much nuclear material North Korea has produced or diverted to weapons projects.
In a statement, North Korea said only that Mr. Kim had been "transferred to another position." That alone is unusual; officials being purged in the North are usually never mentioned at all, and simply drop out of sight.
Mr. Kim is said to be a relative of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il . Over the last two years he has become a familiar figure as North Korea has tentatively reached out for investment and trade with its capitalist neighbors, ending decades of virtual isolation. In July 1992 he made a highly publicized trip to South Korea, eliciting a promise from the Seoul Government to consider building a huge industrial complex at Nampo, just above the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two countries.
 
Seoul Suspends Dealings
 But so far, the project has gone nowhere. As it became clear that the North would refuse to accept international inspections of its nuclear sites, the South Korean authorities suspended all dealings on economic initiatives.
"It's possible that Kim Dal Hyon was blamed for the failure," a senior Japanese official said Wednesday.
But Mr. Kim appears to retain his posts on the Communist Party Central Committee, and some South Korean and American officials speculated that he might be in line for promotion. That would be a sign that hard-liners in the Government are losing their sway and that the country may be willing to negotiate access to its nuclear plants in return for an economic package.
There are also other indications that North Korea is making gestures to the West. On Tuesday it published extensive regulations governing new "free economic and trade zones" it is establishing in North Korea, announcing for the first time that foreigners entering the zones would not, under most circumstances, need a visa.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Clinton More Pessimistic
 WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 (Special to The New York Times)
-- President Clinton said today that he could not be confident that a crisis could be avoided over North Korea's refusal to allow international inspections of its nuclear plants.
At a luncheon with reporters, Mr. Clinton sounded more pessimistic about the situation than he had in recent days. Asked whether he believed a full-blown crisis could averted, he said: "I hope we can avoid one, but I am not positive that we can."
The United Nations announced today that Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali would travel to North Korea this month.

HEADLINE: Mexican Candidate Pledges Campaign Changes

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Seeking to dispel doubts about the fairness of Mexico's political process, the governing party's new presidential candidate has promised to issue detailed fund-raising and spending reports and take other steps to insure the credibility of elections next year.
In an interview Tuesday, the candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, outlined a campaign strategy that seemed less about winning than about routing the memory of a 1988 vote that many Mexicans believe President Carlos Salinas de Gortari won by fraud. Mr. Colosio is the overwhelming favorite in the election, scheduled for next August. 
 For the first time in the 64 years that his party has governed, Mr. Colosio said, he would issue regular reports on where his campaign was getting its funds and how they were being spent. He said that he opposed foreign election monitors, but that he would propose a wider role for Mexican-born election observers and would accept an independent audit of the voter rolls.
"This is in the short term," said Mr. Colosio, a 43-year-old former Secretary of Social Development. "In the medium term, I would propose to continue the democratic transformation of the country so that future generations can be confident of the political process, so that there will be clear rules in politics as there are in the economy."
 
Changes Called Insufficient
 Most of the changes Mr. Colosio endorsed appeared merely an elaboration on steps already contemplated by the Government or on new electoral laws approved this summer. The leaders of several election-monitoring groups said that the changes were encouraging but that they considered them far from sufficient to guarantee a democratic process next August.
During his five-year administration, Mr. Salinas has made general pledges of greater democracy, but for the most part the results have failed to satisfy his domestic and foreign critics. The perceived flaws of the Mexican political system came under scrutiny in the United States Congressional debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Yet by the tone of his remarks and by his emphasis on the need for political change in Mexico, Mr. Colosio seemed to move beyond the positions taken by Mr. Salinas, his political mentor.
The President, who is barred by the Constitution from seeking re-election, has often said that as Mexico's economy develops, its democracy will gradually be "perfected." Mr. Colosio suggested a more active and immediate process of change.
"I am committed to the democratic transformation of the country," Mr. Colosio said several times. "I do not want, nor do I need votes that are gotten outside the law. I need only the votes of Mexicans who are convinced of my proposals."
 
Plans to Be Outlined
 Mr. Colosio announced his plans for campaign financing, election observers and the auditing of voter rolls in a speech tonight to the national convention at which his nomination was formalized by the Institutional Revolutionary Party. He did not, however, explain the ideas in any detail.
Since it was formed in 1929, neither the party nor its two predecessors have ever lost a presidential election, and it has given up only three state governorships.
In the past, the party's dominance over an almost token opposition was insured by coercion and fraud at the polls. As the opposition has grown more organized and vigilant since Mr. Salinas's tainted victory over Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist leader, in 1988, such techniques as stuffing ballot boxes and the use of state resources in the party's election campaigns have generally given way to more sophisticated strategies.
But a highly competitive election on Nov. 28 in the Gulf Coast state of Yucatan revived many of the opposition's complaints. After a governing-party campaign that was notably austere and well-organized, the vote itself brought claims of vote-rigging.
Mr. Colosio declined in the interview to discuss the Yucatan situation in any detail, saying he had been too busy preparing his campaign to study it carefully.
 
Goal of Clean Election
 He said he understood that he must take measures to reach his goal of a clean election. But Mr. Colosio was noncommittal when asked whether he might isolate or punish party members who had been involved in past frauds.
"There are vices and inertia that we must overcome not only in the P.R.I. but in other political groups as well," he said, referring to the governing party by its Spanish initials.
Mr. Colosio said he would pursue an agreement among political parties to extend the role of independent election observers to include the monitoring of more than the actual balloting. For example, he said, the observers might oversee the formation of regional election councils and the drafting of the voter rolls.
As "a guarantee," Mr. Colosio said he had assigned responsibility for his campaign finances to his campaign coordinator, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, a former Minister of the Budget and Education with a reputation for honesty.
Of the periodic financial reports that he said Mr. Zedillo would issue, he added, "We will be as specific as we have to be in order that there be no doubt or suspicion that the funds I receive for my campaign come from legitimate sources."
 
Supports Quick Count
 Mr. Colosio also said he supported a so-called quick count of the vote on election day, a process that has been increasingly used in Mexican state elections to provide an indicative sample of voting patterns. And as Mr. Salinas has before him, Mr. Colosio said he supported a private audit of the entire voter registry, a document that opposition parties say has been used in the past to exclude their supporters.
Citing recent opinion polls showing Mexicans overwhelmingly skeptical that next year's election will be fair, Robert A. Pastor, a political scientist at Emory University who closely follows the Mexican electoral process, said Mr. Colosio's comments struck him as "an acknowledgement that the principle challenge facing the Government today is gaining the trust of the Mexican people in the process."
"But that's a very large mountain to climb in a relatively short amount of time," Dr. Pastor added, "and some dramatic measures are probably going to be needed to increase the percentage of people who believe the elections will be free."
Mr. Colosio said he opposed any participation of international observers in the election, citing laws that prohibited their involvement. But leaders of Mexican observer groups also said that because of highly restrictive laws approved by the Mexican Congress earlier this year, significant changes would have to be made before even Mexican observers were assured of a clear role.
"We are not at all satisfied with his saying he will bring democracy if he is elected," the head of one citizens' group, Julio Faesler, said of Mr. Colosio's remarks.
"It is now that he must act forcefully with his party," said Mr. Faesler, the president of the Council For Democracy. "It is not enough for him to stick to the letter of the law. He must tie the hands of his party so there is no covert funding, no fiddling with the electoral lists, no stacking of the polling stations with PRI people. So far, the signs we are seeing do not point in the direction of a clean and democratic election."

HEADLINE: European Official Urges Cuts In Social Benefits to Add Jobs

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 8

 BODY:
In a clear statement that Europe's welfare state will have to change radically if an unemployment crisis is to be overcome, the European Commission today proposed lowering minimum wages and cutting non-wage labor costs like social security payments as a way to create 15 million jobs by 2000.
Presenting a long-awaited policy paper on Europe's soaring unemployment, which now affects 11.3 percent of the work force, close to double the United States rate, Jacques Delors, the president of the commission, made it clear that social welfare programs might have to be trimmed back. 
 "If we want to safeguard the principles that forged the current model of European society and its welfare state, we must adapt this model," said Mr. Delors, a French Socialist. "We are no longer in a world where everything is guaranteed."
 
5 Million Jobs Lost
 His report is expected to dominate discussion here at a summit meeting of European leaders this week. It clearly reflected a deep malaise.
The loss of more than 5 million jobs since 1990, the increasing competitiveness of a developing world with much lower labor costs and the long recession have prompted widespread questioning of Europe's social model.
Indeed, political debate is now increasingly marked by discussion whether heavy social security, health and pension payments have made labor costs too onerous, discouraging employers from hiring. Unemployment benefits paid in Europe this year are expected to total about $226 billion -- equivalent to the gross national product of Belgium.
In response, Britain has led a campaign for widespread deregulation of the European labor market, to bring it closer to an American model. But President Francois Mitterrand of France has argued that comprehensive social benefits are the crowning achievement of post-war European social democracy and cannot be dismantled.
In making his proposals, Mr. Delors clearly tried to tread a middle path. But he nonetheless suggested that the current European economic model has reached a point of exhaustion.
In sumarizing his report, Mr. Delors suggested that each nation aim to reduce non-wage labor costs by the equivalent of 1 percent to 2 percent of G.N.P.. Since 1970, these charges have risen 40 percent, twice the rate in the United States.

HEADLINE: MALAYSIA PREMIER DEMANDS APOLOGY

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Dec. 8

 BODY:
The brickbats are flying once again between two of the most outspoken politicians in the region and a result may be a multibillion-dollar trade war between Australia and Malaysia.
The feud is between Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, who refused an invitation from President Clinton to attend the Asia-Pacific summit meeting in Seattle last month, and Prime Minister Paul Keating of Australia, who referred to Mr. Mahathir as a "recalcitrant" for not traveling to Seattle. 
 Mr. Keating told reporters in Seattle that he "couldn't care less" about the Malaysian leader's absence from the summit, which was sponsored by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation organization. "APEC is bigger than all of us -- Australia, the U.S. and Malaysia and Dr. Mahathir and any other recalcitrants," he said.
Dr. Mahathir, whose anti-Western stance has made him a hero in much of the developing world, has demanded an apology from the Australian over the remark and has threatened to reduce diplomatic relations and to review all trade links with Australia if he does not receive one.
 
'Buy Australia Last' Campaign
 The Malaysian Consumer Affairs Ministry has suggested that it will support a boycott of Australian goods, and officials have already begun speaking of a "Buy Australian Last" campaign.
So far, Prime Minister Keating has refused to make an explicit apology, and a letter he sent to Dr. Mahathir last week seems only to have made things worse.
While the letter has not been made public, the Malaysian Foreign Minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, said it "did not come from a person who appears to be sorry and regrets what happened as a result of his own remarks, which went beyond extreme."
Trade between the countries amounted to nearly $2 billion last year. Australian exports to Malaysia have risen 14 percent a year on average for the last six years, and many Australian exporters are worried that they will be shut out of one of the fastest-growing markets in Asia because of Mr. Keating's comments.
"I can't understand these Australians," Dr. Mahathir, who was trained as a physician, told reporters here. "I cannot understand this condemnation, this vilification of my person."
Australia, he said, "talks down to Asia -- it tells the Asians how to behave themselves, even when the Australians themselves are not very well behaved."
The Malaysian leader has said that he stayed home during the Seattle summit because the United States and other nations in the region had offered only a cool response to creating an Asians-only trading group, a cause he has championed.
 
Asians Support Malaysia
 The dispute seems to have more serious implications for Australia than for Malaysia, since it could hinder efforts by Mr. Keating's Government to reorient Australia's foreign and trade policies towards the booming nations of Asia, and to portray Australia as an Asian nation.
Diplomats from other Asian governments are quietly lining up behind Dr. Mahathir, saying that Mr. Keating's remarks were unnecessarily rude and showed that Australia's leaders, used to name-calling in their domestic politics, are still not ready to operate among the nonconfrontational societies of Asia.
"In this part of the world, attacks cannot be personal, and the Australians must learn that," said an Asian diplomat in Kuala Lumpur.
The last serious flap between Australia and Malaysia came in 1991, when Mr. Keating's Government was forced to apologize to Malaysia over an Australian television soap opera, "Embassy," which portrayed scandalous goings-on in Ragaan, a fictitious Southeast Asian nation that bore similarities to Malaysia.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Another Round on TV Violence

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR

 BODY:
When it comes to television, violence remains hot stuff, either as a component of entertainment programming or as a subject for hand-wringing special reports and documentaries, most of which are sure to insist that television alone cannot be blamed for all of today's violence, especially its escalation among the young. Other culprits are righteously invoked: family disintegration, poverty, overcrowding, hunger, drugs, easy access to guns. The numbing mantra goes on; the headlines about violence proliferate.
Don't misunderstand. Some of these television essays are valuable, if only as road markers indicating where we stand, or crawl, as a society. Tonight at 9 on MTV, for instance, "Generation Under the Gun" interviews teen-agers in New York, New Orleans and Omaha about the role of guns in their lives. 
 The report is hardly comforting. Increasingly, the attitude for too many young people on streets or in schools is "kill or be killed." Old-fashioned fistfights are deemed useless. "You beat somebody up," says one youth, "they go home and get a gun." Guns, all agree, are readily available everywhere. One student says, "It's easier to get a gun than an education."
Various vested interests appear to protect their own turfs. The actor Sylvester Stallone maintains fuzzily that television, as opposed to movies, does indeed desensitize. Dr. Dre, a rapper, insists that his provocative, even incendiary lyrics carry no message, that "I'm just interested in selling records." Meanwhile, Tabitha Soren, an MTV reporter, churns out statistics: 1 in 25 high school students carries a gun to school; a new handgun is produced every 20 seconds. MTV's amorphous conclusion: "Ultimate responsibility lies in your hands. There is hope." Well, yes, depending on education, the economy, parents and all that stuff.
This television approach has become fairly standard. Among the better entries in recent months were Linda Ellerbee's "Are You What You Watch?" on Nickelodeon, an intelligent discussion with youngsters who got Howard Stringer, the president of the CBS Broadcast Group, to admit that the impact of local-news sensationalism on children "makes me very nervous," and ABC's live "Kids in the Crossfire," moderated deftly by Peter Jennings out of a junior high school in Washington. "Kids in the Crossfire" opened with the gruesome statistic that there had been 13 shootings in the nation's capital the previous evening, three of them fatal.
And, as Ms. Ellerbee might put it, so it goes. More than 20 years ago, when I first came to television reviewing, NBC was ballyhooing a major study on the effects of television violence on society at large. After a flurry of panel discussions, open to the press, the project receded into the mist of network bureaucracy, not to be heard from until 10 years later, when its major conclusions were held to be inconclusive.
That's not surprising. Through the years, innumerable studies of television violence have come forth with impressive evidence that (a) it's of no importance whatsoever, or (b) it's an insidious blight on civilization. Learned arguments can be produced for whatever point of view is demanded at the time. It depends on the recruited experts, the songs they sing often being connected to whose bread they eat.
Hardly a year has gone by without some new solution's being promoted as the perfect answer to assorted social ills. For drug addicts, there was everything from halfway houses to "tough love" confrontations with parents at home. The last I heard, street sales of cocaine and heroin were brisk as ever. Currently being touted as a restraint on violence is the concept of "conflict resolution," the supposedly revolutionary idea of getting teen-agers to talk out their problems. But as one astute young man told Mr. Jennings, "In some schools, if you be a mediator, you can get hurt."
Perhaps television's role in all these tit-for-tat exchanges on blame and responsibility is being shortchanged. Perhaps television's influence stems not from specific programming content, but from its being a major component in the American, and indeed now the international, way of life. The commercial medium is designed to sell, everything from the audiences sought by advertisers to the expensive sneakers to sought by youngsters, many of whom will do whatever is necessary to get them. They have been insistently persuaded that their lives are nothing without these athlete-sponsored products.
One of the more defining moments captured recently on local newscasts featured a youth shaking his head in response to the shooting deaths of two of his friends, killed by a gypsy cabdriver they tried to rob. Their friend just couldn't believe the driver's stupidity. "Man," the boy told the television reporter, "he didn't go with the flow."
And there's the crucial question facing television and our consumer culture. Whose flow do we go with?

HEADLINE: Jim Morrison's Fans Keep His Fire Alight In a Birthday Homage

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 8

 BODY:
Gaelle Rabaste, who is 17, was not even born when Jim Morrison died of heart failure from an overdose of drugs and alcohol here on July 3, 1971. But on the day the lead singer of the Doors would have been 50, she crouched by his tomb, reading his poetry with tears in her eyes.
The grave itself was covered with flowers, love letters, poems and the inevitable bottle of whisky left by the hundreds of young Europeans and Americans who came to pay homage to him on his birthday. "Move on, move on," security guards kept calling out. "Give other people a chance." 
 Nathalie Roux had come from Switzerland for the occasion, carrying her guitar in the hope of singing her own tribute. "After I heard Jim Morrison, my life changed," the 18-year-old said. "He's like a Messiah to me. I know it sounds silly, but he has helped me see things the way he would see them."
Even on days of no particular significance to Morrison devotees, his tomb is the main attraction in the huge Pere-Lachaise cemetery in eastern Paris, easily outdrawing the final resting places of the likes of Moliere, Chopin, Bizet, Proust, Oscar Wilde, Isadora Duncan, Edith Piaf and Maria Callas.
 
Diverse Observances
 Yet if "Jim Lives," as myriad graffiti around his tomb proclaim, it is also because Paris has now embraced him as a cult figure: his birthday has been marked by film showings, photo exhibitions, concerts, radio and television specials, even a poetry reading at the Georges Pompidou Center.
Morrison moved here five months before his death, fleeing scandals provoked by his raucous performances and apparently hoping that he would be recognized as a writer in a city where Hemingway and other expatriate American writers had prospered. But "the end" he so often sang about soon came.
Not all Parisians are happy that he is buried here. Families who own nearby tombs have long campaigned for his remains to be evicted, complaining that his fans smoke marijuana, drink beer and liquor and generally behave badly. Indeed, two years ago, the 20th anniversary of his death turned into a riot when guards tried to close the cemetery at night.
Since then, a guard is permanently stationed at Morrison's grave, but messages continue to appear on surrounding tombs. One directly behind the singer's black marble headstone reads: "Adolf Hitler, who should be dead, is still alive . . . he lives in Miami . . . and you, who should be alive, are dead . . . but you are still among us. Frederic."
Other graffiti -- mainly in English, but also in French, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian -- are more direct: "Jim, you are the God," "Jim, we need you," "We love you and you make me feel alright," "Jim, Welcome to the Severed Garden" and, perhaps most appropriately, "Stoned Immaculate."
 
Portable Statuary
 A marble bust of the singer once stood on his tomb. First, fans began to chip off bits to take home as mementoes. Then it was covered with graffiti. Finally, in 1990, it was stolen. Now fans often carry their own busts or statues of Morrison to the grave as part of their tribute.
Fear of trouble brought extra security guards to the tomb today, but apart from discouraging beer drinking and keeping the crowds moving they had little to do. The visitors were in solemn mood, prefering to celebrate the creativity of the singer, poet and, to many, prophet rather than the violent self-destruction that marked his brief five years in the spotlight.
Among the fans were few contemporaries, proof enough that he is far larger as a myth than he ever was as a star. Indeed, those at his grave today were almost all in their teens and 20's, pilgrims who either were converted by older brothers and sisters or were led to Morrison by Oliver Stone's movie "The Doors."
Yet what is the appeal of his almost-nihilistic message to this generation? "He's not an example, but he's a legend," Florence Roger, a 14-year-old Parisian schoolgirl, said. "He wanted to die, to get close to death. Perhaps if he hadn't been so drugged up, he wouldn't have written such beautiful poetry."
Rene Beuttkus, a 25-year-old who installs central heating for a living, drove with four friends from Dessau in eastern Germany to be here today. Why? "Because Jim gives another dimension to life," he said. "It's the words of his poems and his life."
 
Lyric Symbolism
 A tall, bearded Frenchman who refused to give his name said the message came from "up there." And he tried to explain. "The song 'Riders on the Storm,' is not about a motorbike," he said, referring to a Doors hit. "It's about seeing a light ahead and moving toward it."
Christophe, a young Frenchman from Normandy, said he wished he had lived in the 1960's. And for him, Morrison's example was "to let things come the way they come." Asked if that wasn't passive, he said, "What else are we going to do when we're unemployed and there's nothing else in our lives?"
He and a friend planned to spend the day at Pere-Lachaise. And wandering through were a group of schoolgirls from Finland, four long-haired Germans in matching leather trousers, a middle-aged Spanish woman who said nothing as she lighted a candle at the grave, and many more.
Paul Will, a 24-year-old social worker from Wisconsin, said he came over from London because his Australian girlfriend, Shannon O'Hara, simply announced, "It's got to be done." And he was pleased he did. "Even Jimi Hendrix's grave in Seattle isn't this busy," he said.

HEADLINE: New York State's Two-Track Strategy to Improve Rail Service

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It's unfortunate John L. Rose ("Don't Hitch Faster Train Service to Fantasies," letter, Nov. 27) didn't bother to read your entire Nov. 10 news story on Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's proposal to build the world's first magnetically levitated train system from New York City to Boston via Albany before concluding that the state was overlooking improvements to existing rail.
He would have learned that the Governor and I are pursuing a two-track strategy that includes $992 million for upgrading Amtrak rail lines between New York and Buffalo to achieve speeds of up to 125 miles per hour. We also support continued improvement of the Northeast Corridor rail lines from Washington D.C. to Boston through New York City. 
 The Empire Corridor rail improvements, to be completed within five to seven years, would reduce travel time between New York City and Buffalo from eight hours to less than six hours, and cut the trip from Albany to New York City by about 30 minutes, to less than two hours.
There's no doubt the United States has fallen far behind the Europeans and Japanese in the pursuit of high-speed rail, but critics who dismiss maglev as too "grandiose" are showing the same kind of shortsightedness that caused us to lose ground in the first place.
By investing now, New York State can become the world leader in the development of the next generation of transportation technology and reap enormous economic benefits. New York is a state with a proud history of transportation innovation. We had the foresight to invest in canals, trains, subways, airports and interstate highways like the Thruway, all of which stimulated our economy and created thousands of jobs.
While some have raised concerns about its cost, maglev can actually avoid more expensive alternatives for dealing with urban congestion, such as new road construction and airport expansions. In the Los Angeles area, for instance, the Century Freeway was built at a cost of $127 million per mile. In comparison, the cost of building a maglev from New York City to Albany is estimated at a maximum of $45 million per mile. Maglev offers other environmental benefits and energy savings through reduced fuel consumption and improved air quality.
At a time when defense industries are struggling to survive, maglev represents a promising defense diversification initiative for companies like Grumman Corporation on Long Island, which hopes to perfect a maglev design at the nation's first maglev test track proposed for Stewart Airport, near Newburgh.
As for maglev's viability, a recent report commissioned by the United States Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy and the Army Corps of Engineers concluded that the potential benefits from a maglev system are "sufficient to justify initiation of a development program." Furthermore, the study by the National Maglev Initiative found that the Northeast is the only market in the country in which fare revenues could cover capital, operation and maintenance costs.
With its world-class research institutions, advanced technology leaders and highly skilled work force, New York is better positioned than any other state to support the kind of partnership needed to develop this revolutionary new mode of transportation. Now is the time to climb aboard.

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Reacting both to polls that show Americans ever more fearful of violent crime and to Tuesday night's carnage on the Long Island Rail Road, the Clinton Administration today tentatively embraced a proposal to require all gun owners to be licensed.
The plan, the details of which will not be settled for many weeks, was announced by Attorney General Janet Reno, who had been ordered by President Clinton to study the idea only on Wednesday. Other than signing the Brady bill mandating a waiting period for purchases of handguns and supporting a plan to restrict the sale of assault rifles, the President has so far moved cautiously on gun control. 
 Despite the new polls and the shooting spree in which a gunman killed five passengers on the railroad and wounded 18 others, the political equation makes sweeping changes in gun laws perilous.
 
Message From Voters
 Recent elections have sent a cautionary message to the White House. Although there were other important issues that helped shape the outcomes in races in New Jersey and Virginia. In both states, the Democratic gubernatorial candidates, who supported strong gun control measures, were defeated by more conservative candidates. The Republicans had argued that the way to control crime was to impose longer prison sentences and abolish parole.
Even though the National Rifle Association lost the Congressional fight last month over a waiting period for purchases of handguns, it remains a powerful force in Congress and warned that it would fight any attempts to pass other restrictions on handguns.
With the White House facing difficult battles over welfare changes and monumental health care legislation, battles that will require compromises with moderate and conservative lawmakers, it is far from certain how committed the President will be to broad gun control measures when they are actually introduced in Congress.
 
Clinton's Difficult Situation
 Still, the White House finds itself in the awkward position of looking for ways to show its toughness on violent crime by cracking down on the proliferation of guns without alienating those moderate and conservative lawmakers whose votes will be needed on health and welfare.
The awkwardness was evident when the White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, described a session Mr. Clinton had today with mayors and police commissioners.
She said: "What the President said was that the crime issue threatens the rest of his domestic agenda, that if we don't do something about crime it threatens health care reform, job creation and economic growth, welfare reform and a number of the other items that he believes are important.
"So certainly, crime is at the forefront of his domestic agenda, but it works in conjunction with many of the other issues that he feels very strongly about, and he's going to certainly be talking about it and working with members of Congress, working with the local mayors and police chiefs and people around the country to try to do something about not only crime but the decaying social structure that is some of the underpinning causes of crime."
In recent days, Ms. Reno, Mr. Clinton and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis Freeh, have all called for tighter control over weapons. In the meeting with mayors and police commissioners today, Mr. Clinton reaffirmed his commitment to support a ban on assault weapons.
"I think we can do something," he told the group, without discussing specifics. "I think the American people are tired of hurting and tired of feeling insecure and tired of violence."
 
Role for States
 Ms. Reno said that the licensing system should be handled by the states, just as they issue drivers' licenses, and that the Justice Department was in the process of reviewing options.
"I think it should be at least as hard to get a license to possess a gun as it is to drive an automobile," she said today at her weekly news conference. "I don't think somebody should have a gun unless they can demonstrate that they know how to safely and lawfully use it, that they're capable of safely and lawfully using it, and that they're willing to safely and lawfully use it."
But Democratic legislators and their aides today expressed caution about Administration support for specific gun-control proposals. They noted that when separate versions of the crime bill passed the House and Senate last month, the White House and Justice Department were nowhere in sight. The two bills will have to be reconciled next year if they are to become law.
A poll published today by The Los Angeles Times said that despite the adoption of the Brady bill, 64 percent of Americans think gun-control laws are not strong enough, while 7 percent say they are too strong and 24 percent find them adequate. The poll, taken of 1,612 adults nationwide, was conducted from Dec. 4 to Dec. 7 and its results have a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
A study to be made public on Friday by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press found that 57 percent approved of the President's attempts to limit the use of handguns, while 29 percent disapproved.
By a margin of 51 percent to 45 percent, they opposed a law to ban the sale of handguns, although 57 percent said controlling guns was more important than protecting the right to own guns. Still, only 41 percent of those polled thought stricter gun control laws would significantly reduce violent crime. The survey of 1,479 adults was conducted from Dec. 2 to Dec. 5 and had a margin of sampling error of 3 percentage points.
Ten states, including New York and New Jersey, already require gun owners to have permits. An 11th state, Minnesota, requires either a permit or a seven-day waiting period.
Ten days ago, Mr. Clinton signed the Brady bill, which imposes a waiting period of five business days for handgun purchases so that local law-enforcement authorities can check the background of the prospective buyer for evidence of a criminal past or mental instability. The bill was named for James S. Brady, the former White House press secretary who was wounded in the 1981 attempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan.
Supporters of gun control legislation said that it was only a first step and that its effect on controlling weapons would probably be limited.
 
Push for Licensing
 On Wednesday, Mr. Brady, joined by his wife Sarah and Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, announced his intention to push for new gun-control legislation next year. The measure would require all handgun buyers to get a license that would be issued after a background check. It would also limit purchases to one handgun a month and require the registration of all handguns, including used ones that are resold.
A group from the Conference of Mayors presented Mr. Clinton with a report today that recommended gun registration, banning semiautomatic assault weapons, imposing waiting periods on purchases of all firearms and new taxes on weapons and ammunition.
Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, today proposed that a 30 percent sales tax be imposed on handguns, assault weapons and ammunition for both. Under the proposed legislation, revenue from the tax and from a steep increase in Federal gun dealers' licensing fees would go toward health care costs. Under the plan, dealers would pay $3,000 for a three-year license.

HEADLINE: Bank Official Gets Reduced Term Over Iraq Loans

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS

 BODY:
A Federal judge gave a reduced sentence yesterday to an Atlanta bank manager who had granted more than $5 billion in secret loans that were used to arm Iraq.
Judge G. Ernest Tidwell of Federal District Court in Atlanta sentenced the banker, Christopher P. Drogoul, to 37 months in prison, saying he was giving a reduced sentence because the United States Government had encouraged economic aid to Iraq. Mr. Drogoul has already served nearly 20 months of that sentence and could be freed in less than a year. 
 Mr. Drogoul, who was the manager of the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, which is based in Rome, had pleaded guilty to three felony counts earlier this fall, precluding a trial on his role in arming Iraq. Before that plea, his trial was to serve as the main stage for accusations that President George Bush and others in his Administration had secretly armed Iraq and then sought to cover that up when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990.
Mr. Drogoul was charged by the Justice Department under President Bush with defrauding his superiors in Rome in making the loans to Iraq. In his defense, Mr. Drogoul said that in covertly funneling the loans to Iraq, he was acting with the implicit understanding of his superiors in Rome who had been asked to help Saddam Hussein by Bush Administration officials.
But Judge Tidwell ruled that Mr. Drogoul's lawyers could not present evidence as to Washington's policy toward Iraq. With that ruling crippling the defense, Robert Simels, Mr. Drogoul's lawyer, said there was little hope of an acquittal.
Nonetheless, Judge Tidwell said United States policy toward Iraq was a factor in his deciding Mr. Drogoul's sentence. The Federal sentencing guidelines would have required Mr. Drogoul to be sent to jail for 46 to 57 months, but Judge Tidwell said from the bench that he was departing from the guidelines, an unusual procedure.
In explaining his reasons, Judge Tidwell said, "The Government actually pursued a policy of economic support to Iraq even though the creditworthiness of Iraq would not have justified such credit and such information was readily available."
Many of the loans that Mr. Drogoul processed was money guaranteed by the United States Government.
John Hogan, a senior aide to Attorney General Janet Reno, told Judge Tidwell that the Justice Department was still investigating the arming of Iraq.

HEADLINE: PENTAGON FIGHTS BUDGET OFFICIALS OVER $50 BILLION

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
After drafting an ambitious post-cold-war strategy, the Pentagon finds itself $50 billion short of what it needs to carry out the plan and in a skirmish with the White House budget director over the money.
The dispute has been going on behind the scenes for weeks. But it broke into the open today, when Leon E. Panetta, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, confirmed that the Defense Department would be short $40 billion to $50 billion over the next five years. With President Clinton trying to cut the Federal budget, Mr. Panetta said he did not expect a change would be made in next year's Pentagon spending request. 
 Defense Secretary Les Aspin plans to ask for the extra money anyway when he meets with Mr. Clinton next week to discuss his budget, leaving Mr. Clinton to arbitrate the fight. The shortage stems from faulty inflation estimates and the decision by Congress to raise military pay.
 
Tough Spot for Clinton
 That puts the President exactly where he least wants to be: in a dispute between his budget director and the Pentagon and potentially in a standoff with Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee and supports the Pentagon's push for additional money.
This latest episode is the opening round of the annual infighting over the budget. This year's debate is especially heated, however, because Mr. Clinton is trying to protect the United States role as a military power while honoring his promise to shift the nation's priorities more to domestic programs.
Also at stake are the White House's relations with the uniformed military. "Something will have to give if we don't get the funds," a Pentagon official said. "We will either have to cut the forces and throw the strategy overboard, give up some weapons modernization or get the funds we need from domestic programs."
 
'This Is a Real War'
 One general said: "This is a real war. It is a war with O.M.B. and a war among ourselves."
From the start, some critics questioned whether the Pentagon had the resources to underwrite its strategy of being able to fight two regional wars that begin nearly at the same time.
The Pentagon says it needs to maintain this ability to deter attack by third world countries. For example, if the American military had the ability to fight only one regional war, a conflict on the Korean peninsula could encourage countries like Iraq or Iran to seize the opportunity to strike.
Thus, the already-tight Pentagon budget was further squeezed when Congress decided to ordered a payincrease for military personnel that the Clinton Administration had not sought. That and other personnel decisions added $14.5 billion to the Pentagon's five-year plan.
In addition, inflation estimates that were too optimistic also mean that the military budget is underfinanced by $33 billion, Pentagon officials say.
As a result, Pentagon officials say they are faced with a five year shortage of almost $50 billion.
Senator Nunn predicted this problem in March. He said then that he had been assured by the White House that it would support increases in military spending if they were needed.
"I have been assured that the Administration will not permit higher inflation in the future to damage our defense capability," Senator Nunn said in a speech on March 5.
 
Speech by Senator
 He also said then that the White House had told him the military budget would be protected if Congress voted to give the troops a raise over the Administration's objections.
But now many Federal agencies expect to be short of money and the White House budget office is trying to hold the line against increases in military spending. Mr. Panetta said today that agency heads throughout the Government were asking for $20 billion more than they were going to get for next year, adding to the pressures to make tough-minded budget decisions.
Amid all this, the budget office and the Pentagon have staked out their positions.
Mr. Panetta told reporters today that he supported the new strategy but added he did not anticipate increasing next year's military spending request to make up the difference.
Asked if the White House planned to forgo any adjustments in the Pentagon spending request for next year, Mr. Panetta said, "Yes."
Referring to the five-year $1.2 trillion Pentagon spending plan announced in March, Mr. Panetta said, "The President has pretty much made a commitment that he wants to stick to those numbers."
 
Pentagon's Understanding
 Pentagon officials also say there was an understanding between the Defense Department and the White House that money to cover inflation and the pay raise would be provided if they they were needed.
"We're still sticking to the agreement," a Pentagon official said, adding the military does not believe that Mr. Clinton had made up his mind.
If the White House rejects Mr. Aspin's appeal for more money, senior Pentagon official say, the Defense Department will have reopen its comprehensive bottom-up review.
After Mr. Panetta's comments became known at the Pentagon, a spokesman for the budget official sought to play down any suggestion that Mr. Panetta had prejudged President Clinton's decision.
"It is the director's view that we are staying on the path we have established in the President's economic plan," a spokesman for Mr. Panetta said. "The specific issue of whether there will be any adjustments in relations to these issues will be decided in the budget process."
But the spokesman declined to comment when asked if Mr. Panetta wanted to amend his earlier remarks that suggested he did not expect to make an adjustment in the Pentagon's spending proposal for next year.
Military spending has gone down steadily since the height of the Reagan Administration's buildup in 1985, after adjustment for inflation.
Still, with a budget this fiscal year of $262 billion, the Pentagon spends more than the other agencies, making it a tempting target for budget cutters.
 
Comprehensive Plan
 As part of a comprehensive plan to develop a military force for the post-cold war world, the Defense Department announced in September that it planned to field 10 active Army divisions, 12 aircraft carriers and 20 active and reserve Air Force wings and a sizable Marine Corps.
Even that plan, which was approved by Mr. Clinton, initially posed problems for the Pentagon. The price tag for the force was $13 billion more than the Pentagon had planned to spend over five years, requiring offsetting cuts.
Deeper cuts, experts say, could prompt a wide-ranging debate over the wisdom of the Pentagon's strategy of preparing for two regional conflicts, its multibillion dollar decision to build a third Seawolf attack submarine to preserve the military industrial base and its decision to proceed with other costly weapons programs, including new nuclear tipped submarine missiles.
Some critics say the Pentagon can afford to make deeper cuts.
But the Clinton Administration is reluctant to drop the two-war strategy, which was also endorsed by the Bush Administration, in part because it does not want to be seen as retreating from American military commitments.
Further, the pace of American military operations around the world is already putting the operations and maintenance accounts under strain.
Another concern is that many of some of the savings through more efficient operations anticipated by the Bush Administration may not materialize.
"I am concerned that D.O.D. not be penalized if the Clinton Administration inherits phony assumed savings from its predecessors," Mr. Nunn said in March.

HEADLINE: Mediators Cancel Meeting of Bosnian Foes After Government Balks

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The international mediators trying to end the conflict in Bosnia today abruptly canceled a meeting between the warring parties that they had planned on Sunday in Greece after the Bosnian Government said it would not attend.
But diplomats reported that Lord Owen, the European Community's mediator, and Thorvald Stoltenberg, who represents the United Nations, hope they can bring Serbian, Croatian and Muslim leaders together for another meeting about Dec. 20 that could produce a peace settlement. 
 The decision to cancel the meeting, planned in the northern Greek city of Salonika, came after the two mediators met today in Belgrade with Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia, and Radovan Karadzic, leader of the self-styled Serbian Republic in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
 
Hopes for Breakthrough Rise
 Details of today's Belgrade talks are not yet known, but diplomats said hopes of a breakthrough had risen in the last day or so after an earlier round of talks in Geneva broke off inconclusively just over a week ago.
Part of the reason for the renewed optimism that the three parties might finally accept a settlement splittting Bosnia into three ethnically based states are signs of a possible agreement giving the Bosnians access to the Adriatic Sea through the Prevlaka Peninsula, on the border between Croatia and Montenegro. The area is a demilitarized zone controlled by United Nations forces.
The Bosnians had been pressing for a corridor to the sea either through the Croatian port of Ploce or at the seaside town of Neum, in Herzegovina. But these solutions would separate two Croatian cities, Split in the north and Dubrovnik in the south. So the Croatian side proposed Prevlaka.
 
Militarily Sensitive Area
 But a Muslim corridor to the town would have to traverse Serb-controlled territory. Moreover, Prevlaka is militarily sensitive because it is within artillery distance of the Yugoslav naval base at Kotor Bay.
Officials say the Serbs may consent to the proposal, however, in an effort to obtain a relaxation of international trade sanctions, which have destroyed the economy of Serbia and Montenegro, the other republic in the rump Yugoslavia.
Today, the United States, France and Britain rejected a Russian request to send large quantities of natural gas to Yugoslavia this winter to heat homes, schools and hospitals, and set tough new conditions for supplying any extra energy during the winter.
The United States, France and Britain said they were opposed to granting any general exemptions from the trade embargo for energy this winter. But they agreed at a meeting of the Security Council committee overseeing the sanctions to allow limited deliveries of energy to specified needy groups if the United Nations thinks they should be given help and the energy supplied is carefully monitored. Because decisions of the sanctions committee must be unanimous, these countries can impose their terms.
 
Warning of a Catastrophe
 As a first example of this new policy, the committee gave permission today to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to import 20,000 tons of fuel for refugee aid programs and 7,000 tons for distribution to mental hospitals, orphanages and other institutions denied fuel by the Belgrade Government.
Supporting Russia's request for permission to sell about 130 million cubic meters of natural gas monthly to Yugoslavia, Moscow's United Nations representative, Yuli Vorontsov, told the committee that the country faced "a real humanitarian catastrophe" this winter, with only enough fuel to meet 20 to 30 percent of its needs.
While Mr. Vorontsov did not deny the need to maintain sanctions as a way of forcing Belgrade it to end the fighting by Serbs in Bosnia, he said they should not overstep certain "humanitarian limits," contending that the shortage of medicine, fuel and many basic goods now "constitutes a real threat to the health and survival of hundreds of thousands of people."
But a United States official said, "We want to continue bringing the reality of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina home to the Serbs in Belgrade while avoiding excessive humanitarian suffering."

8 Killed in Sarajevo
 SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dec. 8 (Special to The New York Times) -- Fighting increased in this besieged capital today, with 8 people killed and 26 wounded by artillery and sniper fire from the Serbian positions ringing the city.
Two of the people who died were picked off by sniper fire, which has increased since the lifting of a fog that had blanketed the city for most of the week. One of the artillery victims was the head of a local health center, who was hit while unloading baby milk sent by Unicef.
Heavy shelling was also reported in Mostar, leaving at least one dead, Bosnian television said. Artillery fire and firefights were also reported in a number of other towns.
Serbian forces shelled areas where relief supplies were being airdropped by parachute, a United Nations spokesman, Lieut. Col. Bill Aikman, said this morning. United Nations officials have complained in recent days that the Serbs have been blocking relief truck convoys despite several agreements that they should let the supplies pass unhindered.

HEADLINE: Panel Urges Expanding Aid for Two-Parent Homes

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
In an effort to encourage family stability, the Clinton Administration's task force on overhauling welfare has proposed to make it much easier for families to collect welfare even when the father is present.
Administration officials said the recommendation, described in a confidential draft of a report to President Clinton, is meant to correct the welfare system's much criticized tendency to divide families by cutting off benefits when the father lives in the house. 
 "We need to send the signal that two-parent families are vitally important," said David T. Ellwood, an assistant secretary of Health and Human Services, who is one of three leaders of the task force.
But as is often the case in the welfare system, the effort to correct one problem could create another. Conservative analysts asserted today that allowing fathers to collect welfare could significantly increase the program, which already covers a record 14 million Americans, and would weaken the incentive for fathers to work.
"It runs counter to what we're tying to encourage here," said Representative Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a sponsor of a Republican welfare bill. "It says, 'Don't bother working.' "
Mr. Ellwood conceded that the proposal would increase the number of people on welfare but called the expansion "very modest" and short term. He said he did not know how many families that would be affected or how much the proposal would cost.
Private analysts were in sharp disagreement, with estimates ranging from a few hundred thousand to more than one million new welfare recipients.
"My fear is that, if this passes, five years from now we will be trying to reduce the number of welfare fathers as well as welfare mothers," said Douglas Besharov, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.
The recommendation is part of an Administration effort to fulfill President Clinton's campaign pledge "to end welfare as we know it" by imposing a two-year limit on benefits. After that, Mr. Clinton said, welfare recipients will have to work.
Last summer he appointed Administration officials to translate his popular campaign pledge into legislation. After months of research and public hearings, they have revised their recommendations, which are now summarized in a 31-page paper dated Dec. 6.
 
Shoring Up Families
 Mr. Ellwood said the proposed rule changes were part of a larger strategy to shore up the American family, including a proposal that President Clinton lead a campaign against teen-age pregnancy.
The paper also recommends that teen-age mothers on welfare be required to live with their parents rather than set up homes on their own, noting that such young mothers "are rarely ready to manage a household or raise children on their own."
It proposes letting welfare mothers satisfy work requirements by serving as mentors who would discourage teen-agers from becoming pregnant.
And the officials studying that matter may propose allowing all states to deny extra payments to women who have additional children, as New Jersey and some other states are now doing as an experiment.
 
Hurdles for Fathers
 There are now about five million families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the main Federal welfare program.
But only about 350,000 of those families are households where both parents live together. Such families, the paper said, "are subject to much more stringent eligibility rules than single-parent families."
That is because the A.F.D.C. program was originally intended for widows during the Great Depression, when the expectation was that families with healthy fathers could support themselves.
But in the subsequent decades analysts began to fear that the restrictions on aid to fathers encouraged families to break up, and the rules have been slowly changed since 1961.
Under current law, two-parent families can collect welfare but only if the father has a substantial work history, defined as having been employed in six of the previous 13 months. That is meant to reserve aid for fathers who are temporarily unemployed, rather than terminally idle.
And 13 states, including Florida and Texas, provide aid to such families only for six months a year.
The panel's recommendation, which would need Congressional approval, would abolish the work-history requirement, and extend welfare year-round to any two-parent family poor enough to meet the income requirements, which vary by state.
"We don't want there to be incentives that favor single-parent families, if at all possible," said Mr. Ellwood. "This is all in the context of promoting parental responsibility."
A two-parent family is defined as a mother and father living together, married or not.
The panel also proposed abolishing another rule that restricts aid to two-parent families. Such families now cannot collect aid if one parent works more than 100 hours a month. Mr. Ellwood said that rule discouraged recipients who want to work. .
 
How Big an Expansion?
 While Mr. Ellwood said the changed rules would bring "a very modest expansion of people on the welfare rolls," he predicted that their stay would be short term.
That is because, under the Clinton proposal, most welfare recipients would be required to seek job training to improve their skills. And those without jobs within the two years would be required to enroll in a Government-financed work program.
While Mr. Ellwood cited no numbers, another member of the panel predicted that the changes would bring roughly an additional 250,000 families onto welfare.
But Mr. Besharov called the proposal "a sharp break from past welfare policy" that could extend welfare to as many as one million fathers who are now indigent and living away from their children.
Though potentially unpopular with conservatives, the proposal is likely to enjoy favor with many advocacy groups, which fear that current rules push families to break up.
Mark Greenberg of the Center on Law and Social Policy, a Washington advocacy group, praised the Administration proposal, saying it "sends a clear signal that it's all right for the father to live with his children."
As in previous drafts, the 31-page report was silent on how much the program will cost. It reiterated that the cost of the expanded training and work programs would be offset by cuts in other programs.

HEADLINE: M.R.I. Scanner Industry Faces a Shakeout

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
When Alan Winakor first got into the business of owning and operating magnetic resonance imaging scanners in New York during the 1980's, the machines -- which can take sophisticated pictures of the brain and other body parts -- were a sure-fire way to make money.
Private insurers gladly paid more than $1,000 for the test, which recent studies have suggested can cost only $300 to perform. And doctors were liberally ordering this risk-free exam to diagnose an ever-growing range of medical conditions, from brain tumors to knee cartilage tears. 
 
 
Shakeout in Industry
 The result was a proliferation of the machines, which cost from $1 million to $2 million. Today, in one square mile of Long Island, there are now 13 scanners, more than in Canada's most populous province, Ontario, which has four times as many people as Nassau and Suffolk counties.
But today, as more patients have moved into health maintenance organizations and the nation is looking hard at reining in the cost of care, investors in M.R.I. scanners and other profit-making medical ventures are finding the bloom is wilting.
"I don't think we'll all survive," said Mr. Winakor, president of Medical Marketing Developments, which manages and markets seven M.R.I. centers in the New York area. "A couple of borderline facilities have already closed and I think you're going to see tremendous consolidation in the next year or two."
Spurred often more by the promise of profits than by medical necessity, the United States has accumulated a vast supply of privately owned medical technology, from M.R.I.'s to cholesterol testing labs to nuclear heart scanners -- far more than the country needs, many health economists say. And perversely, this abundance -- combined with the willingness of private insurers to pay top dollar for certain tests -- has in many cases kept prices high: since many M.R.I. machines are busy only half the day, their owners must charge high rates in order to cover their overhead.
But economists say that the era of freewheeling investment in medical technologies like M.R.I. scanners is now waning, especially with the rise of managed care, a trend that President Clinton's proposed health care reforms seem certain to accelerate. As a result, thousands of private businesses like Mr. Winakor's are scrambling to arrange contracts with unions, insurers or hospitals -- anyone that can promise a steady market for their products.
Many health economists and patient advocates say the shakeout will be a boon for patients. They say many M.R.I. operations are inefficient and overpriced, and that their aggressive marketing practices and sometimes shady arrangements with doctors have led to many unneeded scans, sometimes for more than $1,000 each. A 1992 General Accounting Office report concluded that it costs efficient M.R.I. centers only $262 to $399 to do the test. And so many experts expect that the coming consolidation will lead not to a shortage of scanners but to greater efficiency and lower prices among those that survive.
"The situation with M.R.I.'s is symptomatic of the tremendous excess capacity in our health care system: hospitals in the Sun Belt are half full, M.R.I. machines and mammography machines can operate less than half the day," said Dr. Uwe Reinhardt, a professor of health economics at Princeton University. "No airline can be profitable with a 50 percent load, but these facilities can do it because private insurers pay ridiculous prices -- they have shoveled out the money."
 
H.M.O.'s Seek Discounts
 But others warn that the consolidation will involve some hardship for patients. These machines, they point out, have allowed doctors to safely and simply diagnose conditions that previously required risky and invasive testing.
"I think that access to the scans is going to be drastically diminished and I think its naive to think that only the unnecessary scans will be eliminated and the necessary ones will still occur," said Dr. Jeffrey Newhouse, professor of radiology at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, who added that an insured person who can now be scanned the same day the test is ordered, and within a mile of his home, might in the future have to wait longer and travel farther.
Although no one knows exactly how many M.R.I. scanners there are in New York City, estimates range from 100 to 200, with a vast majority being in neighborhoods where the well-insured live, with a relative shortage in poorer areas.
In the 1980's with private insurers paying more than $1,000 and Medicare paying more than $700 a scan, even scanners that sat dormant much of the day could turn a good profit.
While private insurers may pay handsomely per scan, H.M.O.'s and other managed-care plans are likely to negotiate severely discounted rates -- some already pay only $400 a scan -- or to pay a flat fee to a radiology center for as many scans as may be needed. Also, H.M.O. doctors will probably be far less likely to order the test than private doctors. H.M.O.'s are generally paid a yearly fee for taking care of patients, and ordering expensive tests will quickly eat up the annual fees.
 
Changes Affecting Business
 "Managed care stands the economics of these machines on its head," Dr. Reinhardt said.
Already, in anticipation of great changes, orders for new machines in 1993 were only half of the number in 1992, said Philip Drew, a medical technology market analyst with the Concord Consulting Group. New laws that limit doctors' ability to invest in medical testing operations have also dampened enthusiasm for such ventures. During the late 80's neurologists and orthopedists were frequent investors in new M.R.I. machines, but studies showed that physicians with such investments tended to order more scans, raising ethical questions.
Traditional economic theory holds that such an excess supply should have brought prices for M.R.I. scans down, but the opposite occurred: Studies showed that in states with few scanners, the cost of the procedure was low, but in states with an abundance, the charges were high, said William Reis, who evaluated the economics of M.R.I.'s for the General Accounting Office.
Moreover, because the owners of scanners outside hospitals often need to charge high fees to survive, most do not take Medicaid and are far too costly for the uninsured.
 
Poor Often Denied Access
 "You find yourself in the idiotic position of having to deny poor people access to technology because you have too many machines," said Dr. Reinhardt. The same situation exists with mammography centers, he said.
From the medical perspective, M.R.I. scans are virtually no-risk procedures. The machines, normally run by technicians, create detailed images of the body's inner organs using only magnetic fields, and involve no radiation; the only significant drawback is that some patients become claustrophobic when slid into the tunnel-like apparatus.
As a result, health experts say, many doctors have taken to ordering them at the slightest hint of disease -- at least for those patients with conventional insurance plans. In an age of heightened malpractice fears, some doctors ordered scans for every headache to make sure the cause wasn't a tumor and for every new back pain to rule out a ruptured disc.
"Right now, if the patient is insured with fee-for-service insurance, there's no down side," said Dr. Roger Hyman, chairman of the Department of Radiology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. "The patient will get reimbursed. The doctor will get information -- or no information if it's normal."
Financially, M.R.I. scanners have little risk. Most are bought or leased from one of three major manufacturers, and economists say that with prevailing private insurance rates, the machines can make profits doing as few as five scans a day.
"Even if you took all Medicare patients you'd be breaking even if you did 2,000 patients a year," Mr. Drew said. "And for scanners that take mostly private, the break-even number is about 1,500."
 
Circumventing Regulations
 In an effort to limit the number of scanners, most states declared in the mid-80's that before a hospital installed a new machine it would have to apply for a "certificate of need," showing that there was enough business to support the purchase. There are now 31 certified scanners in New York City, which as part of their contracts must agree to take all patients regardless of insurance type.
But New York and most other states do not regulate scanners outside hospitals, and investors quickly saw an opportunity, so that there are now far more machines outside hospitals than in them.
"They put in place this program to control costs and the number of scanners and it backfired," Dr. Hyman said. "The hospital couldn't have one, so the physicians and investors put in one across the street and not only did they not prevent the opening of another scanner, but costs actually went up." The private offices tend to skim off the patients with good insurance, leaving the poor for the hospital scanners. As a result, while privately insured patients or those on Medicare can often be scanned at a moment's notice, those on Medicaid, with the lowest reimbursement rates, may wait weeks.
There are now 2,500 to 3,500 scanners nationwide and perhaps 10 percent of those are in New York State, with most of those in the New York metropolitan area, Dr. Hyman said. But these are just ballpark guesses, and the handful of manufacturers carefully guard the number of machines they sell and service in a given region as a trade secret.
After several Government reports concluded that insurers were paying too much for scans, Medicare reduced its reimbursements from about $700 a scan five years ago to $550 now.
The declining payments in and of themselves will not drive centers out of business. But there is more trouble at the door. Many managed care organizations have specific protocols for dealing with conditions like back pain: under the protocols, M.R.I.'s are postponed until conservative treatment -- generally bed rest, exercise and medicine -- has been tried and has failed. Because most patients respond to this treatment, many scans are avoided.
But there has been a decrease in ordering scans from traditional private doctors as well, said Mr. Drew, who speculates that all the recent political attention on excessive health-care costs has caused doctors to hesitate before ordering expensive tests. Doctors say that in the last year, the number of M.R.I. scans ordered locally is down 15 to 20 percent, Mr. Winakor said.
 
Economics vs. Medicine
 The question of how many scans need to be done and how many scanners are required to do them is more of a political and economic decision than a medical one, Dr. Hyman said. "You get information from each scan but when you add in the cost factor it may not always be worth it," he said. "In a managed-care environment you say this is an $800 test, am I likely to get that much worth of information?"
Preparing for the future, M.R.I. owners like Mr. Winakor are undertaking aggressive marketing campaigns, contracting with unions, insurers and hospitals to provide discounted scans in return for "a measure of exclusivity." But he and others worry that the big H.M.O.'s, which control the movement of vast numbers of patients, will be able to bargain for rates that will drive them out of existence.
At the same time, medical economists like Dr. Reinhardt look on with a certain amount of glee. He says that medical technology has long escaped the controlling pull of market forces.
"The Clinton plan is designed to demolish excess capacity," he said. "Medical manufacturers think it's the Government that's going to be the devil at their neck, but I think its the little H.M.O. managers who are going to be an army of little devils at their necks."

HEADLINE: NO MORE OFFERS, NORTH KOREA SAYS

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 9

 BODY:
North Korea said today that its offer to the United States to open a limited number of sites to nuclear inspection was the "largest concession" it could make, and warned that if it was turned down the North would conclude that Washington "no longer has the intention to continue dialogue."
The statement by the North Korean Foreign Ministry seemed to heighten the standoff with the Clinton Administration. At the same time, though, the North seemed to offer hope of some further progress, saying that once the two countries agreed on a "package solution" -- shorthand for economic aid and moves toward diplomatic recognition -- it would agree to full inspection of the sites it had declared to the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
 [In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman, Christine Shelly, said the United States was "not unduly" upset by the latest statement from North Korea, Reuters reported.]
 
Some Urge Softer Line
 So far, the Clinton Administration has refused to be lured into such an agreement, insisting that the North first comply with its inspection obligations under the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons and begin to hold serious talks with South Korea. But some officials in Washington and Seoul are already arguing for a softer line, one that would give the North much of what it has demanded in return for a solution to the impasse.
"We have encouraged the United States to show some flexibility," an official of South Korea's Foreign Ministry said today. Washington has not presented a new offer to North Korea's delegation to the United Nations.
Resuming normal inspections of North Korea's nuclear plants would not include its two major nuclear waste dumps, which the United States believes may provide evidence of how much plutonium the North has produced in the months when inspections were forbidden. That issue, officials say, would come later, during talks on resuming more normal relations.
 
Economic Problems
 North Korea's statement also included a lengthy review of the country's faltering economy, and acknowledged for the first time that the situation is growing increasingly dire. It said that the collapse of some of its main allies, all socialist nations, "caused big losses in our economic construction," and that "we have to divert a big proportion of the economy to national defense in order to increase the defense capabilities of the country."
A reformist member of the government, Kim Dal Hyon, who was removed earlier this week as the state planning chief and Deputy Prime Minister, was not listed today when the North Korean Government issued a list of names of its politburo. There had been speculation that Kim Dal Hyon was in line to become the next Prime Minister, and some analysts said his removal suggested he was being blamed for a disastrous year in both foreign and economic affairs.

HEADLINE: Level Producer Prices Show Inflation at Bay

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Despite a spirited surge in the economy, inflation remains at bay.
Prices obtained by American producers for finished goods showed no change in November, the Labor Department reported today, as increases for food and cars were about offset by declines for energy and tobacco. 
 Only one month since April has shown even the slightest increase at the producer, or wholesale, level -- a two-tenths of 1 percent rise during September. The index that shows consumer price movements is scheduled to be issued on Friday.
"Inflation still looks comfortably low," said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Lehman Brothers Global Economics.
If food and energy, two large and typically erratic components, are excluded from the calculation, the Producer Price Index rose four-tenths of 1 percent, the most since April. Most economists, however, considered this increase in the so-called core rate a temporary blip, mainly reflecting a 2.1 percent jump in car prices after a drop of 3.9 percent in October.
The gyrations in automobiles reflect the introduction of new models and adjustments the Government makes for changes in quality; air bags becoming standard equipment, for example.
Financial markets thus took the report in stride, with the Federal Reserve still expected to make no change in monetary policy -- though it could incline toward tightening -- at the meeting of its Open Market Committee on Dec. 21.
Strongly expanding economies tend to generate inflationary pressures and many investors and analysts have grown wary of late that the Federal Reserve, which has been holding to an accommodative policy, will seek to dampen an economy widely expected to grow at a rate of 4 percent or more in the current quarter.
Indeed, some of its officials have said that short-term interest rates, which the central bank has held steady for the last 15 months, will need to rise. They have avoided, however, giving any indication of timing nor have they cited evidence of any speed-up in inflation.
The Clinton Administration and some Democrats in Congress have been emphasizing what they regard as a very encouraging outlook for a check on inflation, in particular the sharp decline in oil prices this fall.
Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, whose members buy from producers, said that since the Producer Price Index did not change last month, neither should Federal Reserve policy.
"Despite recent signs of economic growth, including stronger retail sales and gross domestic product, the threat of renewed inflation is minimal," Mr. Schreibman said.
Various analysts, in fact, find little historical relation between growth and inflation. "We ought not to assume that because the economy's growing so rapidly that this means inflation has to rise," said James W. Coons, economist for Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio.
Pointing to data for the gross domestic product and the Consumer Price Index from 1950 to 1993, he found that "inflation in the next year bears no statistically significant relationship to economic growth in the current year."
But while agreeing about the record, H. Erich Heinemann of Ladenburg, Thalmann told clients this week that he rejected what he said had become the "conventional wisdom of a new era of low inflation."
He predicted a rise based on a 50 percent spurt in bank reserves over the last three years and on what appears to be a lack of anti-inflation political commitment in Washington.
Today's report on producer prices showed that the lack of current price pressure was about as favorable for goods at the intermediate and crude stages of production as for finished goods.
Intermediate goods, like a sack of flour, eased two-tenths of 1 percent in November, the best performance since May, while crude goods, such as a bushel of wheat, rose four-tenths of 1 percent after a 1.4 percent jump in October.
Among finished goods, those ready for sale to the final individual or business user, food prices rose eight-tenths of 1 percent as beef and veal, fresh and dry vegetables and fruits and melons turned up while the price of milled rice soared 29.3 percent after a 21.4 percent October jump.
Prospects for exporting rice to the Far East have brightened lately.
 
Energy and Tobacco Fall
 Energy goods fell 2.7 percent, paced by a 5.8 percent drop for gasoline that nearly offset a big October rise. Tobacco prices fell 1.3 percent after two straight gains, the report also showed.
For intermediate goods, where food and energy paralleled finished counterparts, prices firmed three-tenths of 1 percent for durable materials used in manufacturing, like cold rolled steel. Prices eased three-tenths of 1 percent, however, for nondurable factory goods, like chemicals.
The Producer Price Index for construction materials climbed six-tenths of 1 percent in November, surpassing a five-tenths of 1 percent October gain.

HEADLINE: U.S. Specifies Highways Eligible for Upgrading

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Hoping to stop Congress from using Federal transportation money for pet projects, the Clinton Administration today identified 159,000 miles of highways as strategically important and said only those roads would qualify for more than $14 billion in improvements through 1997.
The proposed system, which requires Congressional approval, includes the 45,000-mile Interstate highway system, highways deemed necessary for defense and those that serve regional travel and provide access to airports, Amtrak stations, public transportation systems, water ports and freight terminals. 
 Four million miles of roads criss-cross the nation, but the designated highways carry more than 50 percent of the nation's traffic and 70 percent of truck traffic, Administration officials said.
 
Formula of 1991 Act
 The 50 states and scores of regional planning commissions will determine which of those highways will receive the Federal money distributed in accordance with a formula in a 1991 act that required the Administration to designate a National Highway System.
The system is the first step toward a national plan intended to integrate all methods of travel and enable local officials to determine the best way to move their people and products. Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena said that with all its maps of highways, airports, ports and shipping lanes, the agency had no map that showed how the systems were linked and interact "or fail to do so."
In the past, Mr. Pena said, local officials asked, "How can we extend or widen a road?" or "How can we add a new subway?" By so doing, he said, the officials lost sight of their goal of serving people who are "trying to get to work or to get home for the holidays, people trying to get raw materials to their businesses and ship goods to their customers."
As the former Mayor of Denver, he said, "I can tell you that in the past, the first question was, 'Where's the money?' Mr. Pena said the city's transportation policy was driven more by the availability of Federal dollars than by the travel needs of citizens. "Those were the projects we went after."
"We can't afford to make decisions as we did in the past," Mr. Pena said.
Asked about President Clinton's offer of highways, bridges and other transportation projects to gain Congressional votes for the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Pena said the President had merely promised to "expedite and facilitate projects already in the pipeline." Some of those projects were mired in the bureaucracy, Mr. Pena said, noting, "Sometimes it was our fault."
 
Hearings Are Planned
 Congressional leaders joined representatives of many transportation organizations in expressing enthusiasm for the proposal. Congress is set to begin hearings in February.
In the New York City area, the system includes the West Side Highway, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, Broadway, the Belt Parkway, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, the Long Island Expressway, the Cross Bronx Expressway, Bruckner Expressway, Cross Island Parkway, Interborough Parkway, Northern and Southern State Parkways and the Hutchinson River and Bronx River Parkways.
They are among thousands of highway projects that will qualify for the more than $3 billion earmarked for the National Highway System each year through 1997. An additional $2.5 billion annually is available for maintenance of the Interstate system, along with $3.5 billion annually for city streets and rural roads. Another $2.5 billion is available for bridge maintenance.
"This will help rebuild America," said Rodney E. Slater, the Federal Highway Administrator.
 
New York's Share
 Under the Federal formula, New York State is eligible for $180 million this year under the National Highway System, as well as for $102 million for maintenance of the Interstate system, $142 million under the city street and rural road program, and $255 million for bridges.
New Jersey is eligible for $87 million under the highway program, $31 million for Interstate maintenance, $118 million for bridges and $90 million for city streets and rural roads. Connecticut is eligible for $57 million for highways, $35 million for the Interstate, $68 million for bridges and $84 million for city streets and rural roads.
Secretary Pena noted that the United States spends nearly $1 trillion a year on transporation -- 17 percent of the gross domestic product. "That means that any gains we can register in systemwide efficiency will have large and rapid payoffs," he said.
In addition to the Interstate system, the National Highway System includes 21 corridors Congress designated for the system totaling 4,500 miles, including a stretch of U.S. Highway 219 south of Buffalo that was championed by former Representative Henry J. Nowak, a Democrat who was a senior member of the Public Works and Transportation Committee.
There are also the Strategic Highway Corridor Network, which comprises 15,700 miles of highway designated by the Defense Department, and 1,900 miles of roads linking major military installations and related sites.

HEADLINE: Budget Director Looking For a Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration needs to squeeze more than $30 billion from department spending requests to hold next year's Federal budget below the limits allowed by law, Budget Director Leon E. Panetta said today.
Mr. Panetta said the Federal departments had requested $20 billion to $23 billion more than allowed by the spending ceiling established in the deficit-reduction package approved last August. 
 In addition, he said the Administration needed to cut $10 billion from the budget requests to allow for salary increases mandated by Congress for some Federal employees and to compensate for an inflation rate that is lower than the Administration had predicted. Lower inflation means the spending caps will be less than anticipated.
 
Suggestions for Cuts
 Mr. Panetta, who made his comments in a meeting with reporters, said that he and directors of nine Federal departments had meetings in recent days with President Clinton in which the agency heads defended their budget requests while Mr. Panetta suggested ways that some of the agencies could trim spending.
"These caps are extremely tight," Mr. Panetta said. "It's going to force some tough decisions."
For instance, he said the Pentagon's request for next year is about $5 billion more than the President had envisioned in his military spending plan, while the State Department's budget request exceeded the targets set by the Office of Management and Budget.
Making the Administration's efforts harder is Mr. Clinton's desire to increase spending in areas that he calls investments in the future, including Head Start, job training, education and technological research. This, Mr. Panetta said, means the White House has to make deeper spending cuts in some areas to finance greater spending on "investment" programs while staying within the budget caps.
Mr. Panetta said the Administration had not yet decided what many of the spending cuts would be, although he said some of them would come from Vice President Al Gore's plan to streamline Government. Specifically, he cited a recommendation by Mr. Gore to consolidate more than 30 existing education grant programs, a move that is expected to save $515 million from 1994 through 1999. He also said the Administration would propose savings on a Federal program that stockpiles helium.

HEADLINE: Health Cost Rises Are Less Steep

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Reflecting rising political and economic pressures, the growth in spending for health care will slow dramatically in 1994, large employers and insurers said yesterday.
Pressure from the Clinton Administration and employers is forcing an increasing number of health maintenance organizations to hold their rate rises to 4 percent or 5 percent. After experiencing double-digit rate gains over the last five years, some companies are even seeing rates climb below the 2.8 percent inflation rate. 
 Nationally, the 1994 H.M.O. premiums are increasing an average of 5.6 percent, down from 8.1 percent in 1993, the Group Health Association of America, an H.M.O. trade group, said yesterday. A dozen employers, insurers and H.M.O. executives reported similar increases in interviews.
The cost of traditional health insurance is rising about 7.5 percent, although many traditional health plans are still expecting increases in the high teens, following double-digit rises in recent years.
Both proponents and critics of President Clinton's health care program jumped on the latest numbers to argue their cases.
"One reason this is happening is because people see reform coming," Walter Zelman, a senior White House health policy adviser, said. "If the President abandoned health care reform, these trends would slow down measurably."
 
Clinton Would Set Ceiling
 Another reason, he said, is that more people are joining H.M.O.'s, whose costs typically rise at a slower rate than traditional coverage. The Group Health Association said 45 million people were enrolled in H.M.O.'s in 1993, a gain of 3.6 million from 1992.
Mr. Zelman said the cost trends would make it easier to meet the President's health care budget targets without invoking the budget ceilings, which are under attack by physician and hospital groups.
The President's plan would place a ceiling on increases in the cost of basic health coverage at 1.5 percent above the general inflation rate in 1997. The limit would be lowered over three years and held to the consumer price index in 2000, Mr. Zelman noted.
Critics of the Clinton proposals seized on the flattening of the spending trend to argue for delay. "The changes in prices in the private sector are changing the political dynamic," said Paul M. Ellwood, chairman of the Jackson Hole Group, which favors managed competition, a less regulated approach than the Administration's proposals.
"People may want to take more time to get the private sector completely changed around" before going ahead with a new Government program, he added.
In the most dramatic example of lower H.M.O. costs, the California state employees' health plan, Calpers, is demanding a 5 percent decrease in 1994, which would cut $80 million from the $1.6 billion that it spent to cover 980,000 employees, retirees and their families in 1993.
Tom Elkin, a Calpers executive, said the cut had been accepted by some California H.M.O.'s and that others had even offered not to increase premiums. The largest California H.M.O., Kaiser Permanente, has not responded yet, he said.
Dan Danzig, a spokesman for Kaiser, which covers seven million people across the country, said it was taking the Calpers request "very seriously." He said Kaiser's rate increases would average 4.1 percent nationally in 1994, down from 6.7 percent this year and 9.6 percent in 1992.
 
Xerox's Costs Down
 The Xerox Corporation said its most cost-efficient H.M.O.'s would have increases of 3.6 percent, down from 5.5 percent in 1993. The average increase for all Xerox employees in H.M.O.'s will be 5.3 percent, and for traditional coverage, 16.8 percent, a Xerox spokeswoman said.
But even smaller employers have been able to slow costs. Ron Dix, a vice president at Badger Meter Inc., based in Milwaukee, said costs for its 750 employees would decline by 5 percent this year. In 1994, he said, the company expects there will be no increases at its doctor and hospital networks, which are not part of an H.M.O.
And Thomas S. Kalbrener, benefits manager at the Waldorf Corporation, a paperboard maker based in St. Paul, said he hoped to hold increases to "the 2 to 3 percent range" in the fiscal year beginning next July.
Joe Maginnis, a vice president at Prudential Insurance, which provides health coverage for 14.5 million people, said its H.M.O. premiums would rise 6 to 7 percent in 1994. He said rates for physician-hospital networks, called "preferred providers," would rise by slightly under 10 percent, and for traditional coverage by 16 percent to 20 percent.
David Simon, a senior vice president at the U.S. Healthcare Corporation, an H.M.O. based in Blue Bell, Pa., with about 1.6 million enrolled, said, "We're looking at 4 to 6 percent increases." In New Jersey, where the company has a strong presence, the increase will be "less than 5 percent," he said.
The New York H.M.O. Council, a trade group, said increases in the state would average 5.7 percent, a sharp drop from 12 percent in 1993.

So, Let Your Cursor Do The Walking

BYLINE: By JOSHUA MILLS

 BODY:
An electronic yellow pages that will allow computer users to find all the shops in Brooklyn, Queens and Nassau County that repair cellular telephones, for example, or all the Mexican restaurants in the Bronx and Westchester County where dinner for two is less than $50 was announced yesterday by the Nynex Corporation and the Prodigy Services Company.
The service, expected to be available in the fourth quarter of next year, will combine in one vast listing all 300 volumes of classified ad pages from Nynex's service area of New York and New England. It will, for instance, enable banks to change interest rates in their ads daily, and it allows for the use of headline type, color and photos in the ads. 
 "The most important thing is the ability to use processing power to sort through the listings," said Gary Arlen, of Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md., an information services consultant.
Not so long ago, the prospect of electronic yellow pages would have sent shivers through the newspaper industry, which feared the loss of classified advertising. But in recent months, newspaper companies have announced alliances with local phone companies to put various services on line for computer users.
 
A New Area for Enterprise
 Local phone companies have only recently been freed to enter such non-telephone businesses, having been barred from doing so when the Bell System was broken up a decade ago.
Prodigy, which is owned by I.B.M. and by Sears, Roebuck & Company, has about two million subscribers nationwide, who pay fees to use the system. About 180,000 of them are in the Nynex area.
A computer user connects to Prodigy with a telephone modem. After entering the yellow pages, the customer can specify what topics are to be searched for; the resulting list can be printed or stored in the computer.
Prodigy and Nynex declined to put a dollar value on their alliance. Ross S. Glatzer, president and chief executive of Prodigy, said only that they were equal partners, but that in the early stages Nynex had made the bigger contribution.
And Kathy Ives, director of On-Line Services for Nynex, added: "We don't care what the platform is; we just want to get our product out there. Right now, there's no other advertising platform out there; Prodigy is the only advertiser-supported on-line service."
Initially, she said, Nynex would list all current yellow pages advertisers on its electronic service without charges, hoping to sell them display advertising in the future. She said ad rates had not yet been established.
Ms. Ives said Nynex would at first concentrate its marketing of the new service within its region, perhaps later expanding to nearby areas like New Jersey and Connecticut. She also said that Nynex would try to help Prodigy sign up more subscribers in the Nynex area.
 
Monopoly Question Raised
 Nancy Jones, a spokeswoman for the Newspaper Publishers Association, said the industry continued to fear that telephone companies' monopoly position over local phone service gave them a competitive advantage over other media.
She said her group would push for Federal legislation requiring phone companies that offer electronic services to create independent subsidiaries to prevent them from using their phone business to subsidize the electronic services and to assure all providers of information equal access to telephone networks.
Executives at Nynex and Prodigy said the alliance had been in the works for more than a year. Cox Newspapers and the BellSouth Corporation have already said they will jointly offer newspaper classified advertising and the yellow pages; Newsday and Nynex said they would electronically deliver local information like sports scores from Long Island high schools.
Mr. Glatzer said yesterday that he expected more such alliances, expressing the hope that Prodigy would become a national platform for yellow pages and classified ads. "We've mapped out several dozen papers we were interested in," he said, "and we've asked how long before the BellSouth-Cox relationship is replicated. I think we'll see a lot more papers, and telephone company-newspaper alliances, within 24 months."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Argentine Notes Draw Investors

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Far from Mexico -- where the North American Free Trade Agreement is rousing markets -- there was business being done yesterday that signals that many investors are already betting on what might be the next Mexico in Latin America.
On Wall Street, and in Europe and Asia, portfolio managers and institutional investors yesterday snapped up $1 billion of 10-year notes issued by the Republic of Argentina. 
 The notes were marked by several firsts, including the first global issue by a Latin American government as well as, apparently, the first global junk bond, or below investment grade issue, ever sold.
A global issue is one that is sold and can be traded in markets around the world at the same time. Before Argentina, the global market was the place for rock-solid credits like the World Bank.
Barbara L. Kenworthy, a portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation, knows the checkered financial history of Latin America. Still, she bought about $15 million of the Argentine bonds, a large purchase for her, and put them in three different Dreyfus funds.
She acknowledges that the bonds are risky and that she normally does not buy below-investment-grade securities. But, she said, "You can put a little bit of high risk in a portfolio, if fundamentals and momentum are in your favor."
The rush for the Argentine issue seems to reflect many of the trends that have pushed investors all year: the demand for higher yields has forced investors to buy bonds with higher credit risks and longer maturities.
Emerging markets have been one of the sweeter flavors of the year because they offer higher returns. And investors are looking in Latin America for the next Mexico, a below- investment-grade issue that has a chance to be raised to investment grade, which is what many analysts and portfolio manager are betting for Mexico.
The success of the Argentine issue also shows how much the view on Latin America has changed in such a short time. It was just over 10 years ago that Latin American countries began defaulting on their debt, causing a major international financial crisis.
And it is just since 1989 that a solution to this crisis began to unfold. In fact, Brazil, the largest debtor in the developing world, has yet to make final a deal on its debt with its bankers worldwide. And Brazil has yet to agree on an economic reform program with the International Monetary Fund.
Ms. Kenworthy of Dreyfus said the positive fundamentals for Argentina included the opening of its markets. Much of the momentum, she added, comes from the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has made more and more investors look favorably on Latin America.
She said the size of the issue would make it a "benchmark" and mean that it would be easy to trade. So a lot of managers getting into Latin America for the first time will think one simple way is to buy the Argentine bonds, in the same way that the Latin American telephone companies have been bought in the past. In addition, she said that she was expecting credit agencies to upgrade the rating on Argentina, which would increase its price.
James Quigley, managing director of the global debt syndicate at Merrill Lynch, the coordinating manager of the issue, said that the market had already priced the issue as if it were rated at the "strong" BB level. It is currently rated BB- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation and B1 by Moody's Investors Service.
The $1 billion in 10-year notes were priced to yield 8.47 percent, which was 280 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the yield on the 10-year Treasury note.
Mr. Quigley said that there were orders totaling between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion at the time of the pricing yesterday. He said that in the end underwriters in the syndicate had sold about $1.2 billion worth of notes to customers with only $1 billion available.
This short position helped increase the demand when the issue began to trade and is one of the reasons that it ended trading higher on the day, with the spread over the 10-year Treasury note narrowing to about 277 basis points.
Of the $1 billion in bonds, about $600 million were sold in North America, mostly in the United States, about $300 million in Europe and about $100 million in Asia.
 
Treasury Market
 Prices and yield in the Treasury market were little changed for the third day in a row yesterday, despite the release of relatively positive inflation data. The wait for today's release of the more important November Consumer Price Index could have restrained buying.
The price of the 30-year bond inched up 3/32 as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 6.15 percent, from 6.16 percent Wednesday. The price of the two-year note fell 2/32 as the yield rose to 4.17 percent from 4.13 percent.
The Labor Department reported yesterday that the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods in November was unchanged while the so-called core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, jumped an unexpected four-tenths of 1 percent.
But while the jump in the core rate unsettled the market a bit, Richard Berner, the chief economist for the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said that any near-term inflationary fears should be eased by the recent drop in oil and gasoline prices and the price restraint in the health care industry.

At Citibank, More No-Fee Credit Cards

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Citibank plans to drop annual fees on seven million credit card accounts in a bid to capture a larger share of the $200 billion industry, according to company filings with the Government.
In addition, Citibank will lower the minimum payments card holders are required to make each month and charge them higher penalties when these payments arrive late, under a plan outlined in a Form 8-K filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 Analysts said Citibank, the largest credit card issuer in the country, was taking the steps to retain present card holders, attract new ones and increase the number of charges customers make.
The bank is betting that the increased spending that accompanies the recovering economy, along with efforts to lower credit losses and fraud, will offset the decrease in annual fees, they said.
James Bailey, executive vice president of North American consumer banking for Citicorp, the parent of Citibank, said: "When you have the economy improving and lower funding costs and lower fraud losses, you have an opportunity to increase your market share by being more aggressive. This is us going on the offensive."
 
A Trend Toward No Fees
 The plan also represents a change in direction for Citibank, which is one of the last large credit card issuers to still charge annual fees. Citibank's decision to eliminate the charge for roughly half of its 20 million credit card accounts -- 4 million have already received this benefit -- may signal that annual fees have become obsolete.
"This will accelerate a trend that is has already been in place: the phasing out of annual fees on bank credit cards," said Robert McKinley, president of the RAM Research Corporation, which tracks the bank card industry.
But changing the credit card operations carries a risk for Citibank because the business has been one of its steadiest sources of revenue. The annual fees alone generated revenue of about $500 million each year, Mr. McKinley said. A Citibank spokeswoman declined to confirm the figures.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Broadly, But Eases Against the Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar edged higher against most European currencies but slipped against the Japanese yen in quiet trading yesterday following the release of flat November producer prices.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose slightly to 1.7055 German marks, from 1.7052 marks on Wednesday. But it slipped to 108.66 yen from 108.95 yen. 
 Meanwhile, gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery, the most actively traded futures contract, dropped $1.30, to $384.40 an ounce.
A slightly bigger-than-expected increase in the core Producer Price Index failed to lift the dollar. Over all, producer prices were unchanged in November from the previous month, but the core rate, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, rose four-tenths of 1 percent.
 "There is not a lot of interest in the P.P.I.," said Andrew Larkin, foreign exchange trader at Postipankki Bank. "If anything is to stir this market, it will be the Consumer Price Index tomorrow."
 Higher American interest rates would make dollar-based assets relatively more attractive than foreign investments, encouraging dollar purchases. With evidence pointing to strong United States growth in the fourth quarter, many are wondering if the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates early next year to quell inflationary pressure.
 "The question is whether or not the Fed will tighten," said a United States bank dealer in London. "Consumer inflation will be more closely watched in that regard."
 Dealers were also watching continuing world trade talks as international negotiators worked furiously to conclude the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before the Dec. 15 deadline.
 Any trade friction tends to roil the foreign exchange market, but dealers said listless year-end trading could limit any reaction to GATT developments.
 "The market is totally lethargic," said Al Soria, foreign exchange manager at Kansallis Osaki Pankki. "People are waiting for GATT to pass, but even that won't move the market much.".
 The British pound closed in New York at $1.4935, down up from $1.4970 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates, compared with Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.4660 Swiss francs, down from 1.4665; 5.8465 French francs, up from 5.8395; 1,668 Italian lire, up from 1,666, and $1.3287 (Canadian), up from $1.3231 (Canadian).

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Yankees Deal Owen To Angels

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

 BODY:
The Yankees took a step toward trimming their payroll yesterday when they traded their overvalued shortstop, Spike Owen, to the California Angels for a minor league relief pitcher. But it was only a small step in this arduous economic process because they also agreed to absorb an undisclosed amount of Owen's contract as a condition of the trade.
Conceding that they made a mammoth blunder when they signed him to a three-year, $7 million free agent contract last December, the Yankees will now pay a portion of the $4.25 million Owen will receive over the next two years to dismiss him and save some important cash. It is doubtful the Angels would have made the deal unless the Yankees assumed at least $2 million of Owen's contract. 
 Unloading part of Owen's hefty salary increases General Manager Gene Michael's flexibility as he continues pursuing a starter or an outfielder to bolster the Yankees. Michael said Wednesday that he must first dispose of a few contracts before he can get involved in chasing free agents or trading for high-priced players because he has been instructed to remain near a $45 million budget.
 
A Minor Dent in Budget
 Owen is scheduled to make $1 million in 1994 and $3.25 million in 1995 so his departure makes a minor dent in a budget that is already projected at about $40 million.
"If we can move two or three contracts," Michael has said, "I think it would be possible a lot of things could happen."
Owen lost his starting spot to Mike Gallego after the All-Star Game and became the highest-paid cheerleader in the Bronx, so it was pretty surprising that Michael found a new home for him. If the Yankees do not make another transaction involving an infielder, Gallego and Randy Velarde would be the likely candidates to start at shortstop. Both had career years in utility roles as Gallego hit .283 with 54 runs batted in and Velarde hit .301.
But Michael curiously mentioned Class AAA shortstop Dave Silvestri in the statement issued yesterday about the trade that brought Class AA pitcher Jose Musset to New York. It was curious because the 26-year old Silvestri was deemed so unimportant in September that the Yankees did not even recall him when their rosters expanded to 40 players.
"Spike Owen was a true professional and did a nice job for us last season," Michael said in the statement. "Moving him gives us a chance to move along some of our young players, and Dave Silvestri is one of the young players who should be given the opportunity now."
 
Could Velarde Go Next?
 Whether Michael was intimating that Silvestri should be given an opportunity to start is uncertain, and the general manager did not return a telephone message left last night. Silvestri, who batted .269 with 20 homers and 65 runs batted in for Columbus, has played 14 major league games and is considered a defensive liability. If Michael is serious about Silvestri challenging for the shortstop slot, Velarde could be traded next.
Owen, who is 32 and an 11-year veteran, began his Yankee career in promising fashion by hitting .419 in his first 12 games, but his production on offense and defense plummeted after that. His range was suspect, and his penchant for sliding to his knees to field grounders mystified observers. It grew more and more obvious that the Yankees needed a change, and Gallego and Velarde handled shortstop most of the second half as Owen made nine starts in the final two months.
For the season, he batted .234 with 2 homers, 20 r.b.i. and 14 errors in 96 games.
The 25-year-old Musset is a career minor leaguer who was 2-6 with a 5.49 earned run average and 21 saves in 59 games for Class AA Midland of the Texas League last season. In four seasons, the right-hander was 13-16 with a 4.43 e.r.a. and 29 saves in 124 games.

The Economy
Consumer prices rose a modest two-tenths of a percent in November, restrained by declines in the cost of energy. The small November rise matched the average for the two preceding months and was seen as further evidence that inflation remains in check while the economy picks up momentum. [Page 39.]
President Clinton and the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, Lane Kirkland, agreed to end their bitter public debate over Nafta and will work together on health care changes. But the union said state and local chapters could still decide to punish supporters of the trade pact in the 1994 elections. [1.]
The Fed assailed the Treasury's proposed overhaul of the Community Reinvestment Act, saying it could lead to Government influence over loans and unsound lending practices. [39.]
 
Companies
Green Point Savings depositors voted to convert the mutual savings bank to public ownership through a $700 million stock offering. But state regulators must rule on the change and will hold hearings to determine if regulations were followed. [39.]
Nynex plans to reduce expenses sharply in its core local telephone business. But the Baby Bell refused to confirm reports that it planned to cut about 22,000 jobs over three years. [39.]
Paramount's board will meet Monday to plan an auction for the company after the Delaware Supreme Court ruled that it must consider acquisition bids other than Viacom's. [41.]
American companies should be allowed to export advanced fiber optic communications equipment to the former Soviet Union and to China, the Commerce Department recommended. [41.]
Canadian bank executives are paid far less than their U.S. counterparts, data released under new disclosure rules show. [41.]
Prudential Insurance's financial strength rating could be lowered because of the scandal in its securities unit. [50.]
 
International
American lawmakers, executives and lobbyists are pouring into Geneva hoping to influence the world trade talks. Their fervor may be a signal that any GATT agreement will face the same intensity of feeling in Congress that greeted Nafta. [39.]
European Community leaders backed a plan to create jobs by cutting labor costs and employer contributions to welfare programs. More than 5 million European jobs have been lost since 1990 and the unemployment rate is 11.3 percent. [5.]
The Japanese economy is still deteriorating and may not recover for a year or more from its two-year-old recession, a survey of the country's business executives showed. The executives indicated they planned to cut staff and spending. [40.]
 
Markets
Blue-chip stocks rose to new records while broader averages continued to slide. The Dow industrials rose 10.89, to 3,740.67. [40.]
Interest rates rose despite a Government report that consumer inflation remained subdued last month. [48.]
Oil prices rebounded on technical factors, weather-related supply problems and producers' optimism on prices. [49.]
The dollar weakened against the German mark but gained against the Japanese yen. Gold prices rose. [49.]
 
Your Money
The urge to donate to charities rises during the holidays, but donors should scrutinize how groups parcel out their money. [36.]
Following a selling strategy can help investors maximize their returns when they want to liquidate stock holdings. [36.]
Keeping several retirement accounts at one bank is not wise because of new limits in Federal deposit insurance. [36.]
A special kind of trust for children with mental and physical disabilities can protect their inheritance and benefits. [37.]

HEADLINE: European Community Backs Plan To Create Jobs by Reducing Costs

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Facing an unemployment crisis that is the main concern of their electorates, European Community leaders gave broad backing today to a plan to create jobs by cutting labor costs. But Britain and Germany balked at proposals that the community borrow billions of dollars to start major public works projects.
While the 12 leaders debated formulas to create $15 million in new jobs by the year 2000, negotiators in Geneva struggled to put the final touches to what many officials regard as the best long-term solution to the disappearance of European jobs -- a world trade agreement that is expected to stimulate business worldwide. 
 But Foreign Minister Alain Juppe of France said sharp differences remained with the United States over the Clinton Administration's demand that the subsidizing of the French movie industry through a box office levy on tickets be eliminated.
"We would not like to see the world trade talks fail because the Hollywood lobby turns out to be stronger than the French farmers lobby," Mr. Juppe said, alluding to the fact that an agricultural agreement has already been reached between the United States and Europe but the movie issue remains contentious.
 
'Hollywood Domination' Faulted
 "We cannot accept that Hollywood's domination of this industry became a total monopoly," Mr. Juppe added. "We will not budge from our system of support for our industry, and, if necessary, the audio visual sector will have to be excluded from any GATT agreement."
Peter Guildford, a trade spokesman for the European Commission, said no European decision on a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was now expected before a special foreign ministers meeting here on Monday.
The absence of a trade agreement has long worsened Europe's unemployment problem. With over five million jobs lost since 1990 as the continent's recession has persisted, and 11.3 percent of the work force now unemployed, political debate in Europe this year has centered on whether the answer lies in scaling back the welfare state to make job creation cheaper or increasing public spending.
 
Two-Pronged Plan Offered
 A 184-page plan put forward this week by Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission, proposed a combination of both: lowering minimum wages and cutting the nonwage labor costs that finance Europe's comprehensive social welfare programs, while at the same time devoting $22 billion a year of community money to huge projects for roads, railways, energy and telecommunications.
Community officials said there was broad agreement that labor costs and rigidities must be reduced if Europe is to match the United States' ability to create jobs with growth -- an indication that Europe wants to borrow some elements from the American social model even as President Clinton looks to Europe for his health care plan.
With tax and social security payments adding an average of 40 percent to labor costs in Europe, compared with 30 percent in the United States, European employers have shown increasing reluctance to hire and have brought the welfare state to a point of unparalleled crisis.
But if there was general agreement that the welfare state has become too burdensome, there was sharp disagreement over proposals to use public spending to spur job creation. President Francois Mitterrand of France strongly backed the proposed public works program, calling for precise dates to be set for the projects "to give a signal of hope to our citizens."
 
Major Attacks Borrowing
 He was countered by Prime Minister John Major of Britain, who led a virulent attack on the proposed financing of the projects.
"It would be absurd for the European Commission to increase its borrowing when member states are taking severe action to reduce theirs," Mr. Major told the other leaders, referring to a proposal that the commission borrow about $9 billion a year through bond issues to finance new projects like a proposed high-speed train betweenLyons, France, and Turin, Italy, or a Berlin-Warsaw motorway.
Kenneth Clarke, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, was more outspoken in his criticism of the commission's proposal to borrow and spend, saying, "It's just nonsense to think you can wave a magic wand and produce 15 million new jobs by pouring in new money from some new borrowing facility."
Britain's position was backed by Finance Minister Theo Waigel of Germany. Both countries argued that the proposed borrowing could be inflationary and that investments should be led by the private sector.

HEADLINE: U.S. Politicians Turn Into Lobbyists Over GATT

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Congressional leaders, executives, lobbyists and environmentalists who fought for or against the North American Free Trade Agreement have been streaming here to fight shoulder to shoulder against proposed provisions of a new global trade agreement.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who wants to retain American limits on low-cost imports, and Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, the West Virginia Democrat concerned about limits on medical research subsidies, came last week. 
 The House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, arrived on Thursday. And Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee, also landed here Thursday, in an Air Force jet full of committee members and their aides; Mr. Rostenkowski wants to retain United States penalties on countries that restrict American exports.
 
Trying to Avoid Division
 The Clinton Administration is listening to the complaints about the proposals being negotiated under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade because it does not want Congressional consideration next year of a global pact to become a political brawl like last month's vote on the North American pact.
The deadline for the talks is Wednesday, and issues still to be settled include greater access for American movies in Europe, international banking, and rule changes that will determine whether existing American trade laws are gutted or retained.
"It is clear that there is enormous Congressional concern in several areas, particularly anti-dumping, financial services, aircraft and audio-visual," a senior Administration trade official said this morning after meeting with members of Congress on Thursday; the official insisted on anonymity.
The Administration is trying especially hard to make changes in the pact so as to preserve American trade laws. The laws are used to impose steep tariffs on foreign goods that are sold in the United States below cost or for less than in other markets, a practice known as dumping. The dumping law is popular in Congress, but widely disliked overseas, so the Administration has an uphill fight to get its changes.
"It is the issue where feelings run the deepest in Congress," said Jeffrey Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. But he acknowledged that other countries opposed the changes. "Most of the delegations are solidly arrayed against us on most of these issues, but from our standpoint, this is a central part of the proposal."
Mr. Gephardt said in an interview tonight that the global pact's prospects in Congress would depend on deals made here. "It will be contentious, but I think if the negotiators are able to do some things in the last hours of the negotiations, things like anti-dumping, 301, aircraft and audio-visual, then I think it can pass the Congress," he said.
He was referring to Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which allows the United States to retaliate unilaterally against foreign countries that restrict American exports.
 
Traveling Far

 
 While some American politicians are seeking broad changes in the proposed pact, others have more parochial concerns, and are willing to come a long way to express them.
Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming, arrived here late Monday night from his ranch in Big Horn, Wyo., for one day of lobbying with American and European Community officials. He sought lowered European taxes on soda ash, which is used to make glass and detergents and is the basis of Wyoming's biggest export industry. The European Community imposes a 10 percent tariff on soda ash, but it promised American negotiators this week that the tariff would be cut to 5.5 percent.
That was still too steep for Mr. Wallop, who feared that his trip had had little effect. "I haven't noticed one yet, in all honesty," he said.
Senator Wallop, who has backed free-trade pacts in the past, said he was likely to vote for this one, but he then asked to take back the remark. "I'd rather not have the Europeans knowing that," he said. "I'd rather say that I don't know how I'll vote."
 
Broad-Based Opposition

 
 Labor and consumer groups that opposed the North American pact are also hostile to the 116-nation GATT deal. And five of the six big environmental groups that supported the North American pact announced last week that they wanted many changes in the global accord.
The Administration is pursuing only some of the changes now sought by various groups and is unlikely to prevail on all of them.
The goal is an agreement that will reduce average worldwide tariffs on manufactured goods by one-third and that will for the first time apply the free-trade rules of GATT to agriculture and services like insurance and tourism. The Clinton Administration supports all of these goals.
But Asian nations have been demanding changes in provisions of American trade laws that have been used to impose steep tariffs on their goods, and those demands have alarmed American companies that benefit from these laws.
A remarkably broad range of American manufacturers and service providers like insurance companies and banks are opposing the pact, saying it will help foreign countries more than the United States.
The result has been some odd political and commercial alliances. Mr. Gephardt, who fought the North American pact, and Senator Bob Dole, the Kansas Republican who supported it, last week organized a coalition of 11 American business leaders who share their hostility to rewriting American trade laws.
The group objects to the draft text's changes in Federal laws that now allow American companies to seek steep Commerce Department tariffs on imported goods made with foreign government subsidies or sold in the United States below cost or for less than in their home markets.
The coalition includes Curtis H. Barnette, chairman and chief executive of Bethlehem Steel; George M. C. Fisher, chairman and chief executive of Eastman Kodak; Andrew S. Grove, chief executive of Intel, and Jerry K. Pearlman, chairman of Zenith Electronics.
Mr. Gephardt has also seldom found himself on the same side of a trade issue as Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri. But Mr. Danforth is worried about how the pact will affect the heavily Republican grain farmers in Missouri. For his part, Mr. Gephardt, representing a blue-collar district in St. Louis, is worried that farm issues have already consumed too much time and that protections for factories may have been lost through inattention.
"Up until now, we've spent so much time for agriculture that we've left for last a lot of other things we're interested in," Mr. Gephardt said.
 
Environment Becomes Issue

 
 Environmental opposition to the pact could prove particularly important. The Clinton Administration won endorsements for the North American pact from the six big environmental groups after negotiating a side agreement with Mexico and Canada that will set up a special commission to investigate environmental abuses throughout the continent.
But duplicating that feat may prove difficult for the world trade pact. Five of the same six environmental groups sent a letter last week to Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, asking for extensive changes in the agreement.
Environmental groups want GATT to require for the first time that countries produce goods in environmentally sound ways, so as to eliminate current incentives for countries to produce goods in whatever country has the most lax environmental enforcement. But economic research has suggested that environmental regulations seldom determine where a company builds factories, and the Clinton Administration has not tried to inject this issue into the trade talks.
Not even Mr. Kantor is trying to organize an environmental side agreement among 116 nations. In an interview the day after the House approved the North American pact last month, he said that environmental and labor issues would have to wait for the next international round of trade talks, which conclude, on average, once a decade.

HEADLINE: NEEDIEST CASES;
Man's Job Is Gone, Not Self-Respect

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Felix B. first started working at the age of 9, delivering prescriptions after school for a corner druggist in Brooklyn Heights to help support his sister and his mother.
In fact, for most of his life, there was hardly ever a time when he was not holding either a part-time or full-time job. He put himself through two years of business courses at the Fashion Institute of Technology by working as an office assistant. 
 For 10 years, he worked as a major-domo, or what he calls "a glorified housekeeper," for up to a dozen clients at a time. He cleaned their houses, did their tailoring, ran their errands and helped them manage their busy personal lives, a job perfectly in keeping with his punctilious nature. "My friends called me Felix Unger," he said, smiling.
When that work dried up in the early 1990's, Felix B. found a job with a company that created fabric sample books. It took him back to his love of fashion, first instilled in him by his mother's work as a seamstress. "It was a job that I truly loved," he said, "and one I hoped to stay at the rest of my life."
 
'The Work Was Drying Up'
 But one of Felix's tasks was to review weekly payroll checks.
"I realized after a while that I was seeing fewer and fewer checks and I knew that the work was drying up," he said. "Our business was completely dependent on the shirts and textiles companies. When they started to go out of business, so did we."
Felix, 48, has now been out of work for more than a year and has been living on public assistance since last Christmas. He has kept his apartment in Borough Park, Brooklyn, only by working as an unofficial superintendent in exchange for a freeze on rent increases.
One thing that buoys his spirits is his unpaid work as a computer operator at Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens. The position was arranged through the Work Experience Program, in which welfare recipients work off their grants by helping at city offices or charities. In turn, Catholic Charities has helped Felix with minor expenses and with his job search by printing his resume and buying him new shoes and clothes.
Catholic Charities is one of seven social-service agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which is conducting its 82d appeal through Feb. 28. The Times pays for all of the campaign's expenses so that all the money raised goes to the charities to help them provide direct services for unemployed, poor and disabled New Yorkers.
For Felix, the job at Catholic Charities does more for his peace of mind than for his financial situation. The charity has not been able to hire him because its resources are stretched thin. As he mails out resumes in search of part-time or full-time work, he is in a race to beat his bills.
Despite his frustrations, Felix said that he will not feel defeated by his circumstances unless he loses his sense of self-respect. "There's a certain way you conduct yourself no matter how poor you are," he said. "It's going to take a lot for them to take that away from me."

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Up Modestly

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Restrained by declines in the cost of energy, consumer prices rose a modest two-tenths of a percent in November, matching the average for the two preceding months, the Labor Department reported today.
Analysts regarded the data, which were about as expected, as further evidence that inflation remains in check, though not nonexistent, even as the economy picks up speed. 
 The consumer inflation rate for the last 12 months stood at 2.7 percent in November. On Thursday, the Government reported that prices paid to American producers, a narrower gauge than consumer prices, were unchanged last month.
 
Consumers More Confident
 In a separate report today showing that consumers are growing increasingly confident about the economy, the widely followed University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment jumped 6.5 points in early December, to 87.7, according to subscribers to the survey.
This was the highest reading since January and it incorporated a 6.6-point jump in expectations about the future, one component of the Government's economic forecasting gauge. The results unnerved the bond market, pushing up interest rates, by indicating that consumers would continue to increase their spending, possibly moving inflation higher.
The inflation figures showed prices rising more slowly last month than in October in six of the seven main categories, apparel being the exception.
The so-called core, or underlying, rate of inflation -- excluding food and energy -- was performing only slightly less well than prices over all. It rose three-tenths of a percent last month, the same as in October, and now stands 3.1 percent above its level of November 1992.
 
 
 
Down 0.1% in New York
 In the New York metropolitan area, prices edged down a tenth of a percent to push inflation for the last 12 months down to 2.1 percent.
John E. Silvia, an economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, called the results released today "pretty darn good." But he took issue with those who seem to have concluded that inflation has been thoroughly, and more or less permanently, suppressed.
"Inflation's not zero -- it's 3 percent," he said, adding that this includes significant benefit from half a year of falling oil prices.
Food prices, still seemingly affected by the summer's floods and drought, climbed four-tenths of a percent last month as fresh vegetables, up 5.3 percent, took over from fresh fruits as a main source of upward pressure. Beef prices, which had been steady since April, climbed six-tenths of a percent.
Expenses for housing, which accounts for 41 percent of the Consumer Price Index, rose a scant one-tenth of a percent last month, a slight slowdown from the preceding two months, reflecting declines in the cost of natural gas, electricity and fuel oil. The cost of maintenance and repairs fell 2.2 percent, the report also showed.
 
 
 
Drop in Gas Price
 The transportation sector, where prices rose two-tenths of a percent, benefited from a 1.8 percent drop in gasoline and no change in new cars after a rise in October. But automobile finance charges rose for only the second time in 33 months. Used cars rose again to reach a level 8.3 percent higher than a year earlier, and airline fares spurted 4.1 percent.
Apparel rose four-tenths of a percent in November, but the fact that prices have averaged a small decline over three months indicated that merchants were still unable to raise prices and, in fact, are being forced to offer discounts to move merchandise.
Medical care rose a modest two-tenths of a percent, bringing the three-month compound annual rate down to 4.8 percent and the 12-month rate down to 5.5 percent. For the year that ended in November 1992, medical inflation was 6.9 percent.
Inflation was moderate in the categories of entertainment and other goods, with the former marked by 1.6 percent higher fees for participant sports.
 
 
 
Higher Average Earnings
 When the Consumer Price Index is divided into just two categories, commodities rose two-tenths of a percent, down substantially from October, while services rose three-tenths of a percent for the second straight month.
In a related report, the Labor Department calculated that real average weekly earnings moved up three-tenths of a percent in November but were unchanged over 12 months.

HEADLINE: Italy's Communists Come In From the Cold

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Their name has changed, their ideology has died and no one is talking class struggle anymore. But after decades of waiting for power, Italy's onetime Communists seem finally to reckon their moment has come -- too late to storm the barricades but, maybe, just in time to benefit from a different revolution.
Through the years of the cold war, Italy's Communist Party -- the largest in Western Europe -- was kept out of national office by an alliance of centrist parties who helped themselves to vast and illicit patronage from the state coffers. 
 Now, those same centrist parties -- the Christian Democrats, the Socialists and their allies to the left and right -- are in disgrace because of their involvement in Italy's vast corruption scandals and kickback schemes.
Even Achille Ochetto, leader of the Democratic Party of the Left, as the former Communists are now known, was questioned today by Milan magistrates investigating the corruption scandal. While he has admitted that his followers may have made "possible errors of judgment" in the country's huge graft, investigators have yet to bring any major charges of corruption on the ex-Communists.
The lack until now of formal charges against the former Communists in the nearly two-year-old corruption scandal helped them at the polls in last weekend's municipal elections in which they scored a major success. And as a result of their victory in those elections, the ex-Communists have emerged as the favorites in the national elections expected next spring.
Renamed and reconstituted, however, the Communists who swept into city halls across Italy last weekend are not the Communists of old. That much was evident on Monday night when Mr. Occhetto announced that the party's priorities in any national government would be to continue economic austerity, pursue plans to sell off state industries to private buyers and thus cut back the huge public debt -- platform planks that hardly smack of spendthrift socialism.
"From the political point of view, very little remains from the old days," said Salvatore Veca, a left-wing author and professor of political philosophy at the University of Florence. "There's a complete acceptance of the role of the market. In the United States, the position would be typically liberal."
In the elections last weekend, the former Communists and their allies won the mayoral contests in five big cities as well as in a slew of other municipalities, defeating both neo-Fascists and the federalist Northern League. Moreover, the Christian Democrats and their allies, virtually obliterated by the corruption scandal, were barely to be seen.
The dominance of the former Communists in the election last weekend was only the latest stage of a long process of change that began more than 20 years ago and culminated in 1991 when, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Communist Party of Italy changed its name to the Democratic Party of the Left.
"The change of name came at the end of a long process of self-analysis," said Prof. Gianni Vattimo of the University of Turin. "What it did was to distance the party from Marxism."
"The ideology has all disappeared," said Pietro Folena, a former Communist legislator in Sicily.
 
No Turning Back
 What that means for the former Communists is that there is no turning back to the class struggles of the past, particularly when the future is dictated by free market economics, not ideological division. "This is a party of order and efficiency, not radical transformation," Professor Vattimo said.
The view is not universal. For many Italians, the renamed party still represents a hazardous leap into the unknowns of left-wing politics.
"I, like many others, am afraid of the left," said Alessandra Mussolini, a candidate of the neo-Fascist Italian Social Movement who lost to a former Communist candidate last weekend in the race for the mayorship of Naples.
As evidence of such fears, right-wing politicians point to the strong showing of Ms. Mussolini's neo-Fascist party in Rome and Naples and the stranglehold of the conservative Northern League in parts of northern Italy.
While the former Communists emerged as victors, they did not win alone, securing their dominance only by forging alliances with other parties, notably Greens and in some cases hard-line ex-Communists and, in Trieste, even Christian Democrats.
It is partly to keep the so-called progressive alliance intact until national elections, that the former Communists are laying so much stress on their re-packaging as a responsible and credible candidate for government.
When, during the two-stage mayoral vote, financial markets took a dive on news of former Communist successes, Mr. Occhetto went out of his way to try to calm them. And, when the extent of the former Communist victory emerged this week, the markets responded in kind: the lira firmed and stocks rose.
The problem, though, is how far the former Communists can go without alienating its supporters with such policies as privatization, which automatically cost jobs. It is questionable, too, whether the progressive alliance will maintain support at its current level if a credible, conservative alternative emerges between now and next spring.
 
The Fringe of Power
 Italy's politics have always seemed to upend European stereotypes. While the Communists have not been part of a national government since the immediate postwar years, they ran some cities and labor unions and exerted powerful influence behind the scenes.
Defeated by the Christian Democrats in parliamentary elections in 1948, in which the United States played a behind-the-scenes role, the Communists were the main opposition party for the next 15 years. In the mid-1970's, they won over one third of the votes in national elections, running a close second to the Christian Democrats, and supported a minority government through their abstention on parliamentary votes in exchange for a voice in policy matters.
And, while the Christian Democrats ruled as a conservative force, their extensive spending on social programs and their penchant for state control of large sectors of the economy seemed more to resemble policies traditionally associated with the left.
Thus, if they do come to national power, the former Communists will inherit a topsy-turvy economy saddled with Europe's biggest debt and burdened by a kind of domestic protectionism that shielded private business from harsh competition. And it will fall to former Communists to privatize state enterprises, which provided the source of patronage for their conservative adversaries.
"In a sense, on the one hand we want a free market for the first time, while on the other hand we certainly have social concerns," said Gian Giacomo Migone, a senior legislator from the Democratic Party of the Left.
"What we have in mind is a government in this transitional period that does several things -- balance the budget, defend the lira and set in motion the economy to create more jobs," he said. "Of course, we would not do this like Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan."

HEADLINE: Zagreb Journal;
Feminist Gadfly Unappreciated in Her Own Land

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia

 BODY:
The ornate turn-of-the-century Gradska Kavana on the central square here is one of those cafes that define the style of Central Europe. The lives of nations, and sometimes their fates, are played out at such places, and the relationships between regular patrons are dense and multi-layered.
Like many Croatian intellectuals, Slavenka Drakulic considers the Gradska Kavana a second home, and on a recent morning she made her way to an outdoor table with the confidence of a regular patron. She noticed an old acquaintance, a man she has known since she was a teen-ager, and acknowledged him with a smile and a wave. 
 The man ostentatiously turned his back, letting Miss Drakulic know that he is among those who consider her a virtual traitor to her homeland.
One cannot imagine a self-possessed figure like Miss Drakulic losing her poise, and the rebuff had no visible effect on her.
 
'I'm Not Popular'
 "I'm more popular outside Croatia," she said with a shrug after ordering a Coca-Cola. "I'm known here, but I'm not popular. We are living through a moment when if you're attacked in the press, people don't want to talk to you."
A founder of Croatian feminism, Miss Drakulic, 44, has become something of a literary and political sensation beyond the Balkans. Two collections of her essays have been widely translated and are selling briskly in many countries, including the United States. She has become a favorite guest on television and radio talk shows, reaching a level of international celebrity beyond what anyone here could have imagined a few years ago. Her writings and public appearances have made her perhaps the world's best-known Croat after President Franjo Tudjman.
The contrast between the two could not be greater. Mr. Tudjman is a dour, patriarchal nationalist who is uncomfortable outside his Balkan habitat. Miss Drakulic is vivacious, outspoken, freewheeling, cosmopolitan and fiercely individualist.
These qualities are not much appreciated in Croatia. A Zagreb newspaper columnist has asserted that Miss Drakulic is a "cheap and defective" writer who took up feminism as a way to "rape Croatia." Another scorned her anti-nationalist views and asked, "How can you call anyone a moral writer who, at a time when her people are suffering the most terrible tragedies, cannot identify with their interests either emotionally or intellectually?"
 
Denies Being a Subversive
 Partly to escape what she considers a psychologically oppressive environment, Miss Drakulic now spends only part of her time in Zagreb. But she denies being a subversive.
"I don't like to be pushed into the category of 'dissident,' because I don't think I am one," she said. "I am only reacting against a society that does not value the individual. People here have the feeling, inherited from Communism, that you should go along with everyone else, not stick out, do and say what everybody else does and says. They can't stand that someone is different, because being different or beating the system shows that the system can be beaten. I say and do what I want, and that is incredibly annoying to people here."
She continued: "Because I criticize official policies, and because I'm a feminist, people here say I'm a traitor, which is ridiculous. This Government considers people who write or speak against the Government to be anti-Croatian. This is a terrible manipulation, just like in Communist times.
"This Government is very much like a one-party system. If you want to have an important position in society, in schools, universities, social services, the economy, you have to be in the ruling party."
In 1979 Miss Drakulic and a handful of other female journalists and intellectuals founded Yugoslavia's first feminist group. She traveled to other Communist countries seeking, not always successfully, to find women who shared her frustrations and ambitions. She gradually made contact with Western editors, and her articles about the plight of women in Eastern Europe began appearing in the United States and England.
In this period she also wrote two novels, one of them based on her struggle with illness, in which she spent six years on dialysis and received a kidney transplant in 1986.
 
Feminist Critique of Marxism
 As Communism began to collapse in the late 1980's, Miss Drakulic's popularity abroad began to grow. She collected a series of her essays into a book called "How We Survived Communism and Even Laughed," and quickly emerged as the first critic to describe the failings of Marxism from a feminist perspective. She wrote with insight and wit about such outrages as ugly clothing and shortages of toilet paper.
That book and a more recent one, "The Balkan Express," about her reaction to the Yugoslav wars, were written in English, and neither has been translated into Serbo-Croatian.
In one essay, Ms. Drakulic writes: "Just how many 'iron curtains' still exist? What are they made of? Sometimes it seems to me they are made of a material stronger than iron itself: our memories."
Some of Miss Drakulic's friends in Zagreb say they detect something banal and even fraudulent in her writings, pointing out that there never were shortages of toilet paper in the former Yugoslavia, and that her laments about crowded streetcars and tiny apartments are hardly original.
 
'Everyone Envious of Her'
 But reflecting the grudging admiration for Miss Drakulic here, a journalist who worked closely with her but did not want to be identified said: "She always had the courage to say what she thinks. She is a very strong person, and she can fight with anyone. She has a great drive for success. Everyone here is envious of her."
Neither criticism from pro-Government ideologues or the skepticism of like-minded intellectuals has slowed Miss Drakulic. She has a contract to produce a television series for the BBC, and is hoping to produce others for American and Canadian networks. An Austrian foundation has given her a grant to research the lives of children of Communist leaders.
Miss Drakulic has not abandoned fiction, and is completing a novel that she describes as "a love story that ends with cannibalism."
"It's set in New York," she confided as she finished her Coke. "New York is the perfect place for a story about cannibalism."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Mark Trading But Gains Against the Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar weakened against the German mark yesterday but gained ground against the Japanese yen after a small increase in consumer prices in November tempered inflation fears.
"The dollar came down after the data was released because the market may have baked in a somewhat higher number," said Richard Koss, director of foreign exchange sales for the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. 
 Consumer prices edged up two-tenths of 1 percent last month as a modest rise in food and beverage prices was offset by a steep fall in energy costs, the Labor Department reported.
The consumer price data, along with Thursday's report showing producer prices unchanged in November, kept inflation fears on the back-burner.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.6960 marks, from 1.7055 marks on Thursday.
The dollar's slide was halted by technical support at 1.69 marks and by the report that consumer confidence as measured by the University of Michigan jumped to 87.7 for December from 81.2 in November.
"The market is still biased toward an up move in the dollar because it's optimistic about growth prospects in the U.S. versus European economies," Mr. Koss said. "But it's unable to move up because many people are already long and it's the year-end."
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery, the most actively traded futures contract, gained 50 cents, to $384.90 an ounce. The Republic National Bank quoted spot gold at $383 an ounce, up $1.
Currency dealers continued to watch world trade talks as international negotiators worked to conclude the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before the Dec. 15 deadline, when President Clinton's fast-track negotiating authority from Congress runs out.
The dollar rose to 109.20 yen in New York, from 108.66 yen on Thursday, as several factors weighed on the Japanese currency. The quarterly tankan report on Japanese business conditions, released yesterday, suggested a poor economic outlook, as expected.
Moreover, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's difficulties in the wake of political wrangling over the volatile rice import issue were eroding confidence in Japan's Government.

HEADLINE: Blue-Chip Issues Gain As Other Averages Fall

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The stock market turned in another good news, bad news performance yesterday, as blue-chip issues rose to new records, while broader averages continued to slide.
An unexpected jump in the University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment about the economy in early December, to its highest level since January, was noted by analysts and traders as the most important event of the session. 
 The news was yet another sign of continued strength in the economy, and it tended to lift stocks closely tied to turns in the economic cycle, a group that includes many of the issues in the Dow Jones industrial average.
But the report created worry in the bond market that a stronger economy and possible higher inflation might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. Bond prices slumped and interest rates rose.
"There is concern about inflation," said Thomas Gallagher, chief trader at Oppenheimer & Company, even though reports issued yesterday and Thursday showed that through November price increases remained benign.
"But I don't think we will see any big negative reaction," in the stock market, he added. "Even though the market is acting sloppy, right now people are sitting, wishing this was the end of the year, and hoping nothing happens."
 
A Late Blue-Chip Rally
 Much of the spurt in blue-chip issues took place in the last half-hour of trading.
At the close, the Dow was up 10.89 points, to 3,740.67, surpassing the previous record 3,734.53 set on Wednesday. On Thursday, the Dow closed at 3,729.78. Volume on the Big Board slowed to 245.6 million shares, from 287.6 million on Thursday.
But the broader averages moved lower.
The S.& P. 500 index dipped a quarter of a point, to 463.93; the American Stock Exchange composite index lost 1.03 points, to 466.28, and the Nasdaq's composite index of over-the-counter issues fell three quarters of a point, to 760.74.
Much of the increase in the Dow was a result of a spurt in oil stocks, which rose yesterday after spot oil prices lifted off five-year lows.
Mobil jumped 2 1/8, to 76 1/8; Chevron rose 5/8, to 86 5/8; Exxon was up 5/8, to 62 7/8, and Texaco rose 1 1/2, to 64 3/8. With the exception of Mobil, all are included in the Dow Jones average.
Stocks with fortunes that are tied to a rebounding economy, a group that includes chemical, paper and steel companies, as well as the automotive sector, also did well.
Chrysler climbed 3 1/8, to 56 1/8, after Salomon Brothers raised earnings estimates for the company and said its market share could grow significantly.
 
Technology Stocks Slump
 Trading in Borden was also heavy. The stock rose 5/8, to 18 3/4, as investors reacted to news, announced late Thursday, that the chairman and chief executive of the company had resigned.
However, with the exception of the International Business Machines Corporation, technology stocks continued to slump.
Shares of I.B.M. jumped 1 5/8, to 55 1/4, in heavy trading after Dean Witter raised its profit forecasts for the company, noting healthy sales of personal computers and an unexpectedly good market for mainframe computers.
But Intel fell 1 3/4, to 56 1/4; Apple Computer lost 1 3/4, to 28 1/4, and Motorola dropped 2 1/8, to 88 7/8.
One of the session's biggest losers was Kurzweil Applied Intelligence, which fell 5 1/2, to 15, on the Nasdaq market. On Thursday, the company reported disappointing quarterly earnings.
"In my view, the reason the market has stalled out is the belief the economy is not yet strong enough, despite the good numbers, to easily absorb any rise in short-term interest rates," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.

HEADLINE: Bond Rates Up Despite Low Inflation

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Interest rates rose yesterday despite a Government report that consumer inflation remained subdued last month.
Analysts said Treasury prices retreated yesterday after an initial jump largely because of technical trading strategies, which had a disproportionate impact in light volume. Also prompting selling was a University of Michigan survey showing a jump in consumer confidence in early December. 
 The price of the Treasury's main 30-year bond fell 22/32 of a point, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.20 percent, from 6.15 percent on Thursday.
Prices of shorter-term securities posted smaller losses.
The Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose modestly in November, restrained by declining energy costs. The Consumer Price Index increased two-tenths of a percent, half the October increase. The core of inflation -- excluding the volatile energy and food sectors -- rose by three-tenths of a percent.
 
Both Figures Expected
 Both figures were largely expected and did not change the general view that inflation was running at just below 3 percent this year.
The Labor Department's wholesale inflation report, issued a day earlier, also substantiated predictions that the economy's growth was not arousing a worrisome rate of inflation.
Yesterday's inflation report encouraged some initial buying, but the gains were short-lived as investors reacted to a University of Michigan survey showing consumers grew more optimistic about economic conditions in early December.
According to market analysts who saw the survey, which is not released publicly, the university's consumer sentiment index increased to 87.7, from 81.2 in November.
That prompted speculation that rising consumer confidence could accelerate economic growth and aggravate inflation pressures early next year.
Lending to that view was a jump in oil prices yesterday. The price rise led to a sharp increase in the Commodity Research Bureau index, a daily measure of overall commodity price changes that is considered a harbinger of inflation trends.
 
Technical Influence Cited
 Traders said the market's weakness also appeared to result from technical influences related to a decline in bond futures contracts, which are like other commodities contracts that allow speculators to bet on the future direction of prices.
"There was no real significance to the price action," said Matthew Alexy, market strategist for the First Boston Corporation. "The move we saw today is well within the realm of the trading range over the last couple of weeks."
Elsewhere in Treasury bond trading, short-term securities fell 3/32 point to 5/32 point and intermediate maturities fell 5/16 point to 9/16 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 4.86, to 1,307.35.

HEADLINE: Migration of the 'Plain People' Revitalizes Farming

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PENN YAN, N.Y.

 BODY:
While farmland lies fallow in much of rural New York, an influx of Mennonite families is making agriculture a viable way of life once more in the central part of the state.
"Yates and Seneca Counties are the only two counties in the state to show an increase in the number of farms," said Charlie Elrod, a dairy specialist with Cornell Cooperative Extension. "That's entirely due to the Mennonites." 
 Many of them come from Lancaster County in Pennsylvania, famed for its population of "plain people." The greatest catalyst for their migration has been the price of farmland, which is much cheaper here.
While most of the Mennonites run dairies, some raise hogs, beef cattle and vegetable crops. Still others have opened support businesses, where they make harnesses and furniture, build and repair buggies or sell bulk food, shoes and dry goods.
 
Tripling Numbers
 Leroy Sensenig, a Mennonite who has a sewing-machine repair business, publishes a map pinpointing the home farms of his fellow church members in Yates County and neighboring Schuyler and Ontario Counties. He said that the influx began spontaneously in 1974 with two families, and more followed, with the population tripling in the last 10 years.
The April 1993 edition of Mr. Sensenig's map shows 186 Mennonite households, all affiliated with the Groffdale Conference of churches, a traditional group, although most local estimates put the present number of all Mennonites in the area at more than 200 families.
The community comprises perhaps 1,000 people, served by four Mennonite churches and 11 parochial schools. More than 20 families make up the nearby Crystal Valley conference, a less conservative group whose members drive cars, and several other area households are Horning Mennonites, also a less conservative group.
As one of the first Mennonite farmers to move to central New York from Lancaster County, Pa., Amos Horning, 76, helped many others follow. He was reluctant to draw conclusions about why his people are succeeding as farmers when many non-Mennonite farms are struggling.
"I don't want to brag or nothing," he said, "but maybe it's a little smaller way. Some of these extremely big operations may be too much. If you try to have everything at once, it costs a lot to operate."
Jim Capron, a field crops specialist with the extension, agreed the Mennonite farms were succeeding. "Stand on a hill in Penn Yan looking south and count the new silos," he said.
 
Lower Labor Costs
 Like Mr. Horning, Mr. Capron suggested that the Mennonites' economic success came from things other than the way they farm. The Mennonites do not necessarily differ from non-Mennonites in their use of purchased feed, seed, fertilizers or herbicides. Many use tractors.
But, said Mr. Capron, "If you buy $16,000 pickups and $50,000 tractors and choppers, you have to have a bigger business to support that. They continue to thrive and do well because they accept a simpler life style than the rest of us."
The Mennonites' labor costs are also a factor. "Every person on those type of farms is productively busy -- whether they're 4 or 40. Their labor costs are low because the workers are kids -- they're family," Mr. Capron said. "It's difficult for the existing community of farmers to compete."
Furthermore, he noted, the profitable sale of a Pennsylvania farm also meant a sound financial base in New York, allowing the Mennonites to remodel barns and invest in some fundamental agricultural improvements. "They've taken some poor farms that needed tile drainage, lime, crop rotation," he said, "and now that land's growing some pretty decent crops."
 
Buying More for Less

 Nancy Augustine, a real-estate agent in Lancaster County, Pa., whose grandparents were Mennonites, said a farm of 70 to 100 acres near Lancaster could cost $5,000 to $15,000 an acre.
"When you pay $15,000 an acre for a farm, you're going to have a hard time making that pay," she said.
Jim Moon, a Penn Yan real-estate agent, said a similar farm in sparsely populated Yates County would sell for $500 to $1,500 an acre. Often, he said, a Mennonite farmer who has sold a farm of 50 to 70 acres in Pennsylvania at a profit will buy a 200-acre spread in New York, then divide it for several family members.
As the Mennonites' numbers have grown, the prevailing local rumor has been that, through their strong church affiliations, the Mennonites did not pay taxes. But in answer to those rumors, Mr. Moon, the real-estate agent, said: "Tell me a tax they don't pay. They pay a lot of school tax dollars, but don't ask for schooling for their kids. They're building bigger and better buildings and barns, which adds to the property tax base. They use the roads, but they probably don't beat them up like we do -- and you won't see them down at the social services office looking for welfare."
The Mennonites are good neighbors, too, he said, adding, "If you have a problem, they're probably going to be the first ones there."
Mr. Moon cited the Mennonites' participation in the booming, six-year-old Windmill farm and craft market, a 26-acre cornucopia of farm produce, flea market finds and food, which draws thousands of visitors every Saturday from May to December and has brought dozens of new jobs to the areas. "I don't believe it would have happened without them," he said.
At the Penn Yan branch of the National Bank of Geneva, Jeff Franklin, assistant cashier and agricultural loan officer, said the Mennonites' farm accounts were in excellent shape. Although he acknowledged antipathy from some non-Mennonite farmers toward the newcomers, he said the Mennonites' presence was good for the area. "Economically," he said, "it's terrific."

HEADLINE: BOXING;
De La Hoya Puts Managers On the Unemployment Line

BYLINE: By TOM FRIEND, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 10

 BODY:
Oscar De La Hoya has a new manager: himself. The former Olympic boxing champion, whose professional career is suddenly in knots, surfaced today with a cast on his left wrist and a game plan he utilized in the amateur ranks. It is called "All in the Family."
Charging that his former managers -- the New Yorkers Robert Mittleman and Steve Nelson -- were tardy with bonus payments and had practically moved into his house, De La Hoya officially fired them, in public, this morning. 
 "I'm in full control," he said at a news conference staged next to a Christmas tree.
The 20-year-old fighter was flanked by his father, Joel, and his childhood trainer, Robert Alcazar, and said he intended to restore the entire team that helped him win a 1992 gold medal -- right on down to his cook. He said he would never again allow outsiders to interfere with his career decisions, although in the last week he has established ties with a criminal attorney from Redondo Beach, Calif., and apparently will retain Bob Arum as his promoter.

 
 
March Fight Still Scheduled
 A March 5 bout against Jimmy Bredahl for the World Boxing Organization junior-lightweight title is still on, as is a $7 million-plus deal with HBO.
That is, assuming De La Hoya's left wrist cooperates. De La Hoya revealed today -- others are suspicious he is being overdramatic -- that he aggravated an old ligament injury while punching the heavy bag last week. It was the injury, he said, that forced him to pull out of last Thursday night's fight against Jesus Vidal Concepcion at the Paramount in Madison Square Garden. The managerial rift, he added, had "nothing to do" with the withdrawal.
Arum, who was the promoter of the bout, has called the injury "nonsense," and Mittleman, who was still a member of De La Hoya's camp as of last week, said this afternoon: "There was nothing wrong with him. He was punching the bag with both hands hard."
De La Hoya could have motivation for citing the wrist injury. As soon as De La Hoya pulled out of Thursday's bout, Randy Gordon, commissioner of the New York State Athletic Commission, threatened him with suspension. "The wrist thing came up after the fact, after the suspension threat," Mittleman said.
But De La Hoya and his new attorney, Michael Norris, are sticking to the wrist story, and Norris today even read a statement from a Los Angeles orthopedist, Dr. Kathleen Godzik. She said De La Hoya must wear the cast for six weeks and has relayed that information to Gordon in New York.
Not much else was certain this afternoon. If you believe De La Hoya, he was an impressionable teenager who was overwhelmed by a $1 million offer made to him by Mittleman and Nelson after the Olympics. But according to De La Hoya, the managers "broke their promises," tried to win him over by going through his father and generally hounded him.
The two managers, according to a person close to De La Hoya, answered the telephone at his house and intercepted letters mailed directly to him. When Mittleman moved a mile away from De La Hoya's home in Montebello, Calif., De La Hoya was said to have been beside himself. He bought a cellular telephone so he could make unmonitored calls.
"It bothered me a great deal," De La Hoya said of Mittleman's move to the neighborhood. "Because he was always at my father's house, talking to him, putting things in his head. It wasn't right. It wasn't right for Mittleman to be doing that. I guess what they wanted to do is get to him, so my dad could get to me. But I'll be 21 in February, and I can make my own decisions now."

 
 If you believe Mittleman and Nelson, De La Hoya is a great fighter who is in love with money and who does not know the first thing about loyalty.
"Hey, Rock Newman spends 200 days a year, 10 hours a day, with Riddock Bowe, and you don't hear Riddock complaining," Mittleman said. "But Riddock is an intelligent guy. He understands managers work for him."
Mittleman has admitted that he and Nelson had to borrow money from Arum but has maintained that they were late on bonus payments only once. The managers did give Joel De La Hoya 11 percent of their 33 percent earnings from every fight.
As for the accusation that they used Joel De La Hoya to control his son, Mittleman said: "We treated the father great; he loved us. But he's on whatever side has the money. He'll find a way to grab and steal from Oscar, too."
Joel De La Hoya, for his part, would not answer questions today, nor was it clear who hired Norris or who would buy out Mittleman and Nelson's five-year contract. Mittleman has asked for a settlement "in the millions," and De La Hoya apparently wants to pay them with money from the HBO deal -- a deal Mittleman and Nelson helped put together.
"To tell you the truth, if I get what I want, I'll be happy just to get away from the kid," Mittleman said.

HEADLINE: Canada's Health Care System Merits Copying

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your informative supplement on "The Health Debate" (Nov. 14) has generated considerable comment.
The article on the Canadian system contained a number of misleading statements. To begin with, it is not the case that health care spending in recent years is growing nearly as fast in Canada as in the United States, an assertion published elsewhere without documentation by an anti-single-payer think tank. 
 Morris Barer at the University of British Columbia, in the fall 1991 issue of Health Affairs, documented the fact that the growth in health care costs has moderated recently. In fact the average annual growth in health spending from 1971 to 1987 was 3.86 percent in Canada, and 4.18 percent in the United States. When later years are added in, Canada looks even better, and the United States worse: from 1971 to 1989, growth in Canada dropped to 3.65 percent a year, while in the United States it increased to 4.39 percent.
It is true that the federal Canadian Government, until recently controlled by conservatives, responded to the current economic recession by reducing federal transfer payments for health care to the provinces. To their credit, the provincial governments pick up the slack. Even in the face of an expansion of private insurance for services such as dental care, the public sector still pays 72 percent of health care bills (a minor drop from 77 percent in 1975).
Reductions in services are also misstated. There has been no change in the Ontario Health Insurance Plan's billing policies for laboratory tests: they still cannot charge more than the allowed rate for covered services, which include diagnostic laboratory tests. It was always the case the labs could bill privately for tests that are not covered, because they are considered harmful or unnecessary.
Similarly, like virtually every American health insurance plan, the Canadian system never covered employment-related physical examinations. In the past, some physicians billed the Government for these exams by identifying them as different procedures that were covered; the Government is now cracking down on that practice. However, this cannot be characterized as a reduction in benefits.
Contrary to the article, Ontario has not increased patient payments for drug prescriptions, coverage available primarily to those over 65. This option, once considered, has been flatly and publicly rejected.
It is true that the system has stopped payment for electrolysis, which uses an electrical device to remove unwanted hair. I challenge you to find a United States health plan that covers this or any other cosmetic service, or an American consumer who would support such coverage.
There are certainly problems with every health care system, including Canada's. What is remarkable is the tremendous effectiveness of the Canadian health system in identifying problems, holding them up for public scrutiny and coming up with popular solutions, even during times of economic hardship. This is reflected, as you accurately note, in Canadians' great pride in their system, and their nearly unanimous support for it.
As the chief sponsor of single-payer legislation in the United States Senate, the American Health Security Act, I suggest that we could learn much from our northern neighbors.

HEADLINE: Giving From the Heart, Using the Mind

BYLINE: By JOSHUA MILLS

 BODY:
Letters from charities requesting money are as common in mailboxes these days as holiday greeting cards. Hoping to take advantage of the giving spirit of the season and reminding taxpayers that Dec. 31 is the deadline for gifts deductible against this year's income, charitable organizations from the well known to the obscure pull out all the stops.
Many groups find a receptive audience, for charitable impulses run deep through the American culture. Donations totaled more than $124 billion in 1992, with the vast majority of them from individuals, according to the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel Inc. 
 In a recent survey of 1,007 families by Louis Harris & Associates for the Lutheran Brotherhood, 81 percent of the respondents said charitable giving was a value they tried to pass on to their children. Eighty percent of the responding households with more than $50,000 in annual income said they contributed to their churches or synagogues, and 94 percent of them to other charities.
Yet few donors pay much attention to how charities spend their money, regulators and watchdog groups say. Now and then, an ugly incident provides a reminder of the potential for abuse. A charity pays its staff high salaries and passes little money to the needy, or a scandal erupts like the one last year at the United Way.
Fraud and scandal aside, donors would do well to scrutinize how groups parcel out their money. Before making a donation, particularly a sizable one, they might ask an organization what portion of its expenditures are left after fund raising and overhead to support its mission. An organization should be willing to provide its audit and annual report.
Many people in philanthropies say at least 60 percent of spending should go to charitable programs. Some organizations do much better. The Child Welfare League of America devotes 91 percent of its budget to helping children; the National Hispanic Scholarship Fund spends 95 percent on student aid; the American Red Cross spends 92 percent on services.
No one has challenged those numbers, but several watchdog groups and state regulators say many groups' figures deserve a second look. Until 1987, most charities counted money spent for fund raising in a separate category from money used to feed the hungry, support medical research or other activities known as program services. So it was relatively easy to see what portion of a charity's budget went to service.
Then, in response to lobbying from some charitable groups, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants began allowing groups to count part of their fund-raising costs as program services -- if the solicitations contained educational material intended to motivate some action.
"We find that most people do not want to pay for this type of activity," said Daniel Borochoff, who founded the American Institute of Philanthropy earlier this year.
 If a group you support counts some mailing costs as program services, does it trouble you? Look at the material you received. Did you learn from it, and share that information with neighbors or children? Were you motivated to do something -- write a legislator perhaps or read a recommended article?
"We say our mailings have an educational purpose, and we comply with Internal Revenue Service guidelines," said Helen R. Neuborne, executive director of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, which was criticized by two watchdog groups for counting mailing costs as program expenses. "We get a lot of calls, about 5,000 a year, from people, women and men, who receive our mailings, and want help or information."
The fund, not legally related to the National Organization for Women, received an F from the American Institute of Philanthropy and an N (does not meet standard) from the National Charities Information Bureau.
Ms. Neuborne said that in 1991, the year analyzed for the ratings, her organization undertook a major membership drive that almost doubled its size. "I wanted to build to get a broader base, and that's quite expensive," she said. The ratings, she added, are "simply not fair or a long-term measure of what we do."
Dan Langan, a spokesman for the National Charities Information Bureau, responded: "We are willing to listen to excuses, and if we agree with a plan, we factor it into our ratings. In this case, we did not."
Many nonprofit groups with a social or political agenda -- like Public Citizen, or Amnesty International -- say they have a harder time raising money, and incur greater costs, than groups that support medical research or that help disaster victims.
Mailings are not the only point of contention. In developing ratings, the watchdog groups throw out the value of donated services, fearful that the services will distort the group's financial practices. They point to such groups as the Children's Wish Foundation, in Atlanta, which the Connecticut Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, has accused of grossly overvaluing donated goods. The group, created to fulfill the wishes of critically ill children, said it had received books valued at $800,000 and donated them to hospitals in Romania. The Attorney General's office said the books, all in English, included 3,375 copies of "Principles of Accounting" and 1,525 "Bulbs for Summer."
On Thursday, Mr. Blumenthal said, "Children's Wish Foundation has indicated a willingness to pay a substantial sum to settle the case." The group's leaders were traveling and unavailable for comment.
But eliminating donated services hurts the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, which uses a number of lawyers who donate their time for research and litigation. And that demonstrates a major flaw of report cards -- they are flashy and make good headlines but sometimes oversimplify complex situations.
"Pro bono legal services are a good use of community skills," said Ms. Neuborne of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. "And by not measuring them, you leave false impressions."
Mr. Borochoff of the American Institute of Philanthropy acknowledged that his method penalized the group, and said the public should look beyond grades to reports and audits.
A rating practice that irks many charities is penalizing large reserves. Mr. Borochoff gives an F to any group whose reserves equal more than two years' expenses. Although more than 94 percent of its spending goes to programs, the Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children receives an F from Mr. Borochoff because it has a $4.4 billion reserve, representing 13.5 years of work.
Lewis K. Molnar, executive vice president of the Shriners Hospitals, said, "We keep fund raising to provide enough growth in the endowment fund to keep pace with inflation and expand our services."
On this and other issues, donors need to set their own priorities, and perhaps the best advice is to give thoughtfully, not impulsively.

HEADLINE: One Cop, Eight Square Blocks

BYLINE: By Michael Norman; Michael Norman, a former Times reporter, is an associate professor of journalism at New York University.

 BODY:
It will always come down to this -- one mutt, one cop, eye to eye, struggling for control of the street. The cop is Kevin Jett, Badge No. 19980, Beat 12, Sector George, the 52d Precinct in the northwest Bronx. The mutt is Killer, a Jamaican drug dealer with arctic eyes and a taste for letting blood.
The cop patrols on foot from East 194th Street to East 198th Street, from Decatur Avenue to Valentine Avenue -- one man, eight square blocks, perhaps 12,000 people. Most of these, in the officer's words, are "upstanding citizens." They work hard, worry about their children, struggle to survive. Among them, however, boldly encamped on corners or lying in alleyways, is a species of citizen that Kevin Jett has come to despise: the urban predator -- Cuco and Sweet Pea, Gravy and Chisel Head, Scarface and Killer. 
 In the gathering warmth of a summer day, the officer has turned down Valentine in search of a murder suspect, a Jamaican dealer named Leopold. As it happens, Killer is on the street, his first day back after a while away.
Killer shot a man a few months back, a rival in the drug trade, then left the man for dead. The victim, however, recovered. When Killer discovered his blunder, he fled, eventually to Philadelphia, where his nemesis caught up with him. There, Killer was shot. Naturally, neither man sought comfort in the law, so the police had no case. But "we knew the deal," says Kevin Jett.
"Killer's feared around here, so every once in a while I got to bring him down a peg." And today, spotting him around the bend on Valentine, the officer has decided to do just that.
"Hey! Killer!"
The dealer wheels, his face sour, his eyes full of rage.
"What you call me Killer for!" he snaps. "You know my name."
Kevin Jett had only wanted to tweak the mutt, not force a duel. But one word has led to another and a line has been drawn, and now, too, from out of nowhere, come Killer's supernumeraries, five in all, among them a giant in a track shirt.
"Where's Leopold?" Jett asks. He stands squarely in front of Killer, but he can sense that the others are close. "Why don't you tell him to turn himself in?"
Killer lets the question dangle. His hands are deep in the pouch of his hooded sweatshirt -- hooded sweatshirt? On a day as hot as this? Maybe Killer has poor circulation. "Don't know where Leopold is." He's sullen and still full of fire. "I'm not into that -- that life anymore, man."
Jett closes the distance, closer . . . closer . . . so close, now, Killer can see the flakes of breakfast oatmeal still in the officer's teeth.
"There's no reason for you to get angry," says the cop. "What are you trying to do? Show off in front of your friends here?"
Killer spits and curses.
"You just tell Leopold if you see him," Jett goes on.
"I'll tell him," says Killer, pulling back from the edge, but still sullen, still snarling.
"You know what I like about you Killer? I'll ask you a question and you'll stand there and lie to me."
And all at once, Kevin Jett turns his back and walks silently away. Around the corner on East 194th Street, the officer looks over his shoulder.
"Guys like Killer will eat you alive, even with the uniform on. They can sense fear, smell it like a dog smells it. Some of the mopes will come right out and tell you you're nothing, and you don't want that, oh, no. If you're going to do this job, wear this uniform, you definitely don't want that. If it gets around that you're soft, that without your nightstick and gun you can't fight, that's bad. If you allow someone to smoke a joint in front of you or curse you out, word will spread throughout the neighborhood like a disease. You're a beat cop, out here every day, alone, so you set standards right away, and for those that don't like it. . . . "
THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SHARP EYE IN THE streets: the colonial watch, the gaslight bluebottles, the Roaring 20's copper. Even after the advent of the radio car, most cities still relied on foot patrol, the cop on the beat. By the 1970's however, the role of the police had changed. Department after department, rocked by scandals and racked by recessions, saw their ranks shrink. Many decided to narrow their job to emergency response -- 911, a cop in a car racing from call to call, crime scene to crime scene. Soon, the police became isolated, strangers in the neighborhoods they were sworn to serve and, worse, little more than a passing annoyance to criminals. Disturbed by this state of affairs, a new generation of police executives began to experiment. In the late 70's, in Flint, Mich., and Newark, they took a lesson from history and put bluebottles back on the beat.
Watching all this was Herman Goldstein, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. From his work in criminology, he knew the experiments would fail if the police simply followed form: answered calls, filled out reports, made arrests. They needed to focus on substance, which meant attacking the circumstances that make crime possible.
Goldstein proposed what he called a basic "problem-solving method." Step 1: Analyze the problem. If there is a rash of burglaries in an apartment building, find out when the thefts occur, what floors they occur on and what's being taken. Step 2: Use this information to fashion solutions. Train a tenant watch, persuade the landlord to improve building security, install alarms and show the tenants how to cage their windows and secure their doors. Step 3: Follow up. Watch the building, stay current with the tenants.
In time Goldstein's method and the experiments in foot patrol coalesced in the practice known as "community policing." While some of the early trials in regular foot patrol had little real effect on crime, people in the test neighborhoods embraced the idea. The beat cop was back, and no matter what the statistics said, the neighborhood seemed somehow more secure.
Encouraged by this reception, a number of places, Portland, Ore., and Madison, Wis., among them, adopted the practice. By 1990, Lee P. Brown, then Commissioner in New York, declared community policing "the dominant philosophy" in his department. But in New York, a city of quarreling multitudes, the most densely populated major municipality in the country, community policing has been slow to take hold.
Part of the problem is the size and nature of the force. The N.Y.P.D., with more than 31,000 uniformed officers, is the largest such force in the United States. Its bureaucracy, which includes 8,000 civilian workers, is inflexible. Its rank-and-file officers, wedded to traditions that date from the middle of the last century, resist new ideas. What is more, the new policing demands a special breed of officer, tough but skilled, and smart -- an organizer, a planner, an ombudsman. Finally, there are the streets, which seem meaner and more savage than anywhere else -- perhaps, say beat cops, too tough for tenant patrols and problem-solving protocols and nuisance-abatement programs.
In New York, then, community policing is a mass experiment in urban order, maybe the largest and most important policing experiment any government has tried to conduct.
The question is, can a city this large, hobbled by chronic budget deficits and a hidebound bureaucracy, make it work in a violent world?
THE SKY IS CLEAR THIS MORNING, THE SUN white-hot. On Briggs Avenue, Kevin Jett stops in front of No. 2773, an apartment building with an elegant arch. Last summer a clique of teen-agers used the entryway as their hangout; by early fall, three boys in that clique -- boys absorbed by drugs -- were killed.
"That sobered the others up," says Kevin Jett. "They got jobs. They realized what was going to come of hanging out and doing nothing."
Two teen-age girls are sitting on the steps under the arch. One has a ponytail, the other a gold ring in her nose. Ponytail is talking about getting a job. Gold Ring is talking about her boyfriend, who is "on vacation," a neighborhood term for a stretch in jail.
"I don't need no job," says Gold Ring. "I got a man to support me. He got money."
Jett asks: "Doing what?" She laughs, sheepishly.
"So, what's he do?" Jett again asks, pressing for an answer he already knows.
"He makes lots of loot -- that's what he do," says the girl, sticking her tongue out.
"You ought to get yourself a regular man," says Jett.
"A regular man?" The girl shakes her head. "Ain't none of them out here."
In fact, there are legions of men and women leading respectable lives on Beat 12. They pack the aisles of the Roman Catholic Church, they usher their children through the streets to school, they crowd the busy bodegas and Laundromats. Without the regulars -- day laborers, office workers, welfare mothers -- the neighborhood would surely fall, as have so many others in the Bronx. But more and more of late, the regulars -- and their allies, the police -- wonder how long they can hold their ground.
So many stores have been robbed so often that many, including the Post Office, conduct business from behind thick Plexiglas partitions. Some streets are so dangerous that the auxiliary police won't drive down them. And when regular patrol officers respond to calls in some zones they are often met with "air mail," bricks and chunks of concrete that rain down from above.
At night Beat 12 echoes with gunfire, much of it random; few here are foolish enough to sleep with their bed by a window. When the gunmen have a target, as they often do, the next morning the neighbors are out with broom and hose sweeping blood from the sidewalk. All this, of course, creates an air of dread, a feeling best expressed by a T-shirt popular among teen-age boys. "Back up," it reads, "and live."
NOW AND THEN KEVIN JETT does traditional police work -- writing tickets, making collars -- but usually only in passing. The sector cars answer most emergencies. And special units -- narcotics, morals and so on -- work the streets.
Jett's main mission is to insinuate himself into the lives of the people on his beat, to walk and talk, analyze their trouble and then find a way to stop it. He's a collector of suggestions, a clearinghouse for complaints. He listens, weighs options, takes action.
Sometimes he attacks the context of crime, the disrepair and disorder that make mayhem possible -- drunks on a corner, drug addicts in a lobby, trash on the sidewalk, burned-out cars in the street. And sometimes he moves against the criminals themselves -- a burglar preying on a building, a motorcycle gang staking out a block.
All of this seems to take place more at random than by plan. Kevin Jett is not a textbook cop. He has not read the department's new problem-solving manuals and knows almost nothing of Herman Goldstein's methods; his training in community policing was so short and superficial that he barely remembers it. He embraces the objectives of community policing, but seems to work more by instinct than design. In short, he is no poster boy for community policing. He's a street cop, a grunt who relies more on old-fashioned savvy than problem-solving protocols. As an average cop, one who has to moonlight to make ends meet, he stands as a good test of the new police science.
Down East 194th Street, then north on Bainbridge, then west to Valentine. Across the street four young Hispanic Americans are sitting on the hood of a car. "Let's stop," says Jett. "Just stand here."
He hooks his hands in his gun belt and studies the scene. "They've been dealing heroin up here. I've been in the precinct five years and I've watched them grow up from kids. They were about nothing then, so I guess I shouldn't expect much now. You hope things will change, but they don't."
A moment later, the group moves on and the officer seems satisfied. "If they don't know my name at least they know there's a big black cop who's always around. That's my reputation. I like that."
Always around? Not in this neighborhood, or anywhere else. With vacations, furloughs and sick leave, court time, paper work, meetings, training sessions, special assignments and details, the average beat cop can spend as much as half of his regular 43-hour week off the street. To put it another way, if a neighborhood sees its cop 1 hour out of every 10, it's lucky.
Actually, Kevin Jett is hardly ever around. He tries to stagger his shifts to create the illusion of omnipresence -- one of the new tactics. But while this gambit fools some people -- "Man, you is always working!" says a surprised mutt -- it does not mollify the regulars.
Down Valentine toward East 194th Street, half a block from the corner, a middle-aged Hispanic woman with reddish hair corners the officer. A pack of boys, she says, have been smoking marijuana in front of her building.
"I tell them to leave. I tell them I live here 18 years. They say, 'So what?' "
The officer looks down the block. Four teen-agers are standing in front of the Right Spot pizza parlor.
"That them?" he asks.
"That's them," says the woman.
"Yo!" yells Jett. "C'mere!"
They are 14, perhaps 15 years old.
"You keep hanging out all day," he tells them, "and you're going to get in trouble, or catch a bullet. Don't destroy the neighborhood you live in."
"It wasn't us," one of them says. "It was our friend."
"I saw you," says the woman, so angry she begins to shake. "Don't come in our building! You got no business here! I don't want our kids to see the reefer. It's dirty. Dirty!" And suddenly she begins to cry.
Jett leans forward. "You hear her," he tells the boys, in a voice so soft it's almost lost in traffic. "This is somebody's mother."
SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND THE STATION house is quiet. A sergeant mans the front desk. To his right an officer answers the phone.
The sergeant is writing in a log book and complaining out loud. "Another community event and it's pulling officers from the sector cars, but that's community policing. It's great, huh? We're all community policing."
The cop on the phone cups his hand on the mouthpiece. "Yeah, the community policing unit does something and we have to clean up the mess."
"Ten years," the sergeant goes on, "they've had it for 10 years and it's a failure, but the department keeps trying it because it's the new thing."
In one form or another, New York has had a cop on the beat since 1783. Even in the 1970's, when most of the force rode patrol cars, there were still walking posts and trial programs in foot patrol. Today, on average, about 40 officers in each precinct walk a neighborhood: some 2,700 cops on 1,320 beats, or roughly 20 percent of the patrol force. The experiment is broad, and the results, so far, show just how complicated and difficult the job of radically restructuring the police really is.
In the subculture of the station house, the answer to crime is swift punishment, not social work. To many cops, community policing is too "soft" to deal with the mopes and knuckleheads roaming the streets. Even those officers who joined the force because they wanted to "help people," as so many of them put it, do not relish the role of "government liaison," "problem-solving facilitator" and community organizer.
"If you live in Mayberry R.F.D. then it will work, but I don't see it happening in New York," says one cop, speaking anonymously for fear of official censure. Now an undercover man, he walked a beat for more than a year. "I don't think a police officer should be involved in community organizing. The department also wants you to solve long-term problems, but that was impossible -- the drug problem, that's never going to go away. Community policing -- it sounds great, but I think it's a big waste of time."
The bureaucracy adds to the problems by rewarding cops for "turning numbers," making arrests, not for solving problems. Then there are the dual diseases of brutality and corruption. Beat cops, for the most part, are on their own -- historically a risky practice, particularly in New York. In the early 1970's, a commission headed by Judge Whitman Knapp revealed an entrenched system of corruption -- thousands of cops on the take, mostly from bookmakers and gamblers. This year, two decades after the Knapp Commission's final report, another commission, this one headed by a former judge, Milton Mollen, found new pockets of corruption: small clusters of brutal cops beating up drug dealers and stealing their merchandise and cash.
Finally, as the most trenchant critics of community policing point out, it makes little sense for the police department to become "client oriented," to take its marching orders from the people it serves, if the rest of the city government continues on its centralized, bureaucratic, self-absorbed ways. To truly reform the police, one must first reform the other agents of government -- the sanitation inspector, the Health Department officer and so on -- making them problem solvers too, directed by the community and working in concert with the police. It makes little sense, for example, for the Police Department to target a building for action if it's going to take the Department of Housing Preservation and Development a year or more to evict dealers from their apartments. It's not a foothill that has to be moved, it's a mountain.
THE DAY HE LEARNED THE department planned to hire him, Kevin Jett drove to his parents' house in Mount Vernon to break the good news.
His father was elated. "Go on, boy." he said. "Go on!" His mother, however, seemed heavy-hearted. "A policeman?" she said. "Kevin, are you sure you really want to do this?"
By his own lights, Kevin Maurice Jett, 31 years old, a former amateur boxer and black belt in karate, six feet, 200 pounds, strong and swift, is a mama's boy.
He calls his mother several times a week. She asks if he's wearing his bulletproof vest; she worries the dealers will target him. Not long ago he bought a beeper so she would always be able to reach him. "The beeper makes her feel better," he says. "But I don't tell her half the things that happen on my beat."
Bennie Ruth Jett, an assistant teacher at an elementary school, and her husband, Morris Jett, a supervisor with the city Housing Authority, were born and raised in Mississippi. Twenty-eight years ago they came north in search of a better life, settling in the Bronx on the ninth floor of a 22-story building in a public-housing project, the Mott Haven Houses.
Bennie Ruth's passion was the Pentecostal Church. She sent her children -- Bruce, Cheryl and Kevin -- to Bible study and encouraged them to sing in the choir. Kevin, the youngest, spent so much time singing hymns and studying scripture his friends starting calling him Church Boy.
Mott Haven then was not as mean and dangerous as it is now, but it was still a place to be wary. So the Jetts set down rules: no smoking, drinking or languishing on the corner. After school, there were chores, then homework.
Church Boy went to Christopher Columbus High School, and it was there, one winter day midway through his freshman year, that he learned just how savage the streets can be.
He was on his way home in the late afternoon, walking along Pelham Parkway toward a subway station, when, nearing a corner, he heard footfalls from behind. By the time he turned, he was surrounded.
There were 13 in all, he says, white teen-agers, poised for an attack. He fought off the first, then the second -- even then he was sturdy and quick and well schooled in self-defense. Soon, however, the gang overwhelmed him. They beat his face and kicked and pummeled his body. And then he saw a silver blade catch the light, a sharp blade that sliced through his ear and came though his coat, again and again. He struggled onto the subway, then up the stairs to his family's ninth-floor apartment, where he sank into a chair. His mother came into the room. "What happened?" she asked. He looked up . . . then collapsed at her feet.
ROLL CALL. THE AFTERNOON SHIFT. DOWN Webster to East 194th street, then up a block to Decatur. On the southeast corner looms a soot-stained brick building with Tudor trim, 384 East 194th Street, six stories, 81 shabby apartments -- a haven, the police say, for drug dealers.
The sidewalks are empty, the building quiet. "To look at it now," says Kevin Jett, "you wouldn't think it's notorious. Now is when real-estate brokers bring clients to see apartments. Little do those clients know what lurks in the shadows."
Informers say that business is booming, with at least 3,000 packets of heroin and hundreds of vials of crack sold every day. The dealers use women -- mothers, wives and girlfriends -- to fetch their stock. They are organized and they are ruthless. "You get personal with these guys," an informant told the police, "and they'll just blow you away."
The building is just outside Kevin Jett's beat, but he regularly slides a block east to check it. Sometimes he stands on the corner, as he is doing now, his thick arms folded across his chest, a bugbear in blue frightening away flocks of buyers.
Occasionally he'll cross the street and wade into the circle of young mutts who do the dealers' work -- the lookouts and ushers and cashiers. He'll ask for identification, demand to know what they're doing there -- question after question until he forces them to scatter. But a beat cop has to circulate, so he'll move on, up the hill toward Valentine, knowing, without looking back, that the boys have returned and the next sale is already under way.
The police in the 52d have tried everything to rout the dealers from Decatur Avenue, all the tricks from the old book, all the techniques from the new. Narcotics squads have conducted operations and made arrests. Building inspectors have issued 800 housing-code violations to prod the landlord to fix the building and evict the dealers. Police lawyers have invoked the city's padlock law and closed down crooked storefronts. Beat cops have talked to the "good" tenants, mining them for information; they've also used traffic tickets and miscellaneous summonses to harass the dealers and scare off their trade. Nothing has worked.
The tenants are terrified, and all the tickets and citations are like so many "flea bites," as one cop put it, "when you consider the volumes of money," the profit from drug sales, the revenue from rent. (The building is owned by L. P. East 194th Street Realty. Its lawyer, Irwin Cohen of Brooklyn, says his client knows of no tenants who are selling drugs.)
Still, every month when the precinct captain, the community-policing lieutenant, the sergeants and beat officers gather to identify the precinct's five most pressing problems, 384 East 194th Street is near the top of the list. They hope one day to build a case with enough arrests and complaints to convince a Federal court that the building is a "crime instrument" that should be seized, cleaned out and turned over to a nonprofit community group. But such a legal procedure takes time. Meanwhile, Kevin Jett's supervisors urge him to look for a "creative" solution to the problem.
"Here's the creative solution to that problem," says Kevin Jett, shaking his large fist at the building.
Up 196th Street to Valentine. School is out and the street is crowded with children.
"Excuse me, Mr. Policeman."
There are two of them, dark-eyed girls with wan smiles.
"Hey, hi," says Kevin Jett.
The taller of the two is holding a plastic cage. Inside are two hamsters, one very large, one very small. The large one is chasing the small one, round and round and round. And their keeper is worried.
"Do you think," she asks, "do you really think the father will eat the baby?"
Bennie Ruth Jett was afraid of animals, save the goldfish she allowed in the house, so Kevin Jett knows nothing of hamsters. But a beat cop must have an answer for everything, even a head-hunting rodent.
"I don't think the father will eat him," says the officer, watching the chase. "But you got to get the mother to help."
"Oh," said the little girl, her voice fading. "I just wanted the baby. I gave the mother away."
Down East 196th Street to Decatur. Across the street comes a short, stout boy leading a short, stout dog, both scowling. The dog is a pit bull, the boy is J. J.
"Oh, my, my, my," says Kevin Jett, "here comes the terror of the neighborhood. Now J. J. lives at 384 East 194th Street, so you can guess what he's into. He told me he's raising that dog to hate cops. He used to be the balls of a gang that robbed kids. Now he's a steerer, leading customers to the dealers at 384. He was away for a few months in a juvenile detention center. They should have kept him until he was 40."
OFF THE BEAT, FOR THE moment, on Kingsbridge Road, headed for the New Capitol diner and lunch.
Kingsbridge Road is like a suq, or bazaar, clothing and shoe stalls as packed as old closets, produce stands with the world's fruit piled high. In the stacks of sugar cane and mangoes, there's a little Santo Domingo; in the cans of rambutan, a breath of Bombay. No neighborhood in New York is more eclectic: Koreans, Puerto Ricans, Albanians and Mexicans, Irish, Jamaicans, Italians and Guyanese.
Up the street comes Joanne Pritchard of Valentine Avenue with her companion and son.
"How you doin', Kevin?"
"Doin' fine, how about you?"
"Well, do you believe they shot a dealer in the chest on our street?"
"I heard a little about it this morning."
"We knew him," she says. "He was a nice guy, real nice to the kids. I'll tell ya, we're getting outta here. I got to get the hell out. It's really changed, the neighborhood. People have tried to bring it back, but. . . . "
"Yeah, ah huh, I hear you."
As it happens, two of the precinct's detectives are sitting across the street in a dark sedan. Jett walks over and leans down to the open window.
"What was the deal on Valentine?"
One dealer shot another, says one of the detectives. The victim was Tony Manning.
"Tan-gray Maxima?" asks Jett.
"Yeah," says the detective, "that's the car."
"Why did he get it?"
"Some kind of dispute. Don't really know yet. You know the saying, 'Dead men tell no tales.' "
For the moment, the murder troubles Kevin Jett. The drug dealer, his line of work aside, gave the police their "props," their respect. He was discreet about his business and well liked by his neighbors. Still, Jett says, "I guess if you live by the sword, you die by the sword."
Turkey burgers, yellow rice and marinara sauce. He eats light, lifts weights, runs to keep trim. After the meal, three more turns of the beat, then down to Webster to catch a bus back to the precinct.
Aboard climbs a young Jamaican, a thin man with a toothy grin. He looks toward the back for a seat, but, spotting the officer, decides to stand in front, by the door.
Jett looks up and smiles. Toothy Grin is new to the neighborhood, an apprentice in the drug trade.
"Let's go up front," says Jett.
Toothy Grin loses his glow. He looks at the driver. The bus isn't stopping. He's trapped.
Jett slides up next to him.
"What is it?" says the officer.
"I just be riding here, man," says the Jamaican, the grin now a faint smile.
"Guess you heard what happened to Tony Manning."
"I don't hear no-ting, man."
"You heard."
"No, man, what you say?"
"Better stay out of trouble or you might end up the same way."
Back at the station house, the shift is changing, with cops coming, cops going and the first arrests of the late afternoon crowding the cells. Jett climbs the stairs to the second floor and finds the detective in charge of the Manning case, a stocky man with a square face.
"What happened?" Jett asks.
The detective digs in a large folder and fishes out a stack of snapshots.
"Enjoy," he says.
Tony Manning, in blue jeans and a denim jacket, is lying face down on a white tile landing in front of an apartment at 2685 Valentine Avenue. The landing is covered in blood. Next to the body is a large red V-shaped smear, as if the victim had tried to raise himself before he died. He was shot twice. The first bullet entered his chest and struck an artery. This was the fatal shot. The second bullet hit him in the groin. This was a message.
"My, my, my," says Kevin Jett, shaking his head. "Look at that."
"How old was he?" someone asks.
The detective looks at the folder. "Thirty-two," he says. "But don't feel sorry for him. He wasn't one of the good guys. Shouldn't even investigate this one. Waste of the city's money."
Kevin Jett wasn't so sure. That night at home, he did his laundry, cooked some fish and wondered to himself how Tony Manning, by all accounts a polite and civil man, came to "waste his life" selling drugs. "I kept thinking, he wasn't a bad, bad guy. He wasn't a real thorn in my side. Maybe I'm getting soft."
HE BOXED HIS WAY INTO THE Golden Gloves. He ran track. He played football. At the end of his senior year, Kevin Jett graduated with honors, but when it came time to sort through the scholarships and choose a college, he stayed home, close to his church and his mother, and enrolled at the City College of New York. He studied education, then began to think about the law. Along the way, he married a woman from his church and soon had a daughter, Charisse. Then he began to drift, away from his studies and out of his marriage.
He ended up in front of a sorting machine at the Post Office, "brain dead" and desperately wishing he were somewhere else. He took the test for the Police Department and passed, but when he was called to report, his wife protested that she was afraid. Before long the marriage had dissolved, and in April 1987, Kevin Jett reported for duty with Training Company 8746 at the New York City Police Academy.
Across the six months that followed, he heard lots of advice. "They told us: 'It's a war out there. You're going to lock people up on a Monday and on a Wednesday, they'll be back on the street looking for you.' That was true. We were also told that someone you know on the job will get killed in the line of duty. That was true, too."
Some of the training was easy. "Being from Mott Haven I already knew how to treat people in the streets -- like you want to be treated, even the bad guys, until they show you disrespect." The book work, however, left him struggling, so much so he almost gave it up. "I just kept thinking about graduation, that day when you wear the white gloves and stand and salute with your family watching."
His first day on the job, he left for work from his parents' house. "My mother said, 'Be careful.' I turned around and said, 'What do you mean?' Then I realized, Wow -- I'm a cop."
After six months of field training, he was assigned to the Five-Two, a precinct of about 300 officers on Webster Avenue in the northwest Bronx. He walked short foot posts at first -- back and forth on the same stretch -- then rode in a sector car. In 1991, he volunteered for the precinct's small community policing unit. He liked the flexible shifts -- beat cops set their own hours -- and, he says, "I like to work alone with no one looking over my shoulder." He was assigned to Beat 12, one of the most dangerous in the precinct.
He surveyed the neighborhood and sized up the "players." Then he did what beat cops have always done to make the terrain theirs -- he set out to establish a presence.
"You have to project an image, especially if you work alone. So you have a little talk with the knuckleheads, introduce yourself and tell them where your coming from. You say: 'I'm Officer Jett. This is my neighborhood. If you mess up and I see you around, I'm going to take care of you.' "
His background, of course, helped him do his job. "The average white rookie out of the academy on a beat like this is terrified. I grew up in Mott Haven, and the mutts understand that that's different from East Cupcake, Long Island. They feel that guys who came from there are soft.
"I also tell the rookies that sometimes you can use bluff, trickery and deceit with the bad guys. Some of the knuckleheads say, 'Without that gun you ain't nothing.' I say, 'If we have to do it, let's do it.' Then I say: 'This is my job. Let me do my job and you get on about your business.'
"If I have to fight, I'm the type who hits first and radios for help second. Most cops don't know how to fight. My technique is to pick you up and body-slam you to the concrete. Bam.
"Of course, you got to remember that no matter who you are, there will be somebody bigger, so you have to have the gift of gab. Once at the corner of Briggs and 194, I saw a guy I hadn't seen in the neighborhood before. He was only about 5 feet 8 inches, but he had muscles coming out of his ears. I said, 'Damn, that guys's got some muscles.'
"I go into a video store for a routine check and pretty soon this woman comes in and says there's a guy outside who had slapped her and had some money that belonged to her. I went outside. She says, 'Officer, officer, there's the guy who slapped me.' It was the guy with the muscles -- I mean, muscles in his neck, in his knees, in his toes, muscles everywhere. I said, 'Damn.' She says, 'They call him 'Grape Ape.' I said, 'Damn.' Then she said, 'He just got out of jail.' I said, 'Oh, no.' Then she leans over to me and whispers in my ear: 'The last time it took 10 cops to lock him up. His arms were so big they couldn't get them together to cuff him. They needed two sets.' I said, 'Lady, you ain't helping me none.' I could see myself going though the plate-glass window.
"I said to myself: 'Shoot, you don't want to get into a fight with this guy. You don't know how many of those 10 cops got hurt.' I said, 'I better do some talking.' I wasn't going to walk up and say, 'Look, give her the money or I'm going to lock you up.' So I said: 'Excuse me, fella. Could you come here for a minute.' I said: 'Look, I heard you just got out of jail. Here's the charges you face so far: robbery, assault three, and if you want to fight me, it will be assault on a police officer. Why don't you give her the money and you can walk.' He said, 'O.K., officer.' I was so happy."
Kevin Jett keeps his uniform spotless and neatly pressed. He carries a .38-caliber Ruger revolver with a four-inch barrel, two extra cylinders with six rounds each, handcuffs, a can of Mace and a radio. He also packs two additional pieces of equipment not listed in the regulations.
The first is a pair of black leather driving gloves. In the beginning, he wore the gloves as prophylactics, to search addicts and dealers, anyone with cuts or open sores. Then, perhaps acting on his boxer's instincts, he began wearing them for trouble. Now the gloves are a kind of signature. "When people see me with my gloves on," he says, "they know it's not about talking to anyone." Another part of his kit is a pocketful of quarters, which, every day, he slips into the hands of the small, often thirsty fold that tugs at his trousers or trails him wide-eyed and silent along the street.
IT IS JUST AFTER 7 P.M. and Ted Husted is calling to order the monthly meeting of the Bainbridge-Marion Community Association, a neighborhood group bent on beating back the mutts.
Kevin Jett is at the head of the table. Meetings like these are part of his routine. Last month, the precinct commander, Capt. Raymond Redmond, was there. So were 150 angry and emotive citizens.
Tonight, the mood is different. There have been some changes in the neighborhood. "We've seen more police on the beat and more sector cars," Ted Husted is telling his neighbors. "And now that they've put helicopters up, there's not as much gunfire at night. We've even seen Captain Redmond on patrol in the neighborhood, so it's not just show. We don't have any promises, but they're doing something."
Kevin Jett leans back and smiles.
The meeting is in the parish center of Our Lady of Refuge Roman Catholic Church. The church and the church school are one side of 196th Street. P.S. 46 is on the other. Together they anchor the neighborhood and are a large part of the reason that Ted Husted, a teacher, and Milton Mendoza, a carpenter, have not fled.
They own homes on Bainbridge Avenue, across the street from the public school. They are neighbors and friends. In the fight for the streets, they are also a flanking force for police. If they and others like them leave, the knuckleheads will overrun the neighborhood.
Ted Husted teaches second grade at P.S. 46. He and his wife, Jo Anne, will not let their three children walk the streets or visit the homes of their friends. "Maybe a drug dealer might be living next door to the apartment they would go to and maybe someone looking for that dealer will get the wrong address, break down the door and start shooting," Ted Husted says. The Husteds lead a Cub Scout pack, a Girl Scout troop and the local Little League -- recreation for 600 children. Without them, there would be nothing but makeshift basketball in the street. More and more, however, the Husteds talk about leaving. To them, the neighborhood seems lawless.
"If a guy can drive down the block with his radio blasting so loud it shakes the buildings and no one stops him, then he might as well drive down the street with a megaphone announcing, 'I have drugs.' " It is a neighborhood with a hollow heart, says Husted, a place with no moral center. "Parents in this neighborhood teach their children they're entitled to certain things, like if the local bodega is price-gouging, it's O.K. to take what you want and walk out without paying." And children, of course, tend to absorb the worst of society, not the best. "I talked to kids who've seen movies like 'Sleeping With the Enemy.' One of my students said: 'Yeah, my Dad took me. It was great. The guy slapped the [expletive] out of that [expletive]' -- I'm talking about a second grader here."
Their values have become so warped, so twisted that violence, in the end, is the only ethos most people know. "I have one student in class who refused to do anything. One day I said, 'Joey, why don't you do what I tell you to do?' He said, 'Because you don't really want me to do that.' I said, 'What gives you that impression?' He said, 'If you really wanted me to do it, you'd hit me.' "
MILTON Mendoza grew up in the Bronx. His father was a laborer, his mother worked in a sweatshop. Five years ago, he and his wife, Aurora, a nurse, and their two children moved into a house a few doors down from the Husteds'. It's a fine house, with a modern kitchen and parquet floors. Milton Mendoza the carpenter knows his trade. He has worked hard getting his place in shape. In a year, he says, he hopes it is owned by someone else.
It was winter when they arrived and the neighborhood was quiet. Then came the spring and the mutts emerged from their dens. They urinated on the sidewalk in front of his house, burglarized cars along the curb and filled the street with gunfire. One morning Milton Mendoza found three bullet holes near his front door.
He is 39, a man who has taken his lumps. "I come from the streets," he says. "I know how to handle myself." And yet:
One evening in November 1990, as he was driving home from work, something crashed against his car. He pulled to the curb to see what had happened and discovered that a teen-ager had tossed a brick at him. "I asked the kid, 'What are you doing?' He looked at me and said, 'Get the hell out of here or I'll put you in a body bag.' I thought of my family and said to myself, 'This guy is a moron.' So I started to walk away. Suddenly, seven or eight guys were surrounding me. The kid slapped me. So I grabbed him and slammed him against the building. I got in the car and took off.
"I was only a couple blocks from home. I stopped at the house to pick up the wife. When I came out, I saw them on the corner just down from my door. I figured I'd better try to talk to them. All of a sudden someone hit me from behind with a baseball bat. I went down. They sat me up and gave me 25 or 30 shots. Just about then the mailman came by and yelled at them. I was trying to block some of the blows with my arms. They broke my forearm, my wrist, my fingers. They dislocated an ankle and a knee. I had pins in my hand, a carpenter with pins in his hand. When I grew up we had fistfights, but today you look at the wrong person the wrong way and they want to shoot you, stab you, beat your brains out -- they want to kill you. These kids are like time bombs."
STREET COPS CALL HIM Popeye. He is short and muscular, with a balding pate and a canny smile. He worked his way from cadet to Commissioner -- the cops' cop. This year, an election year, is Ray Kelly's last as the top cop. New York's Mayor-elect, Rudolph W. Giuliani, has appointed William J. Bratton, the Police Commissioner in Boston, New York's next Police Commissioner. All three men support community policing.
But Giuliani's campaign promise to push the police to make more street arrests contradicts the whole idea of the new police science. The professionals know that wholesale arrests are a pointless exercise when courts are overbooked and prisons are beyond capacity. "Turning numbers," as the police call it, does little to lower fear or restore order.
Ray Kelly believes that the upstanding citizens he has served all his professional life are more perceptive than most politicians grant. He's walked a beat, he ought to know. "The public," he says, "wants a more personal relationship with the police."
So the Commissioner committed himself to community policing. It's a "work in progress," says Ray Kelly. And progress is slow.
It has not been easy to sell the rank and file on the value of problem-solving protocols. Young cops have the lights-and-siren syndrome; they're all action. And the veterans, those who have been on the job five years or more, suspect that community policing is a smoke screen for "social work." They're angry at the courts, the revolving door of justice, and they're careworn by the suffering they see in the streets. Many are so cynical, so demoralized, they echo the ethos of the streets: justice is swift and sure, some say, only at the end of a nightstick. Kelly knows too that many of his beat cops are ill trained and poorly supervised. Field officers get just two days of training in community policing, and the sergeants who direct them on the job frequently do little more than "scratch," or sign, their log books.
Even Kelly's executive corps has often failed him. Who knows how many tradition-bound captains, inspectors, commanders and chiefs have issued daily orders that sabotaged the new philosophy. Recently two such commanders -- apparently convinced that a cop out of sight is a corrupt cop -- stopped their beat officers from patrolling in apartment buildings, an essential tactic in community policing. "They're paranoid about integrity," says one precinct commander. "The whole idea is to watch your back, to make sure nothing happens, so you can move up to the next slot."
But it is the Commissioner who directs the department, not a small corps of cautious traditionalists. And it is unlikely the new Commissioner will change policies. "We're moving," says Kelly, "there's no going back."
Out in the precincts, the rank and file watches and waits. Some cops long for the old days. Others believe Kelly is right: community policing is here to stay.
On most mornings the troops under his command find Capt. Raymond Redmond, the precinct commander at the Five-Two, an amiable boss, one worthy of respect. He jogs through the precinct and every week spends hours walking a different beat. "The old precinct commander," says Jett, "could barely walk to his car."
Redmond runs the Five-Two with an even hand, an approachable autocrat. This morning, however, the word has spread that the boss is grumpy.
"Well, yeah, I am grumpy and I don't care if my cops don't like it."
He's piqued, in part, from a trip he made the day before to 1 Police Plaza. He had traveled to headquarters for a ceremony to honor the good work of several community police officers, among them one of his own.
"They take them down there and give them a certificate. A certificate? I would have given them a detective shield. That's a reward."
EARLY AFTERNOON and Kevin Jett is back on the job, in the cool, wood-paneled rectory of Our Lady of Refuge, conferring with the pastor, the Rev. John Jenik.
Father Jenik is a multifarious man, 49 years old, a firebrand from the 1960's who abandoned his bourgeois background, joined the church and, some 20 years ago, began a career with the poor in the Bronx. The archetype of the urban priest, he can quote from St. Augustine, plot urban policy, curse like a drunken marine.
He arrived at Our Lady in 1978 and formed the Fordham Bedford Housing Corporation, a nonprofit group that restores and runs buildings seized by the city or the courts. Then he went after the dealers. He organized boycotts of the stores that were drug fronts, then held marches and Masses and vigils at the neighborhood's "hot spots."
The dealers were angry; the priest was hurting business. And before long, John Jenik -- blond-haired, blue-eyed John Jenik, who daily walks his parish unescorted -- had a price on his head. "There's big money out here," he says. "You get in the dealers' way and you get killed."
Which is why Kevin Jett has come to the rectory today. Father Jenik has planned another all-night vigil and Mass -- this time at the hottest spot in the neighborhood, 384 East 194th Street, the six-story heroin house on Decatur.
"Well, Father, we're going to bring in big lights and flood the building and we're going to put people on the roof to make sure you don't get any airmail," says Kevin Jett.
"Good," says the priest. "We'll gather in the church and walk down from there. Thanks, Kevin."
Out on the street, the cop looks back at the rectory. "Father Jenik is a thorn in everyone's side," he says. "But he's a good thorn."
Across the street at P.S. 46, the afternoon session has just started. "Let's pay them a visit," says the cop, and he heads up the steps and though the gray Gothic arch.
Kevin Jett "owns" P.S. 46, and everyone in the neighborhood, including the school's principal, Aramina Ferrer, knows it. "He's told the bad element in the street, 'You don't come into my school and mess with my teachers and my kids,' " says Ferrer. "I feel like he's part of the staff."
The patron of P.S. 46 is always on hand. He speaks to classes about safety and drugs; he roams the peach-colored halls under the big clocks to keep the building secure; and when the final bell rings, he's on the corner, chasing away dealers and ne'er-do-wells.
Last year, when an angry parent confronted the assistant principal, Ferrer turned to Kevin Jett.
"I got five cops and went to the house. I asked him what happened, 'Why did you assault a teacher?' He said: 'I didn't assault him, I moshed him.' I said: 'Oh, you moshed him. Well this is my school, you hear me? Mine. And I don't like nobody coming into my school and moshing the teachers.' I said, 'You do it again, and you'll be getting locked up.' I said, 'If you really have an urge to fight, we can accommodate you.' "
When Kevin Jett surveys his career, three days come back to him: the morning he helped close the smoke shop on Briggs, the evening he saved the life of an asthmatic struggling to breathe and the afternoon he addressed the final assembly of fourth graders at P.S. 46.
"Come on into the auditorium," he is saying now. "Let me show you where I stood." He climbs some stairs, turns a corner and steps onto the stage. "Here, right here by the piano. See, this is where you stand. Then you have to shake everybody's hand. I wore my best dress shoes that day. Patent leather. Really shines."
He steps forward for a moment and stands silently on the apron, looking out into the quiet hall and the long rows of empty seats.
"I love what I do," he says. "But I'm not going to make detective here. No, that's not going to happen."
ANY DAY NOW, JETT IS scheduled to be transferred, most likely to a job as a narcotics officer in the Organized Crime Control Bureau. In New York there's no reward for walking a beat; no detective's gold shield, no sergeant's stripes, no cash bonus. The path to promotion and a raise is still through the special units -- narcotics, vice, organized crime. And Kevin Jett must move up: to support his three children he supplements his base pay of $3,100 a month with his earnings in a supermarket as a part-time fishmonger.
 By all standards, his own and those of his superiors, Kevin Jett has succeeded. Crime statistics in his monthly community policing log show that when he was off the beat for any substantial period, there were more burglaries, robberies, car thefts. His sources on the street have told him that when he's sick, injured or on leave, drugs sales go up, too.
 He attributes his success to his size, strength and background: a black belt in karate, a Bronxite wise in the ways of the streets. "Not every cop can work single patrol," he says. "I grew up in the city. I faced everything the knuckleheads faced."
 The advocates of community policing, however, would argue that even a less streetwise cop, one from East Cupcake, could have assumed ownership of Beat 12. It might have taken more time, but a smart, determined cop armed with the penal code can, they say, "establish a presence" anywhere.
To be sure, the baneful reality -- the swarms of drug dealers, gun merchants, loan sharks, pimps, robbers, burglars and extortionists -- powerfully suggests otherwise. But no one knows for sure. After rising inexorably for more than a generation, reported crimes have declined in New York for two straight years, to the lowest level since 1985. Yet officials are reluctant to ascribe the trend to any one factor, or even to recognize the existence of a trend based on such notoriously unreliable statistics. There is no data on community policing either, and the case studies are too narrow and anecdotal to serve as proof.
The basic idea of community policing -- marrying a cop to a piece of ground -- seems sound. If a cop can move onto a beat, roust the bad guys and teach the upstanding citizens how to resist their return, then that's one piece of ground where crime is unlikely to breed. But the job of organizing and educating places like Beat 12 is more daunting than the job of patrolling them. As one insider put it, "half the community is cheering the cops on, but the other half is still throwing things at them." And without the community, there is no community policing.
To imagine an N.Y.P.D. devoted entirely to community policing is to understand how far the department still has to go. It might have to be twice as large, perhaps 60,000 or 70,000 officers assisted by 15,000 to 20,000 civilian workers, with an annual budget of about twice the current $1.7 billion. A third or more of the force would be on foot patrol, covering the most dangerous and crime-plagued beats 24 hours a day. Cops would be community leaders, practiced in the political art of pushing city bureaucrats -- in sanitation, health and human services -- to do their jobs.
The officer on the beat would patrol where and when he wanted. His supervisors would be true colleagues, teaming up on tasks. The department would be decentralized; most decisions would be made by precinct commanders and supervisors in concert with neighborhood groups. All the support services -- from the sector cars to the vice squad -- would be organized around the beats and would work closely with the cop on the street.
In reality, of course, the municipal budget is tight and growing tighter, and the municipal mind is ill disposed to bureaucratic reorganization. Cops want to be crime fighters not problem solvers, Alexanders whacking the Gordian knot rather than unraveling it. The average cop sees himself as a lone agent, isolated and besieged, the mutts in front of him, his department nipping at his heels.
And there is more -- the overwhelming issues of crime and punishment, rehabilitation, new prisons, disintegrating families, murderous teens, turbulent schools, immigration, the economic isolation of the inner cities, racial warfare, gutter politics, urban alienation and fear so rampant it threatens to make the idea of compassion a concept from another age.
Can community policing work? Yes.
Does it work in the tough precincts of New York? Again, yes, though, at the moment, only by degrees and, at times, as much by accident as design.
Will the entire force -- detective squads, patrol cars, narcotics division and so on -- adopt the new science? Will the "dominant philosophy" ever become dominant practice? Herman Goldstein says that David Couper, the recently retired Police Chief of Madison, Wis., spent 20 years trying to reform that city's tiny 311-member force. By that measure, New York won't have a comprehensive community police force until the year 4000.
Perhaps the problem-solving and organizing can wait a bit. In the Bronx, at least, it seems enough for now just to have some bluebottles back on the beat.

HEADLINE: Mickey Kantor

BYLINE: By Keith Bradsher; Keith Bradsher reports on international trade for The New York Times.

 BODY:
There are several things about Mickey Kantor that his friends have learned to accept.
His competitiveness. "If I took Mickey fishing with me," says Bob Doochin, a close childhood friend, "he made everything into a damn contest. If I didn't stop him, before you knew it he'd be counting the size of the fish, the number of the fish." 
 His temper. When he was an eighth-grader coaching a seventh-grade basketball team, a penalty so enraged Kantor he threw his shoe at the referee. His team was assessed a technical foul and lost the game. Kantor readily acknowledges his lack of sportsmanship. "I don't like to lose," he says. "I don't believe in the game for the game's sake. It's not interesting to me to go out and play a game for the sake of exercise."
His tendency to speak first and think later. Last February, it was widely reported that the Mexican state of Yucatan had helped set up a fund to buy American companies and move them there to take advantage of its low wages. Kantor quickly sought to remove this potential threat to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Without consulting his aides or the Treasury Department, he informed the Senate Finance Committee he would try to reach an agreement with Mexico barring such maneuvers. Advised by his aides that many state governments in the United States were also luring investors, Kantor quietly abandoned the idea.
These qualities show a man so driven and self-assured he has no time for social niceties and no compunctions about making a fool of himself. Armed with that bristling confidence, he has taken charge of setting the rules for the way America does business with the world even though he has scant academic or professional expertise on international trade.
He has approached trade not as an economist or diplomat but as a politically savvy lawyer seeking to strike deals for his client, the President. These deals have forced Kantor to break ranks with longtime allies in organized labor and have confused foreign countries accustomed to free trade rhetoric, if not free trade actions, from the United States.
The first critical item on his agenda was winning Congressional approval of Nafta, which will rewrite the rules for 27 percent of the nation's international commerce and gradually eliminate taxes on imports and other trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States. As grueling as the battle over the regional trade agreement was, it probably counts as a warm-up for Kantor's next big challenge: the Dec. 15 showdown over strengthening international free trade rules.
Free trade regulations for most of the world's commerce in manufactured goods have already been set by GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The regulations outlaw limits on the quantity of imports, restrict taxes on trade and prohibit countries from discriminating against imports. Representatives from 116 nations have been holding talks to reduce import taxes even further and to expand free trade agreements to cover agricultural goods and services. This would stimulate the global economy because free trade allows each country to specialize in products it makes most efficiently.
Kantor may be short on international trade experience but he is long on clout. He has been a friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton since the late 1970's when both served on the board of the Legal Services Corporation, which oversees legal assistance for the poor. And he was Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign chairman. Before taking the trade job, he had been a lawyer at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, based in Los Angeles. Liberal Democratic politicians across the country routinely enlisted the help of the firm's senior partners in raising financial and political support among the affluent communities of Beverly Hills and Hollywood. Kantor met them all.
As the nation's top trade official, Kantor essentially looks at trade issues in terms of how many votes they would win in Congress or the next election. He brings to his job a lawyer's gift for memorizing the key points of a complicated case, as well as the shrewd negotiating skills of someone who spent almost two decades wheeling and dealing with California regulators on behalf of a succession of large corporations. The clearest instance of his penchant for horse-trading, even though it meant undermining the Administration's free trade credo, came during the final weeks before Congressional approval of Nafta last month.
Kantor had insisted in March to the Senate Finance Committee that special deals could not be negotiated for industries in key Congressional districts. He specifically told the committee he would not renegotiate the pact's provisions on sugar. But in the last two weeks before the House Nafta vote, he struck deals with at least a dozen industries that had opposed it, including sugar producers. He signed letters of understanding with the Mexican Government that reinterpreted the free trade pact's sugar and orange juice provisions and that would shield the American sugar and citrus industries from Mexican competition. This helped persuade several Florida and Louisiana lawmakers to support the agreement. Although consumer advocates like Ralph Nader criticized Kantor for restricting American access to cheap Mexican sugar, the Trade Representative defended his letters as necessary improvements.
Kantor's sharp tongue and legendary temper have alienated many. And his no-nonsense pragmatism has outraged some of the people he worked with and befriended when he was a young Legal Services lawyer closely allied with labor. More than any other issue, free trade separates New Democrats like President Clinton from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party and its bedrock support among unions.
Evelyn Dubrow, vice president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and a friend since the late 1960's, is appalled that Kantor fought for Nafta over the unions' objections. "I'm frankly disappointed in Mickey, who was a very liberal, concerned person when he was working for prepaid Legal Services," she says. "He is making a great mistake in not recognizing what Nafta will do to the high-skill, low-wage workers of this country."
Kantor, however, sees no contradiction in being a lifelong friend of labor and pushing for Nafta. He contends Nafta will help American workers by creating jobs. "One thing that always strikes me," he says, "any poll you ever see about trade, the American people by fairly large margins think we always do worse by trade agreements, in terms of jobs and the economy, than better. We've got a long way to go to convince the American people that we will act in their interest."
Those who have worked with Kantor and his predecessors say that his deal-making ability has allowed unusually quick progress in the GATT talks this year. Not tied to free trade ideas, he has shown a willingness to compromise on the last two Administrations' more ambitious demands for trade liberalization. The result has been a series of deals on everything from pharmaceuticals to distilled spirits, even though disputes remain on such issues as steel subsidies, the licensing of computer chips and the creation of a new organization to regulate international trade. This deal making has its price: It is more likely that the final agreement on Wednesday, if there is one, will be less far-reaching than what economists have hoped for.
CIVIL SERVANTS AT THE office of the Trade Representative were stunned when Kantor took over. His predecessor in the Bush Administration, Carla A. Hills, is one of the Republican Party's smartest lawyers. She was known in the agency for reading every memo thoroughly, highlighting numerous passages and asking so many questions that her aides felt like first-year law students.
Although Kantor displays similar energy, he is her opposite in many ways. She prizes formality; he does not. "This guy barely read briefing memos," says an official who has worked with both Hills and Kantor. "You'd go in there and he'd say: 'What are the big issues? What are the politics? Thanks.' " At interagency meetings and Congressional hearings, Kantor quickly developed a reputation for rambling comments that strung together a lot of facts and statistics with little analysis.
Over the last 10 months, Kantor has become more conversant in trade issues, although he remains the inveterate politician. Many working in the Trade Representative's office now admire Kantor's willingness to trust them with the fine print, contending that Hills's concern with detail made it harder for her to compromise.
Kantor's pronouncements on trade policy have also been more combative than Hills's. Early in a dispute he has been more ready to threaten trade sanctions. Although global trade war in the early 1930's is widely blamed for worsening the Great Depression, Kantor believes that the odds of a recurrence are very long because of changes in the global economy. "I can't imagine rational, reasonable people getting themselves into that position, given the extraordinary interdependence," he says. "We're too interconnected."
But despite the repeated threats of sanctions, so far he hasn't imposed any. The resulting combination of bluster and inaction has confused foreign trading partners. Foreign trade negotiators and even some American officials complain that it is often hard to predict Kantor's position on any given day from what he said the day before. Asked whether he does this to keep negotiating opponents off balance, Kantor cites a Chicago Bears halfback in the 1960's who was known for his broken-field running. "Let me just say that Gale Sayers was a great runner, and he did not find the shortest distance between two points was a straight line."
Soon after taking office, he threatened to limit bidding by European companies for Federal contracts unless the European Community canceled its new rules on public works contracts that hurt American providers of turbines and telephone switching equipment. On April 21, the European Community agreed to cancel some of the new rules. For the first time since the days of the Marshall Plan, Europe opened its market for power-generating turbines to full competition from American companies. Kantor, in turn, agreed to narrow American sanctions, but kept a few because the community did not agree to open its telephone switching market. The final settlement required no knowledge of trade law. Instead, it took the ability to build relationships with negotiating opponents and to divide the problem in new ways that would allow at least part of it to be solved.
WHEN MICKEY KANTOR TALKS, HE chops the air with huge, misshapen hands. Severe arthritis has swollen his knuckles to the size of small walnuts. The arthritis started 17 years ago -- he is now 54 -- and keeps him in nearly constant pain. For years, he countered the pain by running, swimming and playing baseball, basketball and tennis. The pain can nearly paralyze his hands and feet, especially in times of stress, but he never complains, even to close friends or family.
And there have been times of trauma. His first wife, Valerie, was killed in a plane crash in 1978. (Kantor is now married to Heidi Schulman, a former NBC news correspondent.) His elder son, Russell, died in a car crash in 1982, when he was 16. Soon after the death of his mother, in the late 1980's, his older sister, Sonia, was fatally injured when she fell and hit her head. This summer, two days after he concluded labor and environmental agreements with Canada and Mexico, Kantor was hurt in a freak accident. Out on a hotel rooftop to watch a fireworks display, he fell down an unmarked air shaft. He has had to wear a back brace since and will not be able to run again until next month.
Sports were important when he was growing up in Nashville. He, two brothers and his sister called their grandfather, Isadore, the Commissioner. Isadore Kantor lived with the family for many years. By day, he presided over the backyard baseball league at their two-story suburban home. At night, he regaled his grandchildren with stories of life as a bookbinder, union activist and Socialist in Brooklyn. Mickey's first exposure to current events came from his grandfather's political arguments with his father, Henry, who owned a furniture store across an alley from the Grand Ole Opry. "The big fight in the family," he recalls, "was between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party."
Mickey was an indifferent student. At Vanderbilt University, he played varsity baseball and seldom studied for his undergraduate major in business and economics. "In school, he was interested in nothing but athletics and girls," his father says with a sigh. The big change came during law school at Georgetown, after a stint as a Navy supply officer, when he met and married Valerie Woods, a fellow student who made him study every night while she fixed dinner.
Kantor's early support for workers was reinforced when he went to work in Florida. As a lawyer for the Office of Legal Services, he spent two years defending destitute migrant workers. After working on George McGovern's Presidential campaign in 1972, he moved to California and worked on Alan Cranston's successful run for the Senate in 1974. He then joined Manatt, Phelps. The change in legal clients, he says, was motivated partly by financial need and partly by a desire to have a job that allowed him to set his own hours and work on various political and civic causes.
During his 17 years in Los Angeles as a lawyer and corporate lobbyist, he worked on three more unsuccessful Democratic Presidential campaigns. In the Carter Administration, he served on the Legal Services board and met Hillary Clinton. He became a regular visitor to the Governor's Mansion in Little Rock in the 1980's and was one of the first people to join the Bill Clinton campaign in 1991.
As campaign chairman, Kantor showed the same tendency to steamroller friends and foes that he now exhibits in the trade office. His conduct in scheduling the campaign debates with President Bush helped solidify his reputation as the man nobody wanted for a colleague. At the three-day bargaining meetings, Kantor repeatedly threatened to walk out if the Republican team did not meet his demands, reminding them at every turn that President Bush was trailing by as many as 17 points in the polls. Near the end of the sessions, Kantor was pugnacious even toward Jack Quinn, a fellow Democratic negotiator who is now chief of staff for Vice President Al Gore.
"We were getting close to a deal," recalls a participant in the negotiating sessions. "Kantor was holding out on one point, and Jack began to speak. He slammed his hand down on the table and said, 'Jack, not now. I mean it!' I thought it was a gratuitous thing to do, particularly to someone on your own side. I don't know of anyone after the negotiations who had any desire to spend time with Kantor."
Kantor says the outburst was necessary because he wanted to move to another subject before the Republican negotiators could rethink their decision to allow a town hall debate with questions by everyday Americans. As it turned out, Clinton looked comfortable chatting with the guests in this format. President Bush seemed wooden.
For a while after the election, it appeared unlikely that Kantor would have a role in the new Administration, much less the prominent place at the President's side that he expected. He won the trade slot on Christmas Eve, in the final batch of Cabinet appointments, after organizing a successful economic conference for the President-elect.
MICKEY KANTOR disdains labels for his trade policy. "I'm not a theologian and don't intend to be," he says. "I think my job is to be an advocate, coordinator, facilitator, spokesperson and negotiator but not a theologian -- I'm secular when it comes to trade."
In an Administration that seeks long-range solutions for the nation's economic problems, he has no vision of a national trade strategy and no plans to develop one. "I think visionary is an overblown term -- I'll do what the President asks me to do," he says.
He started his term as the nemesis of free traders and the darling of protectionists and advocates of managed trade. His strong criticisms of Japanese trade barriers endeared him to labor activists and members of Congress who have waited for years for a trade confrontation with Tokyo. But after the inconclusive Tokyo economic summit in July, Nafta became the main trade issue and Kantor emerged as one of its most prominent defenders. Free traders began warming to him. Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat who welcomed Kantor's tough stance toward Japan, became one of his most outspoken critics. She accused him of having been beguiled by corporate lobbyists.
Kantor's admirers in Congress and the Administration believe he has neither sold out nor served free trade but has found a middle ground. His detractors contend that he has lost an opportunity to put a fresh stamp on American trade policies that have changed little over the last two decades, despite widening trade deficits.
Kantor has been more willing to argue over policies than some of his colleagues in the Clinton Administration. But he has also been willing to subordinate his agency's interests for the sake of the Administration's efforts to pursue a coordinated economic strategy. His influence in developing Administration trade policy has gradually waned. This partly reflects his lack of interest in setting long-term goals and partly reflects President Clinton's creation of the National Economic Council, headed by Robert E. Rubin. Kantor's agency heads the Trade Policy Review Group, a secretive interagency committee that set the nation's trade agenda for many years. When Carla Hills was the Trade Representative, she used her agency's chairmanship of the group to dominate trade policy. But these days, the review group has been eclipsed by the National Economic Council.
The reduced status of the trade office has hurt Kantor's repeated efforts to help his allies in organized labor on small issues. He has sided with the United Automobile Workers, for example, in unsuccessful efforts to raise taxes on imported minivans -- by reclassifying them as trucks instead of cars, thereby raising the duty from 2.5 percent to 25 percent. He has also tried to block expanded trade privileges for Nissan's operations in Tennessee. Both times, he was defeated by shifting coalitions centered on Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who has tended to follow more traditional free trade policies. This has left Kantor, the old Democrat in a New Democrat Administration, trying with mixed success to keep his relations with labor leaders cordial on the big issues.
In the aftermath of the Nafta vote, as Kantor shifts his attention to world trade, he is trying to make peace with labor. The day after the House finally approved Nafta last month, Kantor arrived at the office at his usual hour, 7 A.M. He called officials in Australia and New Zealand to discuss beef and dairy issues pending in the GATT talks. He was cheerful but uncharacteristically calm, already focused on GATT issues. As always, he was also thinking about domestic politics and his friends in organized labor. Mickey Kantor, new-old Democrat, remained, above all, a practical man of politics. He already had a mental list of union leaders to call. "They're my friends and they remained friends during this whole process. There were good conversations. We disagreed. But today's the day we begin to work together on other issues."

HEADLINE: Y(oung) A(mericans in) P(rague)

 BODY:
Is Prague to the Nineties what Paris was to the Twenties? The number of YAP's (the local acronym for Young Americans in Prague) is hard to calculate; estimates run from 4,000 to 30,000. But their presence in the pubs and clubs of this ancient brooding city has become a cultural phenomenon, one of the most visible aftershocks of the fall of Communism.
Like the American expatriates who once gathered in the cafes of the Left Bank, the YAP's have a creative bent; but it's not just the literary life they're after. For every aspiring writer drawn by the ghost of Kafka and the playwright President Vaclav Havel, there's a budding entrepreneur. Computer programmers and investment analysts crowd the Repre Klub, a popular American hangout, along with poets and screenwriters -- the Hemingways of our day. There's an American-style Laundromat (Laundry King) and an American rock band (Dope). John Bruce Shoemaker, a former journalist, has opened two bars -- the Thirsty Dog and the Martini Bar -- in a turn-of-the-century building in the historic Municipal House, Obecni Dum. Jennifer Yeager runs a catering service and sells her wares to local bakeries and restaurants. "I'm a true capitalist," she explains. "I'll bake anything people want." Scott Rogers and Marketa Janku (American-born despite her Czech-sounding name) founded the Globe, an English-language bookstore and coffeehouse favored by expats. "It's just amazing all the things I've been able to do here," Janku says. "The opportunities are what really blew me away." 
 Not every YAP is a capitalist. Katie Michel, from Gladstone, N.J., works for a nonprofit organization that operates programs in English as a second language, AIDS awareness and journalism. What unites the bohemians and the business types, the poets and Peace Corps idealists is a conviction that history -- to paraphrase T. S. Eliot -- is now, in Prague.

GRAPHIC: Photos: CENTER OF ATTENTION -- As a seven-foot-tall black American, Henri Abrams, 24, stands out from the crowd. Originally from Suitland, Md., he came to Prague to keep in shape during the off-season of the Continental Basketball Association and is now the starting center for Sparta, a Czech basketball team. His biggest complaint is Czech food: "You can't live on McDonald's alone." (pg. 70); MAKING MUSIC -- Tracy Buckle, 23, from Chicago, and Sharla Benedict, 29, from Tallahassee, Fla., are the two members of Hunka-Hunka, an original "rock folk country blues funk lyrically based band." There's an official ban on performing in public without a license, "but if the police come by and we're in the middle of a song, they'll let us finish it and play one more before they make us stop," Buckle says. (pg. 71); THE LITERARY TRADITION -- Jeffrey Young, 25, from Savannah, Ga., and Alfredo Sanchez, 27, right, from Mexico and California, are two of the co-founders of the international literary journal Trafika. "Prague is a multicultural city," Young says. "Foreign literature influences Czech writers and Czech writers influence literature abroad. You can't get that in Savannah." WHERE THE MONEY IS -- Jason Shore, 26, below left, is an investment analyst for the Czech Ministry of Privatization, mediating between the Government and foreign investors. He likes the work, but complains that "the air is pretty rotten, especially for a Californian heading into his third winter here." FOR ART'S SAKE -- Jonathan Feldshuh, 29, below right, gave up his job writing software for a financial services company in New York to pursue his art in Prague. To make ends meet, he teaches English at the Czech Academy of Fine Arts. His biggest fan is his landlady, Eva Pospichalova. "She tends to like things that are recognizable," Feldshuh says, "like her garden." (pg. 72); OUT OF THE KITCHEN -- Lori Wyant, 26, left, from Lexington, Ky., was a founder of Ivana's Kitchen, a Mexican cafeteria that operates out of a Prague nightclub. Now she manages the Canadian-owned Jo's Bar and stars in "Prague 1," a 20-something television series about young Americans in Prague -- "where you can make a life style out of partying and not be looked on as a loser." SALOON TRADE -- Scott Otto, 31, below left, was in the corporate finance department of a New York accounting firm when he discovered his calling on a one-day trip to Prague. He's now the proprietor of the Sports Bar Praha, serving up hamburgers and fries to the hockey crowd: "It's a great feeling when the house is packed and people's thirsts are being quenched -- and not just by our beer." BRINGING UP BABY -- Linda, 30, and Brett Mermer, 28, below right, from San Francisco, were among the few American couples to have a baby in Prague. ("He was a lot bigger than most of the Czech babies," Linda Mermer says.) Married at the Church of Elvis in Las Vegas, they came to Prague with the idea of opening up a Polynesian bar.

HEADLINE: SUNDAY VIEW;
A Lincoln With an Agit-Prop Subtext

BYLINE: By Vincent Canby

 BODY:
As much as it recalls the early life of a monumental man, "Abe Lincoln in Illinois," Robert E. Sherwood's 1938 play now in gigantic revival at Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater, recalls the era in which it was written and the manner by which the Lincoln legend has been shaped. It also recalls the economics of a long-vanished Broadway theater that could support a cast of 49 actors in a play that hasn't a single production number, bare leg or specialty act.
That sort of prodigality is both instructive and entertaining in a show that evokes a lot of fascinating history, not all of it having to do with Honest Abe, the Rail-Splitter and Great Emancipator. 
 Yet this "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" is one of those theatrical experiences that are far more interesting to ponder afterward than to sit through while they are going on. It is long (nearly three and a half hours) and stately, rather like a diorama. At its best, it is endearingly naive, but it may remind you of the critic Edmund Wilson's bracingly churlish remark in "Patriotic Gore": "The cruelest thing that has happened to Lincoln since he was shot by Booth has been to fall into the hands of Carl Sandburg."
Sherwood's approach to his subject seems to depend heavily on "The Prairie Years" (1926), Sandburg's highly romantic, poeticized biography of the young Abe Lincoln as a humble backwoods prophet and savior. It's an approach that spoke directly to pre-World War II America's need to believe in the kind of benign father figure that Franklin Delano Roosevelt was fast becoming.
The depressed 1930's were a time of awful despair. They were also a time when hope was offered by militant left-wing politics and by the schemes of F.D.R.'s excitingly named, ever improvised New Deal, whose purpose was to implement the promise of the unofficial Roosevelt campaign song, "Happy Days Are Here Again."
Even Broadway responded to the fervor of the New Deal. In 1938, Sherwood, Maxwell Anderson, Sidney Howard, S. N. Behrman and Elmer Rice, mainstream writers all, who were impatient with the way the Theater Guild was handling their work, formed the Playwrights' Company. The spirit of collectivism seeped upward to spawn a commune of aristocrats.
The first Playwrights' Company production was Sherwood's passionately felt "Abe Lincoln in Illinois," which was as much about F.D.R. on the eve of World War II as it was about Lincoln facing his own call to greatness. After all, 1938 was the year of the Anschluss (when Hitler annexed Austria), of Munich and, finally, of the partition of Czechoslovakia. Possibly because of its agitprop subtext, the 1938 production was not only critically acclaimed, winning the Pulitzer among other prizes, but also hugely popular with the public.
Sherwood's Lincoln is something more than kissing kin to Sandburg's. He's a man whose life is forever changed by the untimely death of Ann Rutledge, and who, like Jesus, reluctantly sacrifices himself to greatness for the greater good.
In the Sandburg-Sherwood myths, Ann Rutledge (about whom little is really known) is a paragon of sweetness, too good to survive in this world. The fiercely ambitious Mary Todd is God's strange way of telling Abe when to git a move on, as if he had no ambitions of his own. William Herndon, who was Lincoln's law clerk and then partner in Springfield, is a firebrand abolitionist and a drunk, someone you might not think could live much beyond 30. In fact, Herndon died at the age of 73 in 1891, having written a book of memoirs that outraged the keepers of Lincoln's flame by suggesting that Lincoln was a good deal more sophisticated and neurotic than the accepted legends would allow.
Wilson's impatience was not necessarily with Sandburg's emphasis on myth (except when the myths came from Sandburg's own imagination), but with the manner by which this myth-making obscures the dark contradictions within -- and the true complexity of -- the real Lincoln. Sherwood's Lincoln is a grand variation on the figure that can be seen at Disney World where, in the Hall of Presidents, through the magic of Audio Animatronics, a mobile plastic Lincoln speaks a few words from the Lincoln canon.
The lavish Beaumont production, which makes as much use as possible of all available stage space and stage machinery, suggests a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical that once was lost but now is found, though without the score. Rodgers and Hammerstein do not come to mind by chance.
There are moments when John Lee Beatty's stunning sets, especially his big open-air New Salem, Ill., seen on a Fourth of July in the 1830's, recall the work of the regionalist painters who were supported by the New Deal's Federal Art Project. These painters had earlier inspired Lemuel Ayers's designs for "Oklahoma!" Mr. Beatty, too, is paying tribute to an earlier theatrical tradition.
As directed by Gerald Gutierrez, with Sam Waterston in the title role that defined the career of Raymond Massey, "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" is not, as you might think, an old-fashioned play, at least not in the sense that it is well made. It breaks all the rules governing the construction of well-made plays. It has no strong story line. Supporting characters aren't characterized; they are labeled and move on. It assumes that we already agree about Lincoln's place in history. Thus his greatness needn't be dramatized so much as illustrated in the series of loosely strung-
together vignettes that make up its 3 acts and 12 scenes.
The best of these: the starkly staged debate between Lincoln and Stephen A. Douglas (Brian Reddy), for which most of the words were supplied not by Sherwood but by Lincoln and Douglas.
THE PLAY ENDS WITH THE famous 1861 farewell speech to the people of Springfield, spoken from the rear platform of the train that is taking President-elect Lincoln to Washington and, as they say, into history. The concluding note of prophetic doom is made suitably rousing by the singing of "John Brown's Body" and by Mr. Beatty's final, spellbinding theatrical effect, the sort of thing you might see in a Radio City Music Hall pageant.
Mr. Waterston, who looks reasonably like Lincoln, survives these circumstances with a modesty that is becoming but is not strong enough to dominate Mr. Gutierrez's physical production. Lincoln himself was 6 feet 4, but even he might have had difficulty looming large amid all of the stage effects. Then, too, Sherwood's Lincoln is most often seen as a shy, diffident figure, whether dodging history's demands or trying to escape Mary Todd's lethal embrace.
Mr. Waterston is very fine in isolated moments when he's allowed to play something other than Lincoln's impending martyrdom, that is, when he can find Lincoln's eccentric strength. Early on, there's a brief, enlivening moment when Mr. Waterston seems on the point of doing a buck and wing as he tells a comic story. Later, in Sherwood's most improbable but theatrically effective scene, Mr. Waterston catches something of Lincoln's formidable passive-aggressiveness when he returns to Mary Todd, whom he had abandoned earlier, to present her with the stewardship of his fate.
The moment invites speculation. It is mysterious and tragic. It's real theater. The rest of the time, "Abe Lincoln in Illinois" demands agreement, if not total obedience. It says over and over, in one way and another: This is the gospel. Believe.
 
'All in the Timing'
 O.K., here's the drop-everything-and-go note of the week: "All in the Timing," six delirious one-act plays now at Primary Stages, written by David Ives, a wizardly playwright who is new to me. Four of the plays have been seen in New York earlier, but this is the first time they have been presented, so to speak, in their own evening. Though the pieces are called one-act plays, they are more like sketches for some hilarious, celestially conceived revue. The writing is not only very funny, it has the density of thought and precision of poetry.
Take, for example, "Words, Words, Words." Three actors appear as chimpanzees, caged in a Columbia University lab that has been furnished with a rubber-tire swing, bananas, desks and typewriters. They are the monkeys who, if left long enough in front of typewriters, will one day write "Hamlet." One problem: they don't know what "Hamlet" is. In a few priceless minutes, Mr. Ives demolishes, among other things, academe, writers' workshops, the jargon of criticism and all the reverential guff ever written and spoken about the creative process.
Or, "Philip Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread," in which four actors somehow manage to reduce a piece of Glass-like music to the rhythms and cadences of speech. Magical and funny. Or my favorite, "The Philadelphia," in which it's revealed that "inside what we know as reality there are these pockets, these black holes called 'Philadelphias.' "
Being in a "Philadelphia" is to be exiled to another space-time continuum without leaving the planet. You go about your daily life as usual, but nobody pays any attention. Druggists say they don't carry aspirin and never have. A request for pastrami at a deli prompts derisive laughter; coffee shops don't serve coffee. To survive a "Philadelphia," you have to learn to ask for the exact opposite of what you want, which leads to marvelous, mind-bending reversals of thought and language.
Mr. Ives would seem to be a master of language. He uses words for their meanings, sounds and associations, spinning conceits of a sort I've not heard or seen before. He's an original. Jason McConnell Buzas directed the flawless cast: Daniel Hagen, Wendy Lawless, Ted Neustadt, Nancy Opel and Robert Stanton. Spread the word. Or words.
 
'The Loman Family Picnic'
 You might also check out the Manhattan Theater Club's elegant production of "The Loman Family Picnic," written by Donald Margulies, directed by Lynne Meadow and designed (beautifully) by Santo Loquasto. The bitter comedy, which was presented as a work in progress at the M.T.C. in 1989, could be described as a triumph for a play badly made on purpose, being part grim portrait of a dysfunctional Coney Island family, circa 1965, and part musical comedy.
The family: Mom (Christine Baranski), Dad (Peter Friedman) and their sons, Stewie (Harry Barandes), who's about to be bar mitzvahed, and Mitchell (Jonathan Charles Kaplan), the imaginative younger brother. The setting is a ghastly new high-rise apartment that also is a parody of Jo Mielziner's classic set for "Death of a Salesman."
The play begins more or less as Real Life, though the ghost (Liz Larsen) of Mom's favorite aunt appears. Bored Mom simultaneously overprotects her husband and sons and underrates them. Dad is overworked and exhausted. Each son itches in his own way to break loose.
The second act is something quite other. It's largely given over to monologues and fantasies that function like blackout sketches, and to young Mitch's musical adaptation of "Death of a Salesman," with himself, his mother, father and brother delivering songs that are funny, bleak and full of Broadway razzmatazz. David Shire wrote the excellent score.
Don't ask me how it works but it does, at least much of the time. Mr. Margulies deconstructs the conventions of the family play without destroying the genre. What's most surprising and heartening is that his off-the-wall concept could find such generous support at the M.T.C. and in Ms. Meadow's staging. Plays like this usually wind up in the basket marked Outgoing.
All the performances are good, but Ms. Baranski is superb, whether nodding her head vacantly as she listens to Dad's complaints, or robustly belting out a number in which she tries to sum up Dad's ordinariness. He's a "second-rate man," she sings with enthusiasm, "an in-between man," and the audience laughs its approval.
We're a long way from Willy Loman territory, where our hearts ache as Willy's gallant, threadbare wife cries out that attention must be paid.

 BODY:

Renting in Rome
 
Q. My husband and I would like to rent a one-bedroom apartment, studio or room in Rome for 10 days next February. Can you help us with the names of renting agents? -- Katherine Callahan, Prattsville, N.Y. 

A. There are a number of options available. One is to write to the Ente Provinciale del Turismo in Rome and ask for a copy of Alberghi in Roma (Hotels in Rome), which lists hotels, pensions and residences, with prices. Most residences are apartments with kitchens. The rooms are cleaned daily, and linens are changed twice a week. Prices vary, depending mainly on location. To receive the hotel guide, write to the Ente Provinciale del Turismo, c/o Signora Cinelli, Via Parigi 11, 00185 Rome; the telephone number, dialed in Italy, is (06) 488991, fax (06) 4819316.
Another option is to contact a rental agency like IDEC S.r.L., Via Angelo Poliziano 27, 00184 Rome; (06) 70454455 or (06) 704544074. (The first number accepts faxes after 5:30 P.M. Rome time and on weekends.) The agency has 20 apartments around Rome, ranging from about $215 a week for a studio and $920 a week for a spacious one-bedroom apartment near the Trevi Fountain. There is a one-week minimum stay, and everything is included except phone charges. The agency needs to know the date and time of arrival so arrangements for keys can be made.
Another possibility is the Residence al Velabro, Via del Velabro 16, 00186 Rome; (06) 6793450, fax (06) 6793790. The apartments are spacious, with a cooking area, answering machine and daily cleaning service. The price is about $150 a day.
If having a landlord who speaks English is important there is the Mallia Residence, Via Damiano Chiesa 8, 00136 Rome; (06) 301981, fax (06) 30198603. It is situated in a garden in a quiet neighborhood called Balduina, normally about a 25-minute ride by bus or taxi to the Vatican; if traffic is congested, however, the trip can take twice as long.<heart> The apartments have a large living room and one or two bedrooms and a kitchenette. There is a pool, gym and tennis court.
The smaller apartments cost about $105 a day, which includes cleaning, linens and heat, plus 9 percent tax. If one rents by the week, it is cheaper (about $430 plus tax for one week, $675 plus tax for two weeks).
 
Opera in Milan
 
Q. I have searched without success for a tour operator offering an escorted itinerary that would include attending an opera at La Scala in Milan. Can you help me? -- Mary Raftery, Brookline, Mass.
 
A. If you are interested only in attending an opera in Milan, it is doubtful that you will find a tour operator to help you. But if you have the time and money for a more extensive tour, there are several operators that include a visit to La Scala in a package of other cities. La Scala is one of the most difficult opera houses for a traveler to attend, mainly because of its large subscription list and the fact that available tickets do not go on sale very far in advance. Ordering by mail is sometimes possible and sometimes not, depending on the performance. At the box office, tickets are limited to two to a person.
Travelers on their own should plan a trip that will allow a stay of at least three or four days in Milan during La Scala's recently extended season, December to July, and take a chance on getting tickets at the box office or from a hotel concierge for an opera that one would like with a cast also to one's liking.
Among tour operators likely to have tours going to Milan are Dailey-Thorpe Travel, 330 West 58th Street, Suite 610, New York, N.Y. 10019, (212) 307-1555 or (800) 998-4677; Great Performance Tours, 1 Lincoln Plaza, Suite 32V, New York, N.Y. 10023, (212) 580-1400, and International Curtain Call, 3313 Patricia Avenue, Los Angeles, Calif. 90064, (310) 204-4934.
Dailey-Thorpe usually has three or four different escorted itineraries a year that include a stop in Milan. One tour, Deluxe European Capitals, is scheduled from March 13 to 26 and will go to Paris, London and Milan, where the group will see "Don Pasquale" by Donizetti and "Maometto II" by Rossini. The exact price has not been set, but a spokesman said most tours ran about $500 a day for one person in double occupancy and include economy air fare from New York, deluxe hotel accommodations and all meals.
Another Dailey-Thrope tour, Springtime in Italy, is scheduled from April 19 to May 1. It will go to Milan (for "Don Pasquale" and a ballet), Turin, Genoa, Florence and Venice. A third, as yet untitled tour is planned for July 13 to 25, and will go to Munich, Milan (for "Eugene Onegin" by Tchaikovsky) and Verona.
Great Performance Tours is planning a tour to northern Italy from April 28 to May 7 or 8. It will visit Milan, but participants will see a ballet rather than an opera, a spokesman said. Other cities on the itinerary are expected to be Bologna, Turin and either Florence or Rome.
Another tour is planned in July, and it too will take in a ballet in Milan, but there will be operas in Verona and probably Venice.
The approximate price of each tour will be $4,000 a person in double occupancy, including air fare from New York.
International Curtain Call offers deluxe, escorted tours to some of the music festivals in Europe as well as regular-season performances at various opera houses. Two tours planned next year will include Milan. Spring in Italy from May 20 to June 4 will offer "Rigoletto" by Verdi and "Elektra" by Richard Strauss, a choral concert with La Scala Philharmonic and possibly a ballet, all in Milan, a spokesman said.
Other cities on that tour will be Turin (for "L'Elisir d'Amore" by Donizetti), Florence (for "Salome" by Richard Strauss, the Verdi Requiem conducted by Zubin Mehta and a concert by the Oslo Philharmonic, all at the Maggio Musicale festival) and Venice (for "L'Orfeo" by Monteverdi). The price is expected to be between $4,200 to $4,500 plus $750 to $800 for air fare from the East Coast.
 
Staying in the Cotswolds
 
Q. I am interested in staying two weeks in a cottage in the Cotswolds in England next summer. I do not want to drive but want to be within walking distance of public transportation. Can you suggest places to write to? -- Richard F. Atnally, Wayne, N.J.
 
A. A list of a dozen agencies that rent out cottages in the Cotswolds is available from the Heart of England Tourist Board, Larkhill Road, Worcester, England WR5 2EF; (905) 763436, fax (905) 763450.
Another organization that has rentals close to public transportation is National Trust Holiday Cottages, Post Office Box 536, Melksham, Wiltshire, England SN12 8EA; (225) 705676, fax (225) 706209.
Both groups will send their brochures without charge, but a fee of $1.25 to cover postage is requested by National Trust Holiday Cottages. International postal coupons or a personal check are acceptable.

The Man Who Mocks Talk Shows Inherits One

BYLINE: By ANDY MEISLER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
As the host of "Talk Soup," a daily cable program that samples confessional talk shows, Greg Kinnear has won a reputation as a deadpan satirist and perhaps the world's leading expert on bizarre on-screen behavior. But what is there in his background that persuaded NBC to choose him as the new host of "Later," the 1:30 A.M. show in which one-on-one conversation is everything?
Mr. Kinnear, at his table in a Sunset Boulevard hamburger restaurant, answers the question with a question: "Does the name Hart Bochner mean anything to you?" 
 From 1987 to 1990, he explains, when his on-air job consisted of introducing movie trailers on the now-defunct Movietime cable channel, he occasionally talked to real-life actors on his set -- which was located in a converted porno-film studio.
"Maybe once a month," he continues, "the talent booker would coax some foolish celebrity to come into the dark cavernous hell that was Movietime. I remember when we got Bochner. It was a huge deal! The building was in an uproar. Hart Bochner came by! And we did this little interview, and I'll never forget the horror in his eyes as he got into the studio and began really looking around."
Of such encounters, particularly in the irony-friendly Letterman era, is talk-show stardom created. To hire Mr. Kinnear, NBC had to top offers from the likes of Fox television and Disney. In the past six months the "heat" around Mr. Kinnear, as industry insiders say, has been intense.
"Greg is extremely telegenic," says NBC president Warren Littlefield. "He comes off as someone you want to spend time with."
Mr. Littlefield is a fan of "Talk Soup," a half-hour program run six times each day by E! Entertainment Television. In this, he has something in common with many other entertainment executives. "Talk Soup" collects particularly grotesque and outrageous segments from daytime talk shows like "Donahue," "Vicki" and "Ricki." The segments are pithily introduced and, afterwards, snappily summed up by Mr. Kinnear ("They're currently unemployed and living off the government," he said, updating a clip of a porno actress who appeared with her husband on "The Jane Whitney Show." "Who says that the system doesn't work?"). Often, after a particularly ridiculous excerpt, he simply stares dumbfounded into the camera. "Sometimes," says Mr. Kinnear, "even I can't believe what I'm seeing."
Mr. Kinnear's own life story probably wouldn't get him onto "Geraldo" as a guest, but it is certainly out of the ordinary. Born in Indiana, he moved to Washington at age 10 when his father went to work for the State Department. The family was posted to Beirut, where civil war broke out eight months later, and the Kinnears were evacuated to Athens. Mr. Kinnear spent his high school years in Greece; his only exposure to American television, he says, were once-a-week reruns of "Dallas" and "The Muppet Show."
Movietime provided him with his first television work, but in 1990, the channel was purchased by a consortium of companies including Time Warner. The new management renamed the network E! and promptly fired all of the hosts, including Mr. Kinnear.
In 1991, E! decided they wanted Mr. Kinnear after all, and he began "Talk Soup" on a shoestring. Mr. Kinnear says: "The first acknowledgment I had that anyone in the industry was watching was about a year ago. I got a call from my agent saying that Rob Reiner was a big fan of the show and wanted to talk to me. I nearly fell out of my chair."
The talks with Mr. Reiner were not fruitful. But other producers and networks waved offers at him, including Fox, which had to fill the time slot recently vacated by the infamous "Chevy Chase Show."
"I was a little nervous about that spot," Mr. Kinnear says. "I think anybody who tries to go in there after what happened will have a tough time. It's like building condominiums on an ancient Indian burial ground or something. I wanted something a little more low key for my first talk show."
Mr. Kinnear says that when he takes over "Later" next month from Bob Costas, who wanted to move on, the show will start to include short skits and comedy performances. So that he can continue to appear on "Talk Soup," "Later" is relocating from New York to Los Angeles. Mr. Kinnear insists, however, that one-on-one interviews will remain the backbone of "Later." "The show will live or die by them," he says. "If I can't do them, if I can't pull them off, if I can't draw another person out of their shell, if I can't develop a good rapport with random people, four nights a week -- well, pretty much, this ship is sunk."
He is, he says, looking forward to the challenge. "Hillary Clinton has already expressed strong interest," he says. "Mother Teresa won't stop calling me."

HEADLINE: Beneath Moscow, a Piece of Its Soul

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN; CHRISTOPHER S. WREN is a former foreign correspondent for The Times based in Moscow from 1973 to 1977. As editor of new projects, he supervises The Times's Russian-language edition.

 BODY:
THE turbulence afflicting Russia these days can disorient even a frequent traveler to Moscow. For one thing, you can't find Feliks Dzerzhinsky. The statue of the founder of the Soviet secret police was toppled by demonstrators against the failed coup in August 1991. His pedestal in Lub yanka Square is adorned now by a simple wood cross.
Once you could set your watch by the honor guard that goose-stepped to Lenin's tomb on the hour. The ritual has been canceled. And what about all those statues and other monuments paying public homage to Lenin and his Bolshevik cronies? They are vanishing even as the onion domes are being repainted on the old churches once closed under the Communists. Moscow's streets, whose names evoked a pantheon of Soviet heroes, have reverted to names that predate, and puzzle, the city's current inhabitants. But my favorite landmark has been left virtually untouched, and it's still affordable. The Moscow Metro, or subway system, survives as an island of rational continuity in the sea of economic and social upheaval. 
 I confess a fondness for subways, whose condition can reveal a great deal about a city to a traveler. I have sought out subway systems in Hong Kong, Montreal, London, Paris, Madrid, Lisbon and, not least, Boston and Washington, because they offer not merely rapid, cheap transport but also a chance to rub shoulders, quite literally, with the natives. Yet Moscow's Metro, short for Metropolitan, tops my list. During the four years I lived in Moscow as a foreign correspondent, I rode the Metro to visit Russian friends at a time when the K.G.B. labored to isolate Western journalists from our sources. In the Metro's underground passages, I discovered that the tails assigned by the K.G.B. to follow me were stocky middle-aged women with shopping bags. Today, the Russian Government doesn't seem to care where you go or whom you talk to.
On two trips to Moscow within the last 14 months, the Metro was my tunnel to those old memories. It assured me that a Moscow mired in commercial rapaciousness today no more reflects the Russian soul than did those fading three-quarters of a century under Communism.
Elsewhere in Moscow, I ran up against the kind of buccaneer capitalism that Karl Marx warned us about. I encountered it at the Metropol Hotel in June. My wife and I first stayed at the Metropol in 1967, back when you could still find a Russian willing to defend Marxism. Our double room at the Metropol was, I recall, cramped and dark, with two narrow beds, a grim reading light, a musty carpet and a view of what looked like a junkyard. We didn't complain. This was the Soviet Union, after all, and our room, I recall, cost about $35 a night with some meals and other perks thrown in.
When I checked into the Metropol again in June, the room they assigned me looked as small and gloomy as the other had 26 years earlier. True, the bathroom was new and my window framed the same junkyard from a slightly different angle. But I found myself again with narrow beds, a dim reading light, a drab carpet. The biggest change, beyond the refurbished lobby, was that the Metropol now cost $310 a night. I never paid so much for a hotel in my life, not even in overpriced cities like Tokyo or Riyadh. I shouldn't grumble since the Metropol favored me with its corporate rate. I eavesdropped on another arriving foreigner who timidly inquired about the price of his room. The clerk announced that his rate was $370 a night, which is more than most Russians could hope to earn in a month.
And meals were extra. Breakfast at the Metropol cost $22, though the buffet included fresh omelets and a harpist in attendance. My bill for three days' worth of laundry -- mundane shirts, underwear and socks -- ran $45. And the Metropol is not Moscow's priciest hotel; others like the Savoy and Penta can charge more.
In the old days, the Soviet regime segregated tourists for ideological motives, lest our bourgeois decadence derail the happy march of the Russian people toward Communism. With Marxism looking as dead as Lenin in his air-conditioned mausoleum, exorbitant prices now constrict the foreign visitor in a dollar cocoon.
When I lived in Moscow, Russians trafficking in American dollars risked being sent to a Siberian labor camp. Today, everybody does it. In fact, the dollar has replaced the ruble as Moscow's commercial currency. Taxi drivers ignore their ruble meters and the shortest ride can cost a foreigner $10. Before climbing into one taxi, I proposed paying in rubles. The driver took umbrage and went in search of a more malleable tourist.
That may be why I greet the Metro as an old friend. It still accepts only rubles, though the handsome brass tokens have been replaced by flimsy yellow plastic disks. And it still works when so much of Moscow does not. An electronic clock on the platform tells you precisely when the last train left. The wait between trains, once 90 seconds at rush hour, can stretch now to three minutes, not bad for a society in collapse. Each station and the next get announced over a public address system that is, yes, actually comprehensible.
It may be a cheap shot to compare the clean, safe Metro with New York's grimy, menacing subways. Moscow has 120 stations radiating out from a central ring, compared with 469 stations scattered across New York. The Metro closes from 12:30 A.M. to 6 A.M. for cleaning and repairs, while the subway runs around the clock. And the Metro has fewer decades to show its age, having opened in 1935 compared to 1904 in New York.
Yet the difference runs deeper. Muscovites, for all the disillusionment bred by Communism's collapse, display a proprietary pride in their Metro. Musicians, hawkers and beggars encroach on its subterranean approaches (though one of the best jazz combos I've heard in Russia performs nightly at the Metro's entrance off Red Square). But inside, panhandling, littering and graffiti seem not to happen because riders would not tolerate it. Seats are still reserved for elderly, disabled or pregnant passengers in every car.
Riding the Metro during rush hour a year ago, I found a middle-aged Russian glaring at me. I wondered whether he was xenophobic but, no, he pointed sternly to the floor under my seat, where some inconsequential receipt had fallen from my pocket. I dutifully picked up the paper and he nodded approval.
The art inside the Metro has survived the ideology that produced it. Perhaps the finest Stalinist architecture was built underground as Metro stations, sometimes with ornate chandeliers.
The official tourism agency Intourist used to market the Metro as evidence of the superiority of socialism. It dispatched tourists to marvel at bronze statues of workers, peasants and soldiers at the Revolution Square station, stained glass at Novoslobodskaya, mosaics at the Kiev station, and ceiling murals at Mayakovsky station. Today, these constitute poignant artifacts of that idealistic, savage epoch.
IN taking visitors for a ride but not ripping them off, the Metro still offers Moscow's best bargain. The Metro costs Russians more but not foreigners, thanks to the falling ruble.
When I visited Moscow five years ago, a ride cost only 5 kopeks, or about 7 cents at the prevailing official ruble rate of $1.45. Last June, I found the fare at 6 rubles; by October, inflation had pushed it up to 30 rubles. But with the ruble scraping around 1,200 to the dollar, this still works out to 2 and a half cents. A visitor can ride the Metro 50 times for the cost of a single trip -- $1.25 -- on the New York City subway.
Much of the old Moscow I do not miss, not the pretense and pomposity of a bankrupt ideology and certainly not Feliks Dzer zhinsky's statue. But the link between the old and the new that was severed elsewhere can be observed on the Metro. If you want to know what Moscow is really like, pass up the $22 breakfast at the Metropol and, for a fraction of the price, treat yourself to a ride on the Metro. Unlike most of what Moscow offers these days, it's an experience you can afford.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK'S FUTURE;
Waterfront Vision

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We write in response to Herbert Muschamp's essay "Fear, Hope and the Changing of the Guard" [Nov. 14]. While we share his hope that architecture and design will "play a more substantial role" in urban affairs, we believe his criticism of the city's new waterfront zoning is not well informed. 
 As members of the City Planning Commission, our charter mandate is to plan for the orderly growth and development of the city. We provide the basic framework within which other design professionals can work. Toward that end, and based on the Comprehensive Waterfront Plan prepared by the Department of City Planning, we adopted the city's first waterfront zoning regulations after an extensive public review process. This zoning text, as modified and approved by the City Council, will guide waterfront development for decades to come. Its vision for our shores enhances New York as a world city.
Most importantly, it establishes public access to our waterfront. It allows utmost flexibility for tomorrow's businesses and industries, and therefore challenges developers, architects, designers and investors to shape these areas. They now have the opportunity to recreate our city's edge.
Having created the rules and established the basic building envelopes for future development, we take pride in the commendation of The New York Times's lead editorial of Oct. 4, which hailed our work as an "ambitious step" that could make an "invaluable contribution" toward reclaiming the city's edge.
In our municipal democracy, criticism is necessary and appropriate. Informed criticism, however, is what is most valuable.

HEADLINE: School Integration: Summing Up the Case;
For the State: Legislature Has Met Constitutional Test

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

 BODY:
ON Thursday in Rockville Superior Court, Judge Harry Hammer will hear the final summations in the lawsuit known as Sheff v. O'Neill, which is seeking to overcome the segregation of poor Hispanic and black children in Hartford's schools by linking the schools with those in 21 surrounding towns.
The suit seeks to improve the education of Hartford children by breaking up the concentration of minority students in the city's schools, where the enrollment is more than 93 percent Hispanic and black, and by obtaining more state aid to overcome the educational obstacles posed by poverty. Judge Hammer, who heard opening arguments in the case on Dec. 16, 1992, is expected to issue his decision in the spring. After nearly three months of testimony earlier this year, each side has summarized their arguments in briefs submitted to Judge Hammer. 
 The state was defended by the office of Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, led by Assistant Attorneys General John R. Whelan and Martha M. Watts, and assisted by Alfred A. Lindseth, an Atlanta lawyer who has represented local governments in school desegregation cases. Here are excerpts from their post-trial brief.
 In the course of the proceedings, the one central issue on which the plaintiffs' case turns appears to have receded into the background: Have the defendants violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights? After all the educational and social theories have been debated, and after all the data has been analyzed, the answer to this question is clearly NO.
The principal constitutional provision on which the plaintiffs' claims rest is Article Eight, Section 1, of the Connecticut Constitution. That section provides: "There shall always be free public elementary and secondary schools in the state. The general assembly shall implement this principal by appropriate legislation."
First, the constitution directs the General Assembly to implement the principle that "[t]here shall always be free public elementary and secondary schools in the state." Without a doubt, the General Assembly has done this. It has established a comprehensive system of free public elementary and secondary education. The General Assembly has continuously concerned itself with the challenges and obstacles of offering a first rate educational system, including the challenges and obstacles of racial and ethnic concentration in urban areas and of the consequences which poverty has on education.
Second, the state has provided a fair and comprehensive system for funding its educational programs, which provides extra resources for cities like Hartford and which has passed constitutional muster.
Pursuant to the state's funding system, Hartford received 2.8 times more state aid per pupil in 1991-92 than its suburbs received.
Third, the state has helped cities like Hartford develop and fund special programs specifically designed to address the special educational needs of Hartford students which stem from problems such as poverty, health care, housing, and exposure to drug abuse. There is no reliable evidence that most Hartford students would perform better in suburban schools, which lack many of these programs.
Fourth, the state has never segregated any students or school systems by race, and there is no allegation in this case that the state has ever done so. Nor do the plaintiffs allege that the state has done anything to create the housing, transportation, or employment patterns which have caused the demographic shifts over the years and have resulted in the present racial, ethnic and socioeconomic complexion of the Hartford area.
Fifth, not only has Connecticut never advanced or supported segregation, the state has promoted racial and ethnic diversity in its schools.
Plainly, the state has done all, and more, than the constitution requires it to do. The plaintiffs have not proven that the state has violated their constitutional rights.
The plaintiffs cannot prevail unless the court accepts the strained and unprecedented interpretation of the state constitution that the plaintiffs advance. Under their theory, the existence of certain conditions, such as the racial, ethnic and socioeconomic patterns alleged here, even though not caused, and indeed combatted by the state, themselves constitute a violation of the constitution.
The evidence in this case shows that the problems faced by children in Hartford, like the children in urban centers throughout the nation, are the product of complex social and economic conditions. Children bring to school the problems of poverty, health care, housing, crime and drugs. Only the General Assembly has the constitutional authority to address those underlying problems and the educational challenges that flow from them.
As little as the plaintiffs have offered to suggest a standard for racial and ethnic balance, they have offered even less to establish that there is a standard of socioeconomic balance that must be read into the constitution.
Witnesses for the plaintiffs who are intimately familiar with the socioeconomic composition of the Hartford student body testified that they could not say how much of a reduction in the concentration of poor children in Hartford schools was necessary nor could they identify a specific point at which the concentration of poor students crosses the line from acceptable to unacceptable.
How best to serve children attending our public schools who are afflicted by poverty is one of the most important and complex issues being studied, debated and dealt with by educational experts, teachers, cities and states throughout the country.
The plaintiffs' implicit, if not overt, suggestion that achievement standards be read into the constitution is probably the most specious of all their legal claims.
The defendants share the plaintiffs' desire that all children perform at the highest possible level regardless of their background or the conditions which they bring to school with them. The defendants also share the plaintiffs' desire that all children reach the highest possible level of achievement in an environment that exposes them to the diversity of the people of our state.
The defendants do not, however, share the plaintiffs' assumption that a court can successfully order these ideals into place. Not only do the courts lack the legal authority to determine how to pursue these objectives because the defendants have not violated the constitution, the courts lack the breadth of power needed to determine and implement effective approaches to the many obstacles that interfere with educational achievement and the opportunity to be exposed to children of different backgrounds.
The real question presented by this case is what branch of government makes these decisions? The simple answer is that it cannot be the courts because the courts can never act on the broad social policy which need to be addressed. Only the General Assembly has the broad perspective and broad power needed to balance the many competing considerations and direct a comprehensive attack on the social problems that interfere with the ability of children throughout the state to take full advantage of the educational opportunities they are being offered.
In requiring the state to offer a system of free public elementary and secondary education, the constitution imposes no specific methods or standards that must be met, nor does it prescribe any particular course of conduct for dealing with the broad range of challenges and problems involved in educating the children of this state. Unless the discretion that must constantly be exercised by state and local officials - from the General Assembly to the classroom teacher - violates the constitution and thereby makes injunctive relief appropriate, the plaintiffs may not use the court to review and change these decisions.
The court should recognize the plaintiffs' case for what it is - a request by a small group of individuals for a writ of mandamus that would dramatically intrude upon the broad discretion which must be exercised by the General Assembly, the State Board of Education, the Commissioner of Education, 22 cities, towns and school districts in the Hartford area, and the citizens of this state through their elected representatives. No court has the authority to grant the kind of relief the plaintiffs are seeking under the facts of this case.

HEADLINE: ART;
The Tidy World of a New England Printmaker in Old Lyme

BYLINE: By VIVIEN RAYNOR

 BODY:
This week's action takes place at the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme and at the Lyman Allyn Museum in New London.
Once in a while, the Griswold undertakes a show proving that there is, too, life after American Impressionism. In the early 1980's, the example chosen was Thomas Willoughby Nason, a printmaker and, seemingly, the embodiment of New England values. Except in a television re-creation, where would an artist be found today who seriously wore three-piece tweed suits, smoked a pipe and kept a gun rack in his studio, a spaniel at his heels? 
 Nason is now back at the museum in force, thanks to recent acquisitions, including a gift from his niece, Janet Eltinge, and what might be called the tender loving care of Charles Price, professor emeritus of art history at Connecticut College. Professor Price, who cut an impressive figure earlier this year with "This Wondrous World," a show of children's book illustrations at the Lyman Allyn Museum, has done it again with "Thomas W. Nason: New England Virtues Aged in Wood."
It is a selection of Nason's prints -- mostly wood engravings -- interspersed with occasional contributions from contemporaries like Stow Wengenroth, Louis Lozowick and Asa Cheffetz. Accompanying the show is a catalogue set not in the ubiquitous sans-serif but, rather, in the dignified New Baskerville typeface and illustrated by prints and photographs.
In a sense, the production, -- which is as compact and well organized as the artist's life seems to have been, -- files him away in the slightly musty archives of printmaking as it used to be. Outside of "The Cove," a woodcut measuring 10 inches by 13 1/4 inches, "Maine Islands," a 7- by 22-inch engraving, and a few drawings of comparable size, there is nothing much larger than a postcard, nothing in color -- bar the prints with tonal values enhanced by tinted blocks -- and, above all, nothing the least bit experimental. Nason was the compleat Regionalist, as innocent of Cubism as he was of Surrealism, and in the heyday of Stuart Davis and the Precisionists, he belonged to no scene.
Indeed, as Professor Price tells the story, this clergyman's son appears not to have strayed far from his background -- he grew up on a farm near Lowell, Mass. Although Nason did not have a college education, he became a secretary to a successful Boston lawyer, Albert Burrage, and through him met his wife-to-be, Margaret Warren. It was also while working for Burrage that he became interested in art and began collecting prints, especially those by the 19th-century English masters, which may account for the whiff of Thomas Bewick that can be sensed in his work. As an autodidact, he conducted his studies mainly in the print department of Goodspeed's Bookstore, showing his early efforts to its director, Louis Holman.
After serving in the Army during World War I, Nason returned to Boston to settle, with Margaret, on River Street, in what passed for Bohemia. In 1931, Mr. Burrage died, leaving his secretary unemployed but free to concentrate on the art for which he had received some recognition, including first prize at a National Arts Club show in Manhattan. Life cannot have been too bad, for the two were able to buy land in Lyme and, with the help of architect friends, were living in their own house by 1938.
Despite the bleakness of the time, Nason received many commissions, notably those for illustrations to books of Robert Frost's poetry, as well as for editions of "Walden Pond" and "Poems by William Cullen Bryant," which were both bought out by the Limited Editions Club. The honorary Master of Arts degree bestowed on him by Tufts College in 1945 marked the peak of the artist's career and also the beginning of its denouement. As Professor Price points out, there was some room for Precisionism in the postwar era but none for Regionalism. "The consequence for an art as quiet and restrained as Nason's was almost total eclipse," he writes. Only now is it emerging from the penumbra.
The latest work in the show is a wood engraving of the Griswold commissioned by the Lyme Historical Society in 1962. There are no examples of the paintings he produced in later years, when his eyesight was failing. But then, neither are there signs of decline, although the artist had his off moments. In some of the early wood engravings he seems to have had trouble disengaging his burin from a groove, hence perhaps the ridge along the edge of the cloud bank in "Windswept" (1925). And in other images like "Summer Clouds" (1934), his predilections of different textures becomes obsessive. Generally he is at his best in chiaroscuro wood engravings like "Summer Storm" (1940), a rolling landscape with rain falling from clouds. This print is an example of the softening effect conferred by tinted blocks. He can also stop the eye with his studies of farm buildings, which, though close to Precisionism, reveal something like sensuality in the handling of solid form. But the animals and birds beloved of Bewick are absent from Nason's images, figures are few and far between. His was a tidy world seldom disturbed by bad weather but always infused by melancholy. This essay in perfectionism remains on view through Jan. 16.
Though billed as sculpture, the contents of the invitational at Lyman Allyn are, with few exceptions, crafts items. Rather than "Reflections of the Inner Light," the title should be "Reflections of Virtuosity." Nevertheless, some works are more sculptural than others, beginning with Gabriel Warren's relief that seems to be in the process of exfoliating its surface components. These are concave sheets of metal, probably aluminum, that are laid on in a kind of brick course with strips of contrasting metals instead of mortar.
Other examples are "Sanctuary" and "Spine," by Pat Smith. The first lies on the floor, a "hollow square" of white porcelain strips hedged by four short beams of raw wood; the second, a relief, consists of 36 porcelain "vertebrae" running down a background composed of eight slate rectangles. Robert Taplin commemorates Primo Levi with "Suicide," an open-sided bronze structure on legs that suggests an oven but contains three people seated at a meal. Ralph Bucci draws inspiration from prehistoric stoneworks but produces relatively small, smoothly modeled forms in clay.
Prizes for sheer complexity should go to Carol Kreeger Davidson and Jim Visconti, the first for sheets of bronze curled into roughly figural shapes or cut into strips and woven like baskets; the second for raku-fired porcelains that have the look of Torahs. Niki Ketchman has developed a reputation for sculptures that are tangles of black wires and valances of stiffened ropes. But the examples here take color from the company they are keeping. All in all, this is a case of inventiveness galore but precious little soul. The display remains on view through Jan. 2.

HEADLINE: School Integration: Summing Up the Case;
For the Plaintiffs: At Issue, Lack of an Equal Education

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON

 BODY:
ON Thursday in Rockville Superior Court, Judge Harry Hammer will hear the final summations in the lawsuit known as Sheff v. O'Neill, which is seeking to overcome the segregation of poor Hispanic and black children in Hartford's schools by linking the schools with those in 21 surrounding towns.
The suit seeks to improve the education of Hartford children by breaking up the concentration of minority students in the city's schools, where the enrollment is more than 93 percent Hispanic and black, and by obtaining more state aid to overcome the educational obstacles posed by poverty. Judge Hammer, who heard opening arguments in the case on Dec. 16, 1992, is expected to issue his decision in the spring. After nearly three months of testimony earlier this year, each side has summarized their arguments in briefs submitted to Judge Hammer. 
 The lawsuit was filed in 1989 on behalf of Milo Sheff, now a 14-year-old Hartford student, and 16 other children by a legal team including John Brittain, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law; Wesley W. Horton, whose Horton v. Meskill lawsuit in the 1970's led to more state aid for urban schools, and lawyers from the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and Education Fund. Here are excerpts from their post-trial brief.
 What is at stake in this case is the nature of the fundamental right that the Connecticut Constitution protects in insuring all children an education. Plaintiffs contend that it is the right to receive not just any education, but an equal education, a quality education and an education unencumbered by racial, ethnic or economic isolation. Plaintiffs have demonstrated through admissions, trial testimony, and the state's own documents: 1. that the educational system in Hartford and the surrounding suburbs is segregated on the basis of race, ethnicity and economic status; 2. that it fails to provide the equal educational opportunity to which each and every student in Connecticut is entitled; and 3. that it fails to provide Hartford students a minimally adequate education. The defendants have not attempted to deny the underlying facts. They cannot. As Governor Weicker candidly admitted in his State of the State message on Jan. 6, 1993:
"The racial and economic isolation in Connecticut's school system is indisputable. Whether this segregation came about through the chance of historical boundaries or economic forces beyond the control of the state or whether it came about through private decisions or in spite of the best educational efforts of the state, what matters is that it is here and must be dealt with."
The defendants nevertheless repeat the same legal argument that this court has twice rejected: that the court lacks the power to address the inequities and inadequacies in the public schools. Despite a strong constitutional mandate and this Court's prior rulings, defendants contend that this "court has never before injected itself into the process of addressing social and educational problems in this way." They protest that there are "no clear cut solutions." Stripped of its verbiage, the defendants' answer to the unconstitutional conditions in the schools is that either they are not able to, or they are not required to, address this situation. But solutions do exist for the pressing educational problems of Hartford, and this Court has the institutional responsibility to insure that these conditions are eliminated.
The daily reality faced by many Hartford children is one of poverty-concentrated classes in racially isolated schools with inadequate resources, substandard achievement levels, and gross educational disparities relative to suburban school districts. Even for high achieving students, the system's inequities have harmful effects; for the average child, the consequences can be devastating.
The educational environment of students in Hartford cannot be divorced from the social circumstances in which Hartford children find themselves. As they pass through the schoolhouse gates, they bring with them the overwhelming burdens of poverty and other socioeconomic factors which place them at risk and cause them to "start the race behind the starting line."
It is axiomatic that poor urban children deserve the same educational opportunities as middle-class suburban children. Each child is precious, and each is an important resource for our future. It is a profound responsibility of the public schools to help children overcome the disadvantages of poverty and achieve to their potential.
The significance of plaintiffs' evidence on the concentration of poverty in the Hartford schools is, first, as defendants have officially stated, "those who need more must receive more." However, in reality, poor children in Hartford actually are receiving less. Second, the concentration of poverty in the Hartford schools places an untenable responsibility on Hartford schools, teachers and administrators which they cannot meet given current funding and levels of resources. Third, the high concentration of poor students adversely affects educational outcomes for all students. Finally, the high concentration of poverty in the schools is closely linked to extreme racial segregation in the schools, which heightens the detrimental impacts of poverty concentration on Black and Latino students.
The Hartford School District is compelled to use a substantial portion of its limited funds to hire staff to address the special needs of Hartford's students, rather than in the traditional parts of the educational program.
In the past two to three years, the deficiencies of the Hartford school system have been exacerbated by budget cutbacks. In the 1992-93 school year, over 100 staff positions were cut, including 40 teachers, and a wide range of support positions, including nurses and other health staff, social workers and psychologists, administrators, and custodians. In the same year, over one million dollars in non-staff budgetary cuts were made, including reductions in planned maintenance expenditures, after-school programs, athletics, and textbook acquisition. Similar, but less severe cuts, were made in 1990 and 1991.
If, as plaintiffs contend, the state is under an affirmative obligation to provide equal educational opportunity to school children in Hartford, then it is abundantly clear from the evidence that the defendants have failed to act in a manner sufficient to meet the constitutional mandate.
Under the Connecticut Constitution, the importance of public education -- as a personal right, and as an affirmative state obligation -- is securely established, for it is "a fundamental right." Together, Article First and Article Eighth have been construed to impose an affirmative duty on the state to provide a substantially equal educational opportunity to every school child. It is the scope of this duty which separates the parties in this case.
Because the harm that would flow from the absence of any injunctive relief is immense, the court must grant plaintiffs more than merely a declaratory judgment. In Hartford alone, there are almost 26,000 children in a racially and economically isolated school system which is failng to provide an adequate education or opportunities equal to that of other children in this state. As plaintiffs' witnesses at trial indicated, "something very dulling happens to them when they stay in a negative environment, where lack of expectation gets lower and lower every year. They just don't grow, they don't blossom." As the detailed historical treatment of this issue has so repeatedly demonstrated, while the state has continued to talk, it has consistently failed to back its words with any significant action. This Court is a means of last resort to translate words into action.
As outlined below, any plan for the Hartford region must include the following seven components:
1. The remedial plan must be interdistrict in its design.
2. The plan must include mandatory and voluntary provisions.
3. Reduction of racial isolation and poverty concentration must be a major goal.
4. Bilingual education programs must be preserved.
5. Educational enhancements must supplement any desegregation goals.
6. Housing and other components must be addressed in the plan.
7. Timetables must be strictly enforced.
Decades of delay and neglect by state authorities have deprived the plaintiff children of their fundamental right to an equal educational opportunity. The continued concentration of the poorest students in the most racially isolated school district with the worst academic performance in the state creates a compelling and urgent need for this court to act. The time for judicial intervention is long overdue.

HEADLINE: Shopping for Ideas

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
ON a gray afternoon earlier this month, a 23-year-old graduate student left the Rutherford, N.J., offices of the Academic Research Group, carrying a large white envelope.
"I have a 30-page term paper that's due," she said. "They sent me a catalogue and they had all the core information in one paper." 
 She had just gone shopping in the supermarket of ideas. At this season, as semester's end nears and research-company advertisements beckon from the pages of campus newspapers and magazines like Details and Rolling Stone, it is a time-honored ritual.
The student, who said she was in a graduate program at a local university, declined to give her name for fear that her professor would learn of her visit. She said she planned to use the $125 report on business in China that she had bought to augment her own research; indeed, research companies maintain that such reports are intended simply for reference and study. But many educators say the reports are little more than off-the-rack term papers created and sold for the convenience of beleaguered students.
The Academic Research Group occupies the basement level of a modest two-story brick office building in Rutherford. A small white sign on a window bears the name of the company; the blinds are drawn.
Founded in 1972, the concern, like many research companies, offers a wide range of services, including speech writing and preparing grant applications. It also offers a catalogue of about 20,000 research reports on a wide range of topics, like "The Role of Money in Inflation" and "Cosmic Imagery in 'Antony and Cleopatra,' " at $6.95 a page. In addition, the company offers custom reports, prepared to the client's specifications by a stable of anonymous freelance writers, starting at $28 a page.
Just what do students get for their money? A selection of Academic Research Group reports bought by The New York Times came in prose styles ranging from the shallow to the sophisticated. Consider report No. 26004, "The Amy Fisher Case." Dotted with small lapses in grammar and spelling -- the name Buttafuoco is rendered as Buttafucco throughout -- the 17-page account of the notorious crime uses such memorable phrases as "a de-ranged adolescent mind."
At the other end of the stylistic spectrum is No. 8183, "The Scarlet Letter," whose baroque syntax would hold its own at any Modern Language Association meeting: "Thus, viewed in a strictly moralistic context, 'The Scarlet Letter' provides less commentary on the nature of moral transgression or social indiscretion, depending upon one's own point of view, than upon the grimly nonmoralistic interpretation of an offense or act like Hester's as a psychologically traumatizing experience for participant or, even, unobservant bystander."
Whatever their style, the reports are not meant to be submitted as course work, the research firms say. "We have taken every step we can to make sure it is not an issue," said Diane M. Shaw, president of the Academic Research Group. "If you've read our literature, you've seen it's replete with references to the fact that if we know that's what's happening, we don't do it."
Laws in some states, including New York and New Jersey, prohibit the sale of papers to be submitted to meet course or degree requirements. Academic Research Group clients are asked to sign a disclaimer stating that they do not intend to submit their purchases to an academic institution. Catalogue reports are stamped on each page with the notation, "Prepared by The Academic Research Group Inc. For research and reference use only."
But still there's nothing to stop a determined student from recopying a report and handing it in, conceded Bart Lowe, owner of Research Assistance, a Los Angeles company. "Nothing more than stops them from going to the library and copying out of a book or copying out of Time magazine," he said. "If someone's inclined to cheat, they're going to do it. However, I would say with my clientele, that's pretty much of a rarity."
 CRITICS in the higher-education community say that students' use of research companies continues to grow. "The problem has been mushrooming for the past two decades," said Sheldon E. Steinbach, general counsel to the American Council on Education in Washington. "And now with the advent of fax and other methods of rapid transmittal, I'm sure that although not quantifiable, it could be reaching epidemic proportions."
The graduate student who was writing about China said that although the Academic Research catalogue lacked an up-to-date report on the specific topic of her paper, she bought an 18-page report titled "The Outlook for Sales and Direct Investment in China."
"It tells me all about China," she said. "I'll have to make a lot of changes, but it gives me their economy. It gives me everything that's going on."
To her, the report was worth the money. "It'll save me six or eight hours in the library," she said.
Prepared reports like this tend to appeal to both the best and the worst students on campus, said Gary Pavela, the director of judicial programs at the University of Maryland and an authority on academic ethics.
"The very best students have a drive for perfectionism that might impel them to hand in professional writing that would earn them an A," he said. "The student who has become disconnected from academic work panics at the end and tries to have someone else do the whole thing."
In Rutherford, several students said they wouldn't just buy a report and turn it in verbatim. "That's not right," said one student, 19, who dropped by the Academic Research office to pick up a catalogue. Dressed in a black sweatshirt, he said he was a criminal-justice major at a local college. He said he was looking for background material for a six- to eight-page paper on suicide.
"It brings me down every time I'm in there," he said of a course he is taking, on death and grief. "So I just don't want to spend that much time thinking about it."

HEADLINE: Lawsuits and Lawyering

 BODY:
Connecticut residents should be disappointed by John Williams's admission that he settles or wins only approximately half of his numerous police-misconduct lawsuit ("Relishing the Risks and Rewards of the Law," Nov. 7). With approximately a 31-month backlog for tort cases in our state courts and a 20-month backlog in Federal courts, it is astonishing to realize that a lawyer may file civil suits that have no more chance of winning than could be predicted by the flip of a coin. We must suspect that our judicial system is hopelessly capricious if plaintiff attorneys cannot distinguish lawsuits that have the intrinsic merit to be successful from those that have only the potential to tie up our courts for extended periods of time.
Whether Mr. Williams's record is typical for plaintiff attorneys in Connecticut is difficult to determine because the statistical branch of the Supreme Court of Connecticut does not compile data on whether plaintiff attorneys are winning or losing civil cases. It is noted by the Connecticut lawyer James Rosenblum, however, in his book "Malpractice Solutions" that fewer than 30 percent of suits alleging medical malpractice are ultimately successful. He reports that only approximately 25 percent of cases that go the full distance to a jury verdict are won by the plaintiff attorney. 
 For plaintiffs with legitimate complaints who are likely to win monetary damages, the lengthy wait for justice is not acceptable. For the numerous defendants who will eventually be vindicated, the system is unreasonably punitive. There is clearly a need for a comprehensive evaluation of the efficiency and the fairness of our system of judging liability.
Mr. Williams's practice of economically isolating police officers by suing them directly rather than the municipalities they work for deserves our condemnation. A town or an insurance agency can afford the ten's of thousands of dollars required to completely defend against a protracted lawsuit. A modestly paid public employee, however, may have to settle the most unworthy of lawsuits simply because he or she cannot financially afford justice.
While Mr. Williams finds trial law to be "a great deal of fun," there is a more sobering side to the story. As a doctor, I have treated a number of individuals, including police officers, who have found themselves as defendants in tort lawsuits. Frequently these patients experience anxiety and depression for years following the suit. They often express despair that they and their families have been subjected to public humiliation based on what they perceive to be exaggerations, half-truths and factually incorrect charges in the lawsuit. In some cases the successful defense of the lawsuit leaves the families of the defendants bankrupt.
All Connecticut citizens, including police officers, should suffer the penalties imposed by the civil and criminal court system if they are actually guilty of committing irresponsible acts. It is difficult to believe, however, that our founding fathers intended our courts to be a place where large numbers of defendants, would be psychologically and financially savaged prior to being found innocent by a jury. Social responsibility dictates that our publicly financed courts not be used to bully citizens who are innocent of wrongdoing.
It would be appropriate to have a judicial review of all unsuccessful civil lawsuits to be sure that every factual charge in the case was supported by the evidence, that the case was competently litigated and that there was a reasonable chance at the outset that the case would be successful. Attorneys who abuse the system should lose their courtroom privileges and should pay the legal expanses of the defendants.

HEADLINE: Foreign Aid Leaves Nicaragua in a Bind

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Public cynicism about foreign aid is fueled when the press quotes "experts" who argue more aid is good, less, bad ("A Foreign Aid of Words, Not Cash," Week in Review, Dec. 5). 
 Your suggestion that a drop in aid may increase political instability in Central America is ironic, for nowhere has our aid been used more effectively to thwart the popular will by underwriting military repression.
Since the 1980's, the United States has conditioned aid to the region on the adoption of draconian economic policies designed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. These "structural adjustment" measures have opened Central American economies wider to Northern commercial interests while undercutting the poor, small producers, devastating the environment and effectively denying citizens a voice.
In Nicaragua, three years of adjustment have left the economy moribund and the population in a desperate state. Led by the U.S. Treasury, the international community has rejected Managua's request for support for a new economic program emanating from a national dialogue. With foreign reserves running out, Managua is having to accept aid on terms it knows will only wreak more havoc and make it more dependent on foreign aid.

HEADLINE: 'Squeegee' Crackdown Displays Insensitivity

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As the screenwriter and executive producer of "The Saint of Fort Washington," now playing in New York City, I read with amazement the policy of the incoming Commissioner of Police, William Bratton, to "attack the largest crime problems by focusing first on the smallest," namely "to order a crackdown on 'squeegees,' the men and women who wipe the windshields of motorists waiting in traffic" (news article, Dec. 4). 
 In my movie, Danny Glover and Matt Dillon work hard as two of these homeless New Yorkers who try to earn enough money to rent an apartment by washing windshields with their squeegees. When I researched the movie years ago in New York, there was still some compassion about the plight of these homeless people and their struggle to gain an economic footing.
But Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani and his new Police Commissioner have the opposite point of view. To them these people wielding squeegees are common criminals and must be incarcerated. What a sorry commentary. Is all of New York City about to fall down the rabbit hole? I suggest the mayor-elect and police commissioner-to-be see my movie before taking office.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
As Gunfire Gets Closer, Fear Comes Home

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
FANS of evolution, people who find that silver thread of adaptive progress in the darkest, most random events, might just as well focus on one particular passenger in last week's Long Island commuter train carnage who took out his cellular phone and tenderly approached the coherent among the bleeding gunshot victims waiting aboard the train for trauma aid. "Who can I call for you? Give me a number?" the man pleaded.
Good: Fight the national rage of 9-millimeter technology with electronic highway technology. Do something. Don't just wallow there in the mortal phenomena. Cling to the appearances of reasonableness, even as our latest gunman did. "Reasons for this" the stalker had thoughtfully jotted down beforehand in a pocket list of aggravations that seemed the usual welter of paranoid precision. At the end he punctiliously added: "In case of emergency, call. . ." and gave his phone number back in New York City where he lived alone and stoked his rage, preparing an emergency, indeed, for strangers not to be spared his sense of grievance. 
 The victims all are most precious losses, as with all this year's thousands across the national toll of violence by criminals and the criminally insane -- a working-class father and son shot side by side, an exemplary young immigrant lawyer taken from her husband, a little girl's doting father bestilled amid his new commuting routine. The pistol slayings stirred another national sensation that prompted the Clinton Administration to float another gun-control proposal, but the local politics of the issue remain as contrary as ever with each fresh shooting spree. This time the suburban venue was the key to freshening the news value of more gun deaths: the idea of innocent lives and hopes being smashed open amid a most vulnerable, lulling means of passage, a commuter train on its soporific nightly trundle back from high-risk urban America.
At the news, the rest of us took up our familiar spectator roles. How quickly the radio call-in shows adjusted, some people actually taking the topical bait and discussing "bias crime," as if a meticulous list of ethnic and institutional complaints should be taken literally. Driving back from the shooting scene, you could hear the usual mix of queries ("How could this. . .etc.?") and vicarious righteousness ("It's time that we. . .etc."). But mainly there was a sense of media poultice, of the surrounding innocents, wounded by fresh horrific news, needing to restore that chimera, the belief we can respond effectively to abnormality.
At the wheel came easy notions of menace ingrained. Menace? Well, look at the squeegee guys at the red light. Do they know they're being officially targeted by the new city administration, counter-menaced in a way by the rest of us who don't much like being hustled by the threat of filthy beggar rags and brigands' leers across life's hermetic windshield?
"Disorder is a precursor of serious crime," says George L. Kelling, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University who has been studying squeegee beggars, as if they were urban fauna in the latest documentary on evolution. "More and more there is a demand to do something about this sense of disorder in the streets," the professor says, championing the current "broken window" thesis of New York City's Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani, which holds that if small incursions are tolerated, larger felonies are sure to follow.
So, a micro approach. The squeegee pests are to be arrested for their menace now, even as they are studied like antibodies in society's petrie-dish researches against crime. Who knows? Amid the urban anomie beyond the windshield, not so far away now from the commuter mayhem, the thesis seems no less fruitless than gun control. At a red light, a squeegee man named Matt begs to differ with the broken-window thesis. He says the real key to keeping life these days is in guessing precisely which ones among those of us who jut and mouth out from the general throng of angry Americans just might be armed for emphasis. "I mean, we got kids in this city packing 9-millimeter pistols, and the city ought to be figuring out how to stop them from moving on to assault rifles, am I right?" asks Matt, a man after Jules Feiffer's heart.
Feiffer long ago exhausted the satirical arts, in words and pictures and theater, of alerting the nation to its unspeakable criminal violence. Reality has outraced him, most awfully, lately, in instances of small-town and suburban kidnap-murders of children across the country that underline growing community frustration at violent crime's reach beyond the cities. In the St. Louis region, the bodies of two little girls have police hunting another serial killer -- modern America's haunting crime figure in real life, in entertainment movies and in popular docudrama pastiches of both. The statistics of violent crime may be dropping slightly, but the poignant detail of fresh depradations can stun the nation. In one of the Missouri murders, the young victim's parents had taken the precaution of giving her a personal alarm, a device that was found wailing and abandoned on the street.
Amid the high volume of murders, it seems to take lethal intrusion into previously secure situations, such as the suburban commuter routine or small-town home life, to heighten demands for remedy. This was the case with one horrendous California tragedy this fall, the kidnapping at knife-point of a 12-year-old girl from a slumber party. She turned up murdered, lost to life in Petaluma, a small town used for staging Ronald Reagan's now classic "Morning in America" commercials.
Thus can grisly incongruity grow, along with the toll. As it proceeds, the latest detailed news of random violence, whatever it will be (and it will), seems of value mainly for scraps of mercy amid the crimson woe. "They must have been asleep," says one commuter eyewitness in a gentle depiction of the three men she saw slumped in the blood- and tissue-smeared train.
The gunman, identified as Colin Ferguson, a 35-year-old immigrant from the island of Jamaica, had ridden out from the city, with a swath of angry institutional and ethnic grievances jotted on notes in his pocket, to stalk commuters as they neared Garden City.
While the public is plunged deeper into this grisly evidence of the prevalence and risks of gun play, legislators remain most wary of the political risks of gun control. The latest incremental idea to be talked about by the Clinton Administration, picked up from Mayor-elect Giuliani, is to somehow license the nation's legions of gun owners and make them prove their proficiency. There undoubtedly will be another burst of proposals at the next particularly noticeable volley of violent crime.
"I had strange thoughts the whole time," says a commuter who fled down the aisle. "Half of it didn't seem real. When it dawned on me it was really going on, this guy shooting -- pop, pop, pop -- I thought: 'Here it's only a minute before my stop. I was so close to freedom. Why couldn't this guy have done this a minute later?' " With such candor did the survivor describe not so much the surprise of the event but the familiar sense of removal he craved and normally has when the latest twist of violence comes down. Another passenger lost these critical bearings after he was shot and still wondered if this could be true. Before the pain swept him, the traveler remembers thinking: "This is a story in a newspaper like any other day. This is a sick story."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Is a Diplomacy of Dollars Really Enough?

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SHORTLY after the Clinton Administration took office, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told a gathering of American, Japanese and European businessmen that he saw himself as the America Desk officer at the State Department and that his top priority was "American jobs."
At a recent White House briefing, Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown introduced Mr. Christopher by commenting that the country "finally has a Secretary of State" who believes one of his prime tasks is "to promote American business abroad." 
 After listening to Mr. Brown and Mr. Christopher, it was tempting to ask: Would the real Secretary of Commerce please stand up?
President Clinton has deliberately blurred the lines between these two on the grounds that the only way to enlarge the American economy today and create more jobs is by expanding foreign trade. And with no over-arching threat from the Soviet Union to preoccupy diplomats, opening markets is as valuable a task as any for a Secretary of State.
Actually, American foreign policy has always been a blend of economic, political and security concerns. To fight the cold war, the United States built both a political-security alliance, based on NATO and an economic alliance based on the Marshall Plan, foreign aid and global trading rules. These two orders were mutually reinforcing, but the security side always dominated alliance politics and American foreign policy.
The President's effort to radically change that balance has set off a debate as to whether the Administration has not forgotten that there is more to foreign policy than trade policy.
 
'Gone Overboard'
 "I think we have gone overboard in looking at the world through the question of: 'Is it going to create more jobs?' only" argued Morton I. Abramowitz, former Ambassador to Turkey and now president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "We may be inadvertently conveying in our rhetoric that all our problems are foreign economic problems and that people should not worry about Bulgaria or Albania or Russia, because they are not creating jobs. The danger is that you may actually be encouraging American insularity."
From another angle, Human Rights Watch, an American monitoring group, said in its annual report last week: "Rather than articulating a vision of human rights as an essential element of world order, the Clinton Administration has only cautiously embraced the cause, jettisoning human rights when the going gets rough."
President Clinton was driven to emphasize jobs diplomacy partly because of the economic realities of the post-cold war world and partly because of the ideological realities. He clearly realized early on that the collapse of the "Evil Empire" has deprived his Administration of the sort of compelling threat that could galvanize the American public and justify devoting resources for an active, broad-gauged foreign policy. He needed a new way to legitimize engagement abroad, and it had to be something that average Americans could feel as viscerally as they felt the Communist threat -- not some abstraction that could only be explained to them by a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. His answer, in part, was: "Jobs, jobs, jobs."
But maybe this is just the lazy man's post-cold war ideology. "Jobs" is a mantra, not a vision. It represents not a foreign policy doctrine but an intellectual vacuum. The Administration still has not explained what is the proper relationship between security and economics and human rights in specific situations, such as relations with China.
Critics of the President argue that an overemphasis on jobs and trade also can give a very unrealistic view of the world to the American public, because it explains only part of a complex world. Passion and ideology still frequently overwhelm economic interests. The Serbs are not shelling Sarajevo in a mad quest for more jobs; Israelis and Palestinians are not still killing each other because of differing interpretations of the GATT agreement.
Also, a purely trade-driven foreign policy risks dulling the senses of the American people. Americans have always been enlisted into foreign engagements by a spirit of moral crusade. American boys have never gone off to war chanting "G.N.P., G.N.P., G.N.P."
Many American ambassadors agree that they must put more emphasis on economics and trade -- and that the President is justified in some overstatement in order to jar the bureaucracy into thinking differently. Their complaint is that he has not backed his dollar diplomacy with dollars: The State Department's budget is scheduled to shrink by 20 percent in real terms over the next five years. Consulates, which are also export promotion centers, are being closed all over the world. The American Consul in Bilbao, Spain, in that country's industrial heartland, now has a budget of $50 a year to entertain Spanish businessmen -- enough for one good lunch (without wine). Vice President Gore's proposal for reinventing government includes a call to close American libraries overseas. "Businessmen and students use those libraries all the time to learn about our products and our culture; they're not just there to read 'Moby Dick,' " said one senior American diplomat in Europe. "I still have a huge military section and a huge C.I.A. section in my embassy. It is still a cold-war embassy. In terms of export promotion, I am not even in a position to deliver on the President's rhetoric."
Administration officials counter that over time all of this will change. They also argue that, despite some overstatements, Mr. Christopher is actually running a very balanced foreign policy -- stressing economics and the balance of trade in Asia, and classic diplomacy and the balance of power in the Middle East.
The importance of the end of the cold war, they say, is precisely that it allows American policy to adjust to each region. Too often in the past, they argue, countries like Japan exploited the State Department's obsession with forging security alliances and bamboozled Washington into playing down trade differences for fear of alienating Tokyo. Those days are over.
J. Brian Attwood, head of the Agency for International Development, argues that the Administration's stress on economics in foreign policy is intended not only for profit but for prevention. The cold war has left behind a collection of failed states, from Haiti to Somalia. Providing them with a means for sustainable development -- which is the core philosophy in Mr. Clinton's revamping of A.I.D. -- is not a soft-hearted humanitarian gesture "but a way of dealing with specific threats to our interests and to world stability," he said. That is the essence of preventive diplomacy.
Indeed, at this moment, economic levers may be far more effective tools with which to influence other countries' behavior, or bring rogue states back from the brink of aggression, than the traditional political and military ones, said Jeffrey E. Garten, Under Secretary for International Trade. Cargo-ship diplomacy can, he seemed to be saying, replace gunboat diplomacy.
"It isn't just a question of jobs, jobs, jobs," he said. "It is what levers does the United States have in the post-cold war world that mean something. I think that the military option means less and less, except in situations where real national security is at stake. It will mean nothing if the 82d Airborne flew over Indonesia. So what? But if A.T.& T. wires the whole country -- that is a significant amount of influence."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
North Korea's Game Looks a Lot Like Nuclear Blackmail

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
WHEN historians and intelligence analysts search for the roots of North Korea's drive for atomic weapons, they are usually drawn back to a moment 43 years ago, when the Truman Administration contemplated the quick and decisive way to end the Korean War: a nuclear attack on Pyongyang.
It never happened, of course, but North Korea's leaders to this day throw Gen. Douglas MacArthur's plan in the face of visitors as a symbol of American imperialist savagery. The power of the bomb, even as a threat, made an impression that four decades later is coming back to haunt the White House. 
 The country whose frenzied Stalinist rhetoric became a joke even among its Communist allies, whose moribund economy made Cuba look like an entrepreneurial powerhouse, has suddenly found the formula for dealing with America as an equal. At 81, Kim Il Sung, the world's longest serving national leader, is trying out his theory that nothing makes Washington take you seriously faster than a pile of plutonium.
And it's working. In the last few weeks hardly a day has passed without the President of the United States -- who was 4 years old when the "great leader" faced off against America the first time -- talking about the importance of a deal with one of the world's most isolated regimes. After decades of refusing to speak directly with the North, officials of the State Department and the National Security Council are dangling the kind of carrots Mr. Kim once fantasized about: promises of trade, economic aid, an end to the biggest American-South Korean military exercise, even diplomatic recognition.
Washington will talk about all this as soon as international inspectors are allowed back into seven buildings at the heart of the North's nuclear complex. Needless to say, if there ever was much evidence of a bomb project inside, by now it has been moved someplace else. And Mr. Kim has played his few cards superbly. "Just think how much Kim has accomplished in the past few months," a senior Japanese intelligence official mused. "America is paying attention to him. Everyone else in Asia is afraid of how the North Koreans may overreact to too much pressure." The North, he suggested, hasn't gotten this much attention since it crossed the Han River in 1950, wiping out Seoul.
Indeed, even today, 40 years after the signing of the armistice, North Korea's greatest leverage arises from the fear it engenders -- not so much because of its million-man army or its artillery within easy reach of Seoul, but rather because of the regime's reputation for unpredictability. This is, after all, the country that a few years ago was blowing up commercial airliners and planting bombs to wipe out the South Korean Cabinet. That weighs heavily on Washington's strategists. "There is a fine line between persuading North Korea to do what needs to be done, and provoking a terrible reaction," Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said recently in Seoul.
 
Wavering
 Clinton Administration officials bristle, of course, at any suggestion that their proposed concessions prove that nuclear blackmail works. But that is the subtext of the whole drama intensifying in Washington, Tokyo, Seoul and Pyongyang.
It may also explain why Mr. Clinton seems to be wavering so -- brandishing economic sanctions one day, then wondering aloud if they would work, then trying to cool down the rhetoric, then insisting again on full inspections. Clearly, having backed away from stated goals in Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti, he is under pressure to show that, in at least one area of key American interest, military power can still be converted into diplomatic influence. But is it really worth the risk for a bomb that may not exist?
For Mr. Kim, American analysts and military commanders assume that there is only one agenda item: To save his reeling regime from imminent economic collapse. No one seems to think he or his mysterious son, Kim Jong Il, can pull it off, but then again a year ago no one thought they would get this far.
In this strategy, stage one is obvious: Rip down the blockades to doing business with America and Japan, since Russia and China have lost virtually all interest in dealing with Mr. Kim's bankrupt Government.
Stage two gets a bit more dicey. North Korean officials described to visitors last year an image of their country somewhat akin to Vietnam -- a Communist regime seeking to maintain rigid social controls while marketing a disciplined, cheap work force and natural resources to moneyed neighbors. Right now, this hardly seems like Asia's greatest investment opportunity. But last week, along with the usual threats, the North turned out a remarkably detailed -- and in some ways quite liberal -- set of regulations for free-trade zones.
Mr. Kim knows two things: As soon as he reveals all his nuclear mysteries they are worthless as bargaining chips, and he has very little time to make this high-wire act work. The economic desperation is now so deep that North Korean propaganda last week finally dropped any pretense of hiding it. Meanwhile the man presented last year as a champion of reform, Kim Dal Yong, the state planning chief, was mysteriously deposed last week, presumably because whatever he was doing didn't work fast enough.
What all this means is that while Mr. Clinton has no good short-term options on nuclear inspection, the long-term strategy is simply to try to assure the world of a soft landing as North Korea collapses. That helps explain why Japan and South Korea are generally advocating timidity on the nuclear issue. The Japanese are shy of confrontation, and fearful of a flood of refugees or unrest within their own big North Korean community. The South fears being stuck with the bill for the North's collapse. But both recognize that the current situation cannot last; already the International Atomic Energy Agency is saying its cameras have failed from lack of maintenance, and it can no longer ensure that nuclear material is not being diverted to bombs. Soon that alone may drive the West to seek sanctions, and prudence will dictate a military buildup to guard against retaliation. "The place is going to implode or explode," Gen. Gary E. Luck, the commander of American forces in South Korea, said recently. "I hope it's an implosion. Because I don't think the world would like to see what an explosion looks like."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Amid Joblessness, The Joys of Tenure

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the halls of academia, only a few doctrines are as sacred as free trade. One of them, not surprisingly, is tenure, the almost ironclad guarantee of job security that most professors enjoy.
Curiously, many of the same arguments scholars make in favor of removing international trade barriers can also be used to make the case against their own lifetime job protection. 
 Like tariffs and quotas, tenure promotes inefficiency, inhibits competition and probably raises costs to consumers. Both systems are vestiges of a younger America. Trade protection was introduced to allow burgeoning American industries to grow solid roots; today, the arguments for it mostly involve salvaging jobs for unskilled workers. Similarly, tenure was instituted decades ago at a few elite universities to shield academic freedom; now a fixture on more than 90 percent of American campuses, it guards little more than the professors' paychecks.
Presumably, few of the 300 tenured professors of economics who signed a letter to President Clinton last summer supporting the North American Free Trade Agreement considered the connections.
But many politicians, especially those who opposed that trade agreement, spotted the link. Even some who favored Nafta resented what seemed to be the callous way many economists made their points. Like this argument: Sure, Nafta will cause hundreds of thousands of workers to lose their jobs, but even more jobs will be created. Or: The jobs that will be lost are low-skilled, low-wage jobs. We ought to concentrate on generating high-tech, well-paying jobs.
Here is how Representative David E. Bonior, a Democrat from Michigan, characterized such arguments in a passionate speech in the House in a losing cause the night Nafta was approved last month:
"The working people who stand against this treaty don't have degrees from Harvard. They don't study economic models. And most of them have never heard of Adam Smith. To them, Nafta isn't some economic theory. It's real life."
Some economist recognize the paradox. One is Jagdish Bhagwati, a tenured professor at Columbia who is one of this country's most prominent advocates of free trade but who is mindful of the pain expanded trade can cause some workers.
"Economists," Mr. Bhagwati said last week, "might not approach with such ferocity, without any understanding of the human cost involved, the view that flux and labor turnover promote economic efficiency if they themselves were subject to the same flux."
Few other Americans besides judges enjoy such lifetime contracts. According to the Department of Education, more than 60 percent of the nation's full-time faculty members enjoy tenure, and many who don't expect to earn it in the next few years. College teachers are on probation for five to seven years, after which they are dismissed or granted tenure. Once invested, professors can be let go only for serious misconduct or what their contracts generally call "financial exigencies."
The American Association of University Professors reports that in a typical year, 35 to 50 professors nationwide are discharged for offenses like plagiarism or sexual harassment. But professors are almost never let go for incompetence, and few if any are laid off for financial reasons, even though nearly every school in the country is cutting back in other ways.
 
Fossilization?
 The consequence, said Chester Finn, an Assistant Secretary of Education in the Reagan Administration who is now a tenured professor of education and public policy on leave from Vanderbilt University, "is the fossilization of any given department. You end up with people who haven't had an idea in 15 years. There is no room for energetic, fresh thinkers."
The provost of a large eastern university, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the tenure system made it practically impossible for him to make adjustments in the faculty when cost cuts were essential or when students' tastes changed. "Let's say, I wanted to substitute taped lectures for a particularly uninspired professor or reduce the size of the classics department and expand the department of Japanese studies," the provost said. "I simply could not do it."
Last year, Thomas Day, the president of San Diego State University, announced plans to dismiss more than 100 tenured professors and close nine academic departments to offset a cut in state financing. He was forced to back down after an uprising by faculty members. Afterward, he told The Los Angeles Times that the lesson he had learned was, "It's not your university; it's the faculty's university."
 
 
Academic Fashions
 Even the staunchest advocates of tenure concede that it is no longer necessary to protect professors' freedom to speak out politically. "If by academic freedom you mean that taking Marxist or fascist positions would be risky, that doesn't come up much any more," said Ernst Benjamin, general secretary of the American Association of University Professors. More of a problem, Mr. Benjamin said, are professors who antagonize their schools or communities by, say, flunking a football player. But he said the real importance of tenure was that it provided employment security against faculty overhauls every time fashions in education changed.
What Mr. Benjamin calls security others call rigidity. Robert Stevens, now in England as head of Pembroke College at Oxford, said that when he was president of Haverford College in Pennsylvania in the 1980's, a third of the faculty taught two-thirds of the students, largely because tenure tied administrators' hands.
But Mr. Stevens and many other academic administrators said alternatives to tenure might prove worse. At least, tenure involves a rigorous up-or-out probation period that, in theory at least, weeds out unacceptable faculty members before they get a lifetime appointment. Without it, inertia might lead to almost everyone's being retained. And financial saving from replacing expensive dead wood on faculties with a younger, lower-paid staff might be offset if professors demanded higher pay in exchange for loss of job security.
This is where tenure differs from trade protection. Eliminating trade barriers would no doubt make the economy more efficient. But as Milton Greenberg, the former provost of American University, observed, efficiency at universities can't be measured. "You don't get paid based on how much you are producing," he said.

HEADLINE: Job-Loss Anger: Age Bias Cases Soar in Region

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
At 57 years old and unemployed after 32 years with Merrill Lynch & Company, James Vincent Rooney has angry words for his former employer, the nation's largest brokerage concern.
"The thing that aggravates me the most is how happy they are to train the young people," he said in a telephone interview from his daughter's home in Pennsylvania. He moved there in November, a month after selling his Staten Island home to raise money, and 10 months after being abruptly dismissed from his $70,000-a-year position as a computer specialist at Merrill Lynch. His search for another job has proved so frustrating that he said he had given up. 
 One thing he has not given up on is the law: He is suing the brokerage firm for age discrimination.
 
Increasing Awareness
 Mr. Rooney is among a legion of displaced workers over 40 who, buttressed by a series of amendments to Federal equal opportunity laws over the last 25 years, are swiftly elevating age discrimination to a higher and more contentious level on the nation's legal, social and corporate agenda.
Lawyers, corporate executives and the older workers themselves say disputes over age discrimination have become far more frequent and have gained new urgency because of the economic slump and the restructuring of corporate America that has resulted in mass layoffs by hundreds of companies.
And while the economy is picking up, one abiding lesson of the recession is that many employers, seeking lower costs and increased productivity through computers and high technology, can get the work they need from a 25-year-old engineer or business school graduate rather than a company veteran and do so at a far lower salary.
"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize demographics are going to drive this issue," said Charles Fried, a law professor at Harvard University. Although age discrimination "has not caught the imagination of the academic world in the same way as race and sex discrimination, it is going to be the bread and butter of a lot of lawyers," he said.
 
Complaints Have Risen
 Since 1989, when economists say the nation sank into recession, the number of age discrimination complaints to the Federal Government has risen steadily each year.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Federal agency that investigates discrimination in the workplace, said it handled 19,884 of the complaints in the 1993 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, 32 percent more than in the 1989 fiscal year.
The region with the steepest increase in complaints has been the one with the nation's largest concentration of corporate employment -- New York City and its suburbs. The Federal agency said its age discrimination complaints in the city, on Long Island and in Westchester County more than doubled between 1989 and 1992, to 1,292, before falling back to 1,069 in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30.
"We are dealing with white-collar factories," said James L. Lee, the chief counsel for the New York office of the Federal agency.
He attributed the unusually sharp increase in cases at his office to the huge number of corporate job cuts in the region and to few displaced workers over 40 having the protection of labor unions and seniority rights that are commonplace in the manufacturing centers of the Middle West and elsewhere.
The wave of recent complaints and lawsuits stems in large part from changes in Federal law that have all but done away with the concept of "mandatory retirement" in the American workplace.
The principal law, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, was enacted in 1967. It made it illegal to arbitrarily dismiss workers from ages 40 to 65 on the basis of their age.
Amendments since then pushed the age-65 ceiling on the workplace protection higher -- to 70 in 1978. Then, in 1987, the ceiling itself was eliminated. Another change in 1991 eliminated a two-year statute of limitations on age discrimination lawsuits, giving broad channels of recourse to virtually all middle-aged and elderly workers.
People in only a handful of occupations are exempt from the Federal protections, including the police, tenured college professors and top-level corporate executives. And even those exemptions are being whittled away -- the law is to be extended to the police and professors on Dec. 31.
 
'Age Should Not Be a Factor'
 "The law recognizes that when you are in full command of your faculties and have something to offer, age should not be a factor in employment," said Todd Ryan-Millington of Ossining, in Westchester County, who may provide a model for the advocates of the rights of older workers.
Mrs. Ryan-Millington, 78, was dismissed in 1990 from her job as office manager in the Manhattan sales office of New Cherokee Corporation, a textile manufacturer. Not content to retire, she says she has "no intention of sitting down," complains that "the suburbs are boring" and is boning up on her French and German in the hope of starting a new career as a translater.
She has also won a judgment in her age discrimination complaint against her former employer. In November, after an investigation of her case and those of two other former New Cherokee workers over 40, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission threatened a Federal lawsuit, and the company agreed to pay Mrs. Ryan-Millington $99,000 in an out-of-court settlement.
Although Mrs. Ryan-Millington relied entirely on the Federal agency to act on her behalf, many other displaced older workers have turned to private lawyers, making age discrimination a growing area of the law.
"There is a deluge of cases," said Leonard N. Flamm, a Manhattan lawyer who has made age discrimination a specialty. And many of them involve class-action suits in which displaced workers join together as plaintiffs.
 
Class-Action Suits Favored
 Often, he said, the class-action cases are easier to pursue in court than those with only one plaintiff, particularly if the displaced workers can present statistical evidence showing that a single cutback or series of layoffs affected more people over 40 than younger workers.
That legal strategy is being employed by one of his clients, Sheila Rosen, a 60-year-old Manhattan resident who was dismissed in 1990 as a market research manager after 15 years with a division of the American Home Products Company.
She said she was dismissed abruptly, along with 100 colleagues who were over 40 years old, within weeks after the division was acquired by Reckitt and Colman, a British concern. Although layoffs were widespread, she said, only one of the division's employees who was older than 40 was offered a job by the new owner, while half of those younger than 40 were offered continued employment.
"The law was broken here, and I want to stand up and say, 'You can't do this to me,' " said Ms. Rosen, who has not found another job, and is hoping for a jury trial of her suit against Reckitt and Colman. The company, now based in Wayne, N.J., declined to comment on the case.
Among workers older than 40, Mr. Flamm said, awareness of the age discrimination has expanded.
"People are calling lawyers sooner, even before they are fired," he said. "Suing is no longer considered to be for wierdos. These people may never work again, so this could be their last hurrah."
 
A 'Lottery Ticket'?
 That sentiment, however, touches raw nerves among large employers and the lawyers who represent them. They maintain that the growing body of law against age discrimination has led to a flood of suits that are sometimes simply frivolous and more often resemble gambling bets by former employees who are driven by pride but have little legal rationale for their lawsuits.
For plaintiffs, "going to court is like buying a lottery ticket," said Felix Springer, a lawyer with Day, Berry & Howard, the largest law firm in Connecticut, who has represented many companies defending themselves in age discrimination cases. "It's a bit more expensive than the lottery, but your chances of hitting are somewhat better."
In many cases, he added, employers are entitled to dismiss workers who are over 40 for reasons that the workers themselves are not willing to acknowledge.
"It may not be at 45 or 65, but we all eventually slow down," he said. "People are often unwilling to look at themselves and say, 'I screwed up" or 'I've become inadequate.' "
Among employers, age discrimination may have become an even more intense area of debate and anxiety than among their employees.
"It is only in the last decade that this has showed up on companys' agendas, and now it's high on their agendas," said Ann Bartel, a business professor at Columbia University, who is a consultant to companies on how to avoid age discrimination.
Even if they have not been sued for age discrimination, few corporate executives are oblivious to the growing legal influence of older workers because of a string of charges against large employers.
The Equal Employment Opportunities Commission issued a finding on Nov. 23 that Sears, Roebuck & Company had illegally required its employees to waive all age discrimination claims as part of a voluntary early-retirement program.
In October a Federal court jury ordered the Long Island Lighting Company to pay $2 million in damages to a 57-year-old engineer it had dismissed in violation of age-discrimination laws.
Other companies that have been sued in major age discrimination cases this year include the Martin Marietta Astronautics Group, American Airlines, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation and Kidder, Peabody.
 
Mostly Defensive Measures
 Ms. Bartel said the precautions that corporations have taken against age discrimination suits have so far consisted largely of making sure that when layoffs occur, no more employees over 40 years old are dismissed than under 40 years old.
But she said few of the companies have expanded the programs to retrain and assist veteran workers in keeping their skills and productiveness on par with those of their younger colleagues.
"Companies are not being pro-active," she said, adding that they will need to become more aggressive in helping older workers. "It is going to become more incumbent upon companies to retrain," she said.
In the case of Mr. Rooney, who charges that Merrill Lynch failed to offer him retraining as an alternative to dismissal, the company said on Friday that it routinely provides retraining to its employees, and that Mr. Rooney was offered such programs many times in his 32 years, although not as an alternative on the day he was dismissed.
"He did not seek retraining and found himself unprepared to fill other functions as his responsibilities became obsolete and diversified," said Bill Clark, a company spokesman.
Mr. Rooney, however, said he was hoping to take his case before a Federal court jury within the next year.
In the meantime, he said, his 57 years are not only a major issue in his case against Merrill Lynch, but in his futile efforts to find another job.
"You go into an interview, they take one look at the gray hair and glasses, and that's it," he said.

HEADLINE: CHINESE DISSIDENT WARNED BY BEIJING

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 11

 BODY:
In China's first attempt to silence the country's most famous dissident since he was released last fall from a long prison term, Wei Jingsheng said the Public Security Bureau has told him that he cannot write articles for publication at home or abroad.
The warning was reportedly given to the 43-year-old Mr. Wei last week and was related to a piece Mr. Wei wrote for the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, which was highly critical of China's attitude toward democracy and human rights. The essay, which appeared on Nov. 18, was the first article Mr. Wei has written for any publication since he was released last September from 14 1/2 years in prison. 
 Mr. Wei reported the warning in a telephone call to The New York Times bureau in Beijing. Mr. Wei said public security officials told him that his essay in The Times was a violation of his parole and should not be repeated.
It was the first warning Mr. Wei has acknowledged receiving since his release. In the past, Mr. Wei has dismissed suggestions that the Chinese authorities would try to silence him after his release.
 
Holding Back for Now
 But over the last several days, Mr. Wei has said he seemed to have little choice but to heed the warning for now.
Attempts to reach a spokesman for the Public Security Bureau today were unsuccessful. Prohibition against publishing abroad had not previously been spelled out as a condition of Mr. Wei's probation, according to statements by Ministry of Justice officials.
Mr. Wei's article was written for The Times on the eve of President Clinton's meeting in Seattle with China's President, Jiang Zemin. It urged the United States not to let up pressure on China to improve its human rights record.
In his essay, Mr. Wei said China's present leaders were "the most outspoken group of men, shouting their support of human rights and democracy before they ascended to power."
"But their subsequent dictatorship made clear that they have no intention of making good on the promises they once made to the masses," he wrote.
 
China Faces More Criticism
 The apparent attempt by China to muzzle Mr. Wei, who was known during his years in prison as a man of unbendable will when it came to expressing his views, is sure to draw further criticism from human rights organizations and the Clinton Administration.
The State Department is preparing to give an interim report to Congress next month. Last May Mr. Clinton stated that he would not renew China's most favored nation trade privileges in June 1994 unless Beijing showed "significant, overall progress" on human rights.
Winston Lord, the State Department's assistant secretary for East Asia, said on Wednesday that China has "got to understand that movement is required or we're all going to be in trouble come next spring." He likened China's looming confrontation with Washington over human rights to a prospective "train wreck."
Speaking to State Department employees with uncharacteristic anger, Mr. Lord lashed out at recent remarks attributed to a White House official suggesting that President Clinton is so focused on expanding American business interests in China that "we're not going to let something like M.F.N. stand in our way."
 
Human Rights and the Economy
 Mr. Wei, in his essay, had attempted to join the debate over whether a strong American human rights policy aimed at ending repression in China was worth risking a break in relations.
He asked whether the American Government was "controlled by rich capitalists" whose "consciences never stopped them from making money."
He compared the Communist Party leadership to an "old wolf" that might talk about changing its nature, but in the end would follow its natural predatory instincts.

HEADLINE: New Forest Chief Faces Test Over Alaska Timber

BYLINE: By By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The new chief of the National Forest Service, facing his first major decision, is being pressed by conservationists to cancel a big timber sale in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska.
Jack Ward Thomas, who was appointed last month, must decide on Monday whether he will review the planned logging of a vast section of the Tongass forest on Prince of Wales Island in southeastern Alaska. 
 The sale of 267 million board feet of timber from 360,000 acres -- already approved by the regional office of the Forest Service -- is the largest disposal of public timber now planned in the national forests. Conservationists oppose it because they say the Forest Service has not taken into account the effects of the sale on wildlife.
Aside from the sheer size of the transaction, Mr. Thomas's decision is being closely watched by conservationists who have viewed his appointment as a signal that the agency is turning away from a long history of managing the forests mainly for the benefit of the timber industry. Many old-line forest managers in the agency had opposed his appointment, saying it would politicize the Forest Service. Mr. Thomas, a scientist with the agency, was a political appointee not promoted from the senior ranks of managers.
In a letter sent on Friday to Mr. Thomas, Representative George Miller, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources, urged him to review the Tongass sale. Mr. Miller's committee is investigating the service's compliance with the Tongass Timber Reform Act of 1990, which changed the way the forest is managed.
"I know that you share my concerns about abuses which have occurred in the management of our national forests," Mr. Miller wrote. "It would be most unfortunate if, at the very outset of your tenure as chief, the Tongass sale would proceed without adequate review and policy direction reflecting the views" of the Administration.
Two weeks ago, the agency's Alaska regional forest manager turned down an appeal by conservationists seeking to halt the latest sale of Tongass timber to the Ketchikan Pulp Company, one of two logging concerns that have 50-year contracts to cut in the forest.
The conservationists are now urging Mr. Thomas to take the matter up for review. Although a decision to review it would not necessarily mean he would ultimately reverse the regional forester, it would put him into conflict with the timber company, which under the contract is guaranteed a continuous supply of wood from the forest.
"In the course of the last four to five years, we have been short in excess of 100 million board feet," said Martin Pihl, general manager of the company. "The real situation is worse than that, because we have depleted inventories. Further delay will only aggravate the situation. It will cause down time and put people out of work."
Conservation groups contend that Ketchikan Pulp and the other company, the Alaska Pulp Corporation, are not living up to the intent of the contracts, which was to provide stable, year-round jobs at mills making a raw material known as dissolving pulp. The market for that product is saturated, and there have already been layoffs.
The conservation groups, organized in a coalition called the Alaska Rainforest Campaign, say the companies want to cut trees under the contracts, which subsidize the costs of wood, so that the timber can be used in sawmills, which are profitable but employ fewer people.
The coalition is pushing not just to halt the sale of timber on Prince of Wales Island -- it also wants the 50-year contracts canceled.
The issue goes to the heart of the debate over the way the Federal agency is managing the forests.
A Forest Service employee, Bill Shoaf, who led a team that reviewed forestry practices on Prince of Wales Island, has asserted that the agency is deliberately overstating the level of timber harvest that can be sustained there in compliance with forestry laws.
The Forest Service is still developing what it calls a "viable populations strategy" for the Tongass forest, and Mr. Shoaf's accusations question whether the agency is considering the tough questions objectively.

HEADLINE: Optimism Buoys GATT Talks Despite a Rift Over U.S. Trade Laws

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Trade talks among 116 countries have become increasingly mired in a dispute that pits the United States against most of the rest of the world over whether American trade laws should remain intact.
Despite the slow progress, however, the mood here remains one of near-certainty that some sort of global trade agreement will be concluded in the next several days. Most issues have been resolved, including the most contentious fights over farm subsidies, European computer tariffs and American apparel tariffs. 
 In one of the few remaining disputes, the current draft text for a new global trade agreement would restrict the ability of the United States to put steep tariffs on many low-priced imports that hurt American industries. The Administration, partly at the urging of the steel and computer chip industries, is seeking changes to limit or remove those restrictions.
Some American exporters and many economists dislike the American trade laws, because other countries are adopting similar laws, raising tariffs and restricting free trade. But American industries facing heavy foreign competition defend the laws, saying they are necessary to combat foreign cartels that keep prices and profits high in their markets while cutting prices to gain market share in the United States.
 
Resistance to Changes
 Asian and Latin American countries, led by Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Brazil and other increasingly competitive trading nations, resisted American requests today for 11 changes in the draft text. The changes are aimed at protecting the American trade laws that allow companies and labor unions to ask the Commerce Department to impose steep tariffs on imported goods that are sold in the United States either below cost or for less than they are sold in other countries, a practice known as dumping.
The question of what happens to American trade laws is a contentious one in Congress. Most Democrats are reluctant to change them, while Republicans are split on the issue. The anti-dumping issue is also becoming the most acrimonious here in Geneva.
Jeffrey Garten, the Undersecretary of Commerce for international trade and the top American official on the anti-dumping issue, said the United States was insisting that all 11 changes be made. "There seems to be a sense on the part of many delegations that we have put out a proposal with many elements for the sake of negotiating a smaller package, but that is a serious misreading of our intentions," he said.
In separate talks today, Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's top trade official, failed to reach a deal on movies, television programs and music recordings. They were expected to continue talking on Sunday.
 
European Pledges Sought
 The United States wants the Europeans to pledge that they will not limit the use of American programs and music or future technologies like satellite broadcasting to homes. The Administration also wants European countries to share with American companies a fee on blank video and audio cassettes, which can be used to make unauthorized copies. All these fees currently go to the European artists' companies.
The community has resisted restrictions on future technologies, and says it already pays full royalties for American entertainment even without the fees on blank cassettes.
Mr. Kantor also said in a statement that the United States was far from any deal on allowing banks and insurance companies to do business anywhere around the world.
The goal of all the negotiations here is a 116-country pact that would reduce tariffs and broaden the free-trade rules of the 45-year-old General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to cover agriculture, insurance and banking for the first time.
The issues still unresolved are disagreements over language rather than numbers, susceptible to being finessed through murky compromises.
The draft text could curb the anti-dumping laws and other American trade laws because it provides for binding international arbitration of trade disputes.
 
An Option for Review
 A country that lost an anti-dumping case in Washington could come to Geneva and ask a panel of trade experts to review the American action. If the panel ruled against the United States, and if three-quarters of GATT's member countries endorsed the ruling, then the Administration would have to cancel the anti-dumping tariff or allow another country to impose steep tariffs on American goods.
Some of these panels exist, but they have little power because GATT rules require that a panel ruling be endorsed unanimously, including endorsement by the country that lost the ruling. This rarely happens. The new requirement of a three-quarters or two-thirds vote would allow more panel rulings to go into effect.
The new rules make the panels very important. The panel's job is to decide whether each country has followed GATT rules. So, the United States is trying to insure that these rules more closely resemble American trade laws.

HEADLINE: Family Drifts Through Death To Escape Hardship in Cuba

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Desperate to escape a deteriorating economic situation in Cuba, Diosdado Reyes, his wife, 1-year-old son and 10 other members of his family ventured out in a 15-foot, motor-driven wooden boat he had built.
In the first hours at sea, a storm swamped the boat's motor and swept most of the scant provisions and fresh water overboard and left the group adrift. They moved with the currents, scavenging for algae and small fish, and drinking salt water. 
 On the fifth day at sea, Mr. Reyes's older brother, Hermogenes, died of dehydration. The group slid his body into the water to make room on the small boat. On Tuesday, their 12th day since leaving Cuba, they were sighted by a fishing vessel off the Bahamas, but the rescue came too late to save Mr. Reyes's son, Diosnel. The boy was quickly flown by air-ambulance to a Miami hospital, but he died of dehydration.
 
Few Make 90-Mile Crossing
 Studies have shown that as few as one in four Cuban boat people, known as Balseros from the Spanish "balsa" for raft, arrive alive in the Bahamas or their final destination, South Florida. The United States Coast Guard and other groups have issued warnings to deter Cubans from risking the trip. Still, each year thousands like Mr. Reyes and his family weigh the risks and their dismal future in Cuba and choose to try the 90-mile crossing.
As for the Reyes family, "they haven't even realized yet what's happened to them yet," said Clara Del Valle, a director with the Cuban American National Foundation in Miami, which was assisting in efforts to fly the group to Miami.
Mr. Reyes's 6-year-old niece, Dalima Cardosa Reyes, also flown to Children's Hospital in Miami from the Bahamas, was unconscious and unable to breathe on her own when she arrived on Tuesday, said the hospital's administrator, Omar Montejo, but by Friday she had made "incredible progress."
Cristina Reyes, Dalima's mother and Mr. Reyes's sister, was treated for extreme dehydration and released on Friday from Pan American Hospital in Miami. Dalima opened her eyes and greeted her mother with a smile when Ms. Reyes visited late Friday afternoon, Mr. Montejo said.
Cristina Reyes's three other children -- Luis, 6, Daili, 2, and Mariorqui, 8 -- were treated for dehydration and sunburn at a Bahamian hospital. Also treated there were Mr. Reyes's mother, Anita Reinosa, 78; his brother, Alejandro, 23; Alejandro's wife, Maida Palma, and their 2-year-old son, Alejandro Jr. They were all released on Thursday. The seven have temporarily joined the 100 to 150 other Balseros that has sprung up in the Bahamas in recent weeks.
Fernando Rojas of the Cuban American Foundation in Miami said the Immigration and Naturalization Service was arranging humanitarian visas for the family.
Mr. Reyes's wife, Belen Zayas, 23, suffered a collapsed lung during the crossing and will remain under medical care at Pan American Hospital.
Mr. Reyes, who worked as a solderer and an auto body repairman in Moa in the northeast province of Holguin, said the group set sail at dusk on Nov. 22, expecting to need only 8 to 10 hours to reach Great Inagua in the Bahamas, where they had planned to request political asylum.
 
Sighted Ships in Distance
 After the storm damaged their boat and left the group adrift, some on board believed they had drifted near the coast of Spain, Mr. Reyes said in a news conference on Wednesday in Miami.
On Dec. 3, the 11th day at sea, the group managed to tie their boat to some buoys in water near Cay Lobos, one of the southernmost islands in the Bahamas chain. The next day the group sighted ships in the distance and, using bits of white cloth, frantically signaled for help.
When a fishing vessel finally drew alongside, Mr. Reyes said he held his "nearly dead" son up to the crew members before crawling aboard himself.
The fishing vessel notified the Coast Guard, which maintains a helicopter in Great Inagua. Within five hours, the six adults and six children had been transported to the airport in Nassau in the Bahamas, where they were met by ambulances that took them to Princess Margaret Hospital, said Dan Wald schmidt, a Coast Guard spokesman in Miami.
As of Friday, the Coast Guard said that 3,390 Cubans had reached South Florida shores this year, breaking the record of 2,557 set last year. The Coast Guard began tracking the rafters in 1981. Economic hardships and reports of increased repression on the island have spurred the recent exodus.
Jose Cardenas, a spokesman in Washington for the Cuban American foundation, said so many Cubans were trying the crossing and winding up in the Bahamas, the Dominican Republic or Mexico, that the group could assist only those inneed of humanitarian assistance.
"We don't encourage the Balseros to come, but we do try to help those that attempt the crossing," he said. "To a man and woman, they tell us, 'We'd rather risk death on the high seas than the slow death that Fidel Castro subjects us to.' "

HEADLINE: Europeans Back French Curbs on U.S. Movies

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 11

 BODY:
European Community leaders today gave full support to demands by France that its system of protecting and subsidizing its movie industry be preserved in any world trade agreement.
This subsidy system, bitterly contested by Washington and Hollywood, has become the chief remaining obstacle in a seven-year-old negotiation, known as the Uruguay Round, whose goal is updating and extending trade rules to stimulate the world economy. Four days remain until Wednesday's agreed deadline for the talks. 
 In a statement at the end of a two-day meeting, the leaders said considerable progress had been made in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. But they said problems remained, including that of guaranteeing that "an exceptional and separate treatment be reserved for audiovisual products in the present and in the future."
 
New Rules for Film Sector
 The current trade talks deal with bringing the audiovisual sector, which includes movies but also valuable fast-developing technologies like cable and satellite-delivered services, under GATT rules for the first time.
In general, the rules are aimed at eliminating quotas and subsidies. Thus the "exceptional and separate treatment" called for by the European leaders would mean that these anti-subsidy and anti-quota rules would not be applied, now or in the future, to movies, television or future audiovisual technologies.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, has pledged not to yield on the movie question, a vow he also made on agricultural trade before giving way in part to French demands. He has argued that the French system deprives Hollywood of money and market access to which it is entitled.
The conflict pits two considerable forces against each other: a huge American export industry, the second largest after aerospace, with sales in Europe alone of $3.7 billion last year, and Gallic pride, viscerally attached to the notion that France is the sanctuary of serious cinema and to the argument that Hollywood is trying to move from a position of domination to one of monopoly in world entertainment.
As the European Community meeting ended, Sir Leon Brittan, the community's chief trade negotiator, and Mr. Kantor were engaged in potentially decisive talks in Geneva. A special meeting of European foreign ministers has been called for Monday to review the results of their negotiations.
 
U.S. Opposes Limits
 United States objections to current French practice center on a quota system used to limit the amount of American programming on television, and on a series of taxes on movie tickets, television movies and videocassettes that raised $350 million last year and was in turn used to subsidize production of about 150 French films.
Because the American movies account for about 57 percent of the French box office, the tax effectively takes money from American creations to pay for French films. But France argues that Hollywood already has 80 percent of the European market, while Europe has 2 percent of the American, so some protection is required to avoid extinction.
Despite brinkmanship on both sides, it appears that an irresistible momentum toward a GATT agreement has built up. But Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission, said he still had "grave doubts about the audiovisual sector," and Alain Juppe, the French Foreign Minister, raised the possibility that it might have to be left out of a trade agreement.
But the exclusion of a huge export like movies from the Uruguay Round would probably be unacceptable to Washington.
The European leaders committed themselves to spending more than $130 billion of community money in the next six years on major public works projects like roads, railways and telecommunications.
But they said such projects, intended to create jobs, should be financed principally by the private sector. They rejected a commission request that close to $9 billion a year be raised through community bond issues.

HEADLINE: France Fears Fallout From Algerian Turmoil

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Still bearing the scars of its painful loss of Algeria more than 30 years ago, France is increasingly fearful of being drawn into the violent conflict between Islamic fundamentalists and a besieged army-backed junta in its former North African possession.
But with nearly one million Algerians living here and with Algeria still looking to France as its most important European partner, Paris is finding it difficult to shield itself from the repercussions of the violence tearing Algeria apart. 
 The Algerian crisis is "one of the most dramatic and difficult situations we have to face," President Francois Mitterrand has warned. The European Affairs Minister, Alain Lamassoure, noted this week that France was "very worried" by developments in Algeria.
On Wednesday, an elderly man became the third French citizen slain in Algeria since September. Three French diplomats were kidnapped there in October, supposedly by Islamic extremists, although they were later freed.
Angered by the kidnappings, France responded by rounding up 88 suspected sympathizers of the Islamic Salvation Front, the fundamentalist group that was poised to win Algerian parliamentary elections two years ago, before the authorities canceled them. And while all but one Algerian was released, the French Government warned the front against acting in France. This week, French police detained a dozen Tunisian fundamentalists for questioning.
With another militant Algerian organization, the Armed Islamic Group, now threatening to kill all foreigners, France has reluctantly urged its citizens to return home or at least to send dependents back to France. Of some 75,000 French citizens in Algeria, all but 8,000 also have Algerian nationality. So far, between 3,000 and 4,000 have left Algeria.
Alarmed by the attacks on foreigners, Russia, Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain have encouraged their citizens to leave. On Thursday, the United States said it was reducing its embassy staff in Algiers and urged Americans to leave if they did not have compelling reasons to remain.
Although 8 of the 11 foreigners slain by militants since September were not French, no country feels more vulnerable to events in Algeria than France. This is not only because of the large Algerian population living here now, but also because of historical and emotional ties.
France first established direct rule over Algeria in 1834. By the mid-19th century, tens of thousands of French families had settled there.
The Algerian war of independence, which began in the mid-1950's, was profoundly traumatic for France. While it was being fought, France was deeply divided between supporters and opponents of independence. And when it was lost in 1962, one million French Algerians fled to France.
In the years that followed, France slowly established economic and political ties to the secular revolutionary government ruling Algeria. And when this began to buckle under the pressure of economic crisis, rampant corruption and rising fundamentalism, France was forced to take a position.
In January 1992, after the Algerian Government canceled a second round of parliamentary elections that seemed certain to bring the Islamic Salvation Front to power, France reluctantly endorsed the move, hoping the junta could win some popularity by reviving the economy.
But, since then, more than 1,700 Algerians -- mainly soldiers and police, but also journalists and intellectuals -- have died in a simmering civil war in which the fundamentalists have displayed a growing level of military organization while the country's economic and political crisis has deepened.
Today, France has good reason to worry. It sees Islamic fundamentalists stepping up their proselytizing among the 3.5 million Muslims living here, it no longer believes the Algerian junta can crush the Islamic Salvation Front and it knows that an Islamic takeover in Algeria would bring a flood of refugees into France.

HEADLINE: Reluctant Peacekeepers: Many U.N. Members Reconsider Role in Conflicts

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 11

 BODY:
After rampant growth in recent years, United Nations peacekeeping is facing a crisis brought about by the reluctance of governments to underwrite new operations, especially those that put their soldiers' lives at risk.
Stung by the loss of 18 American soldiers in a Mogadishu firefight two months ago and the swell of Congressional anger that followed, the Clinton Administration has put a lid on discussion of all new peacekeeping operations while it reconsiders its policy. Most recently, Washington blocked efforts to send a force to Burundi, a tiny African state ravaged by civil war. 
The emerging American policy -- contained in a classified document circulating in Washington -- could lead to more frequent United Nations intervention by broadening what the United States considers actions that merit the Security Council's use of force. In addition to military aggression, these would include natural disasters, attempts to subvert democracy and gross violations of human rights. But the policy also sets tough new conditions to be met before Washington could support new peacekeeping missions, including requirements that the operations involve American interests and that the United Nations have a strategy for ending the intervention.

 So far this year, the Security Council has churned out a record 181 unenforceable resolutions and statements demanding, for example, a cessation of "ethnic cleansing" in the former Yugoslavia, or an end to fighting in Somalia. As the resolutions mount and are ignored, the Council loses credibility.
"The Council has no clothes because no one does what it tells them," Diego Arria, who served as Venezuela's representative on the Security Council until a few months ago, told a recent seminar here.
With the United States, France and Belgium committed to pulling their forces out of Somalia in the next few months, probably followed by other nations; and with France and Britain reluctant to keep soldiers in the former Yugoslavia for a third successive year of civil war, 1994 could see peacekeeping begin to shrink.
"Politically and economically the international community is now in retreat," United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali lamented in a recent speech.
For President Clinton "the United Nations simply cannot become engaged in every one of the world's conflicts. If the American people are to say yes to peacekeeping, the United Nations must know when to say no."
 
 
Not Threats, Just 'Tragedies'
 Britain's Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, went further, arguing that crises in Bosnia, Somalia, the Sudan and Angola are not real threats to international peace but just "tragedies" that did not require United Nations intervention.
This year's 48th General Assembly, now winding up, has been marked by complaints that the United Nations lacks the staff and expertise to manage a peacekeeping force of its current size efficiently and is taking on more than it can handle or its members are ready to pay for.
In 1987 the United Nations was running just five operations with a combined manpower of some 10,000 soldiers and an annual budget of about $233 million. But as the cold war ended and East and West began working together through the Security Council to settle regional conflicts, the number of operations shot up. Today the United Nations has 18 peacekeeping operations and has deployed some 75,000 troops at an annual cost of more than $3 billion.
These operations are more complex and dangerous than classic peacekeeping -- in which United Nations forces supervised an agreed truce, giving the politicians time to negotiate a solution.
 
Blurred Distinctions
 Increasingly, such "second-generation operations," as the Secretary General has called them, require peacekeepers to intervene directly by disarming guerrillas, monitoring elections or escorting relief convoys, activities that could compromise their impartiality.
Moreover, it is often unclear whether they are operating with the consent of all the parties to a conflict. A new study by Mats Berdal of the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London says United Nations forces now operate in a less "permissive" environment amid "myriad paramilitary groups" who often disobey their leaders' orders. As a result, the distinction is becoming blurred between impartial peacekeeping and enforcement actions.
For many, the lesson of the operations in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia and of President Clinton's decision to turn back American peacekeepers from Haiti in the face of dockside riots, is that the kind of military enforcement the Security Council ordered against Iraq in the Persian Gulf war is likely to remain a rarity.
"After a brief post-cold-war honeymoon, the United Nations is once again suffering from the inability to enforce its decision in critical situations, this time without the excuse of the obstacles created by the Cold War" writes Sir Brian Urquhart, a former Under Secretary General in charge of peacekeeping, summing up the new sense of disillusion with the United Nations in "United Nations, Divided World" a study published by Oxford University Press.
 
'There Is a New Reality'
 In a recent address in Washington, Mr. Boutros-Ghali said: "I am firmly committed to the concept of peace enforcement. It is essential if we are to strengthen international peace and security. But there is a new reality: member states are not ready for it. I must accept reality. I also must continue to give you my view."
Meanwhile, some countries are working quietly to strengthen the ability of the United Nations to run military operations more effectively and to win public backing for them.
Member countries have now provided the Secretary General with a military headquarters staff of some 70 professional officers, as well as with better communications and intelligence equipment. By the end of this year they should also provide him with lists of military units they can furnish at short notice.
The Clinton Administration, which took office vowing "assertive multilateralism," is also quietly striving to build domestic support for a more interventionist United Nations. The Administration plans to seek Congressional agreement early next year on criteria for assessing American support for, and possible participation in, new military operations.
The as yet unsigned Presidential Decision Directive broadens the definition of what constitutes a "threat to international peace and security" requiring Security Council intervention to include: "one or a combination of the following -- international aggression, a humanitarian disaster requiring urgent action coupled with violence, a sudden and unexpected interruption of established democracy or gross violation of human rights coupled with violence or the threat thereof."
 
The Question of Command
 It also provides for American forces to serve under a foreign commander, although their participation must be necessary from a military standpoint. On hazardous missions, Washington would want an American officer in overall command or near the top of the command.
But the document says new operations must have a clear objective and a strategy for bringing them to an end. They must also have widespread political support and serve national interests.
The Administration also plans to ask the Defense Department to share the cost of Security Council peace enforcement operations with the State Department.
Before there can be any more peacekeeping operations, however, Congress must replenish the United Nations coffers by finding up to $950 million in a supplemental appropriation next year to pay America's overdue portion.
Meanwhile, with the United Nations increasingly short of money and troops, attention is shifting to what different regions can do to promote local stability with a little help from the West.
In Africa, a continent with large armies but little money, the Clinton Administration now plans to help Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Uganda send soldiers to assist Nigeria in overseeing the fragile peace agreement in Liberia, providing them with military equipment they cannot afford themselves.
In the same way, the United States, France and Britain are thinking of asking the Security Council to make Russia responsible for order in its former empire by formally authorizing the peacekeeping missions its army is carrying out in Georgia, Moldova and Tajikistan and asking other countries to help with the bill.

HEADLINE: Mexico Raises Minimum Wages as Pledged

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Fulfilling a pledge made during the fierce debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Mexican Government is raising minimum wages by 7 percent, taking into account for the first time worker productivity and the rate of inflation.
The increase is the smallest rise in nominal terms since 1989. But government officials say that because the rate of inflation for 1994 is expected to be 5 percent or less, purchasing power for workers at the bottom of Mexico's wage scale will increase for the first time in years. 
 Still, the minimum wage -- earned by about 16 percent of Mexico's labor force -- will stay low. There are actually more than 200 minimum wages, with the country divided into three geographic areas and with different levels set for over 80 categories of work.
The standard for general labor will increase to about $5 a day in Mexico City and other urban areas, about $4.60 in Guadalajara and medium-sized cities, and $4.15 in rural areas.
The leader of Mexico's primary labor confederation, Fidel Velazquez, said that the increases were less than labor had asked for but that they marked the beginning of a recuperation of purchasing power that has eroded substantially since the mid 1980's.
It was in September, while the trade agreement's supplementary accords on labor and the environment were being completed, that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari told President Clinton that he would increase the minimum wage and, for the first time, take into account increases in worker productivity. The promise was seen as a way to placate officials in the United States who opposed the trade agreement because Mexico's low wages could entice businesses to relocate, taking American jobs with them.
In October, President Salinas announced an economic stimulation package in which he outlined how minimum wages would rise. He included in the package a series of tax cuts and authorization for contract negotiations between unions and private businesses to use measures of increases in worker productivity to determine wage increases and salary bonuses.
Previously during the Salinas administration, a commission set a ceiling on contract wage increases that generally coincided with the inflation rate.
On Friday, the central bank announced that inflation in November had risen 0.4 percent, the smallest increase since 1971. Since January, the rate of inflation in Mexico has been 7.19 percent. The Government hopes inflation will be kept to 5 percent in 1994.

HEADLINE: Zaire Is in Turmoil After the Currency Collapses

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINSHASA, Zaire

 BODY:
They call it "Wall Street," and as in its celebrated counterpart in New York bank notes with a face value of hundreds of billions are exchanged daily in what amounts to this country's only truly functioning currency market. Trouble is, most of the money being traded here is virtually worthless.
Nothing so unusual about that, a stranger might think, given that Zaire's economy has been virtually bankrupt for nearly a decade, a result of endemic official corruption and monetary ineptitude. Indeed, average real incomes here are now a fraction of what they were in the early 1960's, though under current circumstances comparative statistics, too, are probably worthless. 
 But by any accounting, since mid-October conditions in sub-Saharan Africa's second most populous country have taken a dramatic turn for the worse, a result of what is now widely regarded as a major misstep by Zaire's President, Mobutu Sese Seko, and Prime Minister Faustin Birindwa.
For the third time in two years, the Mobutu Government has introduced a new currency in an effort to solve its chronic liquidity crisis. This time, however, it has taken an even more drastic step by trying to withdraw the old bank notes from circulation. But the tactic appears to have backfired, as the new currency has plunged against the dollar on the black market and its circulation has sent prices sharply higher across this huge central African country of 40 million people.
 
110 Million to the Dollar
 And the ensuing chaos, foreign diplomats, analysts and many ordinary Zairians say, threatens to plunge the nation into its gravest crisis since the nightmarish turmoil that followed the country's independence from Belgium in 1960.
One illustration of how precipitously the economic situation has deteriorated in recent weeks is to compare the value of the national currency, the zaire, against the American dollar. At the beginning of October, the zaire traded at about eight million to the dollar; today, the rate is about 110 million and is still rising.
"Things have gone from the ridiculous to the truly absurd," said Atondoko Ngefa, the president of Zaire's Association for the Defense of Human Rights. "It was hard to believe that things could actually get worse here, but they have."
A Western economist here said: "Frankly, I haven't the faintest idea of how most people get by. It defies all logic. But eventually, it will all come tumbling down. It must."
 
Sure of Nothing
 In Washington, George Moose, the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, said at a Congressional hearing last month that the Mobutu Government's currency manipulations were "wrong-headed and could incite a new round of pillaging and military unrest."
Those are the forecasts. But then diplomats, business people and officials also acknowledge they can be sure of nothing.
What is most frustrating, analysts and foreign diplomats here say, is that the current crisis was altogether predictable and probably avoidable. In recent years, prices here have risen fortyfold, partly because of a huge budget deficit that developed after the Government abandoned an economic recovery program devised by the International Monetary Fund early in 1990 and increased spending. And with foreign exports, Government revenue and industrial production at record lows, there was nothing to buttress Zaire's money. At that time, the zaire traded at about 300 to the American dollar, but rapidly depreciated.
Since then, vast segments of the economy have shut down. In the stalls of the street markets here, the price of a sack of manioc, Zaire's staple food, has quadrupled. Relief workers report that malnutrition, virtually unknown here until recently, is spreading. And with the price of food beyond the reach of much of the population, there has been a growing exodus from urban areas back into the bush, where food is still plentiful.
"It's all a matter of supply and demand," said Peter Rosenblum. a senior lawyer with the Human Rights Law Group, who has written extensively on Zaire.
"Zairians are in terror of the new bills," he said. "They know that each time a new bill is introduced, the old bills become virtually worthless, and inflation takes another galactic leap."
 
Violence Is Feared
 There is plenty of evidence, moreover, that if the situation continues to worsen, it could cost the lives of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people through violence it might engender.
Indeed, twice in this decade Zairians have suffered through outbreaks of violence and rioting provoked by the Government's ill-advised attempts to introduce new currencies. In July 1991, Zaire Army soldiers mutinied because they had not been paid. A week of looting and violence spread throughout the country, eliminating most of what remained of the modern productive sector, outside of mining. In the Kinshasa area alone, 90,000 jobs were lost and at least 240 people were killed.
The rioting also led to the evacuation of virtually all foreign workers -- about 20,000 people, mostly from Belgium, France and the United States. They included most of the country's university professors, teaching staff at hospitals and geologists in the vital mining industry.
Rioting erupted again last February when soldiers discovered that the new five-million-zaire bank notes used to pay them were impossible to spend. They seized control of the Parliament building and held several hundred lawmakers hostage, demanding that they order local merchants to accept the new bank notes. Hundreds, including the French Ambassador, were killed.
Nonetheless, in yet another effort to prop up the economy artificially, on Oct. 22 President Mobutu introduced yet another new currency, with each note supposed to be worth three of the old bills, and set at an official rate of three to the dollar.
 
Traders Are Arrested
 But traders on Kinshasa's Wall Street, a narrow alley across the road from the United States Embassy here, quickly devalued the old money. The Government first responded by raiding Wall Street, arresting traders and seizing banknotes.
But the money changers soon returned. Oto Nbongo, a spokesman for the dealers, told Zaire television that they had come back "because among the money changers there are fathers and mothers of families who depend on this practice."
Left unsaid, many Zairians say, is that many of the Wall Street traders are relatives of senior Government officials and soldiers who depend on the market for their main source of income.
More ominously, the new notes have already caused scattered rioting. In late November, soldiers went on a looting rampage in the central Zaire town of Kananga where opposition parties have been leading a boycott of the currency. Three Roman Catholic priests were reportedly killed in the rampage.
In any event, Etienne Tshisekedi, Zaire's main opposition leader, who despite being dismissed by President Mobutu last year still considers himself Prime Minister, has called the new notes a "criminal swindle."
"This operation is pure piracy," Mr. Tshisekedi told reporters at a news conference, "The people will agree with me in the end."

HEADLINE: Europe to Defy Greece on Ties to Macedonia

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Despite a long campaign by Greece to isolate the tiny Balkan country of Macedonia until it changes its name, the rest of the European Community is likely to establish diplomatic relations with Macedonia by the end of the year, diplomats say.
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark are preparing to establish full diplomatic ties as soon as next week, the diplomats say. 
 Greece's 11 fellow members of the European Community have become increasingly frustrated with the campaign by Athens to make the world withhold recognition from Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic that declared independence in November 1991. Greece wants to force the country to change its name, which Athens sees as implying a territorial claim on the northern Greek province also called Macedonia.
The European Community members say offering diplomatic recognition to Macedonia is a useful gesture of support for the Government of President Kiro Gligorov that may help stabilize an ethnically mixed country in one of the most turbulent regions of the world.
The last complete census, conducted in 1981, showed that 64 percent of the Macedonian population were Macedonians of Orthodox Christian background, while 22 percent were Albanians of Muslim descent, with smaller numbers of Turks, Serbs and Gypsies.
Formal ties would also make it easier for European Community countries to provide economic aid and to encourage companies to invest there.
Earlier this year, Macedonia was admitted to the United Nations General Assembly under the compromise name of Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia, which Greece still rejects. This is the name the European countries planning to establish diplomatic relations with Macedonia will continue to use for official purposes. Those wanting full diplomatic relations are in a hurry to do so before Jan. 1, when Greece assumes the presidency of the European Community for six months.
More than 40 countries have recognized Macedonia so far and about a dozen have established formal diplomatic ties.
This month, the Clinton Administration upgraded the United States Information Office in Skopje to a Liaison Office. At the time, the State Department said this "does not change the United States Government's position on recognition." Washington has not recognized Macedonia although there are 300 United States peacekeeping troops there, along with 700 Scandinavian soldiers, in an effort to stop the Balkan war from spreading.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Credit Twist: Fun Is Back For Consumers

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
AMERICANS entered the holiday season charging at a record rate. And as a Christmas present, the people who provide the credit are asking less in return.
"We're seeing a 20 to 30 percent increase in the charges on each card this holiday season," said James L. Bailey, an executive vice president of Citibank, the largest issuer of bank credit cards. 
 Credit cards are still profitable for banks, but the competition is getting stiffer. Price cuts have been common in the battle for market share, especially among those highly desirable consumers who are foolish enough, or poor enough, to keep substantial balances on their cards. Luring such a customer is known as "balance piracy," noted Robert McKinley, president of Ram Research in Frederick, Md. Citibank now joins the trend toward canceling annual fees for most customers, other than the ones who are tied into groups with side deals, such as cards that provide airline miles or car discounts.
The implications of this competition in credit are bullish for economic activity, at least for the time being, and mixed for bank profitability. It is one reason that consumer credit is booming again, growing at the fastest rate since 1989. But consumers may regret taking the generous terms being offered.
Consider a customer who has a $2,000 balance on a Citibank Visa card. Until now, that customer had to pay a minimum of $55.56 a month. Now, thanks to the friendly folks at Citi, that is down to $41.67. The interest rate remains the same, ranging from 9.9 percent to 19.8 percent a year.
We wondered how long it would take, assuming minimum payments at the end of every month, to pay off that $2,000 balance. The answer, at a 19.8 percent interest rate, is 22 years. During that period, the interest charges will total $4,919. And if that hypothetical customer sometimes is late making payments, it gets even worse. Citibank has raised the penalty for missing a monthly payment to a minimum of $15.
Mr. Bailey figures the change will both reduce delinquencies -- by making it easier for customers to make required payments -- and raise bank profits -- by increasing the overall interest payments.
A few years ago, such an easing of credit terms would have aroused talk of an increase in defaults for the banks. Now, Wall Street is more likely to focus on the possibility of increased profits from those who maintain high balances. Worries about credit quality have largely vanished, whether it concerns strapped Visa cardholders or Latin American governments. Argentina last week sold $1 billion in 10-year bonds yielding only 8.47 percent, as buyers dismissed as irrelevant the junk ratings given the bonds by stodgy credit agencies. It was only last year that Argentina renegotiated its debt, forcing the banks to take losses.
Credit binges are fun while they last, and this one will produce a merry Christmas for retailers. It will be interesting to see how long it lasts after that.

HEADLINE: Profile: Albert E. Sindlinger;
Kill-Joy at the Recovery Ball

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WALLINGFORD, Pa.

 BODY:
TIRED of all the happy talk lately about how business has begun to perk up -- but not for you? Looking for a fellow skeptic about the nation's economic course?
Albert E. Sindlinger may be your man. The 86-year-old pollster, who was born during the financial panic of 1907 and came of age during the Depression, finds little to cheer these days. It's not that he's a natural sourpuss -- in fact, critics over his long career have as often complained of over-optimism, notably after the '87 crash -- it's that he says things have fundamentally, perhaps permanently, changed for the worse. 
 "We're not in a business cycle. We didn't have a recession, and we don't have a recovery," contended this opinionated, acutely informed pioneer in probing consumer attitudes. "We're in a structural change."
Before long, he maintained, either the economy will have to be put back on course or the stock market will dive. And while he doesn't buy stocks himself, for fear of impairing his judgment, he said a market drop is much more likely.
"He sees the fundamental forces that are fracturing the economy," said William Dunkelberg, dean of the business school at Temple University, who surveys small business for a trade association.
To Mr. Sindlinger, who runs a survey and consulting business with revenues of about $1 million a year, the main cause of the changes is what he calls the export of American jobs.
"Forty percent of the people in this country are worried about their jobs -- normally it's 4 or 5 percent," he said in an interview in the office wing of his modest suburban Philadelphia home. "You can't run a decent economy when 40 percent of the people get up in the morning" wondering if they'll get their next paycheck.
This view is grounded not in Government statistics, which show an unemployment rate of 6.4 percent, but in telephone polls of a random slice of the American public since he began polling nationally in 1955.
The questions, which never change, produce a reading of what Mr. Sindlinger calls household liquidity, based on whether respondents answer "better," "worse" or "about the same" when asked about their incomes and jobs, both now and six months hence.
For three years, he said, household liquidity has been mired in a narrow range, with around 30 percent of those polled giving neutral or positive answers to the Sindlinger questions. That's about half the 1988 average.
The survey has shown little of the sharp recent improvement uncovered by Sindlinger & Company's better-known rivals in gauging "consumer confidence" -- a term that Mr. Sindlinger not immodestly claims to have coined. The main rivals are the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center and the Conference Board.
The moderate Sindlinger rise from a low just under 27 percent around the 1992 elections is nothing more than "bouncing along the bottom," Mr. Sindlinger said, and is certainly not the harbinger of resumed prosperity signaled by a host of recent statistics.
SINCE Congress approved the North American Free Trade Agreement last month, Mr. Sindlinger's results have rebounded, but he dismissed this as being temporary and confined to people who own stocks. Consumers, he said, are "feeling the pressure of weak income growth, high debt levels, job insecurity and weak home prices."
What sets his work apart, he said, is that he asks consumers about their personal financial and job situations.
Mr. Sindlinger said he faulted the late George Katona, his highly reputed rival, who founded the Michigan survey, for asking householders to make broad evaluations more appropriately addressed to economists. Their answers, he said, can do little but reflect what people have read.
In response, Richard T. Curtin, now director of the Michigan survey, said that while he does ask about things like inflation and unemployment, consumers consistently "have a remarkably good grasp" of them.
One striking result of Sindlinger interviewing, which is contracted out to a telephone teams operating from nearby Broomall and in Arizona, with Mr. Sindlinger's wife, Nellie, 59, often pitching in to make follow-up calls, is that consumers almost invariably find inflation higher than is shown by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
This, Mr. Sindlinger contended, is because the Government fails to adequately capture the full brunt of property and other taxes and the cost of things like insurance and tuition.
HIS own cost-of-living index now shows an annual rate of increase of about 8 1/4 percent after being between 9 and 10 percent much of the year. These rates are three to five times the increases shown by the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index.
The Government indexes do not technically measure the cost of living because the baskets of goods they cover rarely change. "What they're measuring is financial inflation," Mr. Sindlinger declared. "The real inflation is what it costs you to live."
Mr. Sindlinger also denigrates the Commerce Department's gross domestic product calculation, saying it overstates national output and thereby has missed two or three negative quarters since the latest recession's official end in March 1991.
Judged by household liquidity, Mr. Sindlinger now lists 4 states in depression (California, New Jersey, New York and West Virginia), 13 on depression's doorstep, 25 states and the District of Columbia in mere recession and 6 Western states not in recession. He does not poll in Alaska or Hawaii.
Another household problem these days, Mr. Sindlinger said, is that returns on certificates of deposits and other savings have withered to virtually nothing. And while many families have gained buying power by refinancing mortgages, this also implies a cut in someone else's income.
To be sure, households have been pouring money into the stock and bond markets, often through mutual funds, and have generally been well rewarded. But Mr. Sindlinger said people don't generally tap such gains, especially when worried about their jobs: "you don't go to the store and spend the value of the stock."
But at the same time, he said, people are highly likely to spend dividends and other earnings that their investments generate. This led to one of the seemingly odd distinctions his survey has made since its beginning -- between respondents who own stock and those who don't.
Stockowners, he determined in the late 1940's, buy bigger and more expensive cars. Though the intentions of stockholders no longer predict the economy -- and the stock market now seems to be dominated by interest rates -- Mr. Sindlinger said he has no plans to change the methods he's used for 2,012 weeks straight.
He said the economy started to veer in the wrong direction shortly after World War II, when various union contracts were linked to inflation. But the real trouble began in the 1970's, and was marked by two price tempests in oil, when the United States began to hemorrhage money abroad, bloat on debt and set itself up for what Mr. Sindlinger considers ill-advised Reagan-era tax cuts.
The result, he said, is a country that has relinquished its preeminence in manufacturing, a decline that will be aggravated by the free-trade accord. "We ceased to produce major things that we consume, and we buy on borrowed money."
One way or another, Mr. Sindlinger has been involved in communications since he learned Morse code as a boy by hanging around the telegraph office at the railroad station in Gnadenhutten, Ohio, where he went to pick up the Pittsburgh and Columbus newspapers for his morning route.
Before long, he became the country's youngest ham radio operator, and at age 13, invited to Pittsburgh to attend the inauguration of radio, wound up filling in for a drunken announcer and broadcasting results of the 1920 election on KDKA for an hour or so.
But it was as a movie-theater manager while working his way through Ohio University that Mr. Sindlinger began his surveying career by interviewing customers about what they most liked to see.
After graduation, he used his engineering degree to get a job as an electronics troubleshooter and theater manager, supervising the replacement of theater sound systems in cities throughout the East and Midwest -- all the while honing his surveying skills.
"I put hidden microphones in the ladies' rooms and the men's rooms," Mr. Sindlinger recalled with a certain glee. And when he went into the lobby to interview moviegoers, he asked questions not only about the show but about economics as well.
This led him to Time magazine, where his research job was quickly transformed into running the newsreel March of Time, then to replacing David Ogilvy, the advertising pioneer, and to a not entirely happy association with George Gallup in a company called Audience Research.
In 1948, concluding that "the only honest way to do opinion research is by telephone," Mr. Sindlinger set up his own business, polling mainly for clients making cigarettes, gasoline and movies.
For the last 38 years, the weekly telephone surveys have generated the material for a newsletter that now has about 640 subscribers. The basic fee is $300 a year, but a few dozen people pay more -- as much as $60,000 -- for consultation privileges.
What with low household liquidity and the eerie parallels Mr. Sindlinger sees with the late 1920's, it's not surprising that he thinks today's stock market is headed for a fall. And his own money? "In C.D.'s," of course. "Safety first."

HEADLINE: Just How Bad Is It For Airline Workers?

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
WHEN American Airlines reported on Tuesday that last month's five-day strike by flight attendants had cut its earnings by more than $160 million, it was one of the few uncontested facts to emerge from the dispute. The two sides have agreed on little else in their battle over the terms of a new contract.
American, for example, contended that the flight attendants' real wages rose by 32 percent after 1983; the union said the base pay of its members declined 40 percent, that nearly half earn less than $20,000 a year and that their median salary of $23,000 is below that of mail carriers and security guards. The dispute is heading toward binding arbitration. 
 Wading into such disagreements can be treacherous, considering the myriad truths that can be derived from the industry's arcane work rules and complex labor contracts. Nevertheless, the claims of each side raise a question that is likely to surface again and again as carriers continue to look to labor to help lower costs: Just how bad is it throughout the industry for the attendants and the two other major groups of airline workers, the mechanics and pilots?
Lumped together, the workers seem not to have fared well since deregulation took effect in 1978. The airlines dropped from being the third highest-paying industry in 1979, behind financial services and railroads, to No. 17 in 1989, according to the most recent Transportation Department study.
That ranking hardly tells the whole story, however. Because of the industry's rapid growth, the influx of new workers has dragged down overall wage levels. But many veteran mechanics and flight attendants, not to mention pilots, remain fairly comfortable.
"It's almost a tale of two cities," said Jerrold Glass, a Washington-based labor relations consultant for many airlines.
Among those who have fared best are senior unionized employees who were fortunate enough to start their careers at big airlines, like United and American, that got even bigger under deregulation. These employees have seen their real wages decline no more steeply than the pay of the average worker in the United States.
Employees at smaller carriers like Republic actually saw their pay go up when bigger airlines, like Northwest, took them over and brought in higher wage scales.
But many have felt the pain as the competition set off by deregulation put relentless pressures on costs and ultimately claimed such casualties as Pan American and Eastern. Employees at those carriers had to scramble for other jobs, losing their seniority and their higher pay levels.
Entry-level, unionized workers have also fared worse, as starting wages have dipped sharply since deregulation, often creating a wider gap between new and senior workers, according to a recent study by Nancy Johnson, a management professor at the University of Kentucky.
And nonunion workers, who make up the bulk of airline employees, have been hit worst of all. "They took every cut that everyone else took, and didn't get anything back in return," like an equity stake in the company, said Peter Cappelli, a professor at the Wharton School who wrote the Transportation Department report.
If nothing else, it is clear that airline workers -- like those in telecommunications, trucking and other deregulated industries -- have lost the sense of security they enjoyed when the Government helped smooth the rough edges of the marketplace.
"Nobody has a real cozy situation," said David Swierenga, chief economist at the Air Transport Association, the industry's trade group in Washington.
Like the industry itself, some airline jobs have evolved in dramatic ways, creating new tensions between management and labor. Twenty years ago, stewardesses faced girdle checks and were required to quit their jobs when they turned 30, or sooner if they became pregnant. But there are no more stewardesses. Now there are flight attendants, who can earn more than $40,000 a year at large carriers and who often make the job a career. Yet they are still treated, they say, as second-class citizens.
That is one reason the crippling strike at American was described by labor leaders and attendants as a battle for respect, not simply a fight for better pay and work rules.
Mirroring the widening disparities in pay under deregulation, some aspects of the work itself have retained their allure while others have dimmed.
To be sure, many airline employees still enjoy their jobs. The attendants and pilots, in particular, appreciate the flexible life style and valuable perks that their jobs provide. Most employees, for instance, receive flight passes for themselves and their families. At American, an employee's spouse, parents, children and siblings can fly anywhere at a nominal fee if space is available. The perk even extends to a sibling's spouse.
The very nature of the work schedule of pilots and attendants, especially at the senior level and on coveted international routes, gives them freedom to pursue other businesses or hobbies. A senior pilot flying regularly to Japan, for example, might make three three-day trips a month, with the rest of the month off.
AND that does not include vacation time, which can be extended because of a provision in many contracts with pilots and attendants that was held over from the days of regulation. It works this way: If the last day of a three-day trip is also the first day of a previously scheduled vacation, the employee gets to skip the trip and add the days to the vacation. Nor would the employee work any days of a second three-day trip if that assignment overlaps the last day of the vacation. The result is that some pilots and attendants wind up with two months a year in which they work just three days.
Many senior employees, who have a large measure of control over their schedules, play this provision for all it is worth, airline executives say. The provision has come under fire in many recent contract negotiations.
"The flexibility we have in terms of being able to stretch vacation is a quid pro quo for the fact that the airlines run 24 hours a day, 365 days a year," said Randy Edwards, a spokesman for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents American Airlines attendants.
While entry-level workers earn far less money and have much less control over schedules than do senior workers, they are coming into the cyclical industry during a time of growth, a period that offers long-term opportunities to move up. Pilot retirements are expected to peak shortly after the turn of the century, which will push everybody up the seniority scale.
For all the benefits that remain, airline jobs are arguably more difficult now than they were before deregulation. The emotional stress created by the industry turmoil is felt by all employees, but by pilots especially. Although they are the best-paid, they also have the most to lose if they are laid off and have to start over at entry-level wages. And because most pilots come from the military, where life is more ordered, talk of buyouts and restructurings can be distressing.
"Until they live through a cycle or two, it is quite unnerving," said Kit Darby, who runs Aviation Information Resources, an Atlanta-based job clearinghouse for pilots.
FLIGHT attendants also say they have been asked to do more with less. Mr. Edwards said that when he joined American as a flight attendant 17 years ago, a Boeing 727 had 96 seats. That 727 now has 138 seats and is staffed with the same number of attendants, or fewer. Flight crews also switch planes more frequently these days, meaning they are often dashing to make connections along with passengers.
The rise of the hub-and-spoke system in the 80's and the chaotic bursts of activity it creates when planes converge for connecting flights "add a lot of pressure to workers we represent," said Bill Scheri, airline coordinator for the International Association of Machinists.
With fare wars like last year's 50-percent-off bonanza, many flights are packed. And because the hub-and-spoke system has increased the number of connections, more people bring baggage on board, sometimes creating a near free-for-all. Some airlines have cut back on such amenities as food, and then have complained to flight crews that customer satisfaction ratings are slipping.
In response to all the changes, many labor groups are trying to gain more control over their fate. Workers at United, for example, are seeking a majority stake in the company to avert a restructuring that will likely result in asset sales and layoffs. And pilots at American recently hired a consulting firm to suggest ways to better run the airline.
But because labor is management's largest controllable expense and the industry upheaval is far from over, many employees will continue to face uncertainty.
Despite the unpredictability, though, working for an airline "is still a good profession," Mr. Scheri of the machinists union said.

HEADLINE: Workers Face Loss of Tax Break on Flexible Health Plans

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
MILLIONS of workers would lose Federal tax breaks averaging several hundred dollars a year under a little-noted provision of the Clinton Administration's health plan. And even if the plan does not pass, the breaks could well be eliminated.
Flexible health spending accounts, which allow workers to deduct out-of-pocket medical costs from their incomes for tax purposes, are about to go the way of another popular tax break that was sharply curtailed, the individual retirement account. 
 The Administration says $30 billion in tax revenues over six years is at stake here, money it wants to use to help finance its health care plan.
Basic coverage, including the bulk of doctor and hospital fees, would continue as a tax-deductible expense for both employers and employees under the Administration's proposals. And tax deductions for flexible-spending accounts like child care and life insurance would also continue.
The new tax rules would apply to the 14 million workers who have money set aside in flexible accounts for medical expenses like insurance co-payments and deductibles as well as dental and eye care coverage.
Employers and Washington experts on benefits do not expect the tax advantage for flexible medical accounts to survive no matter what happens with the Clinton health proposal. The $30 billion is too tempting to Congress.
MOST large companies, including General Electric, Hughes Aircraft, Kansas City Power and Light, Procter & Gamble and Union Pacific offer the flexible-spending plans, as do many small companies. The plans are usually the centerpiece of an array of benefit options from which employees are allowed to choose. For example, workers can choose a lower level of health insurance and use the savings for other benefits like child care and life insurance.
Employees at Quaker Oats in Chicago, for example, estimate what their annual costs will be for health care deductibles, co-payments and other medical costs not covered by their company-provided insurance. The total is deducted over the year from their paychecks and reimbursed to them as those costs are incurred. Credits not used by the end of the year become lost income.
Brian Svenkeson, a 33-year-old financial planner at Quaker Oats, estimates each year what his health care expenses will be for the coming 12 months. After adding estimates for his wife and two small children, he decided this year to switch from his company's health insurance to a health maintenance organization, which "reduced my out-of-pocket costs," he said. He then allotted $1,000 of his salary to a flexible account to cover those costs. The benefit: Mr. Svenkeson does not pay income tax on that $1,000.
Mr. Svenkeson calculates that, given his tax rate, the tax deduction cuts about $300 a year off his tax bill. Losing the tax benefit would be "very unfortunate," he said.
Mr. Svenkeson can get more benefits from Quaker by earning credits. He can earn up to $250 a year in credits by joining his company's healthy living program, which includes 20 minutes of daily exercise, a checkup for weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels and a no-smoking pledge.
Mr. Svenkeson said he also added to his credits by "selling back" three vacation days to the flex plan. He then used all his credits to buy company-sponsored life insurance. These types of credits seem unlikely to be affected by the changes under discussion in Washington.
The Bell Atlantic Corporation also uses credits. Nonunion employees who select the lowest level of medical coverage get a credit of about $425 a year that they can use, tax-free, for other benefits, including dental and eye care and life insurance. Or they can add the amount to their salary, in which case it is taxable.
Most employers adopted the flexible provisions because forcing employees to make decisions about their benefits would make them more conscious of the cost. With the tax advantage adding to their luster, the provisions helped to wean workers from freely using benefits for which they had paid little or nothing.
"They wanted to back their employees off of health insurance that included an open-ended free choice of doctors and hospitals," said Alain C. Enthoven, the Stanford University health policy expert who is one of the architects of the Clinton program.
He contends that the tax advantage is "a subsidy for inefficiency" because the Government absorbs part of the cost.
By installing the flexible plans, benefits experts said, employers reaped another reward. They reduced their average spending on health by 5 to 7 percent as workers chose lower-cost coverage and tried to use it less.
Kevin Meehan, a vice president of the Wyatt Company, a benefits consulting firm, said some companies, like Merck & Company, the pharmaceuticals giant, preferred to increase their benefits and "had zero savings from flex."
But a number of shrinking military- industry companies have used flexible plans to jettison elaborate benefits they can no longer afford. Some slashed their costs for employee health care by 15 percent, Mr. Meehan said.
MANY labor unions abhor the flexible approach in health coverage. "It is a way to whittle down the benefits," said Louise Novotny, an economist at the Communication Workers of America.
She said the choices offered by the plans divide a work force into older employees, who need comprehensive coverage, and "young healthy folks who think they are immortal and unbreakable."
For many employers, the added after-tax costs that workers would pay for flexible health benefits may not be very important. Executives at several large companies said they would continue the plans even if employees were taxed. "It doesn't impact the cost to the company," Robert C. Penzkover, benefits director at Quaker Oats, said.
While employees like Mr. Svenkeson worry about losing a tax benefit, Patricia M. Nazemetz, benefits director at the Xerox Corporation, said employees in discussions at her company said that "the important thing to them is access to company funding and getting the benefits," not the tax advantages.
Clinton Administration officials said their program would promote cost-conscious behavior. "If you are paying, you'll think twice about it," Roger C. Altman, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, said. With the tax benefit reduced for employees, he said, "employers will substitute higher wages."
The wages would, of course, be taxable, contributing to the Administration's $30 billion estimate of added tax revenues. But the arithmetic has been challenged.
Gail R. Wilensky, who administered the Medicare and Medicaid programs under President Bush, said the $30 billion estimate was inflated. "Employers will increase their benefits for other things -- child care, pensions, elder care" -- that are tax deferred, she said.
"When the choice is 45-cent dollars after taxes or dollar-dollars, people will do anything rather than take it as taxable income."

HEADLINE: Year After Devastating Storm, Nature Offers Not-So-Gentle Reminder

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HIGHLANDS, N.J., Dec. 10

 BODY:
Everyone who lives near the ocean learns the signals of a big storm moving on the coast.
Low-flying clouds fuse into a dark blanket to blot out the morning sun; rainbursts slash against the windows; crashing waves claw high on the sandy face of broad beaches. 
 Mary Kowalski used to love the excitement of such moments.
No more.
One year after the great coastal storm swept across the New York metropolitan region, causing serious flooding, beach erosion and hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage, she and thousands of others in the region now know intimately the great damage and loss each new storm can bring.
"We can't afford to go through this all over again any time soon," she said, expressing the sentiments of most people who live on the Atlantic from Montauk Point on eastern Long Island to Cape May in southern New Jersey.
 
Biggest in 30 Years
 The three-day storm that began on Friday, Dec. 11, was the most powerful northeaster to strike the region in 30 years and spared few people from loss or at least inconvenience.
Hundreds of shorefront homes, particularly on Long Island, were damaged or washed out to sea, while many more, like Mrs. Kowalski's, were flooded miles inland; parts of the New York City subway system ground to a halt; millions of tons of beach sand were lost to the powerful waves, and 500,000 people lost power, many for several days.
Although much has been done during the last 12 months to patch up and restore beaches and buildings, two intricate questions remain: What can be done to minimize the damage from the storms of the future? Who should bear the costs of holding back the sea or, failing that, pay for picking up the pieces afterward?
Nature may force the question quickly.
 
Exposed, Vulnerable Areas
 The barrier beaches in the region were so badly scoured by erosion last December that many areas lie exposed and vulnerable to lesser winter storms, the experts say.
"Even when dunes have been replaced there is no reservoir of sand in front of them to provide an extra buffer," said Dr. Norman P. Psuty, associate director of the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers University.
As a result, he said, "It won't take a northeaster on the magnitude of last year's storm to damage structures and coastal infrastructure."
Gerard Stoddard, president of the Fire Island Association, a homeowners' group, and publisher of Coastal Reports, a newsletter for shoreline property owners, agrees.
"The shoreline today is in a far more precarious position than it was before the December storm," he said.
Fearing that another big storm would tear away expensive improvements, in fact, some of the more than 70 beachfront communities in New Jersey, like hard-hit Belmar, adopted a wait-and-see attitude and did little reconstruction of splintered boardwalks and other structures at the edge of the sand.
Nor are future storms a worry only for those who live on the edge of the ocean.
The reach of last year's storm was felt far inland, in pockets of modest weatherbeaten housing on low-lying land. The Kowalskis rent their small frame house in Highlands, on the Raritan Bay side of Sandy Hook in Monmouth County, and when they returned to it after floodwaters had forced them to evacuate for four days, they found a sodden lump of ruined appliances, carpets and other furnishings.
They were not covered by insurance and did not qualify for assistance programs, they said. The costs of getting back on their feet came out of their own pocket, Mrs. Kowalski said.
Those who had coverage offered by the National Flood Insurance Program did much better. Some $300 million was paid out of the Federal fund to 8,796 claims in New York and 16,304 claims in New Jersey. An additional $36 million went to Connecticut policyholders.
Still, the storm may end up costing the taxpayers more than $600 million in direct or subsidized assistance in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Hidden or uncovered costs directly related to the storm may add another $1 billion in the three states, officials said.
The storm prompted some private insurance companies to raise premiums on windstorm policies in some exposed coastal areas, to cancel existing policies and to seek higher mandatory deductibles on new ones.
The debate was also rejoined on whether taxpayers should continue to subsidize Federal flood insurance for homeowners who choose to live in flood hazard areas or have second homes there. "They expect taxpayers to bail them out when things go bad," said Beth Milleman of the Coast Alliance, a group of environmentalists based in Washington.
Some in Congress would permit existing homes and businesses to continue in the program but would not allow new development to take advantage of bargain premiums.
New Jersey and New York appear to be on divergent courses on beach restoration policy, with New Jersey determined to hold the shoreline against whatever the ocean can throw at it, and New York considering whether to reject extraordinary measures to preserve the shoreline in some sections of eastern Long Island.
Officials in Trenton have endorsed the view that the Jersey Shore and its $8 billion a year in tourist activity are too important to allow the Atlantic to overwhelm the intensely developed oceanfront and inland estuaries.
The state is pouring money into United States Army Corps of Engineers beach replenishment projects along the coast in Monmouth County, from Sandy Hook to Manasquan Inlet, that are expected to cost $1.2 billion or more over the next decade. The state's 30 percent share of the costs, with contributions from municipalities, will be paid from money allocated for the Economic Recovery Act, at least in the initial stages.
The Corps of Engineers will begin the first $100 million phase of the project early next year by pumping offshore sand into an area in front of a five-mile-long seawall in the adjoining towns of Monmouth Beach and Sea Bright, where nearly all the beaches washed away years ago.
"It's going to start moving the minute after it's pumped," said D. W. Bennett, director of the American Littoral Society at Sandy Hook, a national group.
"The project will end up costing twice as much and lasting half as long," he said.
In New York, the Corps of Engineers in October unveiled a $28.8 million public works project to pump 2.3 million cubic yards of sand along a 3.5-mile stretch of Coney Island, as well as to construct an 850-foot seawall to protect the beach and the low-lying community of Sea Gate.
The Corps completed a $7 million project last month to close a half-mile breach opened by last December's storm along a Town of Southampton barrier beach. On the east side of the breech, about 85 homes are left standing of the 300 homes that once dotted the beachfront.
An erosion task force created by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo this year is about to make recommendations for the state's Atlantic coast. An important decision will be whether to limit the spending of public money for shoreline protection to the densely populated areas in the west, such as Coney Island and Long Beach, and not the less-developed summer resorts to the east, like Fire Island and the Hamptons. Public parks and beaches lying east of the most populous zone, such as Robert Moses State Park and Jones Beach State Park, would still be protected.
Another recommendation is whether to force communities and people who derive the most direct benefit from the waterfront to pay a larger share of maintaining the coastline.
Joe Feder, owner of a home on the Southampton beach, deplored what he says is a a hardening position about aiding the stricken coast.
He said Government action, not a natural event, had caused the severe erosion at the point of the breech. Opposition to extending a line of jetties, already installed to the west, caused an erosion problem that hadn't existed before, he said.
"How can anyone point a finger at me and say I don't deserve Government help when Government created a disaster for me?" he asked.

COMPANIES
 
Bank or Mutual Fund? Suddenly, the Line's a Lot Fuzzier
Should you buy a certificate of deposit or put your money under the mattress? These days, it's a toss-up: depending on your car's make and model, the pennies in interest may or may not buy enough gas to get you to the bank. As banks know all too well, the deposits of yesteryear are sprinting to mutual funds, so many banking companies have faced the music and ventured into the fund business. But none have done it on the scale that Mellon Bank did last week when it bought Dreyfus, the nation's No. 6 mutual fund company, for $1.85 billion in stock. Dreyfus manages $80 billion in 130 or so funds; no other bank exceeds $20 billion. But a word of caution: as banks rush into peddling mutual funds, will half-informed consumers keep up? Or will they, conditioned to think any money taken to the bank is Government-insured, be misled into ignoring mutual funds' risks? 

At Borden, It Didn't Add Up
When Anthony S. D'Amato took charge at Borden two years ago, its shares fetched $32 each. By this past June they had slipped below $20. Mr. D'Amato's response? He renegotiated his contract, assuring himself at least $900,000 a year, plus homes in Ohio and New York, plus 100,000 new stock options (his old ones, at $32 and up, clearly had a future as wallpaper). Shareholders, not surprisingly, felt they'd paid for a party but hadn't been invited. For all the talk of changes at Borden, one big investor said, he kept hearing about "funny pay plans." And, as they tend to do these days, investors made themselves heard. Last week, Borden dismissed Mr. D'Amato.

QVC, Viacom: On Your Marks!
Brace yourself: The bidding war is about to get lively again. Upholding a lower court's decision, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled last week that Paramount did, indeed, snub its shareholders by blocking a bid from QVC, which is offering $1 billion or so more than Viacom, the preferred suitor. Under the ruling, Paramount does not have to judge a bid on price alone but get the "best value," all things considered. You can bet shareholders will keep a sharp eye out. And they smell a higher price: the stock jumped $2.75 after the ruling, ending the week at $81.125.
 
Xerox Takes Itself to the Gym
It's the corporate battle cry of the 90's: You can't be too lean or too rich. Big companies have been announcing vast job cuts lately (a fine holiday gift). And whenever one does so, the boss, a million-dollar paycheck folded neatly in pocket or purse, invariably talks of becoming "lean." But while, say, G.M. and I.B.M. are in dire need of shedding flab, Xerox is doing just fine. Before special charges, it made $600 million last year. Still, last week it said it was cutting more than 10,000 jobs, nearly 10 percent of its work force. And sure enough, there was Paul Allaire (1992 pay: $1.5 million, roughly 175 times the minimum wage) speaking of the need to be "lean and flexible." Investors sent the stock up more than $5 in a day. But in a company that prides itself on worker harmony, will those remaining stay loyal?
 
Putting the Carl Back in Carl's
It's hazardous to put your name on a chain of restaurants: if the chain ever tosses you out, you still see your name all over, a mocking reminder of your lost power. Carl Karcher may have felt this in October when he was ousted as chairman of the Carl's Jr. fast-food chain. He'd had a dispute with other directors, and he couldn't vote his shares -- 34 percent of the company -- because they'd been pledged as collateral for a loan. Last week, though, having straightened out the loan problem, he returned as chairman. While his spokesmen termed it a "triumphant return," others said his new role will be largely ceremonial. In any case, he probably won't wince when he passes a Carl's Jr.
 
Wait! We'll Take Apple's Jobs
The final score: economic reality 1, "family values" 0. A week after rejecting a tax abatement for Apple Computer because it gives benefits to employees' unwed partners, Williamson County, Tex., reversed course and gave Apple nearly $1 million in incentives to build an office complex. Why the shift? Gov. Ann Richards twisted some arms, and the economic benefits were overwhelming. But dissenters were still out in force. "An Apple a day," one slogan went, "will take family values away." One intriguing footnote: gay couples cannot, legally, have much besides benefits; homosexual acts are illegal in Texas.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Celestial Optometrists
The Hubble fix-it crew finished its heavenly house call last week, and after five space walks and numerous complex repairs, sent the space telescope off on its rounds again. Inside their space suits, the astronauts had their fingers crossed, hoping that now, at last, the $1.6 billion contraption would see straight into the vast unknown. And down at NASA, amid the elation at the mission's success, a lot more fingers were crossed: the agency badly needs to wipe Hubble's blurred vision off its record. But though Al Gore called the mission "a symbol of NASA on the way back," the answer won't come till after weeks of testing.
 
Fake Violence, Real Outrage
Last week, a man walked calmly through a Long Island Rail Road car shooting people. Also last week, who-knows-how-many teen-agers, and even younger children, calmly decapitated their hapless victims. The shootings were real -- five people died -- but the children were playing "Mortal Kombat," a Sega video game. But even pretend violence -- especially when young children are involved -- provokes real outrage, so last week the Senate held hearings on the impact of video-game mayhem. Just before the hearing, though, some big game makers and retailers -- Sega, Nintendo, Sears, Toys "R" Us -- made a pre-emptive strike, disclosing plans for game ratings comparable to movie ratings. Details weren't given, but one current Sega label shows an interesting assumption: "Mature audiences -- 13." Of course, any 6-year-old who saw that label on her mature older brother's game -- assuming she could read -- would instantly say, "No, not for me."
 
Dissenting Voices on Trade
After Europe and the United States came to terms on a number of sticky issues, trade negotiators in Geneva insisted last week that they would actually meet this Wednesday's deadline for completing the seemingly endless talks. But one discordant note crept in: Asian and Latin nations made loud objections to some deals, saying they favored businesses and farmers in the United States and Europe. Trade experts cast a realistic eye on this assertion, as one admitted that, yes, "the big markets dictate the trading rules." So much for one big harmonious world.
 
Feeling Confident? Charge It!
A more puritanical society might consider high debt a sign of hard times. But no, this nation is built on borrowed money ("leverage," if you want to be fancy); rising debt is a sign of vigor. When people feel good, the theory goes, they get out those plastic cards and spend money they don't have -- and that's what they're doing now, the Federal Reserve says. Last week it reported that installment debt rose an unexpectedly large $8.1 billion in October. . . . All the while, some say this "recovery" is a mirage -- like Albert Sindlinger, at 86 a pollster with a past. [Page 9.]
 
Another report last week showed that more people can handle their debt -- mortgage delinquencies, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported, fell to a 19-year low.
 
Go Ahead, Make a Banker's Day
Rumor has it that a few people actually pay for gifts -- no plastic. Last week, the Consumer Federation of America gave them a bit of advice: Don't make a gift to your bank by writing bad checks. Last year, the group said, banks collected $4.35 billion in fees for bounced checks; $3.67 billion of it was profit.
 
Community Lending: Prove It
In 1977, Congress passed the Community Reinvestment Act to try to get banks to make more loans in poor neighborhoods, but that law, which consumer groups call too lenient, has had only limited impact. Minority applicants still have a harder time getting mortgages. But the Administration wants tangible progress, and last week it came up with a new set of tests. Basically, banks now have to show they're trying, but the Administration wants them to show results -- in lending, in services offered in poor areas, and in community investment.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Rice: From Icon to Import
Japan's rice industry is like America's flag: Mess with it at your peril. No matter that Japanese eat a lot less rice as they grow richer. No matter that Japan's rice farmers are wildly inefficient, leading to prices six to eight times the world level. Rice is a national symbol, harvested by the Emperor in an annual palace ritual and offered to the gods. The idea of opening the rice market to foreigners -- unthinkable. But in the new, rapidly shifting world order, the unthinkable happens daily -- and last week Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Japan, reluctantly, would open its doors to imported rice. He was pushed to do it by pressure for a world trade pact, but only time will tell what political price he'll have to pay. . . . In one depressed corner of the world, the rice news is good news. California could end up selling as much as a quarter of its annual two-million-ton rice crop to Japan.
 
Next: A Trans-Atlantic Bridge
Send Shakespeare to rewrite. The sceptred isle, the fortress built by nature, has been stormed by engineers. The Channel Tunnel is reality. Last week the builders handed the 31-mile tunnel, the world's largest engineering project, over to the company that will run it. Tickets go on sale Jan. 12, and service begins in the spring.

HEADLINE: How a Staid Electric Company Becomes a Renegade

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
ON paper, the LG&E Energy Corporation of Louisville, Ky., seems the model of the traditional regulated electric utility -- a money-machine monopoly that has annually increased its shareholders' dividend for 39 years running. So why is LG&E, whose profits are up 26 percent this year, intent on overhauling itself?
Simple, explains Roger W. Hale, the company's 50-year-old president and chief executive: sooner or later, the clubby utility industry will be a brawling marketplace. 
 "It's going to be just like competition in telecommunications," said Mr. Hale, a former Bellsouth marketing executive. "And we intend to be a low-cost provider."
Because of impending regulatory changes and pressure from many big corporate buyers for lower-priced electricity, Mr. Hale and his counterparts at the Central & South West Corporation in Dallas, Northeast Utilities in Hartford and some other utility companies are bracing for a market in which corporate customers will shop around for power companies the way they now select long-distance carriers, computer vendors and providers of other big-ticket business necessities. Electric bills often constitute 5 percent of a corporation's operating costs in general manufacturing, and as much as one-third in power-intensive processes like aluminum smelting or steel making.
LG&E, expecting a competitive electricity market to emerge within the next few years, split itself into two broad divisions last month. One will oversee the traditional activity of selling electricity to the company's 325,000 business and residential customers in Louisville and the surrounding counties. This unit will look for ways to keep operating costs low for LG&E, which already has one of the power industry's lowest cost structures, according to a survey by the National Regulatory Utilities Commissioners.
The other new division, LG&E Energy Services, will also have some traditional responsibilities, including operating the company's four Louisville coal-fired power plants and coordinating the wholesale exchange of electric power with all the other utility companies plugged into the national "power grid." But Energy Services is also designed to pursue a venture much more radical in the power game -- devising ways to enter other utility companies' home territories and to compete for their most lucrative corporate customers.
With power it produces itself, buys wholesale from other utilities or draws from 19 independent power plants around the country that LG&E has acquired or is building, the company intends to reach into the rest of Kentucky and into other states to offer lower prices than local utilities.
Such competition would shatter the longstanding "natural monopoly" model of electric-utility regulation, and only a few states are yet seriously considering allowing it. But Mr. Hale and a few of his industry counterparts believe it is only a matter of time before they will be able to buy power in bulk from each other and other nonutility sources in order to parcel it out to retail customers outside their traditional turf, paying a fee to use the transmission lines of the local utilities.
This concept, "retail wheeling" in utility jargon, has caused intense debate within the industry and among regulators and lawmakers over whether it will ever come about and, if it does, whether it will cause more harm than good.
Some analysts and industry executives regard LG&E as a model of what many other utilities will have to become to survive in a competitive future. "Sooner or later, utilities will have to focus on the fact that retail wheeling is a possibility," said Debra Bromberg, a utility analyst for Standard & Poor's. Power companies that have higher rates and a big base of industrial customers, she said, have been trying to bring their rates down and offer more pricing options to retain their big customers.
But other experts argue that companies like LG&E may be risking their financial stability and their ability to provide affordable service to their traditional ratepayers by mobilizing for a competitive market that may never develop.
"They're making a big mistake," said Ralph Cavanagh, the director of energy programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environment group that monitors power companies and recently completed a study of the financial, consumer and environmental impact of retail wheeling.
"They're going to be in trouble," Mr. Cavanagh said of LG&E. "They are restructuring for a market that is not going to exist."
If the market does materialize, however, state regulators, who traditionally have set utility prices, would face a problem that they are still wrestling with in the telephone industry. Rates paid by large industrial customers have often enabled utilities to keep prices down for their residential customers. If local utilities begin to lose big customers to far-away competitors, rates would probably rise for the residential and small commercial customers whose business might seem too small to interest the interlopers.
Mr. Cavanagh also worries that retail wheeling would shift utilities away from their current emphasis on conservation and into a new focus on selling as much electricity as possible -- setting back the considerable environmental clean-up efforts the industry had made in recent years.
EVEN within the utility industry, most companies oppose the idea of direct competition and have lobbied against it.
"There is very intense debate about retail wheeling because there is evidence that retail wheeling does not offer the benefits that some say it does," said David Owens, the senior vice president of the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group that represents most of the investor-owned utilities in the United States -- including LG&E, which seems to be a renegade on the subject of retail wheeling.
The prospect of retail competition in the power industry is a result of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Under this Federal law, state legislatures or regulatory agencies are free to take steps that would for the first time allow a utility to compete for the customers of another.
Within a single state, that state's lawmakers or regulators could set up the ground rules for such competition. Between states, reciprocal rules would need to be put in place. In all cases, the idea is to have a utility provide transport for the outside power company, which would pay regulated fees for access to the local utility's customers.
THE concept is being pushed by major corporate customers who want to reduce their costs by buying power from alternative sources -- including industrial companies that operate generators for their own use and often have excess power to sell.
So far, however, only one state, Nevada, has passed a law authorizing competition. The state Legislature hoped the law would lure large industrial corporations, of which the state has few -- which may be precisely why no retail wheeling has materialized so far in Nevada.
Elsewhere, only a few states, including Michigan and New Mexico, are actively studying retail wheeling. And in Kentucky, LG&E's home state, the Legislature so far has not taken up the issue.
But action by industrial companies could force many states to embrace competition. Big users of power including the General Motors Corporation, the Dow Chemical Company, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Anheuser-Busch and 19 other companies have formed a lobbying group, the Electricity Consumers Resource Council, to push for retail wheeling.
"Electricity is the only thing that corporations don't buy in a competitive market," said John Hughes, the group's director of technical affairs.
The lobbying group wields tremendous clout, because its members can influence entire state economies. Mr. Hughes predicts retail wheeling may come within a few years -- much sooner than many experts, both in the utility industry and outside, believe possible. And some Wall Street utility analysts, anticipating market competition, have come up with new ways to rate utility companies to reflect the potential impact of retail wheeling.
Standard & Poor's, for example, now rates utilities by considering a variety of factors, including the company's management and financial performance, rates, customer base, regulatory climate and fuel availability. Among those that Standard & Poor's sees as vulnerable to competition is the Detroit Edison Company in Michigan, which has many power-hungry industrial customers that might be attractive to jealous outsiders willing to offer cut-rate electricity.
By contrast, Standard & Poor's places LG&E among the top 25 utilities that S.& P. deems well positioned to cope with impending competition because of their low operating costs.
Mr. Hale, however, intends to do much more than cope with competition by defending LG&E's home territory. He's eager to take his company on the offensive by "consolidating sources of supply and then going after the customers of the high-cost producers."
 
 
 
WHY LG&E BROKE THE MOLD
IN turning to an outsider from the telephone industry four years ago, the board of LG&E faced a delicate task.
Its president and chief executive since 1978, Robert L. Royer, was soon to retire. There was a consensus that new management was needed to prepare the utility for a more free-wheeling era.
"Ours was viewed as a progressively managed company," recalled David Grisson, an outside board member who was chairman of the search committee. "The last thing we wanted to do was to disrupt that."
The choice: Roger W. Hale, now 50, a veteran of the old Bell System. After the A.T.& T. breakup in 1984 he had been a vice president of marketing at one of the Baby Bells, the Bellsouth Corporation.
Mr. Hale took over as LG&E president in June 1989 and became chairman the next year, when he formed a holding company, the LG&E Energy Corporation.
What Mr. Hale inherited at LG&E was a well-run utility with 4,500 employees. Marketing was rarely a priority, and competition almost unheard of.
Mr. Hale, hearing the demands of big customers and perceiving that regulatory changes lay ahead, cut costs and jobs. He trimmed management by 175 positions and the overall work force by about 25 percent, bringing total employment to the current 3,000.
To help gain experience in wholesale energy marketing, LG&E bought a partnership in the Natural Gas Clearinghouse of Houston, the largest independent gas marketing company in the country, with revenues of over $2 billion. LG&E has also made some key acquisitions, buying independent power plants from the Hadson Corporation of Irvine, Calif., to give LG&E supplies on the West and East Coasts in addition to its home market in Louisville, Ky.
All of these moves have involved only about $100 million in cash, while adding little debt to the company. For the first nine months of this year LG&E had revenue of $890.2 million -- 15 percent higher than in the comparable period last year -- and net income of $88.6 million, an increase of 26 percent.
With the main pieces of his strategy falling into place, Mr. Hale must now wait to see if his notion of the industry's wheeling-and-dealing future proves to be a sharp-eyed vision, or a mirage. Either way, he says, he is certain of one thing: "There will be pressure by which the industry will become more competitive -- and more efficient."

HEADLINE: Police Wonder at Silence in Suicide-for-Hire

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SUMMIT, Ill., Dec. 11

 BODY:
Susan Potempa was battered to death in her garage while her husband and son were out of town for a Thanksgiving football game. At first, the police called her death a random act of violence.
Then an even more disturbing story unfolded. Investigators say that the 50-year-old woman, wracked by pain after a mastectomy for breast cancer, asked at least four neighborhood men about arranging a murder before finding an unemployed 18-year-old who killed her for $2,100 in cash. 
 The teen-ager, Reginald Williams, is in custody. But even as they pursue the criminal case, the police are wondering why neighbors of this blue-collar Chicago suburb who knew Mrs. Potempa well did not realize how desperate she was, and why the men who refused to help her find a hit man did not come forward.
"I've seen murders for 36 years," said Chief Anthony Corbo of the Summit Police Department. "I've seen bloodier and more gruesome murders, but never a murder like this with the 'for hire' aspects and so many people had inklings of it and not come forward. I find it hard to believe that people would keep to themselves and not pick up the phone."
The police learned of Mr. Williams, who lives less than three blocks from the Potempas, after he told a friend he had killed Mrs. Potempa.
The friend contacted the police and agreed to tape a conversation with Mr. Williams, leading to his arrest on Monday. The youth is in jail on a charge of first-degree murder in lieu of $350,000 bond.
"The victim's willingness to be murdered is irrelevant," said the Cook County State's Attorney, Jack O'Malley.
The police said there was no evidence that Mrs. Potempa's family knew of her plans. Nor is there evidence that Mrs. Potempa arranged the killing to preserve insurance benefits, Mr. O'Malley said. Life insurance policies of suicide victims are often automatically canceled.
Mrs. Potempa and her husband, Robert, lived in a split-level house on Selma Street for more than 20 years. They always greeted people with a smile and a wave, neighbors said.
 
'Bump Someone Off'
 A year ago, Mrs. Potempa was found to have breast cancer. She had a mastectomy, but the surgery left her in excruciating pain, said neighbors who often drove her to the hospital when she was too sick to drive herself.
Bob Ingram, who lives a few houses away, said Mrs. Potempa asked him several months ago if he knew anyone who would "bump someone off."
"She didn't mention who it was," Mr. Ingram, 20, told The Daily Southtown newspaper. "I just kind of blew her off. Anytime I'd see her I'd say, 'Yeah, I'll find someone,' but I didn't want nothing to do with it."
The police said that Mrs. Potempa drove Mr. Williams to her house on Thanksgiving night and that Mr. Williams tried to strangle her and left with the $2,100 after she lost consciousness.
But she survived and tracked him down so he could finish the job, the authorities said. The police said Mr. Williams succeeded the second time, strangling her with an electrical cord and hitting her over the head with a power drill.
Mrs. Potempa was found two days later when her son and husband returned from an out-of-town football game. They have refused to talk with reporters.

Australian Director Is Thinking Globally

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
Australian baseball has a long way to go to reach the level of play in this country, but it has something major league baseball doesn't have: a commissioner.
He is John Ostermeyer, and his role as executive director of the Australian Baseball Federation makes him the equivalent of major league baseball's commissioner. It also gives him a platform from which to speak about baseball around the world, and he has been doing that fervently and eloquently in his effort to drag major league club owners into the 21st century of world sports interest. 
 "The world no longer is flat," Ostermeyer said, echoing the title of a talk he gave to the Players Association executive board in Scottsdale, Ariz., last week. "A lot of the baseball hierarchy in the United States has the mentality that baseball stops in New York and Los Angeles. Baseball in its future has to be an international game. We're in deadly combat with soccer and basketball and we're losing the battle."
The battle, Ostermeyer said, is for television opportunities, sponsors, fans. The major leagues, he said, have given the other sports an uncontested shot at those economic elements.
 
Who's Dykstra?
 "Internationally," he said, "baseball is running a poor last to these sports. Ask people in Europe and Asia who Michael Jordan is, who Magic Johnson is, and everybody knows. You say to them, who is Lenny Dykstra, and they don't have an idea."
The large Australian, a businessman himself, criticized the major leagues for "a lack of leadership and vision," adding: "Major league baseball has no global vision, no global plan. I'm not even sure they have a comprehensive plan for themselves."
Ostermeyer found the seeming absence of an international plan especially peculiar in light of the owners' lament that their national television revenue will be slashed to less than half of what it was this year. If they seek other sources of revenue, he said, they should look beyond this country's borders.
"There are more opportunities offshore than in the U.S.," Ostermeyer said. "If you develop the game as a global game, you can double, triple your revenue. You have enormous potential. I strongly believe the future is going to be Europe and Asia. We should be saying where do we want to be by 2005. I don't think the owners think about it. They think about what are we going to do in spring training."
Four years ago, the major leagues created Major League Baseball International to open markets, but Ostermeyer said the subsidiary's bottom line is commercial.
"It seems to me major league baseball is more interested in short-term commercial gain than long-term development," he added.
 
Widening the World Series
 Baseball has developed well enough in other countries, said the former Australian rules football player, that the major leagues should shed what he called the arrogance of playing the World Series with teams from only two countries.
"We should have both a World Series of clubs and a World Cup of Nations," he said. "It would be bigger than the Olympics."
A World Series-World Cup, he suggested, could include the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Cuba, Mexico and Japan with other countries added later. Asians generally, he said, "are improving themselves dramatically."
"Most people see baseball as an American game played internationally," Ostermeyer said. "You should strive to make it an international game played in America. That's when baseball will be successful."
Australia, he said, is probably 10 years away from reaching the level of play other countries have achieved. His federation is an amateur group but also operates a semipro league that eventually will be a full-scale professional league.
If major league clubs haven't discovered international opportunities, they at least have discovered budding talent in Australia. Three or four years ago, Ostermeyer said, maybe three or four Australian players a year would have been signed by major league clubs. But 35 have been signed in the last two years.
Five Australians played in the majors this year: pitcher Graeme Lloyd and catcher Dave Nilsson of Milwaukee, infielder Craig Shipley and pitcher Mark Ettles of San Diego, and pitcher Mark Hutton of the Yankees.
"Australia is the most scouted country outside Latin America," Ostermeyer said.
 
Benes Resigns Himself
 Andy Benes is one-half of an endangered species, but he doesn't want to hold that distinction for long. He was one of only two players -- Tony Gwynn was the other -- who earned more than the major league average salary and finished the season with the San Diego Padres.
"Right after the All-Star break, Randy Smith asked me if I was interested in signing a long-term contract," Benes said, referring to the Padres' then newly appointed general manager. "If I was, he said they would try to come up with something. They said they'd like to sign me but not for what I would be worth in the market. I said that's not what it's about; it's not about money. It's about a commitment to winning. There has to be a commitment to winning, and I haven't seen that. I don't think anyone else has seen that commitment."
The team's No. 1 pitcher, Benes has been sought in trades this off season, but no one has acquired him because no one has been willing to pay the Padres' price.
"We weren't looking to trade the guy," Smith said. "If somebody wanted to come in and knock us over, we'd consider it. But we haven't talked to anyone on Andy in at least three weeks."
Benes, who needs two more seasons before he can be a free agent, recalls that it wasn't long ago that the Padres were close to being a contender, how entering the final month of the 1992 season they actually had a chance to win.
"We had five All-Stars and we didn't have a bad pitching staff," he said. "It's going to be real hard to recover."
Gone are Fred McGriff, Gary Sheffield, Benito Santiago, Tony Fernandez, Darrin Jackson, Bruce Hurst, Greg Harris. In their place are players who earned the minimum salary this year; in fact, 14 of the 28 players on the Padres' roster and disabled list Aug. 31 earned the minimum of $109,000.
"I don't buy the fact that we just want to be competitive," said Benes, a right-hander who had a .500 record (15-15) for a team that had a .377 record (61-101). "They're asking an awful lot out of the personnel we have to play .500, and .500 isn't going to be close to the top of the pack. It doesn't matter if there are eight wild-card spots. That's not going to cut it."
Benes has resigned himself to remaining with the Padres for now, although he would like to pitch for a team with an opportunity to win.
"I won't sign for more than a year," he said. "I thought I was going to be traded during the winter, most likely to the Orioles or the Yankees, but now maybe I'll be traded during the season. I'll be in a situation like McGriff and Sheffield. I want to be in an environment where they will make every effort to win. That's what it's about."
 
Sign of the Times
 Teams aren't the only entities affected by off-season player movement. The Players Association, whose legal efforts created free agency 18 years ago, convened its executive board meeting in Scottsdale, Ariz., last week, and more than one-sixth of the players present, 7 of 39, either had already changed teams since the end of the season or were unsigned free agents.
Charlie O'Brien, the Mets' player representative last season, was at the meeting but not representing the Mets because he has signed with the Atlanta Braves. Rich Monteleone, the Yankees' representative, was there, but he now is a member of the San Francisco Giants.
Casey Candaele (now with Cincinnati) and free agents Scott Sanderson, Walt Weiss, Greg Cadaret and Dennis Rasmussen also are no longer with their 1993 teams.
 
Cuomo's Cap Not in Ring
 With Bud Selig refusing to run if nominated and serve if elected, the owners' search committee presumably continues its search for a commissioner -- 15 months after the owners forced Fay Vincent to abdicate. The committee has not asked Mario M. Cuomo to be a candidate. Cuomo has discouraged any discussion about his being a candidate.
The name of the governor of New York has arisen because he has not declared himself a candidate for re-election next year. But now he has declared himself a noncandidate for the baseball job. In so doing, however, the former minor league center fielder raised a series of relevant questions. The answers or lack of answers to some of them might explain why no eye-catching names have surfaced as candidates.
"There are some important questions anybody would have to ask," Cuomo said. "Do you really want a commissioner? What is a commissioner? What does he or she commission? What is the authority? What is the mission? Are you to be Landis or what?"
"That's the basic problem, if there is one," Cuomo added. "As with most of life, you endanger the chance of success if you dont define the mission."

HEADLINE: Unfair, Jordan

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
It was difficult for me to contain my outrage after reading that Michael Jordan would receive his full $4 million salary for the 1993-94 season from the Chicago Bulls. Certainly, Jordan has given us great moments, but this is certainly not "a gesture of gratitude" by the Bulls but another instance of sticking it to the public under the guise of generosity. 
 While jobs are scarce and bringing my three children to a sports event becomes ever more financially difficult, and greater numbers of homeless are lining the street, what am I being spoon-fed? A retired player (his choice to cease "entertaining" his adoring public) will receive $4 million this year and probably an additional $11.7 million for the remainder of a broken contract.
We've had to deal with huge salaries and skyrocketing ticket prices in a dwindling economy, but when the rich get richer while doing nothing and giving nothing back to the community, the time is right for a more dramatic editorial statement. Maybe the headline should have read: JORDAN $4 Million, Homeless 0.

HEADLINE: Just Another Innocent Abroad?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am astounded by Scott McNealy's naivete. He praises Singapore's low taxes, its mandatory savings instead of social security and says he's "more of a capitalist than ever."
His political outspokenness, however, would not be tolerated in Singapore, whose citizens pay for their economic miracle with a lack of free speech. 
 Believing in some social welfare does not make one an advocate of a centralized socialist government like China's. Yet this seems to be the parallel Mr. McNealy draws. And having no capital-gains tax does not a democracy make. Nor indeed is the freedom to make money the only freedom worth having.

HEADLINE: Recent Job Gains Conceal a Harsh Truth

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your description of recent hiring trends (Business Day, Dec. 2) requires an important caveat. 
 As you note, job gains have been concentrated among managers and administrators, a category that experienced heavy layoffs in this "white-collar recession." But accumulating evidence indicates that the people being hired are not the same people who were let go. Among white-collar workers, layoffs have centered on older men, and to a lesser extent, older women. So far, these men do not appear to have benefited comparably from new job openings.
The sharpest piece of evidence comes from the Census Bureau report on annual earnings. In 1989, 45-54-year-old men with four years of college had average earnings of $42,590, the equivalent today of $47,507. In 1992, similar men averaged $41,898. The 1992 statistics, the latest available, fail to capture changes of the last nine months.
Because the statistics are drawn from national samples, they may contain random error. But they describe a decline in purchasing power -- 12 percent in three years' time -- that is both absolutely large and is far larger than earnings declines among younger, college-educated men and women.
Many recessions in the last half-century were temporary interludes in which the economy before and after the recession looked the same. That is obviously not the case today. While the economy is now replacing many of the white-collar jobs it recently shed, the holders of those jobs appear to be quite different.

Extra Place: Losing All Traces of a Street That Is Barely There

BYLINE: By Bruce Lambert

 BODY:
Extra Place is a flyspeck on the official map of New York City. Indeed, it helps to have a magnifying glass to detect the tiny inlet, on the north side of First Street between the Bowery and Second Avenue. Extra Place is hard to find on foot, too: no signs identify it, nestled behind a row of buildings and looking very much like a driveway.
One legend has it that Extra Place is a leftover sliver of the 110-acre farm of Philip Minthorne, which was divided among his sons after he died in 1802. 
 Now its days are numbered. City officials are "demapping" the street in preparation for the Cooper Square urban renewal project, although it is not going without a fight. Community Board 3 voted on Oct. 26 against demapping Extra Place and the adjacent block of First Street, reflecting opposition to the urban renewal program. The board's vote is not binding.
The City Department of Housing Preservation and Development's $33 million plan calls for renovating 430 apartments and building 560 new ones by 1998 as a mixture of market-rate and subsidized units for people of low, moderate and middle incomes.
Extra Place is just one of the streets periodically added to or subtracted from the official map by the City Planning Commission. Streets were created, for example, when Battery Park City was developed on landfill. And the construction of Lincoln Center eliminated parts of several side streets.
"Street changes are one of the most important things we do, and the process is quite involved," said Lonnie Soury, a commission spokesman. Like other proposed changes, the demapping of Extra Place will have to be reviewed by city agencies, including the police, fire, ambulance and sanitation departments, and checked for complications involving sewers, water lines and other utilities.
The next step, a uniform land-use review, takes at least seven months, after which the commission votes. The City Council has the right to overrule. Once a change is made, it is logged into a computer and incorporated into printings of the city's evolving map.

Trying to Revive La Marqueta

BYLINE: By NINA REYES

 BODY:
A generation ago, the enclosed marketplace straddling Park Avenue between 111th and 116th Streets was vibrant. Crowds surged through the aisles of the five big buildings known collectively as La Marqueta, haggling over the price of platanos. Vendors trumpeted in Spanish the freshness of their eggs, the tenderness of their pork.
Today, only about a dozen merchants, including two butchers, a clothier, a fishmonger and a perfumer, are housed in the single market building that remains open. On a recent Saturday afternoon, the market's busiest time, only a handful of shoppers strolled the cavernous corridors. But now there is hope in El Barrio that La Marqueta will have a new beginning. Three community organizations are vying for a $5 million contract with the city to rejuvenate the site, and a decision is expected this week. 
 "It has to be redeveloped," said Donald J. Cogsville, the president of the state-financed Harlem Urban Development Corporation, which has urged renovation of the market for nearly a decade. "La Marqueta was the center of life, not only shopping life, but also the social life and other interactions within that community."
In the mid 1980's, a developer proposed a $7.5 million renovation of the market, but the project fell through, as did another plan two years ago. Most recently, the Economic Development Corporation, which manages La Marqueta, spent $850,000 on renovations required to keep open the only market building operating.
In their proposals, the three organizations competing for the rehabilitation contract call for spending $12 million to $15 million, including city money and, they hope, state and Federal contributions.
The phoenix that the community organizations propose to raise from the ashes of La Marqueta includes a movie theater, a day-care center, a catering hall, a two-tiered parking lot and space for public meetings. The open-air concept of the Quincy Market complex in Boston is regularly invoked, as is the appeal to tourists of a Hispanic market. One proposal has even suggested that Metro North, which roars by overhead, make La Marqueta a regular station stop.
"You're talking about a major redesign so that La Marqueta becomes the center of commerce," said Yolanda Sanchez, the director of the Puerto Rican Association for Community Affairs, one group under consideration for the contract.
But cynicism runs deep. "The chances of this even being renovated in my lifetime are poor," said Bernard Lifschultz, who has operated a deli there for more than 40 years, and who represented merchants on a task force sponsored by the Economic Development Corporation studying La Marqueta.
Mary Colon, a clothier whose stall is flanked by an unoccupied, gated booth on one side and by a dry-goods grocery on the other, said she had taken in just $13 the whole day.
"It's busy for meat, but not for clothes," she said, gesturing toward the butcher chopping a rack of ribs across the way. "I don't know how I'm going to pay my rent."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Hillary Rodham Clinton Strikes a New Pose And Multiplies Her Images

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT was a running joke among reporters during the 1992 Democratic convention in New York: If you really want to get your head bitten off, go ask Susan Thomases, Hillary Clinton's friend and adviser, what fashion statement Mrs. Clinton wanted to make.
"Clothes," Ms. Thomases told one reporter, with a contemptuous laugh, "are not something I think about." 
 Hillary Clinton was billed in those days as a woman who bought dresses from sale racks and didn't give a fig for fashion. (Her wedding dress was plucked from a rack on the eve of the ceremony.) Substance was all. She came across during the campaign as someone who simply wore whatever Linda Bloodworth-Thomasson, her Hollywood pal, suggested, while she worried about saving the world. As Sarah Phillips, a designer who worked with her, told the Los Angeles Times: "There are more pressing things for her to do than dress up like Vogue."
Yet here is Hillary Clinton dressed up like Vogue in the December issue of that fashion magazine. The Annie Leibowitz photos feature a dishy, dreamy First Lady posing -- head tilted over and blonde hair draped -- like the old Catherine Deneuve perfume ads Johnny Carson loved to mimic. ("Bee-kawz I ehm Catherine Deneuve.")
At the same time, the White House has unveiled the pricey new decor chosen by this First Lady of simple tastes: a swagging and swathing by Kaki Hockersmith of Little Rock, so ablaze in color, texture and pattern that even Belle Watling might feel at home.
So what gives? The Vogue pictures have provoked much comment. Do they help shatter old prejudices in this male-dominated capital that women who are stylish cannot be taken seriously, and that power, in women, is not as alluring as it is in men?
Or do they revive old-fashioned assumptions that even accomplished women secretly want to be desired as beautiful objects?
The pictures hark back to the flap five years ago when first Diane Sawyer in Vanity Fair, and then Meredith Vieira in Esquire, vamped for the camera. The two women were scolded by various pundits for hurting the cause of women in broadcast journalism by encouraging sex-object stereotypes.
"I thought it was a phony issue then and I think it's a phony issue now," Ms. Vieria, an ABC correspondent, says. "Maybe women are more secure now, and being good at one thing doesn't mean you can't be equally good in some other area."
Certainly, Mrs. Clinton's pictures are not overtly sexy; she even refused to wear the $975 Donna Karan black velvet number off-the-shoulder, as it was meant to be worn, and insisted on draping it high like a turtleneck.
But they are, as pictures of First Ladies go, sensual. Britain's Economist magazine ran a story last week on the American First Lady's new "pussycat" look with the headline "Come up and vote for me sometime." In The Irish Times, Conor O'Cleary wrote: "This is Hillary the sex goddess. . . . In one picture she parts her lips suggestively; in another the first lady gazes at the camera with bedroom eyes."
Some people hail the pictures as the pinnacle of Hillary Clinton's campaign to prove that modern woman can be all things -- flinty policymaker and velvety fashion plate. "She could be selling rouge or moisturizing cream, eye liner or hair coloring," Suzanne Fields raved in her syndicated column. "She exudes confidence, competing with models who (like her) can be frivolous, serious, saucy, bossy, testy and temperamental."
Others find Mrs. Clinton's latest incarnation slightly jarring. Having flair while exercising power is a clear step forward. But some regard sultry poses in Vogue as trivializing for a First Lady who has so dramatically outstripped her title.
"It just seems kind of odd," said Michael Deaver, the Reagan imagist, about the concept of a Vogue fashion spread. "Now that she's proven herself as an individual and been tough, why then get back to an image strictly based on femininity?"
THE pictures prove once again that politics and show business are inextricably linked. Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, shrugs off complaints that there is an aura of Hollywood pretension in posing for the celebrity photographer who snapped Rosanne Barr and Tom Arnold mud wrestling and Bette Midler naked in roses.
"Annie Leibowitz photos are works of art," she says. "Comparing them to any other photos is like comparing apples to oranges."
The total effect of Mrs. Clinton's many makeovers -- from the frumpy, hippy, bespectacled look of the 70's to the sleek blond movie star look of the 90's -- has the inherent fascination of one of Hollywood's favorite stock scenes: The hero asks the mousy bookworm to take off her glasses and let down her hair, and then marvels: "Why, Miss Jones, you're beautiful!"
Naomi Wolf argued in her first book, "The Beauty Myth," that women were burdened by trying to live up to impossible expectations about good looks promulgated by a greedy beauty industry. But now, her tune changed, she says that the glossy Vogue shots put the First Lady at the forefront of "a spontaneous uprising" among women who refuse to let men define their sexuality.
"Women are eager to affirm the fact that female sexuality should no longer be perceived as undermining female authority but complementing it," said Ms. Wolf, who publicizes her new book, "Fire With Fire," with glamorous photos of her own. "Now women are beginning to define power and eros as being interlinked in women. Women won't be reading the many faces of Hillary Clinton as an impossible image to live up to, but as a liberating affirmation of how multi-faceted the female consciousness is."
Proving that power, for women, can be as much of an aphrodisiac as Henry Kissinger always claimed it was for men was the effect that Donna Karan sought in her magazine ad featuring a female political candidate riding through a ticker-tape parade with her suit open and a black lace undergarment peeking beneath an unbuttoned shirt.
Lisa Schiffren, a former speechwriter for Dan Quayle, objects to the whole trend. "To use sexuality that way is totally inappropriate in public office," she said.
Those who like the Vogue pictures marvel at Mrs. Clinton's Madonna-like ability to offer a kaleidoscope of images, feeding the short attention span of a channel-surfing, celebrity-hungry electorate. Her admirers say that she has adroitly helped the country adjust to the notion of a First Lady sharing power with her husband by periodically doling out softer, more traditional images like hostess, mother and wife.
But some complain that her cascading images -- changing hairstyles so many times, testifying on the Hill about health care one minute and chatting happily about Christmas baking the next, now adding Rodham to her name, now posing for fashion layouts -- are dizzying and unsettling, and suggest that the 46-year-old First Lady still wakes up every day struggling to create a persona.
"It doesn't feel genuine," said Sheila Tate, who worked as an aide to Nancy Reagan and George Bush.
SOME strategists who know Mrs. Clinton say that she is going through a natural evolution, as she is compelled to pay more attention to her style by a country obsessed with the First Lady's style.
On the campaign, Rosalynn Carter washed her drip dry suits and hung them in the shower to dry; she arrived at the White House with a sewing machine, and the fashion photographer Horst P. Horst once said that when he took Mrs. Carter's portrait for Vogue, her skirt hem was so uneven that he had to ask her to hold a bunch of lilies in her lap to disguise it. Soon she was having her hair done every day and asking her friends where she could get Oscar de la Renta wholesale.
The Vogue article notes that Mrs. Clinton asked to buy the black velvet designer evening gown she wore in the pictures. Vic Gold, who wrote speeches for George Bush, observed approvingly that Mrs. Clinton "has realized there is a certain glamor to her, and she likes it."
There are plenty of historical precedents. When she was 80, Golda Meir was sitting for an official portrait. Eager to find a pose that was dignified and noble, the artist shyly asked, "Madame Prime Minister, how would you like me to paint you?" Equally shyly, the matriarch of Israel suggested: Try to make me look pretty.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Julia Roberts, After the Layoff and With Lyle

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Between wildfires, earthquakes, race riots and a debilitating recession, the city of illusion has been looking a little sad of late. So there is a palpable cheer around Hollywood now that the highest paid actress in the world -- for the moment -- is back in town, generating all kinds of economic activity, grist for the professional gossips and old-fashioned movie star incandescence.
Two years after she made her last film and fell into a tabloid twilight zone over her personal life, Julia Roberts is starring in three new productions, the first of which is Alan J. Pakula's adaptation of John Grisham's legal thriller "The Pelican Brief," opening on Friday. 
 Her face is all over billboards and bus stops this month, the dark, tentative eyes of a woman who is on the run from bad guys in the movie and predatory paparazzi in real life.
At present, she is somewhere in the fortress of International Creative Management, where her agents are giving her last-minute tips on what not to say to a reporter. Which is a bit incongruous, because she has spent the last month and a half trying to learn how to ask questions like a reporter, in the role she is now filming as a Chicago newspaper writer opposite Nick Nolte in "I Love Trouble."
(Tip to Ms. Roberts: Always carry an extra set of batteries for your tape recorder and never believe what publicists say, especially if it's off the record.)
A wall to the office of the I.C.M. agent Elaine Goldsmith slides open -- a very secretive, James Bond kind of door -- and there is Ms. Roberts, in cutoffs, moccasins and modified ponytail, all of 26 years old. Her agents disappear, the sun goes down, and for the next two and a half hours she talks about life as a media caricature and as a new bride to the singer Lyle Lovett. The formerly reticent star seems eager to talk.
Considering that she has been working 12-hour days virtually nonstop for the last half-year, she looks, well . . . vibrant. Her skin is as clear as one of those High Sierra streams where the rare golden trout still swim, and her legs stretch from here to eternity. She volunteers a hair color -- chestnut -- to describe the mane that drove men crazy in "Pretty Woman," the film that made her a global star with more than $400 million in worldwide ticket sales.
One of only a handful of actors who can make or break studio heads, Ms. Roberts is now getting more than $8 million a picture. That sort of price comes with the status of being able to "open" a movie, which means that no matter how bad the film may be, enough people will buy tickets in the first few days of its release to guarantee cost recovery. But the downside is that she exists at a celebrity level where gas station attendants are supposed to care about the tiniest details of her personal life. In that sense, she is both a victim of all the hyper-press that reached a frenzy when she canceled her wedding to the actor Kiefer Sutherland two years ago -- and a beneficiary.
"They say I can open movies, and that's nice in that it puts it into people's minds that women can do it," she said, her legs curled in a chair. "It's not just Kevin Costner, not just Arnold Schwarzenegger. Not just the guys."
She is less comfortable with the public-property aspect of her rarefied status.
"People talk about this Julia Roberts almost like it's a thing, almost like it's a cup of Pepsi," she said. "People think Julia Roberts is something they created. The fact is, 26 years ago there was this scrunched up little pink baby named Julia Roberts." She was actually born Julie, but never mind. "I am a girl," she said, "like anybody else."
Her father, who died when she was 9, was a vacuum cleaner salesmen, and her mother was church secretary. At home, they staged and acted in plays, infusing the three Roberts children with a love of entertaining. She was only a few years out of high school in Smyrna, Ga., when the modest 1988 film "Mystic Pizza" made her a celebrity of the promising variety. It took some getting used to.
"I was in the bathroom somewhere, and this girl followed me and said, 'Excuse me, girl in stall No. 1.'
"I said, 'Yeaaah?'
"She said, 'You were in Mystic Pizza.'
"I said, 'Yeah?'
"She said, 'Can I have your autograph?'
"I said, 'I'm a little tied up right now.' "
For her next film, "Steel Magnolias," Ms. Roberts received an Academy Award nomination. The director of that movie, Herbert Ross, has since criticized her work as one-dimensional, suggesting she should take formal acting lessons. She fired back, but has now decided to call a truce.
Another Oscar nomination came with "Pretty Woman," the fairy-tale story of a Hollywood hooker who spends the weekend with Richard Gere. It was followed by "Sleeping With the Enemy," where she is brutalized by an obsessive husband. Some critics laughed at the premise, but the film drew a huge audience. Then came "Dying Young," a disappointment, and "Hook," which was widely dismissed as a mess, though the blame was laid on the director, Steven Spielberg.
In 1991, Ms. Roberts went through what Ms. Goldsmith refers to as her "Fellini summer," in which she was variously reported to have had a nervous breakdown, been on drugs and romanced several men, all the while feuding with Mr. Spielberg on the set of "Hook." None of it was true, Ms. Roberts said. She played Tinkerbell, but some of the gossip columns referred to her as Tinkerhell.
It was not her most pleasant acting experience; much of the time she was strapped into what she calls "industrial bicycle shorts," which was hooked up to a wire so she could fly. When they shrunk her for the film, she looked at times like a confused horsefly.
"I felt like I had a nice rapport with Steven, yet his depiction of it makes me feel like I'm mistaken," she said with a sigh. "I guess that's just too bad. You know, it may be too much to ask to be in a harness and creative at the same time."
Now, with a cushion of rest between her and that summer, she says she is not at all bitter or angry.
"What people perceive that summer to be is for me a tale of fiction spun way out of control," she said. Yes, she was going to marry Kiefer Sutherland on the Fox Studio lot and three days before the wedding called it off. From then on, her every footstep was monitored, analyzed, speculated upon.
The last two years, she said, "have been two of the most incredible years of my life." She traveled extensively, read more books than screenplays, nurtured old friendships, and -- six months ago -- married Mr. Lovett, a Texas crooner with an original haircut.
"He's really a tremendous man, and he's shown a great deal of courage in marrying me," she said, a dimpled smile spreading across her face. Ms. Roberts said he has had to endure the glare of the public eye. "That's part and parcel of my life, and he's done it with great, distinguishing effort." The butt of jokes that compare him to Woody Woodpecker and sustain David Letterman monologues, Mr. Lovett, 36, has also found a wider audience for his music.
"We're pretending to be a normal couple," Ms. Roberts said. "We get up in the morning and go to our jobs. He goes to the studio to cut a record, I go to the studio to make a movie." On Thanksgiving, she cooked a turkey in Los Angeles for his family, who came up from Texas.
They consider New York home. "We can be walking down Sixth Avenue early in the morning and people will come by and say, 'Hey, congratulations!' But then there are people who talk about my wedding dress looking like a tablecloth, too."
Her role model in the celebrity game is another New Yorker -- Jacqueline Onassis. "How this woman has kept her composure, with what the tabloid shows have done to John F. Kennedy, is unbelievable," she said. "This woman is nobility personified."
By contrast, Ms. Roberts has to fight her own sense of defiance and outrage. "I've become very irate watching the news," she said. "It has gotten so bad here in L.A. The other night, they kept running these blurbs: Tonight at 11, Kiefer Sutherland responds to 'Pretty Woman' 's talk with Barbara Walters. They were setting this up to such a point I started to get nervous. And of course it was just a clip from Kiefer's press junket of 'Three Musketeers,' him commenting on the state of publicity."
She works with Denzel Washington, the actor best known for his appearance last year as "Malcolm X," in "The Pelican Brief." He plays a dignified, heroic investigative reporter who follows up her character's theory about the assassination of Supreme Court justices. Mr. Pakula said it was Ms. Roberts's idea to cast Mr. Washington, who also stars with Tom Hanks in "Philadelphia," which opens later this month.
In "The Pelican Brief," Ms. Roberts plays a Tulane law student named Darby Shaw, the girlfriend of an alcoholic professor played by Sam Shepard. In the book, Mr. Grisham introduced Darby's character this way: "For two brutal years now, one of the few pleasures of law school had been to watch as she graced the halls and rooms with her long legs and baggy sweaters. There was a fabulous body in there somewhere, they could tell. But she was not one to flaunt it."
Nor does Mr. Pakula flaunt it. "The Pelican Brief" makes only minimal use of the physical attributes of the star. Instead the movie follows a tangled plot, bound by a long, conspiratorial rope.
Mr. Pakula owned the rights to the book even before it was written, he said. Ms. Roberts agreed to do the part after reading galleys. Filming in New Orleans and Washington last summer was as close to a perfect experience as she has had in show business.
"I'm telling you, this was a dream," she said. "Everybody. Denzel, Sam, Alan. You feel justified in holding out for something that pays off."
Mr. Pakula, who has directed such stars as Warren Beatty, Harrison Ford, Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, said he found it very easy to work with Ms. Roberts.
"She gave everything," said Mr. Pakula. "By the end, she had earned the respect of the entire crew. Julia responds to the other actors, which is what the best people do."
She is midway through filming "I Love Trouble," a romantic comedy about rival Chicago newspaper reporters. In the movie, which is an attempt to re-create some of the sexual tension of films like "Woman of the Year," with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, Ms. Roberts trades one-liners with a crusty, older newspaperman, played by Mr. Nolte. Of course, this sort of thing goes on all the time in the newspaper business.
Like other actresses who have played opposite Mr. Nolte, Ms. Roberts has had to get used to his sometimes crude behavior. "From the moment I met him we sort of gave each other a hard time," she said, "and naturally we get on each other's nerves." While he can be "completely charming and very nice," she said, "he's also completely disgusting. He's going to hate me for saying this, but he seems go out of his way to repel people. He's a kick."
Charles Shyer, who is directing the film, is aglow over working with Ms. Roberts. "We were looking at film the other day and our editor said, 'She's got it,' " said Mr. Shyer. "I think Julia would have been a movie star in the 30's, 40's, in any era. There is a magic there with her. You just go, 'Wow -- this is what it is all about.' And she looks unbelievably great. We wanted her to be very stylish, like Julia hasn't looked in any other movie."
A THIRD NEW FILM, "MARY Reilly," a period movie based on Valerie Martin's novel about a maidservant to Dr. Jekyll (of Mr. Hyde fame), is set for production next spring. (Think "The Remains of the Day" meets "Frankenstein" in the 1800's.) Stephen Frears, the British film maker whose work ranges from "My Beautiful Laundrette" to "Dangerous Liaisons," will direct. For those critics who say Ms. Roberts tends to play wide-eyed victims in mainstream films, a prestigious project like "Mary Reilly" will throw them a curve, she says. "It's not exactly a day at the Venice Mall," she said.
Ms. Roberts has been somewhat typecast by "Pretty Woman," a character who is most appealing when her hair is big and her laugh is deep. Such pigeonholing doesn't bother her. "I started out being Julia-Eric Roberts-Sister," she said. "Then I was Julia-Mystic Pizza-Roberts. So getting saddled with 'Pretty Woman' is not the worst moment of my life."
Nor is she upset by criticism from feminists who say she glorified prostitution in the movie. "What are you going to do? You can't please everybody. That movie was a fairy tale. We did everything but put a glass slipper on. And I'll tell you something else: For $3,000 a weekend, Richard Gere got a bargain."
The pressure on Ms. Roberts will begin to build again with "Pelican Brief" opening this week. "Unless you open with a huge first weekend, they say you're a flop," she said. "It's unfair to a lot of movies."
She passed on "Sleepless in Seattle," which boosted the star status of Meg Ryan. But she says she has no regrets. The same hold true for the last two years.
"I'm not a big regretter," she said. "I always say, 'Worries many. Regrets none.' "

HEADLINE: Smaller Architects Find Their Niche

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
NEIL MURPHY is not the first architect who has been asked to do something extra to please a client. But he is probably one of few who has ever been asked to scratch a client's tongue.
 The client in question was a young beluga whale at the Aquarium for Wildlife Conservation in Coney Island, where Mr. Murphy is working on a permanent tent-like structure to cover the 180,000-gallon oceanic tank. Greeting the architect, the whale opened its mouth wide. 
By the time Mr. Murphy learned that this was a request for a scratch, it was too late to oblige. But he looks forward to getting another chance. After all, the firm for which he is a consultant, Goldstone & Hinz of Manhattan, takes a whale's needs very seriously. It should. Two-thirds of its work is devoted to zoos and aquariums.
 Goldstone & Hinz is one of numerous specialized architectural offices that bring a particular strength to the drafting table -- and comfort to anxious clients -- in a day of proliferating regulations and computerization. They must be conversant not only with esthetics and engineering, but with technology, sociology and, in some cases, biology as well.
 "You have two sets of clients: the animals and the people," said Theodore V. Hinz, a partner in the Manhattan-based practice. "Animals will tell you right away if they like the exhibit. Many times, we call in a biologist to discuss the animals' characteristics, how they live in nature."
 Robots come into the picture, too. For instance, Shepley Bulfinch Richardson & Abbott of Boston is looking at automatic retrieval systems that could increase by 10 or 20 times a library's storage capacity, with robotic devices pulling bar-coded storage bins off shelves up to 30 feet high.
 Unfortunately, there goes browsing.
 "This is highly controversial," allowed Geoffrey T. Freeman, a principal at Shepley Bulfinch, "but because of the costs of brick and mortar, space has to be for people. We've got to be inventive as to how we house these collections."
 Tracing its lineage to the office of Henry Hobson Richardson, the late 19th-century giant of American architecture, Shepley Bulfinch can claim to have been designing libraries since 1877, when Richardson's Oliver Ames Free Library was begun in North Easton, Mass.
"They really know how university libraries work and don't work," said Dr. Brian J. Byrne, vice president for administration at Fordham University, for which Shepley Bulfinch is designing a new library. "They were selected in a national search for firms that specialize in university library design."
 THE firm has a dozen such projects under way, including the renovation of Butler Library at Columbia University and Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University.
 In fact, with so many projects, Mr. Freeman said, Shepley Bulfinch sometimes has to reassure potential clients at interviews whose first comment is, "You're obviously too busy to work on our project."
 Clients are not the only ones who seek specialized architects. Sometimes, firms with more general practices will ally themselves with offices whose focus is more concentrated. That is what happened on an expansion project for the Duchess County Detention Center in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
 In that case, the firm of Gruzen Samton joined with Ricci Architect, a five-year-old office headed by Kenneth Ricci, which devotes about 30 percent of its practice to jails and prisons and 40 percent to courthouses.
 "The reason I asked Ken Ricci to join us," Jordan Gruzen said, "was to supplement our extensive background with his up-to-date experience with technology and codes.
 "I think clients generally look for an expert," Mr. Gruzen continued. "They often get well-known design firms combining with an expert. It's happening in the court field and it's happening to some degree in education."
 Medical buildings also require a high level of technical expertise.
 "Health care is so codified and regulated, it requires not only preliminary footwork but ongoing education with new medical procedures and code requirements," said Lenore Lucey, executive director of the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects.
 "Magnetic resonance machines became a whole new question," she said. "Where do you put them, how do you shield them, how do they relate to the rest of the building?"
 There has been a movement within the architects' group to create a specially certified class of hospital architects, but Ms. Lucey said that would pose problems.
 "It's been a hotly debated subject -- specialization," she said. "There are a lot of people who feel it makes you too narrow, too focused. There are a lot of people who don't want there to be a credential, i.e., 'I'm a certified hospital designer,' because they feel that would be anticompetitive. The A.I.A. has to be very careful about anything that might restrain trade."
 If the American Institute of Architects created a hospital-designer category, it might put at a disadvantage smaller firms that had neither the time nor the staff to go through the required training.
 "In theory," Ms. Lucey said, "any architect you have should be able to solve any problem you have."
 However, she also noted, "The firms that have been least devastated over the last two years are probably those with the largest backlog of educational, criminal justice and health-related work."
 "Institutions have a different kind of funding that allows them to continue to build, even if the commercial real-estate market has gone down the tubes," she said. "There is an insulation in being involved in the institutional aspect that's probably helpful."
 IN the last year, Goldstone & Hinz has finished two of the biggest jobs it has ever done, Mr. Hinz said, for NYZS/The Wildlife Conservation Society (the renamed New York Zoological Society).
 One is the new Sea Cliffs exhibit at the Aquarium for Wildlife Conservation (formerly the New York Aquarium) in Coney Island. The other is the renovated Prospect Park Wildlife Center (formerly the Prospect Park Zoo) in Brooklyn.
 Sea Cliffs is a 340-foot long series of pools for walruses, harbor seals, fur seals, sea otters and black-footed penguins. What looks to be a natural landscape around the pools is, in fact, sprayed-on concrete that has either been carved, embossed or molded into rock-like form, complete with fissures. "Sea Cliffs doesn't look like a building," Mr. Hinz said, "but there's a building under there."
 Understanding the animals, Mr. Hinz said, means knowing that fur seals spend most of their lives in water and do not need much in the way of beach, or "haul-out area." On the other hand, he said: "Walruses like to sun themselves on big, rocky coasts, so we give them a lot of haul-out area. The same with penguins. They like a lot of beach."
 And dolphins have to go to Florida for the winter, Mr. Hinz said, which is why the aquarium asked for a tent-like structure to cover the oceanic pool, so they can be kept at Coney Island year-round.
 One of the advantages in building during a depressed period is that contractors are willing to cut overhead and take less profit.
 But Mr. Hinz said, "We've found, quite honestly, that not-for-profit institutions that do this sort of work are going to build when they need to, whatever the economy is."
 Asked about the state of the market for his specialty, Mr. Freeman said: "There seems to be a resurgence of commitment to libraries. It's wonderful for libraries and it's great for us." (In dollar volume, academic projects do not even account for a majority of Shepley Bulfinch's work, about 50 to 60 percent of which is in the medical field.)
 Is this the last round of major library expansion? "With electronic access and the wiring of campuses," Mr. Freeman said, "a lot of trustees will say, 'Why do we need more space in the libraries?' "
 To which he provides the answer: "Libraries will have technology that will never be in the dorms. People are going to libraries because more and more study is collaborative. The library is also a social center and you've got to recognize it."
 Traditionally, too, libraries have been physically at the center of campus, an important symbolic role. But new libraries cannot always be placed at the heart of the university. "Generally," Mr. Freeman said, "spaces in the center of campuses aren't available."
 Fordham's new library, for example, had to be placed at the southwest edge of the Rose Hill campus in the Bronx. In that place, it had to play two roles.
 "WHEN you approach the campus from that side, it looks like a public park," said Ralph T. Jackson, a Shepley Bulfinch principal. Fordham officials, he said, "were looking for the library to provide the edge of town and gown while, on the campus side, to provide a form that would welcome people in." In plan, the L-shaped building seems to open its arms to the campus.
 Its tower not only marks its presence on campus but "is very important symbolically because it has to do with the revitalization" of the surrounding area, said Alexander Howe, another Shepley Bulfinch principal.
 When designing or renovating libraries, Mr. Freeman said, Shepley Bulfinch begins with the notion of a railroad-like hub from which users can be directed quickly and efficiently to stacks, reading rooms, reference areas and special collections.
 There are any number of tensions to be resolved. While natural lighting enhances reading rooms, for example, it is inhospitable to the proliferating computer screens. And architects try to keep the size of study areas to fewer than 20 students. Otherwise, Mr. Howe said, "it tends to become a party."
 To cope with changing technology, Mr. Freeman said, "the building has to be spatially flexible -- that's our first line of defense." At the same time, he said: "There still has to be a sense of awe to a library. This is not a dispensary."
 "We're trying to design around the activity of using information, rather than the storage of information," Mr. Freeman said. "In the past, you would design a library with its stacks and then put in readers. As the collections expanded, readers went out. We're going to see, over time, readers expanding at the expense of the collection."
 A key, he said, was to determine how large a core collection was needed for ready reference and "browsability."
 Planning is also critical to jail and prison design, Mr. Ricci said. When county commissioners ask the architects how big a jail will have to be --visions of community opposition and budget overruns no doubt in mind -- he might answer, "We can make it smaller if you improve court administration."
 "We try to control costs based on our knowledge of the inmates," Mr. Ricci said. "Where inmates are present but under close scrutiny, you need medium security. Only in the areas where inmates are along for long periods do you need high security."
 THE cost implications are considerable. High-security windows --glass-polycarbonate-glass sandwiches in heavy steel frames -- can cost five times as much as simple tempered glass. High-security ceilings -- two-and-a-half inches of portland cement and wire mesh -- can cost four times as much as a laid-in tile ceiling.
 "I'm a firm believer in hiring a criminal-justice architect," said Raymond J. Klein, the assistant warden at the Westchester County Department of Corrections complex in Valhalla, N.Y., for which Mr. Ricci designed the multipurpose building.
 "When you hire a criminal-justice architect, you don't have to waste your time -- or money," Mr. Klein said. "What if the architect doesn't know the difference between a Folger Adam paracentric lock and an Air Teq pneumatic system? I'm not paying him to go to school."
 Inexperienced architects may err on the side of too much security. Mr. Klein recalled a project in which a local architect had specified "windows that looked like San Quentin -- in a women's prison."
 There are many specific concerns in this field of design. For example, Mr. Ricci looks for ways to allow maintenance crews to reach plumbing, heating and ventilating systems without going into secured areas, "where they might misplace a tool or leave a door open."
 In one project, this was accomplished through a basement tunnel. In another, it was done through a catwalk under the roof.
 One of the cardinal dimensions in the design of jails and prisons, Mr. Ricci said, is five-and-a-half inches for any opening.
 "That is the dimension below which 99 percent of the inmate population cannot fit their craniums," he said, even if they can contort the rest of their bodies to squeeze through the opening. "The study of phrenology is still alive and well," Mr. Ricci added.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC PULSE: The Great Plains;
Plains, While Still Bleak, Offer a Chance to the Few

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WILD HORSE, Colo.

 BODY:
Survival has always demanded ingenuity in the Great Plains, where 19th-century settlers, making do without timber and nails, used mud and grass to build their homes.
 Today vast stretches of this region are about as lonesome as they were a century ago. But some small economic miracles, born of creative ideas and the willingness to take a chance, are thriving in the scrub and dust of America's least populated quarter. 
Farmers in North Dakota, who produce the bulk of the nation's durum wheat used for spaghetti, have pooled their resources and built a pasta-making plant, which opened two weeks ago near Jamestown.
 
Buying Cattle From Home
 A livestock dealership in Brush, Colo., using television satellite dishes, now broadcasts cattle auctions so ranchers can inspect heifers from the comfort of their living rooms.
 An outdoor-gear catalogue retailer, looking for ways to provide distinctive service from its headquarters in tiny Sidney, Neb., gives its customers a toll-free number to call with any question about outdoor sports, and requires all of its workers to pass a hunting and fishing test.
 Meatpacking plants in western Kansas are increasing production by relying largely on hard-working immigrants from Mexico and Vietnam. And the Sioux in South Dakota recently broke ground on a big gambling casino that will provide jobs for hundreds of unemployed Indians.
 
Towns Falling Away
 But for every economic boom on the Great Plains, there are far more little places, like Wild Horse, that are falling silent. Signs of recovery in the national economy, while raising some hopes here, generally loom as distant as the jets that streak the sky over this region on their way to someplace else.
 Wild Horse, about 100 miles southeast of Denver, was once a thriving town of about 200 people. Over the generations, it survived fire, dust storms and tornadoes. A picture taken in 1917 shows a town radiating with promise, faces smiling and hands clapping to a brass band blaring on Main Street. But in a national economy that has outgrown its use for such tiny, far-flung places, Wild Horse is not likely to survive much longer. Only 13 people live here now, and all but two of them are over 65 years old.
 Abandoned houses creak in the wind and boarded stores sit empty. Only a gas station with a flea market, the Unicorn, remains open. And the handful of survivors fear the day when the name of Wild Horse will be erased from the map.
 The Great Plains, the flat, shadowless sweep from Canada to Mexico, between the eastern foothills of the Rockies and the 98th meridian, a line that cuts just west of Wichita, Kan., covers one-fifth of the United States, but accounts for just one-fortieth of its population.
 And across much of the Plains, the numbers are shrinking. In Nebraska, for example, 83 of the state's 93 counties lost population in the 1980's, and almost all the winners were near Omaha, east of the Plains.
 A century ago, the Census Bureau marked an area "settled" when it had more than six people per square mile, and the historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared the American Frontier to be closed. But today, in about 200 counties on the Great Plains, the population density has fallen below that frontier threshold.
 
Rural America Writ Large
 "What is happening to rural America generally is writ large in the Great Plains," said Mark Drabenstott, a vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City, Mo. But unlike towns in rural regions like the Corn Belt of the Middle West or the dairy farms of New England, he said, many towns in the Great Plains sit in such isolation that further decline means they risk disappearing.
 Mr. Drabenstott explained that if a school closes in Iowa, where towns are much closer, there is likely to be another school 10 or 15 miles down the road. But here in Cheyenne County, with a population of 2,400, the school in Kit Carson is already serving an area of 1,000 square miles. It is not uncommon for children in the Great Plains to spend two hours each way on the school bus. And when a school closes in such a remote place, families must move, rather than opt for an even more distant school, since a school bus ride can only get so long.
 "In many of these little towns on the Plains," Mr. Drabenstott said, "we're reaching the point where the noose has begun to concentrate the mind."
 Over all, population in the Great Plains has been slowly increasing, the result of the growth of a handful of cities. But in the rural counties, the population has fallen more than 15 percent since 1930.
 That decline poses a stark contrast to the current economic booms farther West. In the mountainous regions of western Montana, for example, movie stars and rich Californians are buying ranches and donning leather chaps and cowboy hats. But on the Plains in the eastern part of Montana, where real cowboys wear soiled and wrinkled hats, plenty of old ranch houses are sitting empty.
 "The celebrities only want country that's drop-dead pretty," said Diane Kuhlbacher, a rancher in flat-as-the-floor northeastern Wyoming, which has been untouched by the rapid growth of Jackson and other places across the state near the Tetons. "We think our Plains are pretty, too, but it's the kind of pretty that has to grow on you."
 
Images of the Steppes
 The Great Plains includes parts of 10 states: Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. But no one state lies entirely within the Plains. Two major cities sit at its edges, Denver and San Antonio. The biggest city that sits on the Plains is Lubbock, Tex., with a population of 186,000.
 The region starts where the rainfall begins to stop -- the average precipitation is less than 25 inches per year -- and where the tall grass of the prairies gives way to short grass. For its scarcity of trees and vegetation, Zebulon Pike and other 19th-century explorers dubbed the Plains the Great American Desert. It has also been called America's Empty Quarter and America's steppes. It has the hottest summers, the coldest winters and the shortest growing season of any section of the country. And its ceaseless winds have literally driven some people mad.
 Home for centuries to the Sioux, the Great Plains was settled by whites largely through the Homestead Act of 1862, which President Abraham Lincoln signed "so that every poor man may have a home." And the settlers came in covered wagons by the millions, only to learn that the 160-acre plots offered by the Government, enough land to support a farm family in the fertile soil of Iowa, were insufficient in arid western Nebraska.
 Citing the long decline of population on the Plains, two geographers at Rutgers University, Frank and Deborah Popper, caused a furor a few years ago when they called for the Government to sweep parts of the region clean of its last inhabitants and turn it into a wildlife park to be called Buffalo Commons.
 But Easterners have been making dire warnings about the Great Plains for more than a century. "What do we want to do with this vast, worthless area?" Daniel Webster asked in 1836.
 In the face of enduring pessimism about their region, the Plains men and women still struggle to carve prosperity out of their rocky soil and wind-whipped small towns, and in some cases they are achieving remarkable success.
 
The Farmers
A Bumper Crop Of Linguini
 Given a choice, most American farmers will plant corn or soybeans, crops that generally bring the most cash per acre. And most farmers in eastern North Dakota, stewards of the rich, black soil that characterizes the Midwest prairies, cultivate vast sections of those crops, along with wheat and sugar beets.
 But on the Plains of the rest of North Dakota, where the rain is stinting, most farmers do not have that choice. They generally stick with wheat, which fares better in the drier climate. The difference between the Plains and the prairies can be measured in crop yields. The average yield of wheat per acre in the far eastern counties of North Dakota is 40.4 bushels; in the central counties, it is 23.5 bushels; in the far western counties, it is 12.2 bushels.
 Like all farmers, the Plains farmers' income can soar or swoop, depending on market prices. In the 1980's, a time when farmers were being clobbered by high interest rates, prices for wheat fell to less than $2 a bushel. The double whammy drove many off the land. The farmers who survived are doing much better today, with rock-bottom interest rates and wheat prices that have fluctuated around $4 a bushel.
 But since the specter of another plunge in prices always haunts them, a group of 1,040 North Dakota wheat farmers got together two years ago to devise a way to cushion their risks. Until lately, the durum wheat produced here was shipped to big mills in Ohio and Pennsylvania and used for pasta. Some farmers had an idea: Since North Dakota has the wheat, why not make the pasta right here?
 They formed a cooperative and each invested $12,000 to build a plant. The Dakota Pasta Growers, based in Carrington, N.D., started production in early November. It has hired 100 workers from the region and plans to produce 120 million pounds of pasta in the first year.
 "It all got started with some farmers just kicking around some ideas," said Gary McIntosh, the head of sales.
 With the creation of jobs, real estate values have jumped in the Carrington area for the first time in years. New houses are being built. And an old furniture store, which had been empty for years, has a sign in its window: "Grand Opening."
 "Who says resurrection can't happen?" asked Larry Leistritz, an economics professor at the University of North Dakota, who said the Plains needed to create just such businesses to capitalize on farm production.
 "It's a bright spot," he added. "But there haven't been too many pasta plants."
 
The Winners
Mail Order From Heaven
 It's an old adage: Do what you want. The money will follow.
 Dick and Jim Cabela of Sidney, Neb., wanted to hunt and fish, or at least to be around the sporting life. So more than 30 years ago they started a small business selling gear to hunters and fishermen. Their catalogue sales have seen double-digit growth in every year since.
 A few years ago, the business grew beyond the capacity of the local telephone company to supply it with lines. But the Cabela brothers, like many other entrepreneurs in the Great Plains, rejected the idea of moving for one reason: this was home.
 They opened a second business site in another little town on the Nebraska plains, Kearney, a place that during the homesteader rush of the late 19th century waged a brief campaign to make itself the nation's new capital, but has been struggling since then to keep its population above 6,000.
 Combining its sites in Kearney and Sidney, Cabela's Inc. employs 1,900 people, making it one of Nebraska's largest businesses.
 "This is heaven," said Jim Beardsley, who left an advertising job in Illinois to move to Sidney, population 6,500, and become the director of the company's catalogue sales. "I can hunt and fish every weekend. I've got a 4,000-square-foot house with a hot tub on 18 acres of land that I paid $72,000 for. I can look out my window and see a herd of antelope trotting past. It's so free of crime here that I leave the keys in the ignition of my car. And my kids go to a school with a student-teacher ratio of 12 to 1.
 "Friends back East ask me how I can live in this little town. And I say, 'Yeah, right.' "
 Some scholars of the West say the usual barometers of a region's economic health, like per-capita income, paint a false picture of little towns on the Great Plains.
 "The standard economic assessments are not only inadequate in measuring the quality of life in these little towns, they're pretty much irrelevant," said Phil Burgess, president of the Center for the New West, a research group in Denver. "People say the average income in South Dakota is one of the lowest in the country. But do you know what it costs to buy a nice big house in South Dakota? I was talking to a guy in Southern California recently. He said he pays $1,900 for a alarm safety system. And I told him, 'The people in South Dakota don't have that expense. They don't need safety systems.'
 "The No. 1 issue that everybody in this country is so concerned about is crime. Well, they don't have to worry about crime in little towns on the Plains. If your kid is running around doing something wrong, some neighbor is going to call and tell you about it. So some of these places aren't growing. So what? They've got nice houses, good schools and no crime. Isn't that the kind of quality of life we all say we're looking for?"
 Paul Hoefs, a 44-year-old stockbroker who has lived in New York, Chicago and Miami, was told by his company that he could open a new office in the location of his choice, so long as it had a telephone, a modem and a fax machine.
 Intrigued with the idea of living in a small town on the Plains, Mr. Hoefs and his wife and children took a drive through Superior, Neb. They saw the charming Main Street and quiet neighborhoods of elegant Victorian houses with wraparound porches and leaded glass windows selling for $50,000.
 "As we drove through town, people waved hello to us," he said. "And the whole family said, 'That's it. This is the place for us.' "
 Mr. Hoefs and his family now live in one of those Victorians, and he walks a block and a half to work every morning. The Ranchers A Big Spread Far From School
 Along with her husband, Diane Kuhlbacher owns a 10,000-acre ranch on the rugged, open countryside of Rocky Point, Wyo., but spends most days in a cramped two-bedroom apartment in the town of Gillette, 60 miles away. Two of her sons are in high school, and she did not want them to spend four hours a day on the school bus.
 "Years ago, ranchers would just rent a place in town for their kids to stay by themselves," Mrs. Kuhlbacher said. "But there wasn't as much mischief to get into back then."
 Even in little towns in Wyoming, she said, there are problems with drugs, drinking and teen-age pregnancies.
 Two of her sons and another boy from Rocky Point sleep in bunk beds in one room, while she and her 4-year-old son stay in the other room. "It isn't big enough," said Mrs. Kuhlbacher, who works in a bookstore. "But it's all we can afford."
 Wyoming makes what it calls "isolation payments" to people like the Kuhlbachers to help pay for a second home. The payment of $250 a month covers the rent on the apartment, she said, but not the utilities. Living in the little apartment and spending so much time away from her husband, Jack, is one of the sacrifices required of ranch life in the remote parts of the state.
 The Kuhlbachers could sell the ranch and probably live comfortably on the profits. But the property has been in the family since the turn of the century, when her husband's grandfather settled it under the Homestead Act.
 "Since it belongs to the family, we don't really feel like it's ours to sell," Mrs. Kuhlbacher said. "Besides, we're ranchers. It's our life. And we just wouldn't want to trade it."
 The time spent apart from her husband poses a hardship on the family, she said, but it has also had its bright spots.
 Before Mrs. Kuhlbacher moved out, she said, her husband was "like a lot of other men" when it came to doing chores in the house. "We women have a saying up here," she said. "Wyoming: where the men are men and the women work."
 But since Mr. Kuhlbacher has had to fend for himself, he has mastered the washing machine and doing the dishes. Now sometimes, even when the family is together on weekends, he does the cooking. "He's gotten so he actually likes it," his wife said. "And he makes a mean pot roast."
 
The Survivors
The Sadness Of Empty Houses
 Behind a faded white-picket fence in one of the few lighted houses in Wild Horse, 75-year-old Leona Schrimp sits back in her living-room chair, beside a cast-iron stove burning with the sweet smell of cottonwood, recalling the past.
 "Oh, we had fun in this town once," said Mrs. Schrimp, her white hair pulled back and her eyes flashing like stars.
 "But now, almost everybody has gone away. The Blekebergs, the Kinnebergs, the Kopstads, the Johnsons, the Olsons. It gets so I don't even want to take a drive in the country anymore. Makes me too sad, looking at all those empty houses."
 The town sits on the bank of the Big Sandy River, which has been dry for years. The next town to the west, Hugo, is 34 miles away, a stretch that passes only two houses, one of them empty. Coyotes howl in the darkness, and the fields crawl with rattlesnakes.
 Mrs. Schrimp's mother, Marie, was a homesteader, an immigrant from Norway who came to the Plains in 1908. She took a job cooking for cowboys on a ranch, and the wranglers helped her learn to speak English. She fell in love with one of them, a young cowboy named Otto Goldberg, and they married.
 "There's my dad," said Mrs. Schrimp, pointing to a photograph that showed him and the other townspeople in a joyous spring celebration of 1917.
 "And there's my friend Judith," she said, pointing to a small girl in the photograph. "She was born in '09. Held out here as long as she could. She's in a retirement home now."
 Until 1979, Mrs. Schrimp ran Lee's Cafe in town, which is now empty. Her husband, Curtis, is a retired cattle truck driver. In his spare time, he ran the gas station next to his wife's cafe.
 The schoolhouse down the road closed nearly 30 years ago, and church services are now held in the building, "when we can find a preacher to come out here," Mrs. Schrimp said.
 Until a few years ago, the claim to fame in Wild Horse was the headquarters of the Loretta Lynn Fan Club, run by Loudilla, Loretta and Kay Johnson, who lived on a ranch at the end of a dirt road. But the Johnson sisters moved to Nashville a few years ago, taking most of the post office's business with them.
 The postmistress, Evonne Schallenberger, who plans to retire in June, said she had been assured that the office would be kept open. But the Schrimps have their doubts.
 On the wall hangs a painting of Mrs. Schrimp's mother's home, a little white farmhouse in a meadow by a fjord. The Schrimps have three children, and when they were young, they would gaze at the painting and wonder about their grandmother's life back in the old country.
 The Schrimps' son, Steve, now lives in Denver, where he works as a computer consultant. One daughter, Martha, runs cattle on a spread outside of town. The other daughter, Lee Ann, who went to college to become a teacher, took a trip 10 years ago to Norway to find her grandmother's house, the one in the painting.
 She found the place, and introduced herself to the young dairy farmer who lived there. And they fell in love. Now Lee Ann and the dairy farmer and their children live in her grandmother's old home in Norway.
 A Norwegian newspaper wrote an article about it. The reporter said Lee Ann must love Norway's deep green meadows, rolling hillsides and bubbling brooks, especially after a childhood on the bleakness of the American Plains.
 "Oh, where I come from," she told him, "you can see forever."

HEADLINE: Brighter Outlook for Construction Workers

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
At the site of a dusty and noisy shopping center construction project on Bloomingdale Road here, Livingston J. Walker was grateful to be driving a front-end loader again. Until recently, Mr. Walker had been out of work, like many of his fellow workers in Local 137 of the Operating Engineers Union.
"Every day during the last few years was a black Friday for me," the 38-year-old father of five said. "The recession took a devastating toll on my life." 
 Before the current project began five months ago, Mr. Walker took on whatever odd jobs came his way to provide for his family and meet his bills. Union leaders said stories like Mr. Walker's were repeated nationwide as the unemployment rate for the building trades soared late last year to 14.5 percent -- almost twice the rate for all workers, according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. In June and September last year the unemployment rate for construction workers reached 17.4 percent.
 
A Decline in the Jobless Rate
 "I don't consider myself a macho kind of guy, but I wanted to be doing better for my family," said Mr. Walker, who lives in Port Chester. "Last year and the year before at Christmas, I had to borrow from Peter to pay Paul to buy presents, but the holidays still weren't like they should have been for the kids."
Now the picture is beginning to change for many in the construction trades. Their jobless rate declined to 11.7 percent nationwide last month. And in this city, the 830,000-square-foot shopping center, known as the Westchester, is expected to create 1,000 jobs over the next year for carpenters, teamsters and operating engineers -- many of whom have not seen steady work since the late 1980's. Several other projects, including a new Federal courthouse here, have also meant new jobs for idle union members.
 
'People Are Really Hurting'
 But the recent upswing has not come without concessions from union leaders and a more conciliatory attitude at the bargaining table -- which many have described as a trend born of economic necessity.
"Labor is humble right now, because we are trying to survive -- people are really hurting," said Nicholas Signorelli, business manager for Local 137 of the Operating Engineers, which includes 1,100 active and 750 retired members in Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess Counties.
In order to put at least some of their members back to work, union leaders agreed to concessions for the shopping-center job here, which they would not have considered in the past, Mr. Signorelli said. The contracts of the operating engineers -- who run heavy equipment -- and of carpenters and teamsters allowed for a no-strike clause, a 40-hour workweek instead of 35 hours and time-and-a-half pay instead of double-time for overtime.
Representatives of the O'Connor Group, a New York City development organization overseeing the project, would not discuss contract negotiations, but they issued a statement through Paul F. Kastner, a senior vice president of marketing for the group.
"Although there may have been a perception that the unions in Westchester County were difficult, we were most pleased to discover just the opposite, which is perhaps due to the current economic climate and drought of construction activity in the area," the statement said.
The shopping center is to open in 1995. It will be co-anchored by two department stores, Neiman Marcus and Nordstrom's, and will include 150 specialty shops.
The unions' project agreement with the O'Connor Group represents a positive new trend in negotiations, said Edward Doyle, president of the Building Trades Council of Westchester and Putnam Counties and president of Teamsters Local 456 in Westchester and Putnam, which represents 35,000 working electricians, plumbers, steamfitters and ironworkers, among others.
"It's the answer to labor and management issues," Mr. Doyle said. "It's the wave of the future." He explained that no-strike clauses are important to the banks that are financing new building projects, and in the case of the Westchester, that concession was the key element in gaining an all-union contract.
John E. Nicholson, an assistant business agent for Local 53 of the Carpenters Union in White Plains, called the project agreement "a pot of gold, because finally we are working again." Mr. Nicholson's union is one of six in the county representing 3,300 carpenters.
The change in union attitudes locally reflects a trend being witnessed throughout the state and the country, said Edward J. Malloy, president of the New York State Building and Construction Trades Council, an umbrella organization affiliated with the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
"It is generated by the seriousness of unemployment, which in some cases is between 50 percent and 80 percent for the building and construction trades," Mr. Malloy said. "To compete on jobs, we have to be creative." He said that while the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment figures were lower than the 50 percent and 80 percent figures he had just mentioned, in Plattsburgh, N.Y., for example, there were no jobs for construction, creating localized higher unemployment rates.
Mr. Malloy said that a decision by the United States Supreme Court on March 8, known as the Boston Harbor agreement, has allowed cities, states and Federal agencies to enter into contract agreements in the same way as the private sector and negotiate agreements specifying that work will be done by union members.
He said that the decision in the Building Trades Council v. Associated Builders case -- which validated a union-only labor agreement for the $6 billion cleanup of Boston Harbor and was considered a victory for organized labor -- would open the door to new work for local unions. In Westchester, the New York Thruway Authority will be able to enter into its first pre-hire agreement (an agreement made ahead of time to hire union workers) for a new $125 million, five-year repair project on the Tappan Zee Bridge.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the United State Postal Service would proceed with its plans to build a $102 million, 489,000-square-foot processing and distribution center in Harrison. Although the contract has been awarded to a Connecticut firm, Morganti Construction of Danbury, Mr. Signorelli said, the local unions would be negotiating with the general contractor to use Westchester workers.
Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat from Harrison who obtained a directive from the Appropriations Committee to lift a Postal Service moratorium on new projects, including the one in Westchester, said that as the unions made concessions to gain work, they also had to be careful to protect basic benefits like health insurance.
"Our goal is to create jobs, but there are certain bottom-line benefits that cannot be negotiated," she said.
 
35 Stalemates Reported
 As the construction unions shifted tactics in recent months to compete for jobs, union employees and employers in the public sector have become more adversarial with deadlocked negotiations, often long past the expiration of contracts, said Richard A. Curreri, director of Conciliation for the State Public Employment Relations Board.
"More and more often these days, things come to an impasse," said Mr. Curreri, whose board administers the state's Taylor Law, which regulates collective-bargaining agreements between public-sector employees and their employers.
In Westchester, Mr. Curreri said, there are 35 instances in which public-sector contract negotiations have reached a stalemate. Those include police and library administrators in Yonkers, the police in Greenburgh and teachers and teacher aides in Mount Vernon, he said.
Because of fiscal constraints, including reduced state aid, many municipal governments are asking for more employee contributions to health-care benefits and a reduction in pay increases and leave time, among other concessions, Mr. Curreri said.
 
Job Security a Lesser Issue
 Laura Ginsburg, director of public policy for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Washington, said: "Things are tough pretty much across the country. Employers are in a take-back mode, and we don't know if it is going to get much better in the foreseeable future."
In Elmsford, John F. O'Reilly, a lawyer who represents municipal employers in public-sector union negotiations, said the impasses were often a result of union leadership's "unwillingness to bring back to the members difficult proposals."
He also said that the issue of job security was not as pressing in the public sector, where employees were not subject to the vagaries of the economy in the same manner that, for example, construction workers were. Therefore, he said, they were less willing to make concessions.
But Thomas F. DeSoye, a White Plains lawyer representing public-sector union members, blamed some employers for withholding raises that they were often able to afford, despite their protests to the contrary.
"It's patently unfair to blame union leaders and lay the number of impasses at their feet," he said. "It takes two sides to strike a contract."

HEADLINE: County to Offer Loans To Create New Jobs

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
WESTCHESTER will offer up to $27 million in low-cost financing to qualified applicants next year in a program to attract new businesses and help existing ones expand, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke announced late last month.
The new plan, called the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program, is part of the United States Housing and Urban Development Community Block Grant program. But it is separate from the Federal block grant program that allocates money for downtown beautification projects to eliminate slums and blight, said Barry N. Sussman, director of planning and research for the county's Planning Department. 
 The Federal loan program allows the county to pledge five times its current yearly allotment from the Department of Housing and Urban Development -- about $6 million -- for long-term, below-market financing to qualified nonretail businesses.
Typical applicants for the new program could include someone who wants to build a factory and has obtained some financing from a bank but still needs a loan to complete the deal, Mr. Sussman said.
 
Review Committee Set Up
 Since a goal of the program is to create jobs for low- and middle-income households, an applicant would need to show how his or her proposal -- to acquire or rehabilitate property or to purchase machinery, for example -- would accomplish that, Mr. Sussman said.
Applicants for the fixed-rate Federal loan, which would be administered through the county's Industrial Development Agency, must be approved by a project review committee -- composed of commissioners from the county's Planning and Finance Departments, the chairman of the Industrial Development Agency and two outside financial experts. The proposals are also subject to a final review by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
An applicant's plan must fall within a geographical area that the county has designated as its 37-community urban consortium. That includes villages, towns and some cities countywide, but does not encompass Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle or White Plains, which administer their own Community Block Grant programs.
Mr. O'Rourke said recently that if larger cities with their own programs were to adopt similar loan plans, another $47 million would be available for businesses and new jobs in Westchester.
 
'It Is Found Money'
 In Yonkers, Charles Schorr Lesnick, Director of Economic Development, said his city would present its loan program, which is almost identical to the county's, to a public hearing tomorrow, and the City Council would vote on the matter next month.
Mr. Lesnick said the Federal Housing and Urban Development loan program has actually been in effect since 1979, but many communities were not aware of it until recently, when the Clinton Administration started to encourage municipalities to use the program.
"In a way, it is found money," Mr. Lesnick said. The city will be able to lend $21.4 million a year -- five times its annual allotment for the Federal Community Development Block Grant Program -- to qualified applicants, through the Yonkers Local Assistance Corporation, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the city.
Under the county's program, which the Board of Legislators approved unanimously last month, 1 percent of each loan would be set aside to cover any defaults by applicants, reducing the county's liability for the annual debt service on the loan. In cases where there is a default, the county would seek another operator to take over the business.
Yonkers is setting up a similar default mechanism, Mr. Lesnick said.
Mr. O'Rourke said that the county's investment could be "multiplied by the influx of jobs and business to some of the areas of our county hardest hit by the current economic downturn."
Those areas include Peekskill, Ossining and Port Chester, for example, but not the four large cities that administer their own programs.
The loan plan is part of the County Executive's 10-point Comprehensive Economic Development and Jobs program, which he announced earlier this year.
Under that program, which is designed to create more than 32,000 jobs in Westchester in the next four years, Mr. O'Rourke is calling for the establishment of a county job center where worker counseling and financing advice for small businesses would be available.
Also under the job development program, the County Association, a business organization, would compile a resource directory containing information on types of businesses in Westchester and on support services available for job searches. In addition, Westchester Community College in Valhalla would offer training programs for unemployed workers.
Another part of the County Executive's economic development and job program calls for the establishment of a marketing plan by the Westchester Business Partnership, another business organization, to attract 20,000 new jobs to the county in coming years.

HEADLINE: YELTSIN'S REFORMERS SHOW WEAKNESS IN RUSSIAN VOTE; CONSTITUTION IS APPROVED

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Monday, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Initial returns from Russia's parliamentary elections on Sunday indicated an unexpectedly strong showing by zealous nationalists and Communists against disunited reformers, even while President Boris N. Yeltsin won approval for his new Constitution.
The results stunned reform politicians who had gathered for a gala night in the Kremlin to celebrate the "Political New Year," and they lashed out at Mr. Yeltsin and their own disunity for the unexpected success of what they called "fascists and revanchists." 
 Live television coverage of the increasingly embarrassing gala, which was to continue until 6 A.M. (10 P.M. Sunday Eastern time), was abruptly terminated at 3:20 A.M.
 
Constitution Is Approved
 Mr. Yeltsin made no public appearance after voting in the early morning, but his aides focused on the approval of the Constitution, on which the President had focused his only efforts in the campaign. The charter granted the Russian President considerable powers to issue decrees, appoint the Government and overrule the legislature.
Shortly after midnight, Mr. Yeltsin's spokesman, Vyacheslav V. Kostikov, announced on television that the Constitution had been adopted. "We live in a new state," he declared. "Democracy has triumphed in Russia."
Soon after, Mr. Kostikov announced that the President now firmly intended to remain in office through the end of his term in 1996, although he denied that this was connected with "certain successes" by the nationalist followers of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic Party.
 
Resumpton of Arms Sales
 Far brasher and livelier than his opponents on television, Mr. Zhirinovsky, 47, registered a strong surge in the last two weeks of the campaign with his uncomplicated solutions and angry nationalism, a blend his opponents branded "fascist."
He has vowed to impose a strong central Government, to bring all former Soviet republics back into a Russian empire, to rid Russsia of American influences and to resume arms production and sales to old clients like Iraq.
Reports from around Russia indicated that the turnout would reach only about 55 percent of the 107 million registered voters, far less than in any previous Russian election.
As early voting results began showing successes by the Communists and extreme nationalists, official reports became increasingly limited. Announcers at the televised gala said this was happening due to "shortages of operative information," while officials at the Central Election Commission simply stopped giving information.
The last announcement over television at about 3 A.M. (7 P.M. Sunday Eastern time) gave partial results for four major regions of Russia, but did not explain whether these were representative of the entire electorate.
 
Results From Regions
 They showed Mr. Zhirinovsky registering 26.6 percent in the north European part of Russia, 18.3 percent in the south European region, 15.1 percent in Siberia and the Urals, and 14.4 in the Far East.
Russia's Choice, the pro-Yeltsin party led by Yegor T. Gaidar, had 21.2 percent in the north, 16.1 in the south, 20.7 in Siberia and 14.6 in the Far East.
The Communists got 8.6 percent in the north, 10.5 percent in the south, 12 percent in Siberia and 18.3 percent in the Far East.
A fourth group with relatively high ratings was another pro-reform bloc, led by Grigory A. Yavlinsky, which, respectively, scored 11.2, 6.6, 10.4 and 6.5 percent in the four regions.
Other blocs that seemed likely to clear the 5 percent hurdle and to gain seats in the new parliament included the Women of Russia; another reform bloc led by Deputy Prime Minister Sergei M. Shakhrai; the conservative Agrarian Party, and the centrist Democratic Party.
The pattern of the vote and the relatively low turnout pointed to a powerful nationwide reaction to the hardships and poverty brought on by the collapse of the Soviet state and two years of economic liberalization.
 
'Sweet, Pretty Lies'
 "We did not sufficiently appreciate the sweetness of simple promises to a tired country, to people who no longer want to hear the tired truth and are ready to believe sweet, pretty lies," said Mr. Gaidar, the architect of Mr. Yeltsin's economic reforms.
Mr. Gaidar declared himself filled with "foreboding" about the new parliament. He said the most important task was "to try at any price to create an effective democratic coalition" in the new State Duma, the lower house of the new parliament.
But apart from pointing to a strong showing by Mr. Zhirinovsky and the Communists, the figures were not sufficiently complete to predict the final distribution of forces in the new parliament.
Half the 450 seats in the lower house will be filled from party lists, and the other 225 will come from candidates elected directly in local districts. For the most part, their leanings will become clear only when the legislature meets in January.
While commentators suspected that reformers would not have sufficient numbers for a majority, neither would the opposition, since the Communists vowed not to work with Mr. Zhirinovsky.
But Government officials said that in any case, the new Constitution did not require ministers to resign unless a new President was elected. With Mr. Yeltsin now set to stay in office until 1996, a reform government could remain in office at least through the two years the first parliament will sit.
"The Government and the course of reforms will not change," declared First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir F. Shumeiko. "Certain reshuffling in the Government is possible, but its composition will not change in general."
Though Mr. Yeltsin's aides tried to declare the adoption of the Constitution a victory for the President, the overall results were a blow. The President called the parliamentary elections and the referendum on the Constitution after he dissolved the Soviet-era Congress of People's Deputies in September and crushed armed resistance by his foes.
The old Congress had consistently worked to block the President, and he had acted in the presumption that the nation would now elect a more progressive and cooperative parliament.
That seems not to have happened. This time, however, the President will have the considerable powers granted him in the new Constitution, including powers to issue decrees, name Government officials and even dissolve the parliament.
But with the low turnout and a relatively weak vote for the Constitution, Mr. Yeltsin's mandate was relative, even if his powers were technically buttressed by the new charter.
 
Anger Directed at Yeltsin
 For now, Mr. Yeltsin's spokesman, Mr. Kostikov, tried to put the best gloss on the results, portraying the adoption of the Constitution as a major victory and suggesting that the President might find common ground with the new legislature.
"The President will respect the choice the Russians have made on Dec. 12," he said. The programs of Mr. Zhirinovsky and the Communists have many parts which, he said, "quite correspond to the social aspects of the President's policies -- that is the social policy of the state, patriotism, making Russia great."
But Mr. Yeltsin also now faced the ire of some of his former followers. Gennadi E. Burbulis, once Mr. Yeltsin's closest adviser, put the blame for the reformers' poor showing squarely on the President.
"This was the fault above all of Yeltsin, who took a sideline position that was uncalled for when he needed to side with the democrats and present a strong front against the fascists and revanchists," he said at the opulent headquarters of Russia's Choice in a former aristocratic palace.
Mr. Yeltsin stayed entirely aloof from the election campaign, appearing on television only once last week to make a strong appeal for the Constitution. Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin also stood aside, taking a "vacation" in central Russia.
Other reformers blamed the failure on the disunity of the reformers. Reform politicians with few basic differences formed three blocs in addition to Russia's Choice, led respectively by Mr. Yavslinsky, Mr. Shakhrai and Mayor Anatoly Sobchak of St. Petersburg.
"We will have to pay dearly for the democrats' failure to reach accord and for their leaving our appeals to unify hanging in the air," said Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais, the head of the privatization program.
Mr. Zhirinovsky appeared obviously elated at the televised gala, and at his headquarters on the fourth floor of a dilapidated building in Moscow, his aides spoke with obvious relish of entering parliament.
Random samples of voters showed that Mr. Zhirinovsky attracted a considerable following in the military and among young blue-collar voters, among people who disdain the Communists but have lost faith in reformers.
In a recent interview with Izvestia, Mr. Zhirinovsky said his program included raising living standards by 100 percent within six months by halting all aid to former Soviet republics, halting all conversion of military plants to other uses, exporting large amounts of arms and checking crime by liquidating "all 5,000 crime gangs on Russian territory."
He denied that his ambition to reconstitute the Russian empire would cause war. "All these territories, the Baltics, Bessarabia, the Caucasus, historically belong to Russia," he said.

HEADLINE: In Holiday Season, Rooms Are Scarce In New York Hotels

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
City sidewalks are crammed in New York. Stores and Broadway shows are selling out. And though the holiday season is traditionally the busiest time of the year for Manhattan hotels, a surge in pre-Christmas travelers is capping what travel watchers say is the strongest year in more than a decade for hotels in the city and across the nation.
In the last couple of weeks, Manhattan hotels from the Carlyle to the Best Western at Times Square have been booked solid. Spurred by a gently improving economy, lower air fares and the perennial draw of New York's holiday glitter, hordes of conventioneers, European travelers and sightseers have descended on the city, determined to shop at Macy's, gaze at Fifth Avenue window displays or marvel at the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center. 
 "Our hotel usually requires two to three weeks' advance booking," said Thomas R. Civitano, vice president of marketing for the Plaza. "But during this time of the year, the amount of time doubles." At least 2,000 guests have been turned away since the beginning of the month, he said. Next weekend will be fully booked as well.
"This has definitely been a good year for the hotel industry," said Mark Lomanno, executive director of Smith Travel Research, a consulting firm. "This year, the number of people staying in hotel rooms is up about 4 percent from last year. That's about 65,000 to 70,000 more rooms sold each day across the country."
For New York City's hotels, which collectively boast one of the highest occupancy rates in the country, that means a tight squeeze, especially now.
Steven E. Trombetti, a spokesman for the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the number of hotel rooms has held relatively steady, at 65,000. But Stephen Brener, a Manhattan broker of hotel rooms, who also analyzes demand for rooms, said it has fallen to 58,000, in part because some hotels, like the Vista, devastated by the the World Trade Center bombing last February, are under renovation.
 
Firsthand Experience
 Marion and Andres Binnmyr from Sweden know that from firsthand experience. When the couple first arrived in New York City last week to enjoy the sights, their hotel, the Lexington Hotel had only one room left, one with only a lone single bed. "It was very small," said Mr. Binnmyr. "But after that they put us in a bigger room."
Kim Jung Dae, a traveler from Seoul, South Korea, was simply squeezed out.
Though he had carefully planned a 10-day tour of the United States to include a weekend with his wife in New York City, he arrived on Saturday and drove his rental car first to the Roosevelt Hotel, then to the New York Hilton, only to find the same answer. No room at the inns. Nothing.
"I always heard New York is beautiful during Christmas," a dejected Mr. Kim said in broken English as he headed out to New Jersey to look for rooms. "We planned this for a long time. But everybody else also."
 
An Annual Flood
 As travelers like Mr. Kim found, space in Manhattan's larger, upscale hotels was scooped up early by the annual flood of early December conventioneers and business groups, who combine days of shop talk with shopping. Among those competing for hotel space last week were more than 4,000 members of the American Society of Association Executives, as well as two dozen women from the Midland Symphony Guild of Texas and a group of Russian bankers.
"This trip has made lots of pleasure," said Valery G. Znayko, chairman of the board of Progressbank, a commercial bank in Moscow, as he stood outside the St. Moritz Hotel. After meeting with American bankers, he said, he went across the street to F. A. O. Schwarz to shop for Christmas toys for his nephews.
Mr. Trombetti of the convention bureau says business travel has been bolstered this year in part by the expanded efforts of his bureau, including an increase in the marketing budget from $7.2 million to $8 million and the addition of sales representatives in Canada.
But plenty of those who have hustled in and out of hotel rooms since Thanksgiving were simply in New York City for the bright lights and merriment.
"I come here to go shopping and to see my friends and to go to the theater," said Arthur Altman, a Boston lawyer, who arrived at the Essex House for breakfast. He said he and his wife, Rita, come to New York every year at the same time for a long weekend.
Many holiday sightseers are international travelers, coming from as far away as South Africa and the Philippines. This year, experts and hotel administrators say, besides more Venezuelans and Argentinians, the number of British, German and French travelers, who have had access to reduced air fares, seems higher.
As Thomas and Gabriella Haenseroth from Berlin stood in front of the Plaza, listening to a five-piece ensemble, the Native Spirit Inka Jazz Fusion Band, play New Age-sounding music, they said they had got a bargain on their plane tickets for their first trip to New York.
"Our tickets were only 800 Deutsche marks each," said Mr. Haenseroth as he pulled his fur cap over his forehead. "Usually they are 1,000 or 950 Deutsche marks.
Like other visitors, they said their hotel, the Washington Square Hotel in Greenwich Village, was bustling.
Bob Wiener, owner of the Hotel Consulate near Times Square, had less than 10 rooms available on Saturday morning."They come to New York this time of the year regardless of the economy, crime or taxes," Mr. Wiener said.
At the Pierre Hotel, more than 40 people were on the waiting list over the weekend. The Hotel Millenium and the New York Marriott in the financial district, as well as the New York Renaissance Hotel and Essex House, also had wall-to-wall guests this weekend, as did most of the city's less pricey hotels, including the Best Western and Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel, both near Times Square.
The Loews New York Hotel on the East Side in midtown was booked solid, as was the Lexington Hotel nearby.
But Mr. Trombetti of the convention bureau insists the city is never out of rooms. "It's the busiest year we've had in a while," he said. "But we don't want to discourage people from coming. We always say that there's always room for a last-minute visitor in New York." He said there were still rooms left over the weekend at several Manhattan hotels, including the Roger Smith Hotel on Lexington Avenue, the Holiday Inn downtown and a handful of others.
He said that after Dec. 19, the number of travelers is expected to decline, and the hotels are expected to begin to offer special cut rates. But several Manhattan hotels reported they were booked steadily through New Year's.
Such promises, however, were of little consolation to William Litsinger, 32, who stood anxiously at the front desk of the Helmsley Windsor Hotel this weekend.
"My lovely wife lost our confirmation number for another Helmsley hotel," he told the desk clerk, explaining that he, his wife, and friends had flown in from Baltimore Saturday morning to shop in New York City and spend the night. The clerks apologized but insisted that they were fully booked. There were about 20 parties on the waiting list, all in front of him. Mr. Litsinger said four of the six Helmsley Hotels had turned him away.
"What can you do?" Mr. Litsinger asked philosophically, turning away. "I guess I'll have to go to Jersey or sleep in the airport tonight."

HEADLINE: Film Issue Snags Trade Talks; Anti-Dumping Pact Reached

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Monday, Dec. 13

 BODY:
After more than a week of steady if uneven progress, world trade talks have run into a roadblock amid pronounced differences between the United States and France over the movie and entertainment business.
Although trade officials reported progress on several issues in the negotiations among 116 nations, two meetings on Sunday between Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, and the European Community's chief trade official, Sir Leon Brittan, failed to resolve a deadlock over the export of American movies. This left the fate of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks uncertain with three days remaining until an agreed-upon Wednesday deadline. 
 "We have very severe problems at the moment," Sir Leon said. "Things are not looking good. I think we have a bit of a crisis on our hands."
But Peter Sutherland, the Director General of GATT, said later that he believed unstoppable momentum had built up for an agreement, a view shared by American and some European officials. [News analysis, page D1.]
President Clinton called Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France, Prime Minister John Major of Britain and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany on Sunday night from Washington. Details were not disclosed, but it appeared likely that the leaders were seeking an 11th-hour solution to the impasse.
 
 
A Mark of Progress
 But in one sign of significant progress, a GATT official said an agreement had been reached early today on the question of anti-dumping duties, which are used against imports that are sold at artificially low prices.
The United States had protested what it saw as an attempt in proposed new GATT rules to limit its ability to apply these duties.
The official declined to give details of the compromise that settled this dispute, but said Japan was the only nation not to give its approval.
An American official said that the United States had sought 11 changes in the draft GATT text on anti-dumping and had secured 8 of them. These changes, he said, would allow Washington to retain laws that permit the Commerce Department to impose steep tariffs on imported goods that are sold below cost or for less than in any other market.
But the Commerce Department's latitude in setting the actual level of tariffs was restricted, although it was not yet clear by how much.
The American official played down these limitations, but anti-dumping lawyers have said such constraints could make a significant difference in the tariffs resulting from cases brought by United States industries.
"A week ago, we were opposed by virtually every country, but this evening we managed to get three-quarters of what we asked for," said Jeffrey Garten, the Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade. Mr. Garten said on Saturday that the United States would settle for nothing less than all 11 changes.
Many American industries have been concerned that their ability to protect themselves from overseas competition could be undermined if anti-dumping laws were circumscribed by GATT.
Sir Leon's use of the word "crisis" was its first use by any of the main figures in the trade talks since the North American Free Trade Agreement was approved on Nov. 17. After that, the Clinton Administration decided to push hard for a world trade accord, and important breakthroughs began to occur, particularly on the long-divisive issue of agriculture.
Mr. Kantor was less pessimistic, saying that "crisis" was too strong. But he conceded that "there remain a number of difficult issues."
Chief among them, according to Peter Werner, a spokesman for GATT, was the impasse over limits on American-made entertainment products. "The crisis is the audio-visual issue," Mr. Werner said. "This is a highly sensitive question, for both the United States and the European Community."
The setback meant that a midnight target for a draft treaty was missed. Sir Leon, who will meet later today in Brussels with European foreign ministers, had hoped to present a draft to them. "We haven't actually met the deadline, but we got quite close to it," a GATT spokesman said.
Wednesday, the deadline day, is the last day on which President Clinton can use so-called fast-track legislation, allowing him to submit a trade agreement to Congress for approval without amendment.
 
 
A Major Test
 A GATT agreement would update world trade rules and extend them for the first time to services, which account for about $4 trillion in annual trade. Besides its importance to the world economy, achieving an accord is seen as a major test of the ability of the world's leading powers to avoid conflict in an age when economic power has assumed something of the place once occupied by military might.
Mr. Kantor, a former Los Angeles lawyer, has met a wall of objections from France and the European Community as he has sought to persuade the Europeans to ease a quota system limiting the number of American movies and television programs. He has also sought to persuade the French to lift or alter a range of levies on movie tickets and audiocassettes and videocassettes that raised about $350 million last year.
This money, which the United States says is collected unfairly because many of the films used to raise the taxes are American, goes to subsidize the French film industry, which made 150 movies last year and is by far the largest in Europe.
Jack Valenti, the president of the American Motion Picture Association and effectively the chief lobbyist for American film makers, said he had not slept for two nights in Geneva as he has worked for a compromise. "It ain't us bringing this thing down," he declared.
But French officials see Mr. Valenti as the incarnation of thinly veiled protectionism that has insured that Hollywood has about 80 percent of the European movie market, while European films take about 2 percent of the American box office.
 
 
'Invisible Protectionism'
 They have been particularly incensed by Mr. Valenti's often-repeated claim that dubbed European movies do not sell in the United States, while dubbed American movies have a huge success in Europe.
"There is invisible protectionism in the United States," said Daniel Toscan de Plantier, the president of Unifrance, and Mr. Valenti's counterpart in Paris. "Films circulate throughout the world, but not in the United States."
Officials close to the talks said Sir Leon appeared to have very little leeway after France toughened its stance over the last few days and European Community leaders endorsed its stand on Saturday.
In particular, one compromise -- that American movie makers would have access to some of the money raised through the French levies -- was abruptly dismissed by the French Government on Saturday, one official said.
"Sir Leon is going to need a more flexible mandate if we are going to have a Uruguay Round," said one leading United States negotiator who insisted on anonymity. He was referring to the current round of talks, which began seven years ago in the Uruguayan resort of Punte del Este.
Entertainment products are the United States' second-largest export item, after aerospace products, and the potential for growth in cable and other developing technologies is enormous. The Clinton Administration is therefore reluctant to yield much ground on this issue.
Negotiators said other problems also remained -- over financial services, shipping, American trade laws and subsidies to the European aircraft industry. But these were described as surmountable, provided the audio-visual issue is resolved.

HEADLINE: Canada's Morals Police: Serious Books at Risk?

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Canadians have been reading Marguerite Duras's stories of love, obsession and heartbreak for years. But when an American publisher, Blue Moon Books of Manhattan, tried to ship 30 copies of her novella, "The Man Sitting in the Corridor" to Trent University this fall, the books were seized at the border.
According to a form filled out by a customs official named Corinne M. Honey, several scenes in the book, in which a woman is beaten and eventually dies after passionate sex, put it in a vast category of material that is barred from entering the country because it is considered obscene or exploitive. Ms. Honey, making a judgment on the spot, checked off the box on a form next to "sex with violence," and the customs agency shipped the books back to the United States. 
 Seizures of books have long been countenanced under strict Canadian anti-obscenity laws. But a landmark Canadian Supreme Court decision last year expanded the definition of obscenity to include depictions of sex that degrades or exploits women and other groups, and bookstore owners say it has emboldened the customs agency to seize books that are mainstream and serious as well as sexually explicit pornography.
Customs officials are empowered to seize books that include scenes of rape; of bestiality, even if sex with the animal is just implied; of sex with the dead (people or animals); of sex with children; of anal penetration, and of incest, including "descriptions of any sexual activity among members of a family, whether or not they are genetically related."
 
Freedom of Expression
 Under the same memo, they can also seize seditious material and "hate propaganda," which includes material blaming any specific group for serious economic problems or for manipulating the media. The officials are also supposed to give weight to the writer's "freedom of expression," but it is by no means clear what that means, as Trent University found out in the Duras case.
The university wanted the books for a course on the works of Marguerite Duras, the acclaimed French author whose most famous book is "The Lover." When Trent consulted a lawyer and began complaining publicly, the customs agency abruptly reversed itself, declared that the book wasn't obscene after all, and let the next shipment through.
But many others have met a different fate. Hundreds of books, magazines and newspapers have been detained, often for months at a time, or banned outright by officials up and down the Canadian-American border.
Moreover, bookstore owners charge, it is books for gay and lesbian readers that are most often seized by the authorities. Material that has been stopped includes works that range from the fringe, like the lesbian comic book "Hothead Paisan," to the well known, like David Leavitt's book of short stories "A Place I've Never Been" and Albert Innaurato's "Best Plays of Albert Innaurato," which includes the Tony Award-winning "Gemini."
 
A Different National Philosophy
 Canada's policies, civil libertarians say, reflect a national philosophy very different from that of the United States, where the First Amendment stretches far to protect free expression. In Canada, by contrast, other rights can supersede the right to free speech, as they did recently when a judge banned press coverage of a murder trial and when another judge banned a television movie about sexual abuse of children in an orphanage.
The United States has anti-pornography laws and courts have long struggled to define pornography. But in Canada, owners of seized material must prove that it isn't pornographic, while under the American system the burden of proof is on the authorities making the charge.
"There is a greater willingness to intrude on freedom of expression in this country than there is in the United States," said Alan Borovoy, general counsel of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association. "The Canadian tradition is much more conservative and much more trusting of authority."
In last year's landmark case, Canada's highest court declared that the videos and magazines being sold by a Winnipeg man whose adult-video store had been raided by the police in 1987, were obscene, partly because they were degrading to women.
 
'Cutting Back' Individual Rights
 Kathleen Mahoney, who successfully argued on behalf of the Women's Legal and Education and Action Fund in the case, said that the reasoning underlying the decision was sound, even if customs officials appeared to be going too far at times.
"There's an evolving kind of recognition in Canada that the law has not treated women and other minority groups fairly," she said. "If we truly believe in democracy in the fullest sense of the world, then everyone should be able to participate. That means some sort of cutting back of individual rights as we've always known them."
Bans on obscenity extend to books produced and sold within Canada, too, and in Toronto, a special police unit is charged with rooting out pornographic material from stores. But while the police make sporadic raids on book and video stores across the country, levying fines and confiscating material, most of the confiscation takes place at the border by customs inspectors.
At gay and lesbian bookstores in Toronto, booksellers say the new customs policies have wreaked havoc on business. Some shipments are examined, and others aren't, said Kimberly Mistysyn, manager of Glad Day bookstore. She said that some shipments of books are seized even though they are readily available in other Toronto bookstores and that some periodicals are seized, held for months by authorities and then released when they are well out of date.
Michel Cleroux, a spokesman for Revenue Canada, which includes the customs department, said that the agency does not discriminate against gay and lesbian bookstores. But he said customs inspectors, who are required to look for any illegally imported goods, not just books, pay particular attention to materials from certain book companies.
"Importers who are known to have have previously imported material that falls within the confines of the Tariff Code may be subject to higher levels of scrutiny and examination," Mr. Cleroux said, speaking of the law governing imports. "We're just talking about logic here. For instance, if you were looking for child pornography and you came across a book entitled 'Kiddie Beauties,' you might go through it a little more closely than you would the latest issue of The New York Times."
American book distributors who say their shipments have been singled out in recent months include Blue Moon and Inland Books, a distributor based in Connecticut that does much business with gay and lesbian bookstores in Canada.
"They go after the small presses," said Bruce Walsh, a spokesman for Censorstop, a Toronto group that has been keeping track of the seizures. Mr. Walsh said shipments by larger publishers and distributors are usually left undisturbed, presumably because they involve too many books to oversee, except haphazardly.
Bookstores and distributors generally learn that shipments have been detained only when they receive a notice in the mail, often days or weeks later. And they say that since appealing the customs decisions is so expensive and labyrinthine, and since they have never been given any list of what titles are allowable, they have to work hard to censor themselves.
"If something has been seized before, I simply won't bother to re-order it," said Ms. Mistysyn, adding that about a quarter of the books sent to the store from the United States are seized. "They have in the past seized books that had been seized before and determined to be allowable. They've told us it's an individual decision that's basically up to whoever opens the box."

HEADLINE: Congress Cracks Down As Fish Stocks Decline

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It has been 17 years since Congress passed the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, regulations intended to reverse the steep decline in the catches of the nation's fishing industry. But the slide continues.
Although the law imposed strict catch limits and shortened fishing seasons and all but banished foreign trawlers from American waters, fish stocks off every coast are under more pressure than ever from bigger and more efficient boats and nets. 
 Fisheries regulators, whipsawed by economic, environmental and political interests, are constantly struggling to minimize overfishing and, at the same time, maximize returns for boats and crews.
Worried about the outcome of this struggle, Congress has again stepped in and mandated still more fishing restrictions. In a last-minute vote before Thanksgiving adjournment, the lawmakers ordered a new set of rules imposing stricter limits and shorter seasons.
 
Focus on Atlantic
 An important difference in the new legislation is that it focuses not on the deep offshore waters regulated by the Magnuson Act but instead on shallow inshore waters, specifically the shoreline waters of the Atlantic coast that once teemed with fish. Many of the details of the new regulations will be decided by a compact of representatives of the Atlantic Coast states from Maine to Florida.
For the short term, as the new rules take effect, the fishing situation for many recreational and commercial fishermen will probably get worse before it gets better. The tighter limits and shorter seasons will mean even less opportunity for weekend anglers and even less money for already hard-pressed trawler owners and their crews. But if stocks rebound, the fun and the good times will return.
Can they rebound?
"The statistics are alarming," says Representative Gerry E. Studds of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee.
Along the Atlantic Coast, the weakfish catch has fallen 85 percent since 1980, the summer flounder catch has fallen 70 percent since 1989, and the decline in landings of cod and haddock has left the New England fishing fleet foundering in economic woe.
In the Gulf, red snapper flourishes only in areas where wrecks prevent trawling.
On the Pacific Coast, there are still salmon, perch and bass to be had. But in many cases, particularly outside Alaska, now the nation's most productive fishing region, stocks exist only because hatcheries are producing fingerlings.
 
Widespread Overfishing
 "The nation's fisheries are at a crossroads," Diana H. Josephson, a top fisheries official in the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, recently told Congress.
Ms. Josephson said that 67 of the 236 species tracked by Federal scientists were being overfished and that 61 other species were being harvested to capacity. Some species have become so scarce, she noted, that the fishing season for them opens and closes on the same day.
"We can do better," Ms. Josephson asserted.
The Atlantic's shoreline, where the new Congressional action was focused, was once home to great schools of weakfish, sea trout, black sea bass, flounder, blues, spot, croaker, shad and herring. But in recent years, many species have become extremely scarce, partly because of pollution and unfavorable weather, but mainly because of overfishing.
Increasingly, East Coast recreational anglers have found themselves returning to dock with only a small fish or two in the cooler. And, just as many offshore Atlantic fishermen did in earlier years, many inshore commercial fishermen are now looking for jobs on land or have started trawling for sharks and other fish that previously were considered inedible nuisances.
"The stock of virtually every fish species on the East Coast is in terrible condition," said John H. Dunnigan, the executive director of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate compact that Congress authorized a half-century ago to draw up and administer rules for Atlantic coastal fishing.
 
Stronger Enforcement
 While the aim of the new inshore regulations will be much the same as the older offshore regulations -- to halt overfishing and give fish stocks time to rebuild -- there is more.
Traditionally, it has been the states, rather than the Federal Government, that have regulated fishing in waters extending up to three miles from their coastlines. They have consulted and cooperated with each other, but some states have nevertheless been more lax than others in regulating.
Given that many Atlantic fish migrate, the disparity in enforcement takes on added importance.
The new Congressional mandate calls for the states to continue to consult with each other and to define common limits and seasons on various fish species. But to insure that enforcement is uniform, if a state refuses to go along with a particular restriction, the Federal Government will step in and declare a moratorium on the affected fish in that state.
"This provision gives the law real teeth and that will make all the difference in the world," said William J. Goldsborough, a fisheries expert for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a nonprofit conservation organization. "The only other time we've had that was with the striped bass law, and it's one of the great fish-recovery stories."
Striped bass had all but disappeared from the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic when, in the early 1980's, Congress pressured the East Coast states to impose strict fishing limits and, in some cases, fishing moratoriums. Federal agencies were authorized to step in and impose controls on states that refused to act.
There was almost universal compliance, and today striped bass are back in the bay and the Atlantic in large numbers and recreational and commercial fishermen are once more enjoying good -- though strictly regulated -- catches.
"There's no reason now why the same thing can't happen to shad and weakfish and blues and all the other depleted Atlantic coast species," Mr. Goldsborough said.
 
Voicing Doubts
 Robert West, a commercial fisherman from Buxton, on North Carolina's Outer Banks, has his doubts. So does his wife, Susan, who recently sent a letter to Congress warning that "devastating" consequences might result from tighter limits on coastal fishing.
"When it comes to fish," Mr. West said recently between forays into the wintry Atlantic, "our experience has been that government, especially the Federal Government, usually ends up doing more harm than good.
"First they said they were going to rebuild all the fish stocks way out to sea," he said. "It hasn't happened. Now they say they're going to rebuild all the inshore stocks. Any reasonable person knows that something has to be done to conserve fish. But this time, with all these new rules, I fear they're going to break us all."

HEADLINE: Blacks Fighting Blacks On Plan for Dump Site

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MACON, Miss.

 BODY:
On the face of it, Noxubee County seems an almost perfect place for the Clinton Administration to investigate whether poor and minority communities have been targeted as dumping grounds for toxic waste.
In the last three years, two of the nation's largest waste-management companies have sought to build immense toxic-waste disposal plants in this eastern Mississippi county, where 70 percent of the residents are black, family incomes are low and unemployment is high. 
 Last month, after receiving a formal complaint from a group of local black educators who asserted that the decision to put the projects here was racially motivated and discriminatory, the Environmental Protection Agency said it would take a look. But when the Federal investigators arrive here early next year, they will discover that things are not so simple.
 
A Raw Struggle
 Noxubee County, it turns out, is a community riven by suspicion and mistrust, not just between blacks and whites, but within the black community as well. The question of whether to allow the dumping of hazardous wastes is just the latest issue in a raw and evolving struggle for political power between poor blacks and middle-class blacks.
Political leaders say that many of the region's poor black families supported one of the proposed waste projects because the company promised jobs and agreed to give minority-owned businesses a sizable share of its contracts for supplies, security and other services. Poor blacks said the jobs -- and the money and power they represented -- would help them expand their political influence after decades of rule by whites supported by educated, middle-class blacks.
"We have an opportunity to develop minority-owned businesses," said Ike Brown, a 39-year-old political organizer who has led supporters of one project. "We can give our young people something to help them. When you're poor and got nothing, you're willing to live with a little more risk."
 
Economic Desperation
 But middle-class black families say the companies are taking advantage of economic desperation at the expense of the environment and public health. They note that the geology that has attracted the waste-disposal industry is virtually identical in 13 eastern Mississippi counties, but that it was Noxubee County, with the highest percentage of black residents, that was chosen.
"In this region we have become a dumping ground for toxic wastes solely on the basis of the high percentage of blacks in this community," said John Gibson, the assistant school superintendent in the county. "I think we have a legitimate case."
The companies that proposed the projects, as well as state environmental officials, said there were scientific reasons for selecting the county as a site for hazardous-waste disposal. Lying beneath the region's piney woods and rolling pastures is a layer of impermeable chalk that the companies and the state say would enclose the solvents and other chemical wastes and prevent them from seeping into the soil, water and air.
 
Only One Site Per County
 Until late November, two companies were competing for a state permit to build a hazardous-waste plant in the county. Hughes Environmental Systems/Federated Technologies of Mississippi proposed an incinerator and waste dump in Brooksville, eight miles north of Macon, the county seat. USPCI, a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Corporation, wanted to build a toxic-waste dump in Shuqualak, which is 10 miles south of here.
State law allows only one hazardous-waste treatment plant per county, and late last month, the companies announced plans to build jointly an $85 million dump in Shuqualak (pronounced sugar lock).
If it is approved by the state, which receives Federal money for the environmental regulatory program, the dump would be among the largest in the South, capable of handling 200,000 tons of toxic waste a year. That is almost seven times the amount now exported by Mississippi's manufacturers to treatment sites in Alabama, Louisiana and other states.
Last year, the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People endorsed one of the proposed Hughes projects and accused a local environmental group, Protect the Environment of Noxubee County, of racism. The N.A.A.C.P. said the environmental group, which is biracial, was trying to prevent a new employer from altering the area's low-wage scale, thus keeping poor blacks "socially and economically oppressed."
 
Nasty Struggle
 Opposing the N.A.A.C.P. is a group of black educators and ministers who formed African Americans for Environmental Justice to protest toxic dumping locally. It is cooperating with some of the county's wealthiest white families, who have historically not participated in local efforts to improve schools, housing and other services for blacks.
In this increasingly nasty struggle, both sides say they represent the majority of county residents, and each accuses the other of dishonesty in representing its cases.
Opponents of the dumps make certain that a visitor knows that Mr. Brown, a leading proponent and an officer in the local N.A.A.C.P., was paid by Hughes/Federated Technologies as a consultant. They also say that in local elections last year anti-dump candidates won in more races than pro-dump candidates.
In an interview, Mr. Brown acknowledged being paid as a consultant, but said the company, a subsidiary of General Motors, had agreed to help blacks get jobs.
 
Bearing Scars
 The county's environmentalists also bear scars from the fight. The leaders of Protect the Environment of Noxubee County have acknowledged participating in a public relations campaign that a competitor of Hughes/Federated was financing in an effort to prevent any toxic dumping in Noxubee County. The competitor, Chemical Waste Management Inc., the nation's largest hazardous-waste disposal company, operates a competing toxic-waste site in Sumter County, Ala., about 40 miles east of here.
Martha Blackwell, a spokeswoman for Protect the Environment of Noxubee County, said her group participated in the campaign because it served their purpose and promoted their cause. "I wasn't happy about it," said Mrs. Blackwell, who lives on a catfish farm near Macon with her husband and two children. "But if you look at the results, there still is no dump in Noxubee County."
In accepting Noxubee County as a test case for applying civil rights law to environmental policy, Administration officials said they were fulfilling promises that Bill Clinton made in his 1992 Presidential campaign and again in a speech on Earth Day last spring to investigate instances of environmental injustice.
"It has become clear to all of us in the Administration that poor people and minority communities have been asked to bear a disproportionate brunt of pollution from modern society," said Carol M. Browner, the Administrator of the E.P.A. "What we want to do is look at how every one of the environmental laws affects a community and to make sure the poor and minorities are protected in the same way that all communities are protected."
The investigation here is one of two to be conducted by the E.P.A.'s Office of Civil Rights; the other is planned for Iberville Parish, La. Both investigations were prompted by complaints filed by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund acting in behalf of local community groups.
According to Ms. Browner and other officials, the investigation here will focus on two questions: whether race was a factor in the state's efforts to permit a hazardous-waste project in Noxubee County, and whether the toxic-waste dumps would expose the predominantly black population to disproportionately high health and environmental risks, and thus be discriminatory under the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
 
New Rules?
 The Administration's work is supported by national civil rights and environmental groups that believe it could lead to new rules giving minorities much greater authority to intervene or stop projects that they did not approve.
But James I. Palmer, the executive director of the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, said the Noxubee County case illustrates just how difficult it will be to define what has come to be called environmental racism and then establish measures to provide protections.
"At the very least," Mr. Palmer said, "you have to first ask whether it's environmental racism when most of the black leadership in that county, and many of the black citizens up there, supported a site and wanted the development."

Martha Blackwell, a spokeswoman for Protect the Environment of Noxubee County, who lives on a catfish farm near Macon with her husband and two children, opposes the waste site.

HEADLINE: MOROCCO TO WIDEN LINKS WITH ISRAEL

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
King Hassan of Morocco has decided to broaden his country's economic cooperation with Israel in a major step toward the eventual normalization of relations, senior Clinton Administration officials say.
The King told Secretary of State Warren Christopher in a meeting in Rabat on Friday night about a package of agreements he has reached with Israel that would begin in the "immediate" future, the officials said. An announcement of at least some of the measures is expected on Monday. 
 The package, officials said, includes these points:
*El Al airline of Israel and Morocco's national carrier, Royal Air Maroc, have reached agreement on flights between the two countries. The agreement is expected to increase the number of tourists traveling from one country to the other from about 10,000 to 100,000 within a year, a senior official said. There are about 650,000 Jews of Moroccan descent who live in Israel; about 8,000 Jews live in Morocco. The flights will not be direct, but will go through Spain.
*Morocco and Israel will open direct telephone and mail links.
*Morocco has authorized visits of religious leaders and businessmen between the countries. Morocco and Israel are poised to announce that Israel's two Chief Rabbis will travel to Morocco, a symbolic gesture that is expected to have political and religious resonance in Israel and among Jews around the world.
*The two countries will set up joint banking arrangements that could pave the way for bank transactions and increased trade. Last week, a delegation from Bank Leumi of Israel was in Morocco to discuss ways of operating there.
*On the political level, Moroccan and Israeli officials are expected to increase the frequency and the level of direct contacts, although in the beginning at least, those will be limited to economic and financial exchanges.
 
Host for Peace Talks
 Morocco will also serve as host of peace talks on economic and other issues by heads of the Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian delegations in the first three months of next year.
King Hassan did not tell Mr. Christopher if or when his country would move toward establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, American officials said.
The King, who relies on a number of Jewish advisers and is proud of his country's tolerance toward Jews, is said to favor diplomatic recognition of Israel. Such a move move could bring extraordinary economic and diplomatic benefits to his country, which with its cheap labor, proximity to Europe and fast-growing population is ready for foreign investment.
But the King, who survived two assassination attempts in the 1970's, has no desire to fuel Arab nationalism or Islamic militancy is his country, and is unwilling to move too quickly. Although he believes that he has a special role to play in linking the Arab world and Israel, he does not want to be seen as betraying Arab claims to Jerusalem.
 
Rabin Thanked Hassan
 On his way home from Israel after signing a peace accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization in Washington in September, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel stopped in Morocco to thank King Hassan for helping in the peace negotiations.
The two men, and a number of their ministers, keep in contact by phone, despite the official absence at the moment of direct phone links, a senior Administration official said.
Except for Egypt, which made peace with Israel in 1979, Morocco historically has been the leading Arab country to reach out to Israel. Since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, Israeli and Arab officials have used Morocco as a site for secret meetings.
Israeli officials often traveled to Morocco to prepare for the visit to Jerusalem in 1977 of Anwar el-Sadat, then the President of Egypt. Mr. Rabin secretly visited Morocco in October 1976, and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres paid two secret visits to the King in 1978 and 1981, before visiting publicly, as Israeli Prime Minister, in 1986.
In the last few years, Morocco and Israel have quietly expanded their trade, despite an Arab boycott that prohibits trade with Israel. Administration officials said trade between Morocco and Israel is expected to double next year.
But Israeli officials have no desire to push the King too quickly, and the words of Mr. Peres on the day that Mr. Rabin met the King are widely shared in the Israeli Government. "There must be a certain gradual approach in this development," Mr. Peres said.
King Hassan has gradually moved more and more into the role of a conciliator between Israel and the rest of the Arab world, a role that he told Mr. Christopher he feels comfortable with.
The King also pledged to Mr. Christopher that he would continue to urge King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, with whom Morocco has excellent relations, to ease the Arab boycott. The Moroccan King is also trying to persuade Tunisian leaders to follow his lead with Israel.

HEADLINE: Promises to Keep

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
In his words and actions, Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani has been busy telling New Yorkers recently what he will not do to solve the city's looming financial problems: he will not raise taxes or lay off thousands of municipal workers, and he will not rely on other tried-and-true methods used over nearly two decades by New York City's Democratic fiscal establishment.
Instead he has talked passionately about being innovative and optimistic. But while closing off those critical options, he has given few clues of precisely how he intends to tackle the budget shortfalls that will surely preoccupy him when he takes office in three weeks. 
 That has led some Democratic city officials and some independent fiscal experts to question whether Mr. Giuliani appreciates the depth of the city's fiscal duress, or whether, if he does, he has yet decided how he will address it.
To be sure, Mr. Giuliani has said often during the campaign that he would seize control of the city budget and would resolve, once and for all, the underlying fiscal problems that Mayor David N. Dinkins was often accused of ignoring.
Mr. Giuliani said he would use several means to eliminate the city's huge structural deficit, estimated at $1.7 billion to $2 billion next year: by cutting 35,000 jobs from the city's payroll, but through attrition rather than layoffs (Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani has been busy telling New Yorkers recently what he will not do to solve the city's looming financial problems: he will not raise taxes or lay off thousands of municipal workers); by reorganizing how the city delivers services, including contracting out some services, and by making municipal workers much more productive. He also has said he wants to stimulate the local economy by phasing out four particularly onerous and unusual city taxes.
 
What About Pain?
 He sought to reinforce his message this week, when he selected Abraham M. Lackman to be his budget director. Mr. Lackman, an economist who has been a fiscal aide to the Republican-controlled State Senate for the last 14 years, will bring fresh ideas for closing the budget gaps, several of Mr. Giuliani's advisers contended. And he will do so, both Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Lackman said, by moving beyond the conventional methods employed by Democratic mayors since the late 1970's.
But as he did in the campaign, Mr. Giuliani has sketched his ideas with broad strokes, skipping lightly over the pain that many fiscal experts think would surely accompany any serious reorganization of the city budget. Mr. Giuliani has insisted that his solutions will center on making local government more efficient, thus saving money and closing the budget gaps without seriously affecting the quality of city services.
But many experts, including some who are supportive of Mr. Giuliani, contend that no matter how important it may be to eliminate waste, fraud and inefficiency, that alone will not balance the budget. Even Mr. Giuliani hasn't yet put a dollar figure on the savings he might achieve or specified how he might achieve them.
Some experts say that to trim $2 billion out of the city's $31 billion annual budget Mr. Giuliani will have little choice but to consider reducing or eliminating some services, laying off municipal workers, and, perhaps, raising taxes or fees.
 
Looking for $2 Billion
 "It's going to be very painful," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit advocacy group that monitors the city budget. "Basically, what you're talking about is taking $2 billion out of some pockets that are receiving $2 billion now. Those pockets are labor, the state and taxpayers. And if you don't want to reach into the pocket of taxpayers, then you have to reach more deeply into the pockets of municipal employees and the state."
"This is a very big number," said Mr. Horton, who did not endorse a candidate in the mayoral race but whose publications and ideas figured prominently in Mr. Giuliani's position paper on the city budget. "There's no way it's going to be relatively painless."
Mr. Giuliani has sought to deflect the concerns by suggesting that people have been too quick to reject new fiscal approaches.
In announcing his selection of Mr. Lackman on Wednesday, Mr. Giuliani dismissed some fiscal complaints as revealing "defeatist attitudes." He also reiterated his belief that "the core of our agenda" would include stimulating the city's economy by eliminating several taxes, and closing budget gaps by devising creative ways to make government more efficient.
Mr. Giuliani stepped up his oratory the following day, saying in a speech that he did not wish to fill the city with doom and gloom. "Winston Churchill didn't walk out in the middle of the Battle of Britain and say, 'You know, those bombs may really win out in the long run and we may lose to the Nazis.' "
 
Symbolic Tax Cuts
 But some fiscal experts -- including several who said they were reluctant to speak publicly because they did not want to be accused of prejudging Mr. Giuliani -- said that the problem was not his optimism or his ambition, but the limitations of his program as he had thus far presented it. And by trying to phase out some taxes, in some ways he makes his problems worse. The four taxes he wants to reduce, including the hotel tax and the commercial rent tax, bring in about $1.5 billion a year.
In recognition of that problem, Mr. Giuliani's fiscal advisers say that they will begin phasing out the taxes slowly, and that next year the cuts will be mostly symbolic. Some note, for example, a comment by Mr. Lackman, the designated budget director, that he would exhaust creative new ideas before considering layoffs or other Draconian tactics.
He offered one specific idea: collecting more of the city's unpaid parking fines. Mr. Lackman says as much as $2 billion in unpaid fines could be collected, but Dinkins administration officials say the most optimistic figure would be $500 million, and even that would be very hard to get.
Many Democratic politicians noted that Mr. Dinkins and, before him, Mayor Edward I. Koch, had also seen promise in unpaid fines and had sought to increase fine collections by contracting out the responsibility to a private company. In Mr. Koch's case, it led to a bid-rigging and bribery scandal. For Mr. Dinkins, who sought to sign up the same company, Lockheed Information Management Services, it led to charges of favoritism and the forced resignation of his budget director, Philip R. Michael.
For his part, Mr. Lackman said he would probably have city officials try to improve the fine collections rather than hire an outside company. But some fiscal experts contend that even if Mr. Lackman could succeed where his predecessors had failed, the additional revenue might be the sort of nonrecurring revenue, or "one shot," that many fiscal experts and even Mr. Giuliani himself had long criticized Mr. Dinkins for using.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks to Narrow a Growing Wage Gap

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Seeking to please liberals as well as blue-collar Reagan Democrats, the Clinton Administration is cobbling together a multibillion-dollar strategy that aims to narrow the growing wage gap between Americans who have gone to college and those who have not.
Administration officials admit that their efforts, hamstrung by tight budgets, will make only a modest dent in the wage gap, which has grown steadily as the American economy has shifted away from its low-skilled manufacturing base toward areas requiring higher skills. But these officials say it is important that the White House is making a broad effort to reverse a trend that has fueled anxiety among tens of millions of blue-collar Americans. 
 This strategy includes a larger job- retraining plan for laid-off workers, a new apprenticeship program to provide special skills for young people not bound for college and a loan program to enable more low-income youths to afford college.
 
Money to Come From Trims
 Administration officials plan to increase spending on education and training by about $25 billion over five years, starting with about $2.5 billion this year. They say they expect to pay for it by trimming in less vital areas.
In the Administration's view, this strategy, which focuses on lifting the skills of the non-college-educated, is desirable not only because it is good politics, but also because it will reduce income inequality and help make the nation's work force -- and its economy -- more competitive with those in Japan and Europe.
But many economists say the effort will be able to offset in only a minuscule way the effect of powerful global economic forces. New technological developments, like robots and automated teller machines, are cutting demand for assembly-line workers, bank tellers and other unskilled workers, helping hold down their wages.
At the same time, the growing demand for highly educated workers, like management consultants and software designers, is pushing up wages for college graduates.
As a result, workers with college degrees, who in 1979 earned 38 percent more an hour than high school graduates, now earn 57 percent more, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based research group. Viewed in another way, the average hourly wage for high school graduates fell 12 percent from 1979 to 1991, after factoring in inflation, remained flat for workers with college degrees and rose by 8 percent for Americans with at least two years of graduate school.
"A very, very large gap between the well-educated and everybody else," said Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich in an interview, "makes for an unstable society."
The average American wage has stagnated in the last two decades because of the slowdown in productivity growth, with wages for those without college degrees squeezed especially hard by automation and the globalization of the world economy.
"Global integration," Mr. Reich said, means the relatively unskilled are "competing with millions of people willing to work at a fraction" of their wage.
 
A Gnawing Anxiety
 Clinton aides say American voters feel a gnawing economic anxiety not only because of a pervasive fear of layoffs but also because wages are on a downward escalator for a broad swath of workers.
Mr. Reich, the principal architect of the Clinton strategy, plans to announce in January a much larger retraining program, aimed especially at workers in declining industries and hard-pressed regions. He has also pushed for more Job Corps money to train urban high school dropouts and for a new plan to set up apprenticeships for the non-college-bound -- people who often flounder before finding their first jobs.
President Clinton's college loan program aims to enable more youths from moderate-income families to afford college, and the new national service program shares that goal. The Administration's much-advertised Goals 2000 program, which seeks to improve elementary and secondary education, also hopes to better prepare all Americans -- college-bound and non-college bound -- for the 21st-century work force.
 
Vying With Market Forces
 Alan Blinder, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said: "Realistically, the underlying forces of the market are vastly stronger than anything the Government can do. Some people say the Government shouldn't try to do anything. But Government action can make a difference, if done well."
Even some sympathetic economists wonder whether there is more oratory than substance behind this strategy, not so much because Mr. Clinton's heart is not in it as because his deficit-reduction efforts have left him limited money to fight the battle.
"I wonder whether they'll end up addressing it mainly with language rather than with resources," said Gary Burtless, a labor expert at the Brookings Institution. "It doesn't seem to me they have in mind spending a lot of money."
Lawrence Mishel, research director at the Economic Policy Institute, said: "It's clear that this Administration is much more attentive than the past few administrations to the needs of workers and providing the ladder to upward mobility. All the policies are aimed in the right direction, but the question is whether they will be large enough to make a difference."
Some economists say that to narrow the wage gap substantially would require hundreds of billions in spending on education and training.
"Given political realities and budget constraints, we're doing the best we can," Mr. Reich said.
Clinton aides defend the more aggressive Federal role, saying that public schools and the private sector have not done enough to upgrade the skills of the non-college-bound.
The strategy aims to remedy several problems that Mr. Clinton's advisers and their friends in the labor movement have long worried about. Studies have found that America's non-college-educated workers have fewer skills than their counterparts in Germany, Japan and other industrial countries, although America's college-educated compare favorably.
The wage gap strategy involves more than training and education. Mr. Reich plans to push to raise the $4.25-an-hour minimum wage after Congress considers the President's health plan. Another effort to narrow the gap is the earned-income tax credit, which provides tax cuts or refunds for about 15 million low-income American households.
Even some conservative economists express broad sympathy with the Administration's efforts.
 
A 'Good Place to Begin'
 "Dealing with the education and training system is a good place to begin to deal with this problem," said John Taylor, a Stanford economist who was an economic adviser to President George Bush. But he said too much emphasis was being put on spending more and not enough on improving education through better management and offering families more choice in selecting schools.
Several Clinton aides seek to score political points by arguing that this strategy seeks to reverse the income inequality that widened in the Reagan-Bush years. But Republican economists note that as a result of potent economic forces, this gap also grew even in left-leaning European countries like France.
Some Administration officials worry that the strategy may backfire politically if it is viewed as favoring the non-college-educated over the college-educated. To dispel this perception, one official described the plan as an effort to improve the skills of all Americans, college-educated or not.

HEADLINE: U.S. Malls Luring Foreign Shoppers

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GURNEE, Ill., Dec. 11

 BODY:
Iris Collicutt would never have thought to travel from her home in Switzerland to do her Christmas shopping at Gurnee Mills, a huge discount complex halfway between Chicago and Milwaukee, if she hadn't seen a Swiss travel company's newspaper ad. Yet here she was today, along with her sister, Brigitte Muller, and her mother, Annemarie Muller, talking about how it all made great sense.
"It's not just that it's a lot cheaper, but the salespeople are much friendlier and it's all indoors," said Mrs. Collicut, pausing outside the Camelot Music Outlet, where they had bought compact disks and tapes ranging from Beethoven to reggae. 
 The three had some specific items on their lists, like Oshkosh children's clothing and Timberland boots, but the general plan of attack was to wander in search of appealing deals. Despite a stated intention to "not overdo it," by the time they settled down for a break in the food court shortly after noon, they had accumulated clothing, shoes, Christmas ornaments and the music.
 
A Powerful Phenomenon
 The Mullers' three-day shopping spree represents a slow-developing but potentially powerful phenomenon: the globalization of shopping. Foreign tourists have long been major contributors to sales and profits in exclusive American shopping districts like Madison Avenue in New York, the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif., as well as at world-famous department stores like Bloomingdale's. But until recently, few Asian or European travelers to the United States made major malls the focus of their visit.
Many of these international shoppers, like the Mullers, are not especially wealthy. They fly from Japan straight to Minneapolis to board buses for the Mall of America, or from South America to Fort Lauderdale for the short trip west to Sawgrass Mills, or from Europe to Boston for the 90-minute bus ride to outlet shops around Fall River, Mass., and Howland Place in nearby New Bedford.
Agencies like Imholz Reisen A.G. of Zurich, which organizes shopping-oriented trips to this and other destinations, typically leave a day or two in the three- or four-night stay for sightseeing or jet lag. But their advertisements make clear that standard tourist destinations like the Sears Tower and Art Institute in Chicago are extras. And some travelers, like the Mullers, who paid about $900 for air fare, bus transportation and three nights at a Day's Inn, use much of their free time for still more shopping.
Part of the allure is the availability of items that cannot be found at home. But the main goal usually seems to be a better selection or lower prices. And some analysts see the trend as a big opportunity for discount centers like Gurnee Mills, which are almost unheard-of overseas.
"Brands at a discount is what the world is buying now," said Therese Byrne, a New York-based retailing analyst who believes tourists represent a much bigger growth opportunity for retailers than local shoppers.
That certainly squares with the experience of Andrew Arluck, general manager of the clearance outlet that Saks Fifth Avenue recently opened here. "People from around here may look at some of our designer items and think they are expensive, but foreign visitors who have shopped Saks and other top stores in the cities realize they are dirt cheap," Mr. Arluck said. The foreigners occasionally buy in astonishing quantities and return periodically, he said.
Groups like the 20 or so Swiss who came here today represent the cutting edge of the new trend. The vast majority of foreign business at most American malls is generated by Mexicans along the southern border and in the north by Canadians, who are avoiding a heavy sales tax at home. But the handful of managers at large malls that have tourism departments say there is plenty to be gained by courting all long-distance shoppers.
 
'The More You Spend'
 "Basically, the farther you come, the more you spend," said Colleen Harvey, director of tourism for the Mall of America, a complex south of Minneapolis that is the largest mall in the country. In this holiday shopping season, groups of shoppers have come from Australia, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Britain. The mall's own exit surveys suggest that the percentage of shoppers who are foreign tourists has doubled in the last year, to more than 5 percent, a figure Ms. Harvey believes is low.
Statistics about the impact of the "shop till you drop" trips, as they are sometimes advertised, are sketchy. The Commerce Department estimates that 45 million tourists came to the United States last year and spent $71.2 billion, including an average of $539 on gifts and souvenirs. But those figures give little clue as to spending by tourists destined for malls. A handful of malls in border regions that have tried hard to appeal to foreign visitors say there are some periods when such foreign shoppers outnumber the locals.
Gurnee Mills' larger sister development, Sawgrass, may attract the most foreigners. Nearly half of its 18 million annual visitors are foreign, making it the second-largest tourist attraction in Florida after Disney World. The Western Development Corporation, the Washington-based discount mall developer that owns Sawgrass, Gurnee, and similar complexes outside Washington and Philadelphia, estimates that 46 percent of the foreign tourist traffic is from Europe, 32 percent from Latin America, and 14 percent from Canada.
 
$500 to $1,000 Each
 Sawgrass estimates that foreign visitors -- many of them from South America -- spend an average of $500 to $1,000 each, compared with $80 to $200 for the typical local shopper, depending on the season.
The influx of foreigners is based partly on currency swings. The long decline of the dollar against the yen has encouraged more Japanese to shop in Hawaii and at mainland shopping centers. And the stabilization of the peso as the Mexican economy expands has led to a sharp rebound in Mexican spending in the United States, after a decline in the mid-80's.
Similarly, the strong dollar that encouraged Americans to flock to Harrods and other famous department stores in London during the 1985 Christmas season has been replaced by a relatively strong pound. That not only makes the United States look inexpensive to British shoppers, but has caused Harrods to abandon American marketing promotions.
Moreover, some retail analysts say Europeans are increasingly likely to consider such opportunities because more and more of them belong to families in which both husband and wife work. That encourages them to concentrate their shopping in vacation periods and look for settings where a lot can be done quickly.
 
'Don't Know What to Do'
 "A lot of retailers understand that there are opportunities but don't know what to do about it," said Mark Frantz, a spokesman for Curt Salmon & Associates, a retailing consulting firm that has worked with some clients on building tourist business.
Some malls advertise overseas. Many court foreign travel writers. But most rely on local and state tourist agencies to promote them. Gurnee, for example, depends on state and local tourist officials and on Diane Sharp, who oversees international promotions for Sawgrass, to represent all of Western Development's malls at travel shows.
Ms. Byrne said she believed shoppers like those who traveled from Europe to Gurnee Mills foretell growing pressure for more equal pricing of consumer goods around the world.
"People underestimate the longterm impact of this on pricing," she said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
The Los Angeles Times Steps Back From a 'Sky's the Limit' Approach

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
The Los Angeles Times, one of the country's great newspapers, is in a period of what its managers call refocusing. Others call it retreat.
Though its news coverage remains among the best in the country, the newspaper, by many measures, is shrinking. 
 Largely because of advertising declines, the newspaper's revenue this year is expected to be about $150 million less than its 1990 peak of $1.1 billion; it will be the third consecutive year of revenue declines. Daily circulation is down by more than 120,000 from more than 1.2 million in 1990.
Through employee buyouts aimed at slashing costs, The Times has cut its staff of 8,500 by about 2,000 since 1990 -- a decline of 23 percent. Other newspapers have also been trimming their work forces because of economic pressures, but the industry average is believed to be less than 10 percent.
The newspaper's predicament shows the vulnerability of many big-city dailies. The Los Angeles Times's troubles, some analysts say, come in part from declining newspaper readership generally and increasing battles for advertisers. Those underlying problems, which are affecting newspapers everywhere, are amplified by the stubborn Southern California recession.
 
A Question of Identity
 Whether the paper is refocusing or in retreat, its pessimistic financial reports and cost-cutting measures -- including the buyouts that have brought the departure of some of its best writers -- have set off something of an identity crisis for The Times.
"You have to understand, this was a paper that was the most affluent in the country and everything was possible," said Robert Scheer, a respected national correspondent who left the newspaper staff under one of the buyout programs.
"You would have to be a fool not to wonder: What does this mean for the newspaper? What does it mean for the future of newspapers?" asked Mr. Scheer, who still writes for the newspaper as a freelance contributing editor.
The struggle of The Los Angeles Times, whose enormous growth paralleled the giddy post-World War II development of Southern California, now mirrors the troubles of this region that is struggling with the economic slump.
Even some of the newspaper's senior managers acknowledge that the last several years have been disconcerting to many who remember when Times reporters traveled first class to assignments and Times executives talked of ever-bolder plans for expansion.
"It's like I was on a bullet train and so were a lot of other people," said George J. Cotliar, the managing editor, who joined the newspaper in 1957. "We've slowed down before and we've slowed down now. But that doesn't mean we've stopped."
 
Redefining Priorities
 In a series of interviews here recently, the newspaper's top editors and its publishing executives portrayed The Los Angeles Times's troubles as offering what its editor, Shelby Coffey 3d, called a "silver lining."
Mr. Coffey said the fiscal pressures had encouraged the huge organization to redefine its priorities and to "focus on its core market," a vast area the size of Ohio around this sprawling city.
"It wouldn't be reasonable," he said, "to expect cheering that Southern California has a lingering recession. But you play the cards you are dealt. Our job is to bring the paper through this with strong coverage and make it, ideally, an even better newspaper."
Mr. Coffey and other senior Times officials noted that the newspaper had expanded efforts in some important areas during difficult times. It added correspondents in Berlin, Brussels and Tokyo and started a Seattle bureau. And, after the rioting that followed the 1992 acquittal of the local police officers charged with beating Rodney King, the newspaper revived long-dormant plans for a special Sunday section covering Los Angeles's center city and started a new Spanish-language tabloid.
The newspaper has also continued its Washington edition, with a circulation of 3,000, that is aimed at solidifying the newspaper's reputation with opinion makers on the East Coast.
Times executives also described a program of efficiencies that they said had helped improve the newspaper.
Much of the circulation decline, for example, has been caused by a conscious effort to drive away readers in areas considered too remote from the newspaper's main Southern California market. It was expensive to transport newspapers to other parts of California and other states, and advertisers considered distant readers superfluous, Times executives said.
 
Changes in the Newsroom
 The search for efficiencies has spread into the newsroom, though staff cuts there have not been as large as in other divisions of the paper. In better times, the news department was known for providing its star reporters with opportunities that were rare in journalism. Some routinely worked for months at a time on long articles.
David Laventhol, the newspaper's publisher who recently announced that he would step down on Jan. 1 because of illness, said the newspaper's need for efficiency meant it now had little room for reporters who produced two or three articles a year.
A new publisher named earlier this month, Richard T. Schlosberg 3d, is a former Air Force pilot who cultivates an image of toughness. But in a lengthy conversation before his promotion was announced, he said he believed "the era of the metropolitan newspaper is going to have a rebirth" through rigorous management. Mr. Schlosberg is expected to continue most of the policies he inherits from Mr. Laventhol.
 
 
'It Sort of Hit a Wall'
 For each "silver lining" explanation from Times management, however, there is another that suggests that the newspaper's new era of limits has come at a heavy price. "All of a sudden, it sort of hit a wall," said Noel Greenwood, a former deputy managing editor who left the newspaper last year after a 25-year career there.
The results, Mr. Greenwood and other Times veterans said, are diminished goals and an unmeasurable loss of self-confidence at the newspaper.
"It was, for many years, a newspaper that aspired to be, at the least, one of the highest-quality regional newspapers in the United States," Mr. Greenwood said, "and there has been a series of retreats from that."
Bella Stumbo, one of the best-known of the newspaper's accomplished writers to accept the buyout plan, said the buyout stripped the newspaper of its most experienced reporters. Such plans often have the effect of removing senior workers because of their higher earnings.
Ms. Stumbo said Times managers were damaging the paper. "They seem," she said, "to be methodically eviscerating the senior staff."
Mr. Coffey and other Times officials denied that the newspaper had diminished its ambitions and said it had hired new writers with broad experience at other newspapers.
Mr. Coffey quoted Otis Chandler, the last member of the newspaper's founding family to serve as its publisher, as saying the newspaper was "global and local" in its influence and its coverage. Mr. Coffey said there had been no retreat from that. Mr. Chandler was publisher from 1960 to 1980 and was chairman of the newspaper's parent company, Times Mirror, until 1986.
 
Reducing Expectations

 
 But it is clear that by a series of objective measures, The Los Angeles Times is not what it was. The paper where editors and publishers once talked of ambitions to be an all-California newspaper or, indeed, one that circulated across the Western United States, can no longer be found in Tucson, Ariz., or Salt Lake City. Much of the time, it cannot be found in the central California cities of Modesto or Fresno. Even in San Francisco, the newspaper has scaled back street sales.
The Times is also cutting the number of reporters assigned to its "zoned" coverage, tailored for particular communities in some Los Angeles suburbs. And it closed its San Diego edition last year, surrendering an ambition to dominate California from Santa Barbara to the Mexican border.
For some of the newspaper's managers, one frustration of the financial pressure is that it has focused attention on The Times's problems instead of on what they thought would be a bright new era under Mr. Coffey, who is 47.
Mr. Coffey, a polished and well-read man, was promoted to editor with some fanfare on Jan 1, 1989. After moving through senior editing positions at The Washington Post, and then briefly holding the top editing positions at U.S. News & World Report and The Dallas Times Herald, Mr. Coffey arrived on the fast track at The Los Angeles Times in 1986.
 
Success, and Criticism

 
 Mr. Coffey's tenure has been marked by some clear successes, including a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the Los Angeles riots. The Times has also been innovative in its new design, which uses color photographs and graphics and tries to give readers logical pathways through what was long criticized as a rambling newspaper.
Mr. Coffey has also been criticized. In a highly publicized dispute that boiled over after the disturbances of 1992, some minority reporters and editors said the newspaper, which has few minority journalists in top positions, was resistant to change.
A separate dispute concerns the broad powers Mr. Coffey gave to editors in Orange County, the affluent suburban county south of Los Angeles, to tailor the edition of the newspaper that circulates there. For example, the edition often uses front-page articles on Orange County issues in place of articles chosen for page 1 in the city.
Many newspapers across the country now "zone" their newspapers by substituting items of local interest for others that may appeal to an audience elsewhere.
But Mr. Coffey gave the Orange County editors an unusual level of autonomy. And some people inside and outside of the newspaper have said that remolding a quality paper to appeal to highly local concerns diminishes its stature.
 
Defending the Record
 In a lengthy interview in The Times's executive suite recently, Mr. Coffey turned aside such criticisms.
The dissension in the newsroom after the city was torn by racial tensions, he said, simply reflected that The Los Angeles Times is part of the world. "It would not have been right," he said, "to expect that none of that would have been in the newsroom."
Mr. Coffey defended his record of minority hiring, saying he had increased minority representation in the newsroom from 10 percent to 18 percent, higher than it is at many newspapers.
As for Orange County, he said, the editors there still answer to him. But he noted that since he gave them added control over the edition, The Times has been winning readers in a long-running circulation war with The Orange County Register. While The Register still holds a strong lead in the county, The Times has been gaining.
 
Deflection as ResponseDefense

 
 But Mr. Coffey deflected a series of questions about the declines and cutbacks that have cast a shadow over his tenure. To every question about circulation shrinkage or declining dollars, he answered by discussing the accomplishments of a newspaper that is finding new efficiencies and re-evaluating its priorities.
Near the end of the interview, Mr. Coffey was reminded of his comment that "you play the cards you are dealt."
Were these, he was asked, the cards he thought he had been dealt when he took over one of the richest and most ambitious newspapers in the country?
For the first time in a long conversation, the editor of The Los Angeles Times seemed momentarily at a loss. He smiled a bit awkwardly.
"Are they ever?" he answered.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Self-Defining Governor Looks Ahead

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
TWO years ago, at a breakfast for potential contributors, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo coyly appeared to have finally opened to the door to a Presidential campaign. Matilda Cuomo believed otherwise. She left the power breakfast with the distinct impression that what her husband had said was that he intended to run for Governor again.
"Either she knows all about me, or I am an enigma," Mr. Cuomo mused later. "I hope I am an enigma." 
 He later acknowledged that he had been tempted to run for President but solemnly announced that his obligations as Governor weighed more heavily on his unfinished agenda.
If Mrs. Cuomo was right all along -- if her husband announces within a few weeks, before he diagnoses the State of the State, that he will seek a fourth term -- he will, if he wins and serves most of the four years, have been Governor of New York longer than any of his predecessors. Mercifully, New Yorkers have been spared the recurring speculation about his intentions that, inadvertently or not, he had stoked in Presidential years.
The other day, he cheerfully declined to engage the subject in great detail, and contemplated what others might be saying of him: " 'The guy said for seven months he was not going to play this game.'
"I pick the time the decision has to be made and then I use up all the time. They will have nine months to find a better candidate if I don't run."
His intentions might be gauged by his State of the State address, which he is already drafting: whether it represents a legacy of unheralded accomplishments and unfinished business that he, more than any other Democratic candidate, would be best able to defend or a vision that he rather than the voters will be in a position to see through over four more years.
Against a Republican, he could be more vulnerable than ever. Even some of the voters who give the Governor the benefit of their doubts are weary, or worse, after 12 years, as they were in 1989 of Mayor Edward I. Koch. This year the liabilities of incumbency were driven home to the Governor of New Jersey, to all three citywide incumbents in New York City and to every New York City official elected last month and subject to a just-enacted two-term limit.
Mr. Cuomo is also a contrarian, a Tinkerbell in reverse. Say that he's afraid of losing or cannot win, and he will run. Clap your hands for 12 years of inspiring oratory and for a record undermined by a recession and a Republican-led State Senate and he may vanish from Albany forever.
He suffers from another challenge of his own creation: disillusionment. He has loomed like a larger-than-life colossus, straddling the two tectonic plates of expectation and accomplishment that seem to have drifted apart -- leaving him like a less-than-lithe acrobat attempting a split but seemingly about to land on his rear.
Years ago, the Governor eloquently justified his anomalous role, as President Clinton did earlier this month to a young protester. "Part of my job is to be a lightning rod," the President said. "Part of my job is to lift the hopes and aspirations of the American people, knowing that as long as you're trying to lift hopes and aspirations, you can never fully close the gap between what you're reaching for and what you're actually doing."
Which is why Mr. Cuomo was miffed this fall when it was suggested that the title of an anthology of his speeches, "More Than Words," might encapsulate what seems, to some people, to be missing from his record.
"A lot of people have worked hard to do a lot of good things since our improbable victory in 1982," Mr. Cuomo wrote in an adaptation from his diary, "and I hate to see them slighted because I failed to meet people's expectations of me personally."
"Every time the question is asked, I recall the good political advice my son Andrew gave me in 1983: 'Youll want to do everything, but the people won't be able to remember everything, so pick one thing and say it over and over -- "I'm the Education Governor," or the "Environment Governor." Keep it simple and repetitive, as we do in a political campaign, to help the people remember.' "
That might be good politics, but not good government, Mr. Cuomo wrote, deciding instead to pursue all of his goals simultaneously without worrying which might constitute his most marketable legacy.
"Frankly, I believe the result is that we have earned the right to be associated with an extraordinary range of significant -- and in some cases unique -- accomplishments, notwithstanding they are too many to put on a bumper sticker, or to describe in a 28-second commercial or even an 800-word written analysis."
Mr. Cuomo produced a five-page, single-space typed litany of them (public works, economic development, state tax cuts that in some cases prompted compensatory local tax increases, doubling prison capacity, changing the face of the State Court of Appeals).
After all is said, if not done, he conceded Andrew was right, but added: "Looking ahead, though, I plan to continue to try to do everything we can -- all at once -- to create opportunities and to meet the needs of New Yorkers. The truth is, I think the only label that would really please me would be 'The Governing Governor.' "
Blessed with the Republican-run Senate that has been a convenient foil as well as an obstacle, he also is running against a state government that he would revamp through a constitutional convention -- providing him on the eve of an economic recovery with still another vital rationale to run without having to go through hoops to rationalize the race.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Television;
From radio to pay-per-view, Howard Stern climbs his mountain. Is late-night TV at the summit?

BYLINE: By Bill Carter

 BODY:
HOWARD STERN has spent most of his career confronting value judgments made about him. Now he's eager to supply a stack of green-backed evidence to anyone interested in judging his current value.
"I find myself in a position to say to the powers that be that not only is my radio show a force to be reckoned with," Mr. Stern said, "but it also has serious economic clout." 
 The 39-year-old radio comedian, who has built his reputation on the use of language and subject matter that offends many and amuses many others, has seen his stock as an entertainer soar in recent months.
Mr. Stern's morning radio show, the base of his operation, is top-rated in many of the 16 cities where it is broadcast, including New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia. His first book, "Private Parts," reached No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list (despite being banned from some stores) and has one million copies in print. Widespread reports have three movie studios making offers for him to star in films. And several television companies, most prominently Fox Broadcasting, are offering deals for him to jump into the swirling caldron of late-night talk shows.
Mr. Stern's bankability may be proved again on Dec. 31, when he will try to buck the trend of poor results for entertainment programming on pay-per-view television. Mr. Stern will offer an adult-oriented special lasting one hour and 50 minutes starting at 11 P.M. Eastern and Pacific time, built around his own uncensored brand of beauty pageant. The guests on the show include what amounts to an all-star team from the tabloid league: John Wayne Bobbitt, Heidi Fleiss and Joey Buttafuoco.
Mr. Stern said the pay-per-view format made sense to him now for several reasons, mainly having to do with content and money. The content can be, as he put it, "as wild and outrageous" as on the radio show, and he will be able to avoid the scrutiny of his nemesis, the Federal Communications Commission, which has no jurisdiction over pay-per-view.
Citing certain comments on the radio show as indecent, the F.C.C. has fined the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, Mr. Stern's employer, in recent months. More disturbing, in Mr. Stern's view, has been the chill these fines have imposed on Infinity's ability to buy radio stations.
"What's good about pay-per-view," Mr. Stern said, "is that nobody gets it who didn't pay to get it."
And then there is the money. Pay-per-view has been promising a fortune to entertainers and sports promoters for more than a decade, but that promise has seldom been kept.
Pay-per-view now reaches 20 million of the country's 55 million homes with cable television, but the industry has been weak in marketing. Results for most events have been modest.
In the entertainment area, "a half of 1 percent buy rate is now considered good," said Dantia Gould, the editor of Pay-Per-View Update, a newsletter that follows the industry. The buy rate is the percentage of homes with pay-per-view that buy a program; a 1 percent buy rate translates to about 200,000 homes. The farewell concert by the Judds, for example, did 1 percent, she said, "and that was called a success."
Mr. Stern said he expected to do much better, and executives in the pay-per-view industry tended to agree. Ms. Gould said: "I think he can do sensationally. It's the right combination. He's hot, and he has the radio show where he can really promote it."
She said the price, $39.95, might be a little steep. But she said Mr. Stern's mostly young, male audience is the perfect profile for pay-per-view. She said Mr. Stern might get 3, 4 or even 5 percent of the available audience, at least in the areas where his radio show is hot.
At a national buy rate of 3 percent, or 600,000 homes, the event would take in about $24 million, of which half would go to the cable operators for distributing the event, the rest to Mr. Stern and his partners, Main Event Television.
Mr. Stern said he wanted success of that magnitude to help "prove my commercial viability." That proof is especially important now, Mr. Stern said, because a bonanza on pay-per-view "will set up the next group of things that we do."
Mr. Stern said he was torn between accepting an offer to do a film or going directly into late-night television. A movie might not be ready to go into theaters for almost two years, he noted, while a television deal could be struck fairly quickly. Fox has had a big vacancy in the late-night area since the rapid demise of "The Chevy Chase Show," and Mr. Stern said he had also talked with representatives of one of the planned fifth networks as well as syndicators.
Either way, he said, "the idea of going on television and beating Letterman and Leno would be tremendous to me." The plan is ambitious: he said his show's format would immediately grab a segment of the younger audience, eventually driving both Arsenio Hall and Jay Leno off the air and "leaving a three-way competition between me, David Letterman and 'Nightline.' "
"I wouldn't get into it if I didn't think I could win," he added.
This rosy outlook, however, has one complication: the workload. Mr. Stern said he is committed by contract to stay with his radio show for two more years. That would mean four or five hours of radio each morning followed by the preparation and taping of a talk show in the evening.
Mr. Stern said the odds of his taking on the late-night challenge were "right at 50-50." He said he would decide on the television offers "within the next two or three weeks."
He said that his book had brought him a legitimacy with the mainstream media and that he did not think he was risking any of his prospects by going into areas on the pay-per-view special "that might be perceived as blue or raunchy."
"I always have that in the back of my mind, but forget it," he said. "I have never gotten anywhere worrying about the powerful elite who run the media, the people who might be looking at me for late-night television or movies or things like that. I go by what I think is funny. When it comes to pay-per-view I know who I have to satisfy.
"There will be network types who'll say, 'All he's good for is doing this raunchy pay-per-view.' Fine. So be it."

Shattering the Legends Of West's Pistol Packers

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Anyone who believes that Jesse James resembled Tyrone Power or that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid lived up to their reincarnations by Paul Newman and Robert Redford will be stunned to learn tonight that it wasn't like that at all.
"Outlaws, Rebels and Rogues," the first program of the three that make up "The Untold West," performs what may be the least necessary debunking in American history as it reports that Jesse, who started his career as a Confederate bushwhacker, wrote his own press releases and that a week after he was shot, Ma James was giving tours of their house; that despite 48 movies celebrating Billy the Kid, little is known about his doings (except that he was born in New York City), which does not stop people from paying to see the hole in a wall that is said to have been inflicted by the bullet with which, the ballad tells us, Billy was "shot down by Pat Garrett who once was his friend"; that Butch and Sundance only achieved in the 1969 movie that bore their name the fame that had eluded them in life, and that Belle Starr looked a lot more like Walter Brennan than like Gene Tierney. 
 Even if such revelations do not knock off your 10-gallon hat, they are presented engagingly, with plenty of clips from old movies, some harmless re-enactments and amiable asides by Old West historians, who agree that the famous bad men and woman of pulp and celluloid were all "outlaws of the imagination."
The series continues tomorrow night with "The Black West," an account of the role that blacks -- including Mary Fields, who is said to have ridden for the Pony Express when she was 70 -- played in Western lore. Wednesday's offering, "Hot on the Trail," features Calamity Jane, the Harvey Girls and a Mrs. Noonan, a cavalry vamp who turned out to be a man. It's only a matter of time till somebody debunks them all.
 
'The Cronkite Report'
'The Uninvited: Immigrants at the Gate'
Discovery Channel, 8 P.M.
This sober and sobering survey may not tell you much you have not already read or heard about the plight of refugees and the problems of immigration, but it packs a lot of pain into an hour.
Walter Cronkite, in a somewhat pontifical mood, begins with an overview of a population explosion, particularly in Africa, Asia and Latin America, that portends dire water shortages, environmental devastation and increasing misery. Add the upheaval that has followed the collapse of the Soviet Union and other ethnic and religious conflicts around the world and the result is millions of mostly impoverished people on the move.
Mr. Cronkite reports, too, on the backlash against immigrants in a Europe floundering in recession and on outbursts of racism in Germany and even in Britain. He notes that antiforeign sentiment has been growing in the United States, too, despite this country's history as a recycling station for the wretched refuse from other shores. Nighttime pictures of Mexicans entering the United States show how porous national borders can be.
Experts, notably Doris Meissner, the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization Services, make sensible observations about the conflict between America's traditions and present-day realities, without pretending to have any solutions.

HEADLINE: Welfare Reform in the Making

 BODY:
One of every four children in America is poor; nearly one of every three is born to an unwed mother and 70 percent are raised on welfare.
The statistics are grim, which is why President Clinton put a vow to "end welfare as we know it" near the center of his domestic agenda. The central idea is to make welfare a temporary stop on the way to a job. And according to internal documents obtained by Jason DeParle of The Times, a working group appointed by the President will soon propose legislation to carry out the pledge. 
 Though the working group remains divided on important issues, it is united on the basic thrust. Welfare offices will be turned into agencies that find jobs, not just cut checks. They will provide training, education, child care and health insurance. But, in order to compel recipients to find work quickly, cash assistance will be cut off or down after two years unless there are extenuating circumstances.
Time-limited welfare is the key to Mr. Clinton's reform. But to make the threat humane -- and make the plan politically viable -- government must find work for enrollees who do everything right but still can't find a job. The draft document would require enrollees to accept a subsidized private-sector job or government employment or work off their welfare grants by doing community service. But all-important questions -- such as whether community service would also be time-limited, or what the likely cost would be -- were left unanswered.
Nor does the draft document explain how millions of new workers would be absorbed into the work force. In the past, Congress tried subsidizing employers to hire the unemployed, but the policy backfired because employers wouldn't hire applicants stigmatized by government subsidies. Congress could create public-sector jobs. But if the jobs are meaningful and the workers are paid prevailing wages, as organized labor wants, that is hugely expensive. If jobs are make-work, taxpayers may become outraged at what would appear to be a boondoggle. And any program to put welfare recipients into jobs threatens to displace equally-deserving low-paid workers.
The draft document makes a troubling promise that welfare reform will be self-funded. That could mean no more than that welfare reform will conform to existing budget laws. But if the promise means reform will have to be paid out of cuts in other parts of the welfare program, then the initiative could do more harm than good.
Skimpy funding buried Congress's previous reform, a 1988 law sponsored by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. The law provided all the right ingredients: training, education, job-search assistance, child care and health insurance. But Congress appropriated only about $1 billion a year in matching funds, far below the $6 billion needed.
Studies by the Manpower Research Development Corporation show that in states like Florida and California, where aggressive programs of education, training and job-search were begun, welfare rolls declined and earnings rose. The impacts were small but positive. That suggests -- and the working group agrees -- that the first task is to wring everything possible from the 1988 reform by putting up much more money. Only then will it be time to fixate on the new get-tough policies. And even then, the children of those whose benefits are cut would have to be protected by providing health insurance, food stamps and some child support.
The big hurdle will be money. Mr. Clinton must convince the public that the goal isn't to save a little money in the short run. The larger goal is to save lives -- the lives of the teen-age dropouts and their children -- in the long run. Growing up in poverty for prolonged periods is a ticket to trouble. It is not just a personal tragedy for the families but an albatross for the economy.

HEADLINE: How to Get Real on Global Warming

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Philip M. Boffey correctly notes that hard questions face the Clinton Administration as it continues to search for global warming policies that will deliver real results ("China and Global Warming," Editorial Notebook, Dec. 8). Mr. Boffey raises a very controversial topic: whether American companies should be allowed to meet emissions reduction goals through investments abroad. 
 In its recently released Climate Change Action Plan, the Administration stressed that overseas ventures -- also known as "joint implementation" projects -- would be encouraged. However, the missing ingredient is an Administration commitment that reductions achieved as a result of such projects will be counted toward the domestic reduction goal.
Recently, U.S. electric utility companies have become involved in joint implementation projects that preserve valuable forest areas abroad, deliver ancillary economic benefits to local populations, and offset greenhouse gas emissions considerably. All this is accomplished at low cost, especially when compared with similar projects in the United States.
If the Clinton Administration continues to pay only lip service to such joint implementation projects without providing a clear signal that reductions achieved abroad will be counted toward the U.S. goal, companies will begin to shy away from such opportunities and costs will be driven up in the process. The only way to put a dent in emissions rates in countries like China is to provide the proper incentives now.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A building revival rekindles interest in construction stocks.

BYLINE: By Andrea Adelson

 BODY:
AS an economic recovery appears to take hold in the United States, some analysts suggest that engineering and construction stocks are likely to appreciate in the next year as the swinging of I-beams and the pounding of jackhammers begins in earnest.
But the market has failed to see that a boom within this sector is well under way, analysts say, creating opportunities for investors. 
 Companies like the privately held Bechtel Group, the publicly traded Halliburton Company and the Fluor Corporation have seen their order backlogs climb to near record levels after business bottomed out during the collapse of the oil patch in the early 1980's. Fluor may be especially attractive, analysts say.
Even in the face of such fundamental trends, economic malaise continues to depress stock prices among the construction giants. As recently as Nov. 5, shares of Fluor fell to $38.625, near its 52-week low of $38 in intraday trading on April 26. On Friday, the shares closed at $41.375. This, despite the fact that Fluor has seen its order backlog rise to $14.9 billion, and last week delivered its sixth consecutive year of earnings growth.
In a report last month, Jeanne G. Terrile, an analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company, said the stocks had been stuck in low trading ranges since 1991, in part, because since the rebuilding of Kuwait after the Persian Gulf war, "there has been no new theme with legs" for investors in the construction business.
Yet two old themes still support the long-term investment potential of engineering and construction stocks, she said. As economies recover, investment will increase in power plants, factories, consumer-goods and oil refineries in developing countries.
That, in turn, will stimulate capital investment by producers in developed nations and regions, like Japan, the United States and Western Europe to compete with new economic rivals.
Fluor, which is based in Irvine, Calif., is well positioned in both sectors because "it sells sophisticated, project-management expertise," said Mark Altman, an analyst at Paine Webber Inc. "That's something that will be very valuable as we see large projects come along."
Fluor is still best known for building Saudi Petrochemical's $4 billion industrial city and gas-gathering project in Jubail during the late 1970's.
Since 1986, however, the executives who succeeded J. Robert Fluor, the late grandson of the founder of the company, have become disciples of diversification, even bidding for jobs of less than $1 billion.
Daimler-Benz used Fluor to pinpoint the location for its Mercedes auto plant in the United States. The Department of Energy awarded Fluor and its partner, Jacobs Engineering, a $2.2 billion project cleaning up nuclear-bomb refuse at Fernald, Ohio. Chicago officials chose Fluor for a $200 million modernization of the city's "911" emergency telephone system to handle five million calls a year.
"In being all things to all people, it's a certainty your profit margins will be lower," said John Simon, an analyst for Seidler Amdec Securities. But Fluor's new "shotgun" approach reduces the company's exposure to oil shocks, he said.
Because of the company's global experience and its adroitness in political hot spots, analysts said they believed that foreign business would be the company's main source of future earnings. Fluor's non-United States backlog has risen to 40 percent, from 20 percent in 1988.
While cooperating with a foreign rival to win an international job has become standard procedure among American companies, Fluor takes the strategy a step farther. The company created a joint venture with Mexico's largest construction company, ICA Industrial, even with no large deal in sight.

HEADLINE: THE RUSSIAN VOTE: Man in the News -- Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky;
Muscovite With Bravado

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 13

 BODY:
If his party had not won almost a quarter of the vote in parliamentary elections on Sunday, Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky could well be dismissed as a crude parody of a primitive right-winger, fired by self-pity and primitive nationalism, quick to blame foreigners, intellectuals or unappreciative betters for all his failures, certain of his cause.
His posters show the 47-year-old lawyer wearing a badly knotted tie and a puffy scowl over slogans like, "I'll raise Russia from her knees," or "I'll not allow anyone to offend Russians." 
 His speeches are the stuff of barroom bravado: when he gets Alaska back from the United States, he'll make sure the Americans compensate Russia for the natural resources they used up. Give the Kurile Islands back to Japan? They'll forget about their claim to the land when he sends Russian warships cruising off Hokkaido.
By the time the Central Asians finish cutting each other's throats, they'll beg to become part of Russia. But if he does deem to accept them, it'll be as a volost or uezd -- the smallest administrative units of the old Russian Empire.
 
The Last Great Crusade
 He dreams of Russian soldiers massing for the last great crusade -- "The Last Play for the South" as he calls his autobiography published this year -- a vast drive to Russia's predestined borders on the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.
To counter whispers that Mr. Zhirinovsky is homosexual, a party broadsheet in his office carries a series of five snapshots of him ogling a buxom woman's decolletage over dinner under the headline, "They say Vladimir Zhirinovsky is indifferent to women. Is that so?" Mr. Zhirinovksy is married and has a son.
His autobiography reads like a parody of Dostoyevsky's "Insulted and Injured": he remembers every childhood slight, the names of boys who beat him. He describes an unrelentingly miserable childhood in a communal apartment; he seems to revel in describing humiliations.
"I was denied the most elementary family coziness, human warmth," he wrote. "Life itself forced me to suffer from the very day, the moment, the instant of my birth. Society could give me nothing.
"Two months before her death, my mother would tell me, 'Volodya, there's nothing to remember, not one happy day.' "
Born in Kazakhstan on April 26, 1946, and educated in Moscow, Mr. Zhirinovsky spends ardent pages in his book seeking to prove that he is a Russian. "Vladimir" is a Russian name, he reminds the reader, his town and building were peopled by Russians, all his relatives -- except for the husbands of two distant aunts -- are Russians. The only problem is the name of the father who died shortly after he was born, Volf. The name, Mr. Zhirinovsky acknowledges, is "not so familiar to a Russian ear."
It is from such defensive nationalism and remembered slights that Mr. Zhirinovsky shaped the world view that met with so powerful a response from a confused, humiliated and impoverished nation.
It was a woefully familiar pattern in the 20th century, and shouts of "fascist!" quickly sounded from the ranks of democrats.
"Fascism and Communism are not synonymous," warned Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, whose powerfully promoted Russia's Choice Party failed to garner as many votes as Mr. Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party.
"Fascism is what comes after disappointment in Communism. This historic risk cannot be underrated."
It is too early to judge whether Mr. Zhirinovsky qualifies as a fascist, but his party is neither liberal nor democratic. It was formed in 1990, but before long it became purely a platform for Mr. Zhirinovsky and his menu of quick solutions, nationalist bluster and alluring promises.
One paper called it "autocratic populism." He was the little man bashing the big guys. He played to deep-seated resentments of the Communists who had enslaved Russians, of the "democrats" who had impoverished them, of the Americans who were exploiting them.
He promised protection for the poor, security for the rich, honor and dignity for the military, bread for the hungry, a peaceful life for the old and holidays in Cuba for all.
He vowed to make Russia great, feared and respected again. His symbol was a falcon over a Russia that extended from Alaska to Finland. He would reconstitute a Russia stretched to its imperial borders. He would stop closing down military industries and would resume exporting arms to old clients like Iraq.
In fact, while President Boris N. Yeltsin was acquiescing in the American-led sanctions against Iraq, Mr. Zhirinovsky traveled there and met with President Saddam Hussein.
"I am a moderate in all things," he declared in his book. "Only on the question of statehood am I firm."
It was the stuff Russians increasingly wanted to hear as their world fell apart. The first sign of Mr. Zhirinovsky's appeal came in Russia's presidential race in 1991, when he came in third.
The confusion and dislocation of Mr. Gaidar's economic reforms turned out to be a gold mine. Mr. Zhirinovsky lay low when Mr. Yeltsin disbanded the old Congress of People's Deputies, but when the campaign for a new Parliament began, he emerged with an ample war chest and probably the best understanding of the potency of television.
His rapid-fire delivery and unambiguous pledges drew more attention than the academic and stilted speeches of his opponents, and his ratings soon began to rise.
Mr. Zhirinovsky's sound bites were crisp, his delivery was entertaining: He wouldn't need war to bring former republics back under Russia, he declared. "If we cease assistance, those countries would not last for a month. Why should we create sufferings for ourselves? Let's create sufferings for others."
He wrote: "The flow of refugees is easy to stop. It's enough to threaten those regions from where Russians are driven out that we shall treat their ethnic kin living in Russia in the same way."
 
Backed the Constitution
 He was all for Mr. Yeltsin's draft constitution and the extensive powers it gave the President. "If I could, I would have increased his powers even more," Mr. Zhirinovsky said.
At his party headquarters, on the fourth floor of a dilapidated Moscow tenement, there were all kinds: bearded nationalists, clean-cut youths, dark-suited apparatchiks. Aleksandr Zivkov, a party official, said financial backers of the party were "new businessmen of a patriotic orientation."
No demographic study has yet been published that maps out his followers. But interviews and samplings showed strong support among soldiers and sailors, among disaffected youths, pensioners, workers in military industry -- among those, who, like the young Zhirinovsky, felt rejected, abused, humiliated and impotent as their country tumbled from great power to economic cripple.
"How do I see Russia?" Mr. Zhirinovsky wrote in his book. "I do not see Russia weeping. I see Russia proud, Russia in which the proud traditions of her army will be again realized, where again talented Russian engineers and businessmen will create the latest technology."

HEADLINE: With Time Waning, Europeans Reject U.S. Movie Compromise

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The European Community today rejected an offer by the United States aimed at securing better treatment for American movies in Europe, virtually insuring that the final content of a world trade accord, likely in some form by the deadline Wednesday, will remain in doubt until the last minute.
After a report here today from the community's chief negotiator, Sir Leon Brittan, foreign ministers of the 12 members sent Sir Leon back to Geneva for renewed talks with Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative. The European foreign ministers plan to meet again in Brussels on Wednesday, to make a final decision on the seven-year negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
 "The conditions for a definitive agreement have not yet been secured," Foreign Minister Alain Juppe of France said. "Important difficulties, particularly on the cinema issue, but also on shipping, textiles, financial services and aircraft subsidies, remain."
A GATT accord, bolstering international trade by extending its rules and lowering tariffs an average 30 percent on manufactured goods, is widely regarded by economists, diplomats and government leaders as crucial in a world tempted to create regional trading blocs, disoriented by old antagonisms and new alignments with the cold war's end, and afflicted by recession in many industrial nations.
One possibility being discussed here in Brussels and in Geneva would be to leave out of the agreement the contentious issue of a French reduction or elimination of taxes and quotas on American-made movies, television programs and music recordings. But it was by no means clear that the United States would accept such an outcome.
American officials have made clear that the movie issue is a potential deal breaker because it affects an important export industry with strong prospects for growth. But Sir Leon said, "I do not believe the Americans would prevent a Uruguay Round agreement on the audio-visual issue." The trade talks began in the Uruguayan resort of Punta del Este in 1986.
[In Tokyo early Tuesday, Japan took another step toward world trade cohesiveness. The Socialist Party, the largest member of the shaky governing coalition, dropped its resistance to opening the rice market to imports. Page A6.]
The difficulties, while real and substantial, appeared relatively manageable when weighed against what has already been accomplished, and the continuing political will in Washington, London, Paris, Bonn and Tokyo to keep pushing for an agreement -- even one that is less than complete -- by Wednesday's deadline.
"I believe we will have an agreement within the set time frame," Sir Leon said.
Peter Sutherland, chief of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva, where the negotiators are pressing for a conclusion, announced, "We have made startling progress."
And the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, said: "In the end, the overall picture of what has been achieved should prevail. It would be bizarre if the Uruguay Round failed now because of film tickets and cassettes."
After Wednesday, President Clinton loses the special negotiating authority that allows him to submit an agreement to Congress for approval without amendment. He could seek renewal of that authority, but such a tactic would create the need for two GATT votes, a politically ticklish situation after the bruising battle for approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
 
In Europeans' Interest, Too
 Sir Leon, in his report to the European ministers, acknowledged this political imperative. Pointing to the tremendous potential benefits for the European economy from tariff reductions and trade freedoms that have already been agreed to, he said, "The interest of the European Community is now to accept the agreements of the Uruguay Round."
But, in his most significant reservation, Sir Leon said that the movies, recorded music and other forms of entertainment should be excluded from an accord "if the community's position is not acceptable in all its aspects to its trading partners."
This underlined that the main obstacle to an agreement still lies in the dispute over how much protection the United States is prepared to allow Europe in the highly sensitive and fast-growing movie and entertainment industries.
The issue is politically explosive on both sides of the Atlantic because films and programs are the United States' second-biggest export industry, after aircraft and aerospace, and President Clinton has an important political base in California, home to a movie industry whose exports to Europe alone were worth $3.6 billion last year. In France, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and others have turned what is termed the defense of the nation's culture into something approaching a crusade.
Moreover, in the politics of the European Community, Sir Leon is known to have ambitions to succeed Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, the community's year-round administrative arm, when Mr. Delors steps down at the end of this year. Thus, it is vital for Sir Leon, an Englishman, to be seen as defending French interests to the last in this contretemps.
 
Notion of One European Culture
 "What we are prepared to do on the audio-visual question is balanced and reasonable," Sir Leon said before departing for Geneva. "The United States already has 80 percent of the European movie market, and that market is growing. This is not an American industry fighting for survival. The European Community wants to have the capacity to support its own culture, and that seems to me to be reasonable."
Community officials said Mr. Kantor had made a number of compromise proposals on the issue, which centers on the United States' objections to European quotas that limit American movies on television as well as to French taxes collected on box-office receipts, of which nearly 60 percent are for American films, and cassette sales. The money raised -- about $350 million last year -- is used to subsidize the French film industry.
 
Splitting the Difference
 The American compromise offer included a request that the quotas -- limiting American programs to less than half of television broadcasts in Europe -- not apply during prime time. Mr. Kantor also suggested that when cable services increased the number of channels available in Europe, only half of them be subject to the quotas, the official said.
Another American proposal was that when new technology gives viewers access to "video on demand" -- the ability to call up a vast range of videos to the television screen rather than going to a store to rent them -- the European quota system should not apply.
These approaches were all rejected by the community ministers, and a German spokesman, Werner Wendt, said the most likely area for compromise appeared to be on France's 11 percent box-office tax. The United States has asked that some of that go to American film makers. "We feel confident there will be a compromise on this royalties question, perhaps on the basis that the money the Americans received would be reinvested in Europe," Mr. Wendt said.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Rising Concentration Of Black and Hispanic Students

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
Despite three decades of costly and difficult efforts to integrate public schools, the number of black and Hispanic students in schools with predominantly minority enrollments is rising, a Harvard University study has found.
The study, released yesterday by the Harvard Project on School Desegregation, attributed the rise to higher birth rates and immigration rather than white flight to the suburbs. It also said poverty and housing patterns had concentrated black and Hispanic students in large cities. 
 The report defined predominantly minority schools as those with more than 50 percent of their enrollment made up of either black or Hispanic students, or both, but it did not specify the composition of those schools, which increasingly have mixed enrollments of black and Hispanic students, who can be of any race.
 
Highest Levels Since '68
 The report said that 66 percent of black students, or 4.6 million of the 6.9 million black students in the nation's public schools, attended the predominantly minority schools in the 1991-92 school year, the highest level since the 76 percent reported by the Federal Government in 1968.
It also found that 74.3 percent of Hispanic students, or 3.7 million of the total 5 million students, attended such schools, also the highest percentage in 25 years. Asians were not included in the report.
The report, conducted for the National School Boards Association, found that schools in the Northeast were the most racially separate of any region and that while the South remained the most integrated region, some of the efforts to integrate had slowed and were even being reversed by the same economic and population factors affecting the rest of the country.
"This report reflects what may be the beginning of a historic reversal," said Gary Orfield, a Harvard professor of education who has specialized in school desegregation. "The civil rights impulse from the 1960's is dead in the water and the ship is floating backward toward the shoals of racial segregation."
While educators and civil rights groups said yesterday that integrated classrooms were the ideal, they pointed to the quality of education as far more important than a classroom's racial mix -- that separate but equal education is possible, in spite of the Brown v. Board of Education case in which the Supreme Court ruled that a separate education is inherently unequal.
"At the present time, we are more concerned with the quality of education and this has to take precedence over whether schools are integrated," said Dr. Beverly P. Cole, director of education and housing for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "Having said that," she added, "we still support desegregation efforts and busing is a means to that end."
 
Little Surprise
 The study's findings did not surprise civil rights or desegregation experts, who said that they had seen through their casework mounting anecdotal evidence that black and Hispanic students were being clustered in some public schools. And demographic studies have predicted that within 30 years, half the nation's public schools will be predominantly black and Hispanic. But the groups emphasized that what was more crucial was well-financed schools with strong curriculums and well-trained teachers for all children.
In the 1991-92 school year, the period covered by the study, there were 42 million students enrolled in kindergarten through 12th grade. Of those, 16.4 percent, or 6.9 million students, were black, and 11.8 percent, or 5 million students, were Hispanic. White students accounted for 67.4 percent, or 28.3 million, of enrollment, while Asians represented 3.4 percent, or 1.4 million. American Indian or Alaska native accounted for 420,000, or 1 percent.
The study found that after decades of progress, schools in the South had rising concentrations of black students and those in the West had rising concentrations of Hispanic students.
The nation's largest cities have the highest concentrations of black and Hispanic students, and in large inner cities, "15 of every 16 African-American and Latino students are in schools where most of the students are nonwhite." In medium-size cities, the report said, "63 percent of African-American and 70 percent of Latinos attend such schools."
 
Poverty and Education
 Making the link between poverty and minority concentration in schools, the report said that black and Hispanic students were much more likely than white students to find themselves in schools where achievement is lower. The educational system, the report said, thus perpetuates "the educational inequality of minority students." It said that these deficiencies could not be sufficiently overcome by the Chapter 1 program, the $6.1-billion-a-year Federal program that helps students reach grade level in reading and math.
In New York, Washington and Los Angeles, the study said that civil leaders often assume racial and ethnic separation is worse in the South. But both black and Hispanic students face the most intense separation in Northeastern states, the study said.
The study also found that the clustering of black and Hispanic students in some schools is not exclusively urban. The suburbs of the nation's largest cities "two-thirds of the Latinos and three-fifths of the blacks were in predominantly minority schools."
The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union increasingly have filed lawsuits against school districts and states, using integration as a lever to raise the issue of disparities in wealth between rich, typically white, districts and poor, usually minority school systems. There are now 28 states involved in litigation over their method of financing public schools, and several state courts already have deemed that state finance formulas have helped create separate and unequal schools.
 
Remedies Suggested
 Noting that it took years to address the issue of integration in Federal courts, the report recommended some solutions that bypass courts altogether. It recommended the resumption of a Nixon Administration program killed by the Reagan Administration, the Emergency School Aid Act of 1972, which allocated $1 billion in its peak years to help ease the tension of integration by training teachers in integrated schools. It also supported early experiments in magnet schools, which use specialized curriculums to lure a mix of students crossing racial lines and neighborhoods.
Although busing remains the most widely used remedy for integrating schools, the study recommended a broader remedy, including greater enforcement efforts by the Justice Department and the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights.
It also calls for "restoration of Federal aid for successful integration strategies and for basic research on the consequences of segregation by race, ethnicity and poverty."
The report also recommended efforts to find ways to eliminate housing patterns that had led to segregated schools. The Palm Beach County Public Schools in Florida, for instance, reward developers by building schools near their housing developments if the developer successfully sells his homes to a diverse group of buyers.

HEADLINE: THE RUSSIAN VOTE;
On the Russian Vote, Clinton Accentuates the Positive

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRYN MAWR, Pa. Dec. 13

 BODY:
President Clinton today welcomed the outcome of Russia's first parliamentary elections, saying that despite the strong showing by nationalist parties, the new Constitution and Parliament had swept away the last remnants of the Soviet system and had laid a foundation for democracy.
In a brief chat with reporters after an economic conference at Bryn Mawr College, Mr. Clinton sought to put the best face on the Russian vote. While noting that not all the ballots had been tallied, Mr. Clinton did say that the strong showing of the fervently nationalist Liberal Democratic Party in the early returns should serve as a reminder to the West about how difficult the transition to democracy was for Russian working people. 
 The election results should also prompt a little more sensitivity on toward the treacherous territory President Boris N. Yeltsin has to navigate, he said.
"It will be quite some time before you have a real feel for what's going to happen," Mr. Clinton said. "But I do think that this vote sends a signal about how difficult it is to convert from that old Communist system to a market economy at a time of global recession, when the ability of any other nation or group of nations to give a big infusion of capital to provide temporary security is not there."
The President, fresh from the conference about the economic troubles of the American middle class, drew a parallel to its Russian counterpart.
"Keep in mind that all of these changes, these economic and political changes, are playing out in the former Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe at a time of global recession when there is deep frustration and alienation among middle-class voters in the wealthiest countries," he said. "So this should not be too surprising.
"I think what it means is that we have to think through our approach to these nations, and to remember that there has to be a lot of sensitivity to the ability of ordinary working people to navigate their way through all these tough changes and at least be able to imagine how they are going to come out on top in the end.
"I think that there will be a little more sensitivity to that -- hopefully not just in the United States and Europe and Japan, but also in the international organizations themselves."
 
The Good News
 But throughout his comments Mr. Clinton tried to stress the positive. As a formal White House statement noted: "By approving a new Constitution and voting for a new legislature, the Russian people have eliminated the last vestiges of the old Soviet system and replaced them with new and legitimate institutions that will lay a foundation for continued development of a democratic society. The United States and the international community have a major interest in seeing this process succeed."
Senior Administration officials said that they were taken by surprise by the proportion of support for the ultranationalists, Communists and other anti-reform elements. Nevertheless, they insisted that it was still both politically and mathematically possible that the various reform parties could combine to form a working majority in the Parliament.
"I do think," Mr. Clinton said, "that it will be possible for a majority of people who favor democracy and don't favor a dramatic change in foreign policy for Russia to put together a coalition in the Parliament who can work with the President and go forward."
 
A Glimpse of Stability
 The best news of the elections, American officials said, was the passage of the Constitution, which, they hope, will bring some structure and solidity to the Russian political system and provide some stability in the relations between the legislative and executive branches, an aspect that has been absent for the last year and a half.
"President Yeltsin has stated his readiness to begin a constructive dialogue with the varied political forces that will be represented in it," the White House statement said. "We hope that this sentiment will be reciprocated by all responsible political figures in Russia."

HEADLINE: Mexico's Unions, Frail Now, Face Trade Pact Blows

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Less than a week after the United States Congress passed the North American Free Trade Agreement, with all its promises of a better future for workers on both sides of the border, three Mexicans working at a General Electric motor factory in Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Tex., were abruptly dismissed.
A General Electric spokesman says the company is investigating what happened. But the men say they were dismissed for trying to organize a union not tied to the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party. Bitterly, they say this is the real proof of what free trade will bring. 
 With the trade agreement set to take effect on Jan. 1, the expectations of Mexican workers have soared, and so have their fears because the unions they have relied on for job security and higher wages are weaker than they have been for half a century.
 
In a Poor Position
 Mexican and American officials say that organized labor in Mexico is poorly positioned to help ease the predicted short-term dislocation as many Mexican businesses wither under increased competition or get tougher on workers to increase productivity. Mainstream unions are too tied to the Government, while the small independent unions are too easily crushed.
"What you'll see is a very far-reaching set of changes in Mexico that the unions either are going to have to accept or be run over, given the Mexican Government's policies," said Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California at Berkeley.
The added pressure of the trade agreement could increase divisions between organized labor and the Institutional Revolutionary Party, hastening what appears to be a fundamental shift in Mexican politics. At the least, the pact appears likely to increase tensions in a labor movement ready for some type of change. Fidel Velazquez, the head of the official Confederation of Mexican Workers, is 93 years old and has been in charge since the 1930's.
Many workers feel left out of the country's economic revitalization and unprotected by their unions. And unlike unions in the United States, the mainstream unions supported the free trade accord.
 
Workers Express Bitterness
 The arrangement has led to some bitterness among workers.
"The American unions are acting as unions should -- protecting jobs in their country," said Ernesto Lucero, a 39-year-old unemployed sugar worker who camped for two weeks in Mexico City's central plaza last month along with about 200 other members of the sugar workers' union to demand help. "But here, Government and unions support each other in a nice little arrangement that has nothing to do with the working man."
Most Mexican unions have strong ties to the Institutional Revolutionary Party and members of the Confederation of Mexican Workers hold more than a dozen legislative seats and the governorships of three states.
For decades, the labor confederation has faithfully delivered five million votes to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, and the confederation has pledged to do so again for Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, the party's candidate in the 1994 presidential race. But more and more the Government is using its close relationship with the unions to weaken their power.
In many cases the unions have been forced by the Government to negotiate on contracts plant by plant, rather than nationwide, and they are now being asked to bear with low wages while the economy grows, although the average wage in Mexico still has not recovered the buying power it had in the early 1980's.
Tensions between the Government and organized labor increased just a few weeks after Carlos Salinas de Gortari became President in 1988, when he took on the leader of the powerful petroleum workers union, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia. Mr. Hernandez was arrested and charged with financial impropriety, illegal possession of arms and involvement in the death of a Mexican federal agent. In July, he was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
 
Tough Line for Unions
 Mr. Salinas then hobbled the Mexican public schoolteachers' union by making education a responsibility of the states instead of the federal Government. This limited the union's power by forcing it to negotiate 31 separate contracts instead of one.
With its ambitious program to sell state-owned businesses, the Salinas Administration lopped off 400,000 jobs, many of them union jobs, and said it was for the good of the nation. In 1992, the Government backed Volkswagen de Mexico when it dismissed all 14,000 plant workers and rehired only those who renounced dissident union leaders.
"The future is black for all those unions not willing to subject themselves to the authorities or to the executive power in the nation," said Antonio Velazquez Loza, general coordinator of the Authentic Labor Front, one of Mexico's few independent labor organizations. It represents about 70,000 people in 18 states and led the modest opposition to the free-trade agreement in Mexico. It was the Labor Front that tried to organize workers at the G.E. plant in Ciudad Juarez last month.
In testimony before the United States Congress this year, Pharis J. Harvey, executive director of the International Labor Rights Education and Research Fund, described organized labor in Mexico as "sterile unions without power to represent workers." One major result of the Government-union collusion, he said, was a deterioration of health and safety standards that left Mexico with the third highest rate of industrial accidents in the world.
 
Future of Trade Unionism
 Mr. Salinas has made clear that he considers the future of trade unionism in Mexico to be embodied by Francisco Hernandez Juarez, leader of the 48,000-member telephone workers' union. Last year it was the 44-year-old Mr. Hernandez who stood beside Mr. Salinas during the May Day parade.
Mr. Hernandez said in an interview that he fully supported Mr. Salinas's efforts to get the trade agreement approved because Mexico must be prepared to compete in a global economy.
"We were in favor of the treaty," Mr. Hernandez said, "not because of complicity with the Government but because we thought integration with the United States was the only option.
The coming year is an election year in Mexico, a frenzy of politics and power that takes place every six years as the President -- constitutionally prohibited from running for re-election -- picks his successor and then steps aside. As he has for every election year since the 1930's, Mr. Velazquez of the Confederation of Mexican Workers, who is known as Don Fidel, played a role in influencing the selection of the party's candidate, announced last month.
Many critics say this could be the last Mexican transition of this type because of many factors, including the growing cry for democracy and the unraveling of the labor confederation's power. Changes demanded by the free trade agreement simply intensify the revolution begun by the opening of Mexico's economy and the need for Mexican business to become more competitive.
That process quickened in October when Mr. Salinas announced that the Government, which had limited wage increases for all workers, would encourage open-ended raises based on productivity gains. On Friday, the Govermnent announced that minimum wages would increase by 7 percent in 1994, taking productivity into account for the first time.
 
New Competitive Pressures
 This effectively reduces the power of Don Fidel's confederation. Instead of bargaining with the Government on what the maximum wage increase will be for all workers, the organization will be limited to advising union locals as they negotiate contracts individually with plant operators.
The basis of the Mexican unions' support for the free trade agreement has been the belief that it would create jobs in Mexico. The unspoken thesis was that many of those jobs would come at the expense of workers in the United States as companies were drawn by Mexico's low wages.
That history could feed the tension existing between the unions of both sides of the border long after the agreement goes into effect on Jan. 1. Still, Don Fidel said in a recent interview that he would be happy to talk with the United States unions.
"The discrepancies that we've had," he said, "will not prejudice the friendship that we've maintained for more than half a century."

HEADLINE: After 2 Weeks of Mayhem, The Nation Is Asking Why

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON

 BODY:
After a murderous two weeks that Americans could only wish was a bad made-for-TV movie, a sense of outrage and urgency has spread from small towns to big cities to state capitals and the White House, as the country searches itself for the causes of crime and ways to make people safer.
The fateful first weeks of December have been a period of random, brutal violence in which any one of a number of murders would have been chilling enough by itself. 
 A Brooklyn man opened fire in a crowded commuter train on Long Island, killing six people and wounding 17. An out-of-work computer engineer opened fire in an unemployment office in Oxnard, Calif., killing four before the police killed him. The police found the body of a 12-year-old girl, Polly Klaas, who had been abducted from her bedroom in Petaluma, Calif. The body of another kidnapped child, 9-year-old Cassidy Senter, was found in St. Louis.
 
Countless Murders
 There was a Navy murder-suicide that left three people dead in San Diego, a teen-age sniper who fired at people in the Chicago Loop during lunch hour, and countless killings of people whose names will never make the national news but whose deaths chip away at a weakening sense of safety and order.
"The human race -- what is it coming to?" said Jesus Araiza, a 20-year-old worker at a Chicago securities concern who has started taking martial arts classes. "It's getting to the place where people are not killing even for money, but just killing to be killing."
What is especially troubling, criminologists say, is that in many of these crimes gunfire seems to have become a form of communication and venting.
From interviews with more than 70 people around the country, a portrait has emerged of a country where many citizens lead a frightened, paranoid existence, where every stranger is suspect, where people think twice before venturing out at night and avoid some neighborhoods altogether.
Bess Stone, a 60-year-old Boston office worker, walks to and from the Park Street train station to get to work downtown. "Every day I go a different way to confuse people" in case someone is trying to follow her, she said.
 
Caution and Vigilance
 To be sure, many people do not let fear keep them from eating out, seeing a movie downtown or riding public transportation. But they know, as one minister in Manhattan said, not to "walk in Times Square in the middle of the night after the theater crowd goes home."
Even the bravest souls say they have become more vigilant. They operate in a battle-ready mode that seems normal to big-city people, until they travel to Tokyo or Stockholm or Toronto or think back 20 years, to life before hand-held sirens.
Many of those interviewed talked wistfully of times when people could leave their doors unlocked and children could play outside on summer evenings without a care, and the only gunfire people heard was in a Western.
"I never used to worry about gangs or violence," said Jeff Carr, a 26-year-old mechanical engineer in Little Rock, Ark. "Now I'm aware of it all the time. When I get out of my car at work or home, I do a full 360-degree turn to see if there's any danger."
His boss recently offered to let him use his gun after burglars broke into his house for the third time. Mr. Carr decided against it. But he and his wife now sleep with their bedroom door locked and keep a bat by the bed.
 
A Pervasive Fear
 Whenever Susan Shepherd, a 37-year-old flight attendant from Salt Lake City, checks into a hotel, she props the door open with her luggage while she looks under the bed, in the closets and in the bathroom to make sure she's alone. She resents the precautions she feels she must take. "I remember growing up playing in the neighborhood at night and sleeping out in the backyard," she said. "I don't think you can do that anymore."
Pearl Jackson, a 40-year-old domestic worker in Chicago, gets home from work at 4 P.M. and does not leave her house until the next day. She believes the streets are too dangerous. "You live in fear constantly, every day," Mrs. Jackson said. "You are not safe nowhere. People are getting crazier and crazier. It's out of control. The whole world is going mad."
The public alarm is actually at odds with statistics that show that the rate of violent crime has fallen slightly in the last two years. Still, the numbers are far higher than in the 1960's and 70's, and it is the spectacular, arbitrary killings that frighten most.
 
Violence as Problem-Solving
 "Violence has become the preferred method of problem-solving," said Robert Trojanowicz, director of the National Center for Community Policing and professor of criminal justice and urban affairs at Michigan State University. "We all now realize that there is a problem, and we are all vulnerable."
In the search for a cause, citizens and experts blame guns, crack, gangs, poor public schools, unemployment, television cartoons where the characters always get up after they have fallen off a cliff, politicians, movies with names like "Die Hard" and "The Terminator," rap videos, parents too busy working to tend to their children, fathers who desert their families, and a general moral decay.
By any measure, guns are a major factor. There are nearly as many guns in the country as people. In 1992, when the population was 255 million, there were 211 million guns in the United States, under mattresses, in gun shops and police departments, in the hands of teen-agers and grandmothers. That is 10 million more than at the start of 1990 and more than twice as many as in 1970, when there were 104 million guns, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. In 1950, the United States had 54 million guns.
 
Brady Bill Not Enough
 After last week, some people said the Brady bill, which took years of cajoling and lobbying to get through Congress, is not enough. Colin Ferguson, the suspect in the Long Island Rail Road shootings, was apparently willing to wait 15 days -- three times as long as the Brady bill will require -- to get his 9-millimeter Ruger in California.
In fact, gun dealers have reported a run on semiautomatic weapons -- and bullets by the case -- by people trying to beat both the Brady bill's effective date of Feb. 28 and the further curbs on assault weapons that Congress is expected to enact.
What frightens many people is that in a culture where "Mortal Kombat" is a children's video game and some states seem to have more gun shops than gas stations unstable people can easily be pushed over the edge.
"As the climate of lawlessness rises," said Richard Herrnstein, a professor of psychology at Harvard University and co-author of the book "Crime and Human Nature" (Simon & Schuster, 1985), "people who in another setting might be the crazy guy down the street who mutters angrily to himself now not only mutters to himself but goes out and gets a gun and kills people."
 
Sentiment for Banning Guns
 Many people interviewed said they were in favor of an outright ban on guns. They said the right to bear arms did not mean the right to bear Uzis. "The framers of the Constitution would be appalled if they thought we were having a discussion over the right to own an AK-47," Professor Trojanowicz said. "Our technology has outdistanced our logic."
Still, there seems to be a hardening among some people who feel there are too many guns out there to turn back. They say they will do what it takes to protect their families. In a kill-or-be-killed world, even quiet, law-abiding citizens can turn bellicose.
Marty Price, a 49-year-old Oakland school teacher, has gone to the funerals of five of his son's friends, boys he had reckoned would some day be his pallbearers. When he rides the bus he always sits by the window so he can kick it out if he has to escape. He has bars on his windows at home and owns a shotgun for protection.
"If someone tried to come in here, I wouldn't hesitate," Mr. Price said. "I know that drugs take the reason out of people. They don't want to hurt you, but they don't know better. I would rather face a jury than some of these people."
 
Calls for Change
 Some criminologists are calling for changes in the criminal justice system to insure that people arrested with illegal guns serve time in jail, to make prison more like boot camp and to give recent ex-convicts options like jobs or job-training rather than just returning them to crime.
Increasingly, people are linking crime to larger social problems and looking at solutions outside the criminal justice system. "Spend more money on education," said Robert Carney, a 31-year-old corporate lawyer in Boston. "Spend more money on creating opportunities for people." Especially, he said, poor people in brutal environments, "where living breeds a desire for escape in drugs, in violence."
In interviews, many people said the country could find the money if it wanted to. "When we had the floods, we found the money," Professor Trojanowicz said. "If there's a problem overseas, we come up with the billions. Let's pretend we've got an imaginary flood and put two dollars toward prevention for every dollar of reaction."
He suggested one way to raise money would be to have income tax forms include a checkoff box, similar to the one for public financing of Presidential campaigns, to finance programs for children.
 
Taking Action Now
 Some people and local governments are already seeking their own solutions. Several music radio stations have banned or edited violent or racially derogatory lyrics.
Dallas announced a tough new anti-gang policy last week after a spate of gang murders. The police will saturate gang territory, ticket people under the age of 16 if they are on the streets after midnight and put them in jail for 30 days if they are caught with a weapon.
Some Seattle women fed up with crime started a new group called Mothers Against Violence Everywhere, aimed at educating the public and stemming crime against children. The group had its first meeting last week.
One organizer, Pamela Eakes, said, "We want to say enough is enough."

HEADLINE: Clinton Says He's Wary Of Cutting Entitlements

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRYN MAWR, Pa., Dec. 13

 BODY:
President Clinton came to this predominantly Republican suburb today to warn that if there were more cuts in Federal benefit programs the middle class would be squeezed. He said the best way to cut the deficit and to slow the rise in benefits spending would be to pass his plan to control health care costs.
Mr. Clinton spoke at a daylong conference on cutting the Federal deficit by curbing automatic benefit programs like Medicare and Social Security. His attendance was part of an unusual political payback he negotiated with a freshman Democrat in Congress, Representative Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky, to win her vote for the Clinton budget last August. 
 In return for casting the decisive vote, Ms. Margolies-Mezvinsky did not ask for a bridge but rather Mr. Clinton's participation in the conference about cutting entitlement programs, a move that she and many people in her conservative district favor.
Mr. Clinton agreed to attend only after Ms. Margolies-Mezvinsky retreated from some of her plans to turn the conference into something of a pork-barrel of its own, by offering corporations a seat on Mr. Clinton's discussion panel in return for contributions to support today's session.
 
Lecture on Need for Programs
 If Ms. Margolies-Mezvinsky was hoping that the President would endorse her drive for further cuts in mandatory benefit programs like Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, she had to have been disappointed by Mr. Clinton's remarks.
Throughout his opening remarks and subsequent comments during a panel discussion, the President stressed that such benefits serve large numbers of people, particularly the middle class. His bifocals perched on the end of his nose like those of a college don, Mr. Clinton quietly lectured the audience in this affluent Philadelphia suburb, saying that while they might think of entitlements as something for the poor, that was simply not the reality.
"Most people are surprised to know that the welfare budget is about 2 percent of the entitlements, or about 1 percent of the overall Federal budget," he told the audience of students, local residents and invited corporate guests gathered in the Bryn Mawr College auditorium.
The biggest entitlement programs are Social Security, Medicare, and Federal and military retirement payments, which make up two-thirds of the entitlement budget.
"I think it's important to point out that behind every one of these entitlements, there is a person," Mr. Clinton said. "It's not just organized interest groups; there are people who believe they are literally entitled to receive something back that they paid into.
"It is the middle-class entitlements that have united us and brought us together, that also have the strongest constituencies. These programs are very important in human terms. Thirty-four million people go to see a doctor, or get medical care, because of the Medicare program. Social Security has changed what it means to be old."
 
'Not a Welfare Program'
 Americans, the President continued, "should not view this whole program as welfare."
"It is not a welfare program," he said. "We should be very sensitive about the fact that this is something that has worked. Because of these programs, we are a healthier people. We treat our elderly with greater dignity. This is a huge deal."
Mr. Clinton insisted that those who want to slash these programs were only going to make things worse for the middle class, not only by depriving them of benefits, but also because state governments and local hospitals would simply shift the costs of caring for the poor and elderly onto the people who could pay.
He said the best way to reduce entitlement costs would be to control health care expenses, which are driving up the costs of Medicare and Medicaid. The best way to do that without burdening the middle class, Mr. Clinton said, would be to shift some of the costs now borne by Government to employers, as his health care plan would do, by requiring employers to buy insurance for their workers.
Thus the President, in effect, turned the entitlement-bashing conference into a vehicle for promoting his health care plan.
 
'Hidden Tax Increase'
 "We could bring this deficit down," Mr. Clinton said. "We could just cut Medicare and Medicaid, even though it's an entitlement. We can just take her down. But if we do that, what will happen? Those costs will be shifted by the health care providers to the people who already are providing insurance. That will be a hidden tax increase on businesses and on employees.
"So I say to you, we can talk about these entitlements and we should. As we talk about them, let's not make our middle-class squeeze worse than it already is."
When it comes to addressing the entitlements problem, Mr. Clinton concluded, "I would argue that the real culprit is health care costs, and we can only address it if we have comprehensive health care reform."
That was not the theme of Ms. Margolies-Mezvinsky's opening remarks at the conference, when she stressed the importance of more budget cutting. She said she hoped that today's gathering would be remembered as "one brief moment when public service came before the political agenda, and when we faced up to the sad legacy of debt we have left behind for our children."
Several times in his remarks Mr. Clinton referred to Ms. Margolies-Mezvinsky, doing his best to give her a boost in her 13th Congressional District.
"Without her vote we would not be here talking about economic progress," he said. "We'd still be in Washington throwing mud balls at each other."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
3 Schools of Thought On Clinton's '3d Way'

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
As a candidate, President Clinton prospered by promising a "third way" for the Democratic Party, an exquisitely calibrated course between left and right.
Welfare would be "a second chance, not a way of life." Government would "expand opportunity, not bureaucracy." A new health care system would "cover everybody, and control costs." 
 An artful blend of traditional values and liberal goals, Mr. Clinton's "third way" helped him straddle deep divisions in his party and reach out to the voters of the middle class as a "new Democrat." But now, on the central issues of health care and welfare, Mr. Clinton is trying to transform that careful rhetoric into actual policies. And while translating campaign promises into programs is always hard, "the third way" is proving particularly treacherous.
The tensions are most apparent on health, where Mr. Clinton has found himself at odds with the very group that incubated his candidacy and the idea of the "new Democrat" -- the Democratic Leadership Council.
Mr. Clinton has proposed a plan that promises a comprehensive benefits package to all Americans (an important nod to the left). But the Administration has also, from the very beginning, ruled out the idea of a Canadian-style system of government-financed health insurance; instead, it embraced the philosophy of managed competition, a blend of market and regulatory forces (an important nod to the right).
Has he found the magical third way? Not for many liberals, who assert that the Administration places far too much confidence in the largely untested theory of managed competition. Not for the conservatives, who worry that the Clinton version of managed competition would result in an excess of bureaucracy and government controls. And not even for the leadership council, whose president, Al From, warned in a recent essay: "The Administration plan has many of the earmarks of a new entitlement program."
In the philosophy of the leadership council this is a bad thing; Government is supposed to be in the business of creating new opportunities, not new entitlements that, it is argued, will inevitably be paid for by a beleaguered middle class. So the council has rallied around a plan proposed by Representative Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee, that promises to cover the bulk -- but not all -- of the uninsured, and to do so without requiring employers to contribute to the cost of insurance, as the Clinton plan would require. Mr. Cooper calls his plan "Clinton lite."
Meanwhile, those in the White House, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, have made it clear that universal coverage is the sine qua non of any health plan. ("There are 20 other dividing lines they could have chosen," complains Mr. Cooper.)
Politically, universal coverage is the bottom line for the party's powerful liberal wing on Capitol Hill, particularly in the House, where 93 members have signed on to a single-payer bill. It will be hard to finesse these divisions; either health care is a right or it is not. And if it is a right, the government must find some way to pay for it.
The process of overhauling welfare is much less further along, but it too may carry some inherent tensions. During the campaign, Mr. Clinton promised a two-year cutoff for welfare recipients (popular with more conservative Democrats), but pledged that training, child care and other supports would ease the transition to work (popular with liberals). Right now, Administration officials say they can finance these goals by redirecting existing budgets, but many are skeptical.
Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group in Washington, asserts that there is a basic contradiction in much of the leadership council's philosophy: "The D.L.C.ers in some way remind me of the classic definition of a liberal Republican -- which is somebody who thinks you can have social justice without paying for it."
The council argues that it is simply trying to protect Mr. Clinton from all the pressures on the left -- to keep him true to the principles that won him the White House.
As for Mr. Clinton, he must occasionally long for the days when the "third way" was so vague -- and, as a result, so appealing.

HEADLINE: Germans Whisper Softly in Trade Rivals' EarsDow at Record as a Few Stocks Jump

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BONN, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Everybody always knew that in the end it would come to this: the United States and Europe -- France, really -- haggling down to the wire over a global trade agreement, with millions of jobs and billions of dollars worth of potential business hanging in the balance.
Everyone knew that failure to reach an accord would be a disaster -- for the recession-ridden European Community, for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, for trans-Atlantic economic and strategic relations. 
 And everyone knew that if he had to, the leader of Europe's largest trading nation and the United States' strongest European ally, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, would put pressure on his French friend, President Francois Mitterrand, and get him to see the light.
In fact, the German influence has been subtle yet powerful, according to diplomats and other officials close to the talks. "The Germans have been indispensable to the process," one said tonight, with 29 hours left to go in the seven-year-long negotiations. "My guess is that when it's over, we'll find out that they've been as intensively in touch with the French as they were with the Americans."
 
Won't Take Sides Between Allies
 The Germans made it clear to the United States that in talks officially being conducted by European Community negotiators they could not be asked to choose between their relationship with the French and their relationship with the Americans, officials here insist. Nor did the Clinton Administration ask the Germans to pass tough messages to Paris.
But messages were passed nonetheless, officials say. For weeks, the Germans told the Americans that the French needed sweeteners to make a deal. And Mr. Kohl went to Paris last month to tell the French Parliament that an accord was vital, a plea that the American negotiator, Mickey Kantor, hailed as a poignant appeal.
"Kohl and Mitterrand have never exchanged a harsh word in all the years of the trade negotiations," a knowledgeable German official said during the meeting of European Community leaders that ended in Brussels on Saturday, just after the French and German chiefs had breakfast together. "They understand each other too well for that."
Mr. Kohl said Saturday that Germany, as one of the world's biggest exporters, had a vital interest in a successful conclusion to the trade talks, but he added, "All sides are playing high-stakes poker."
French officials point out that Mr. Mitterrand, too, has repeatedly spoken out in support of a world trade agreement, though he wants -- and got his European partners to support -- a new world trade organization to make it harder for countries like the United States to impose tariffs and quotas when they believe that other nations have broken the rules.
"Harmony prevails in the relationship between the United States and France -- except on the occasions when it does not," the French President said inimitably over the weekend. Chancellor Kohl's view, according to American and German officials who know him well, is that it is best not to get into the middle of a French-American dogfight over trade, agriculture or anything else.
 
Farmers Without Borders
 Besides, all Europeans have a certain sympathy for the French defense of European farmers' interests, and of the highly subsidized European aviation industry, against their stronger American competitors.
"The European aircraft industry must not be sacrificed as a pawn," Wolfgang Piller, president of the Federation of German Aviation, Space and Defense Industries, said today, "while the Americans are allowed to continue to provide unlimited support for their aerospace industry through indirect subisidies." The Europeans view military contracts from the Pentagon to American manufacturers as a form of subsidy.
Mr. Kohl and Mr. Mitterrand went their separate ways to let the negotiators in Geneva make the final push for a trade pact. On Sunday, as pressure mounted, President Clinton spoke by phone with both the Chancellor and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur of France.
There's a bit of high-stakes poker to the German tactic of affecting nonchalance. Where would the Germans be if the push for an accord failed?
The answer is that they believe it won't fail, because Mr. Kohl has made clear that Germany places so much importance on a successful conclusion to the trade talks that France could hardly affront the Germans by permitting them to fail.
Besides, Mr. Kohl knows that if he pushes the French or any other European country too hard to accept an accord that hurts it financially, that country will come back to the Germans, as the European Community's paymasters, for financial help.
Germany was not in a situation where it could be blackmailed, Mr. Kohl said last weekend, but it had received help from its neighbors in the past and would never have achieved reunification three years ago without their support.
Germany owes its post-World War II rehabilitation in large part to the extraordinary reconciliation with France, and to its own commitment to democracy. The one still nourishes the other, certainly as far as Mr. Kohl, a native of the Rhineland, is concerned.
 
Good for One and All
 Because of reunification, Mr. Kohl believes, Germany would be the biggest winner in Europe once the world economy recovers, and it must be prepared to take the interests of others into account, particularly those of France.
"Kohl knows that Mitterrand has problems with French farmers, and he respects his need for a solution that is acceptable to them," a German official said.
Mr. Kohl and other European leaders also went along with Mr. Mitterrand Saturday in agreeing to allow France and some others to continue levying ticket taxes on foreign films and television program rights, and use the money to prop up their own entertainment industries.
So in the end, Mr. Kohl is basically counting on Mr. Mitterrand to do the right thing and not scuttle a trade agreement because he knows how badly Mr. Kohl wants one, and knows how far the German leader has gone out of his way not to embarrass the French while they press hard for advantage with the Americans.
There is a mix of admiration and exasperation in Bonn for how well the French have played their hand, first in agriculture and, in the last few days, in entertainment. "When the Americans settled agriculture early," an envoy said, "they left the door wide open for the French to raise hell with audio-visual."
After some nervousness earlier this fall about whether the United States was really prepared to turn its back on Europe if worse came to worst and build its economic future with Asia instead, the Germans have concluded that this would be unlikely.
"You're ideally situated, if there's a trade agreement, to have the best out of both worlds," a German told an American friend recently. European and American interests are too finely woven to come apart because of a friendly, high-stakes poker game. Mr. Kohl seems to be counting on everyone coming out of the game a winner.

HEADLINE: France Is Seeking Support in U.N. For Tightening Sanctions on Haiti

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 13

 BODY:
France sought the backing of the United States, Canada and Venezuela today for tighter United Nations economic sanctions against Haiti in the hope of forcing the country's military Government to allow the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to return to office.
But French officials said it was still unclear whether France would win support for its initiative, which was presented to a meeting of senior officials from the four countries. The United States reportedly fears that tougher sanctions would bring greater suffering to ordinary Haitians. 
 The meeting of the so-called "Friends of the Secretary General" group on Haiti at the United Nations was called by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe of France, who warned in a letter last month that "the credibility of the organization and that of our countries is at stake."
The closed-door meeting, which was also being attended by Lawrence Pezzullo, the United States special adviser on Haiti, was addressed today by Haiti's Prime Minister, Robert Malval, who plans to present his resignation to Father Aristide in Washington on Wednesday. Mr. Malval has called for a conference of national reconciliation to resolve the Haitian crisis.
French officials said the purpose of the meeting here, which ends Tuesday, was to break the deadlock that has arisen since Haiti's military strongman, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, blocked Mr. Aristide's planned return to the country on Oct. 30.
"We're back where we started," a French Foreign Ministry official said. "Malval is resigning on Dec. 15. The United Nations human rights group has left. The U.N. mission to train the Haitian police has been interrupted. The Canadians have left, the French never arrived, and the Americans could not land. Something has to be done."
The official said that new sanctions would not affect relief aid, but that they could involve restrictions on air contacts as well as a tightening of the current naval blockade.
Tougher sanctions would require the approval of the United Nations Security Council, which imposed a limited embargo on Haiti on Oct. 18. France wants the support of the United States and Venezuela, which are also members of the Council, and of Canada.

HEADLINE: U.N. Agrees to Create Human Rights Commissioner

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The most contentious issue facing the 48th United Nations General Assembly this year was resolved over the weekend when the nations of the world accepted a plan, under discussion for more than 40 years, to appoint a High Commissioner charged with insuring respect for human rights around the globe.
The agreement to create a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights with the power to intervene wherever basic freedoms are being suppressed was reached in a working group of rich and poor countries and is expected to be endorsed unanimously by the 184 members of the General Assembly next week. 
 The proposed new High Commissioner would not have the power to force governments accused of abuses to change their ways. But he could try to shame them into doing so by publicizing violations and reporting them to the General Assembly or the 53-nation Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
The draft resolution setting up the new post, first proposed by Uruguay in 1952, tries to balance the West's general support and the hesitations of China and many third world countries that have been accused of rights abuses in the past. It is a compromise that excludes the most serious limitations opponents tried to impose on the new High Commissioner.
The agreed text charges the High Commissioner with "promoting and protecting the effective enjoyment by all of all civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights." It says the post's duties include "preventing the continuation of human rights violations throughout the world." And it authorizes the official chosen to "dialogue with all governments in the implementation of his/her mandate with a view to securing respect for human rights."
The Clinton Administration, which has spearheaded the drive to create a Human Rights Commissioner, originally wanted the mandate to include a specific right to carry out fact-finding investigations into alleged abuses.
But today Madeleine K. Albright, America's United Nations representative, described herself as "delighted" with the result and called the creation of the post "an affirmation by the United Nations of an enduring United States foreign policy goal."
Some private human rights groups also supported the agreement. Felice D. Gaer, director of the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights in New York, called it a "remarkable victory" that ends the United Nations' "age of impotence in addressing human rights violations."
But she also called on the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, to "drop his well-known opposition to the post and make a distinguished appointment." She said she wondered whether the new Commissioner would be given the staff and funds necessary to do an effective job. The Secretary General has criticized the proposal for a High Commissioner as creating additional bureaucracy.
What is most significant about the draft resolution, in the view of many Western diplomats and private groups, is that it does not contain the major restrictions that China and other Asian opponents of the post like Indonesia and Malaysia tried to impose on it.
In particular, it does not condemn the widespread Western practice of linking development aid to the recipient's human rights performance.
It also does not contain third world proposals imposing confidentiality on the High Commissioner's dealings or requiring the Commissioner to secure a mandate from the Human Rights Commission before acting.
But the compromise resolution says that in addition to protecting human rights, the new Commissioner should promote "a balanced and sustainable development for all people." It also calls on the Secretary General to select a person for the post who has "knowledge and understanding of diverse cultures."
At a conference on human rights in Vienna last summer, which called for the creation of a Human Rights High Commissioner, opponents from the developing world argued that poor countries have a right to aid regardless of their domestic political system and that basic human rights are a Western concept alien to many other cultures.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Manages to Move Up After Early Round of Selling

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the German mark and other European currencies yesterday in thin trading after it rebounded from a round of early selling.
"We tried to test the downside of 1.69 marks in Europe, but there was buying interest at the lower levels," said Eric Butte, corporate dealer at Generale Bank of Belgium. "The market decided there is more potential in a move to the upside." 
 In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.7070 marks, from 1.6960 marks on Friday.
The mark firmed in early European trading yesterday. Over the weekend, a German newspaper quoted unidentified Bundesbank officials as saying German interest rates would not be cut again this year.
Dealers are now awaiting a meeting of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, on Thursday. It is the last scheduled meeting in 1993. While few expect a rate cut, some said the bank might adjust its money supply targets. Other dealers predicted no change.
The dollar then rose against the mark amid reports of weak retail sales in western Germany. The continuing weakness in the German economy has put pressure on the Bundesbank to ease its monetary policy and allow interest rates to come down.
Dealers said the dollar was likely to trade in a narrow range for the rest of the year.
Dealers continued to watch world trade talks as international negotiators worked to conclude the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before tomorrow's deadline.
"The market has shut down early for Christmas," said Eli Rausch, assistant vice president of Banque Francaise. "Barring any unforeseen developments with GATT, the market should remain in a trance until the end of the year."

HEADLINE: Banks Seek Mutual Funds, But Not Many Are for Sale

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
In the wake of the Mellon Bank Corporation's agreement to acquire the Dreyfus Corporation last week, banks across the country are taking a hard look at what mutual fund companies they might buy. But few mutual funds are up for sale.
"In the mutual fund business, there are a large number of buyers, but a small number of sellers," Avi Nachmany, an analyst with Strategic Insights, a consulting firm, said. "A lot of investment bankers are floating a lot of names. But the problem is to find the sellers." 
 The main barrier is that the asking prices are simply too high. "The prices that mutual funds are talking about is way beyond what banks can pay," said one lawyer specializing in mutual funds.
The deal for Dreyfus was unusual in that its stock was trading at a relatively low price, equal to 17 times its earnings. Most other mutual funds, either privately held or publicly traded, have higher profit margins than Dreyfus and, as a result, higher stock valuations. Funds are more typically valued at a price equal to 20 times earnings or more, making acquisitions more costly.
Yet the desire by banks continues. Searching for new forms of income, banks have been pulling away from traditional lending and seeking the steady fee-based revenues that mutual funds offer. Besides, as interest rates have fallen, banks need new products to retain core retail customers who have switched from savings accounts to mutual funds.
Many banks that have tried to build this business from within have found it difficult. Currently, more than 110 banks offer their own mutual funds, and banks take in about 15 percent of all new mutual fund dollars. But gaining the name recognition, the sufficient size and the marketing expertise that characterize the mutual fund industry has proved elusive for many banks, which have found their efforts moving with frustrating slowness, analysts say.
"There's a hunger for banks to expand into mutual funds, but they've found it harder than they had hoped," said Kurt Cerulli, a Boston consultant. "A big percentage of their funds has been money converted from existing trust departments. It's been more difficult to raise new money from retail customers."
 
Suitors Outnumber Prospects

 
 Most experts say banks will find the pickings slim. Other than the Dreyfus-Mellon deal, there has been only one notable mutual fund acquisition by a bank this year: the $130 million acquisition of the Evergreen fund family by First Union National Bank in Charlotte, N.C.
To begin with, any deal would have to be friendly, whether the mutual fund is privately held, as is common, or publicly traded. In effect, mutual funds are structured with a built-in poison pill against hostile advances: the investors in any mutual fund are represented by a board that decides whom to contract to manage their money. For instance, shareholders of a Dreyfus fund, if they want, can take their money away from Dreyfus in protest of the Mellon merger and have it managed by someone else.
"Any deal has to be friendly," Mr. Nachmany of Strategic Insights said. "Legally, you have the question of the management contract when there is a change of ownership. And, in a mutual fund, you are also buying the talent of the people who run portfolios. They could also leave. You are not buying machines."
And there's price. Most banks, not wanting to reduce capital reserves, are interested in buying mutual funds through a stock swap, like the Mellon-Dreyfus deal, rather than by paying cash. But mutual fund stocks are trading at all-time highs; banks would have to give up too much stock to buy a fund and would suffer heavy dilution in future earnings as a result.
In addition, there is a question of who is willing, and available, to be bought. The largest mutual funds are either owned by brokerage firms, like Merrill Lynch or Dean Witter, or are privately held like the Vanguard Group and Fidelity Investments. And fund families with strong name appeal like T. Rowe Price, Scudder, Stevens & Clark or Eaton Vance have so far given no indication that they want to be acquired.
 
Clash of Cultures

 
 But more importantly, many operators of mutual funds worry about cultural differences with banks. Banks tend to be more bureaucratic and have greater limits on pay, making it difficult for them to provide the freedom and high compensation that is key to attracting and retaining top money managers who run the funds.
"We love the business," said the chairman of a large mutual fund company, who declined to be named and stressed his company would not sell. "It's challenging from an investment standpoint, it's profitable and the money managers don't like oversight. They want to run their own portfolios."
Mario J. Gabelli, who heads Gabelli Funds Inc., said he was interested in buying other funds, not selling. "I don't need the distribution a bank can offer," he said. "All I need to do is buy more newspaper ads."
But when the current bull market in stocks and bonds turns bearish, mutual funds might be more willing to sell. "In time, funds may reach the conclusion that they need the bricks and mortar and big customer lists that banks offer," said Rodgin Cohen, a banking specialist at the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm. Added a mutual fund executive who asked not to be named: "Give our industry a few more years and a bear market and you may see some sellers."
Andrew Ziegler, president of Strong Funds Inc. of Milwaukee, said: "Over time, you will see a new type of full service financial firm and I don't know if it will be a combination of existing institutions, like banks and mutual funds, or a general evolution. The Mellon-Dreyfus deal is moving in that direction -- firms that offer both commercial banking and asset management."

HEADLINE: High Court Orders Shift In Insurers' Accounting

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
In a decision expected to change the way the insurance industry keeps track of the billions of dollars in pension funds that it manages, the Supreme Court ruled today that Federal law rather than state law governs an insurance company's handling of pension assets beyond those needed to pay the guaranteed minimum benefit on group annuity contracts.
The 6-to-3 decision, the first majority opinion written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, applied the standards of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to the insurance industry's management of excess earnings on investments from contributions to group annuities, a popular type of retirement plan. 
 The result of the decision, which upheld a 1992 ruling by the Federal appeals court in New York, is to bring disputes over the management of the plans into Federal court. The ruling requires insurance companies to meet the strict fiduciary standards of the Federal pension law for funds over which they have discretion.
 
State-Federal Conflict

 
 The Federal law, commonly known as Erisa, sets standards that are in some respects inconsistent with those imposed by the states, which have historically regulated the insurance industry. New York State, the headquarters of 87 life insurance companies, joined the insurance industry in arguing that applying the Erisa standards would undermine state regulation and impose "extraordinary burdens" on insurers and state insurance departments.
The Supreme Court rejected this argument today, with Justice Ginsburg noting that Congress had considered but ultimately rejected a broad exemption for the insurance industry when it was writing the 1974 pension law. "Erisa leaves room for complementary or dual Federal and state regulation, and calls for Federal supremacy when the two regimes cannot be harmonized or accommodated," Justice Ginsburg said.
As a practical matter, the decision's effect on the insurance industry will be to require separate accounting for earnings from pension contributions that insurance companies now typically commingle in what are known as general accounts. Of some $750 billion in such general accounts, $332 billion is attributable to group annuity contracts.
The general accounts are used to pay pension benefits as well as for general corporate expenses of the insurance company. Today's ruling makes the insurers responsible as fiduciaries for managing a category of these assets for the particular benefit of pension plans, requiring the industry to devise a new form of separate accounting.
 
Bank Versus Insurer

 
 The decision came in a 10-year-old lawsuit brought by the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago against the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, which has held an annuity contract since 1941 for the Sperry Rand Corporation's retirement plan. Sperry is now the Unisys Corporation. Harris Trust, a subsidiary of the Bank of Montreal, is trustee of the Unisys retirement plan.
The suit charged Hancock with breach of contract and violations of Erisa, growing out of changes that Hancock made in the plan. A Federal district court in New York dismissed the Erisa portion of the lawsuit, ruling that the Federal law did not apply. Last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed that decision and reinstated the suit, which will now go to trial.
In the Supreme Court, the Clinton Administration sided with Hancock's appeal, saying that applying Erisa standards would be "disruptive" to the insurance industry. The Administration's brief had a somewhat equivocal tone, noting that application of Erisa "would provide significant added legal protections against losses by pension plans, because Erisa imposes restrictions not currently provided by contract and insurance law." But, the brief said, "there has been no systematic showing of a pressing need" for the added protection.
 
Interpreting a Phrase

 
 The decision, John Hancock v. Harris Bank, No. 92-1074, does not apply to all the annuity assets in the general accounts, but only to money that has accumulated in excess of the insurance company's obligation to the annuity plans. Erisa excludes coverage of "guaranteed benefit policies," so the Court's job was to determine what that phrase meant in the context of the 1974 law.
The Court concluded that what it called "free funds," assets not committed to pay the contract's guaranteed benefits, were not exempt and were covered by Erisa. As a practical matter, however, the industry is likely to have to change its bookkeeping entirely if it is to keep track of a portion of the general accounts.
Justice Ginsburg's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia and David H. Souter. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy.

2 Groups Plan Projects On Computer Standards

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
Two groups of computer and telecommunications companies announced separately yesterday that they planned to begin work on standardizing how computers will talk to each other on the future information superhighway.
Currently, when fax machines and personal computers communicate over telephone lines, they use a relatively simple language of screeches and whistles. 
 But in the future, the task will be more difficult. The immense rivers of information that form voice, video and data will require more elaborate languages spoken by different kinds of computers that may transmit over cable television lines, fiber optic lines or even low-capacity copper telephone lines.
 
Cooperative Effort

 
 Bellcore, the research arm of the seven regional Bell telephone companies, said its member companies would work with companies including Capital Cities/ABC and J. C. Penney to develop computer languages and determine how the information is displayed on the computer screen.
Lanny Smoot, a Bellcore official in charge of the project, which is known as Collaboratory, said the 16-member group would emphasize practical applications. The information superhighway will have to be versatile enough, Mr. Smoot said, for a researcher to find a single paragraph among one million books, but also allow a grandparent to send a home movie across the country.
Bellcore will also seek to develop the technology that will make services economical for companies. For example, home shopping would not be possible unless a secure method of electronic payment is developed.
Bellcore plans to work with Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, Northern Telecom, Microware Systems, Wiltel, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the media lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 
Nuts-and-Bolts Work

 
 Another group called the Cross-Industry Working Team, which has members that are also in the Bellcore group, said it would emphasize nuts-and-bolts standards and software. The group said it planned to define "architecture and key technical requirements" for the superhighway.
Bellcore is also a member of this cross-industry group and Mr. Smoot said the two groups were complementary. "They're determining technical requirements, but we're going to make the technology real," he said.
John R. Garrett, a senior official of the 28-member cross-industry group, said, "There is going to be a Tower of Babel of computer languages and we want to avoid having to use five different telephones or five different computers to perform five different applications." Mr. Garrett is with the Corporation for National Research Initiatives, a research firm in Reston, Va., that is coordinating the group.

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
Hope for Volvo in Rubble of Deal

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
Volvo may have built its reputation on solid reliability and a concern for safety, but its shareholders are enduring an uncharacteristically hair-raising ride.
The messy collapse earlier this month of the Swedish company's plan to merge car- and truck-building operations with those of Renault, which is owned by the French Government, has left Volvo without a chairman or a functioning board, and without a strategy or enough long-term financing for the next few crucial years. 
 Amid the wreckage of the Renault deal, however, are signs that Volvo may be able to engineer a wholesale corporate restructuring. Such a move, which could be built around the divestiture of nonautomotive holdings worth billions of dollars, could insure Volvo's survival as the company re-examines its complex relationship with the French car maker.
 
 
 
More Than a Car Company
 "One thing that not everyone has picked up on in the public debate," said Colin Gibson, an analyst at Carnegie International, a securities firm in London, "is that the big, boring cars from Sweden are only half the company."
Volvo is by no means assured of success. In an increasingly competitive automobile industry, it is among the last independently owned companies of its size. Volvo sold slightly more than 300,000 passenger cars worldwide last year, equivalent to about 6 percent of the General Motors Corporation's annual sales of more than five million units.
Volvo has suffered through three years of heavy losses in its car business, primarily caused by a sharp downturn in sales in its three main markets: Sweden, Britain and the United States. The production costs of the company remain high, by world standards.
 
 
 
Need to Buy Time
 With European, Japanese and American rivals beefing up their attention to quality and passenger safety, Volvo has lost much of the marketing advantage that made it a prestigious fixture in the driveways of affluent suburbs.
 Moreover, although its truck business remains a healthy profit generator, Volvo faces difficulty raising the hundreds of millions of dollars it needs to develop its next generation of cars.
But if, as expected by many analysts, the company shifts away from its diversification strategy of the last decade and begins selling some of its noncore holdings, like its stake in a pharmaceutical company, it could at least buy time to put its automotive operations on sounder footing.
Volvo could also then have an opportunity to unwind gradually its existing relationship with Renault, under which the companies have a web of cross-shareholdings, and perhaps even find another partner.
Indeed, it was partly pressure from Volvo's shareholders that led the company to abandon the deal with Renault and take a fresh look at its strategy.
"If you look at Volvo's balance sheet, and look at the auto operations and try to take sensible views of the values in that business, I think the conclusion most analysts would come to is that Volvo is undervalued," said Mr. Gibson, the analyst. "Unless you adopt a long-term worst-case scenario, it's quite easy to justify a significantly higher share price."
Volvo's shares are trading at roughly the level where they stood before the announcement of the Renault merger sent them tumbling earlier this year. In the United States, Volvo's American depository receipts closed yesterday at $57.875, up 37.5 cents, in Nasdaq trading.
 In the next year or two, Volvo's shares are likely to be supported by an earnings rebound that began earlier this year. Part of the gain has come from favorable exchange-rate swings after the Swedish currency was devalued last year.
 The company is also reaping the benefits of a cost-cutting program that has seen it close one of its three Swedish factories and set in motion the process of closing another. And with the economies of the United States and Britain bouncing back, vehicle sales in those markets have risen this year, helped by the introduction of the full line of its new 850 series passenger car.
For the first nine months of the year, Volvo posted an operating profit of 445 million Swedish kronor, or $53.5 million, compared with a loss in the period last year of 1.5 billion kronor, or $180.3 million. A portion of the improvement came from a one-time accounting change.
Volvo said it planned to hold a board meeting next month to elect a new chairman to succeed Pehr Gyllenhammar, who resigned after the company backed out of the Renault deal. Whoever gets the post -- it will probably be an outsider -- will almost certainly take a back seat in strategy setting and day-to-day management to Soren Gyll, the chief executive. Mr. Gyll led the management revolt against the merger and, by extension, Mr. Gyllenhammar.
 Mr. Gyll has had little experience in the automotive business, having come to Volvo last year from Procordia, the Swedish conglomerate of which Volvo and the Swedish Government were the primary shareholders. But Mr. Gyll has left little doubt that he plans to refocus the company on the auto business.
His first step, some analysts said, will be to sell the pieces of Procordia that are being divided by Volvo and the Swedish Government under an agreement reached last spring. Under that agreement, Procordia was split into two parts: its pharmaceuticals business, renamed Pharmacia, and its consumer products business, now known as BCP. When the transaction is completed, probably early next year, Volvo will own a 25 percent stake in Pharmacia and all of BCP, which includes tobacco, beer and food operations.
Volvo values its stake in Pharmacia at 9.4 billion Swedish kronor, or $1.13 billion. Analysts said it could be sold fairly quickly, perhaps later next year when the Swedish Government privatizes its stake.
Analysts also said Mr. Gyll would probably look at selling the other parts of the nonautomotive businesses as well, including BCP and the company's marine and airplane engine units. In all, Volvo's nonautomotive holdings have a market value of nearly $4 billion.
Any sales, analysts said, could help to reduce the debt taken on to buy Volvo's stake in Renault's car and truck operations, and also to finance the development of new products.

Bond Prices Off in Light Trading

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell and yields rose yesterday as traders and investors awaited important fourth-quarter economic data this week and a Treasury auction next week.
For now, the bond market seems to be stuck in a trading range that analysts say should hold until the end of the year unless there is some surprise in the new economic data. 
 The fear that this quarter's strong growth will continue into next year should keep yields from falling sharply, while the moderate level of inflation through November and the recent decline in oil prices should keep yields from jumping too high.
 
Price Off for Long Bond
 In light trading yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond fell 11/32 , and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.23 percent, from 6.20 percent Friday. Since a selloff began in mid-October, the yield on the 30-year bond has been as high as 6.38 percent and as low as 5.82 percent, but the yield has not been below 6 percent since Oct. 29. Its low for the year was 5.78 percent, set on Oct. 15.
The price of the two-year note, which has fallen because some analysts expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates early next year, was unchanged yesterday, with the yield remaining at 4.22 percent, its high since the mid-October selloff. The yield has not been below 4 percent since Oct. 28.
At the weekly auction of Treasury bills, the discount rate on the three-month bill averaged 3.06 percent, down from 3.11 percent a week ago, while the average discount rate on the six-month bill was 3.26 percent, down from 3.27 percent a week ago.
One factor that prompted selling yesterday was a rise in the price of gold, which some analysts see as a sign of inflationary concerns. Others contend that in light trading it does not take much to move the market and that the rise in the price of gold was just an excuse to sell bonds, not a reason. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the price of gold for February delivery rose $3.70, to $388.60 an ounce.
 
Influences on the Market
 Some traders may also be beginning to focus on the Treasury's auction of two-year and five-year notes next week, which can often prompt some selling.
The data coming out this week include a report on November retail sales, due today, and figures on industrial production for last month, which will be released tomorrow. On Thursday, the trade deficit data for October and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's manufacturing index for December will be released.
Analysts expect the data to show that the economy is growing at an annual pace of around 4 percent in the fourth quarter.
It had seemed last week that traders and investors had accepted that fact, and that data consistent with that outlook would no longer prompt a lot of selling. What would encourage selling would be indications of rising inflation or signs that the economy was not going to slow in the first quarter of next year, which is what many economists are forecasting.
But in the light trading that is possible at the end of the year, the market could wind up being highly volatile and moving more than expected or reacting in a contrarian way to news or new economic data.
 
Other Markets
 Long-term yields fell sharply in Britain yesterday after the Government reported positive news on inflation, leading to increased hopes that short-term interest rates would be cut again soon.
In November, producer prices in Britain were unchanged while the prices manufacturers paid for raw materials and fuel fell three-tenths of a percent, the Government reported. In the last 12 months, prices of raw materials have declined 1.8 percent.
The prices of government bonds rose as much as a half a point. The yield on the benchmark 9 percent 15-year note due in 2008 fell to 6.56 percent, from 6.60 percent Friday, according to Bloomberg Business News.
The base lending rate in Britain is now 5.5 percent. But the good news on inflation and the need for the Government of Prime Minister John Major to assure that the economic recovery continues is making some analysts speculate that another cut might be possible before the end of the year. The Government will report the main measure of consumer inflation tomorrow.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: So Long, Flint, Hello, Toronto: A Director Goes Hollywood (North)

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 13

 BODY:
During the War of 1812, Americans burned York, the forebear of Toronto, provoking the retaliatory burning of Washington by the British fleet. In the 1840's, some Americans tried to start wars of national liberation to make Canada part of the United States. During the Civil War, the Confederates used Canada as a sanctuary for raids in Vermont. Since then, the border has been pretty quiet.
But now, in this year of the North American Free Trade Agreement, comes Michael Moore, who is shooting his first commercial feature film here, a satire called "Canadian Bacon" that portrays Canada as America's post-cold war enemy. 
 Mr. Moore is a genial troublemaker best known for his 1989 documentary "Roger and Me," about the troubles in his hometown, Flint, Mich., after General Motors closed its plant there and put 30,000 people out of work. In the film, Mr. Moore doggedly pursues G.M.'s chairman, Roger Smith, who just as doggedly avoids him.
Making "Canadian Bacon" is much easier, Mr. Moore said. "I have great actors," he said. "I know exactly what we're going to do each day. I have a little bit of money to put the camera on a tripod. In 'Roger and Me,' I had to sell everything I owned."
 
'Too Left for Mother Jones'
 Mr. Moore, 39, the son of an auto worker, went to Canada in his youth for his "foreign travels." He started writing "Canadian Bacon" during the George Bush Administration's 1990 campaign to whip up sentiment for the Persian Gulf war.
"So here was Iraq, an ally of sorts," the film maker said. "We'd given Saddam Hussein $4 billion in aid to fight Iran, and the very next thing he's the enemy. I started thinking, What would be the most absurd example of how the Government and the media could convince people to fear and hate? And I thought, well, it's right here, the longest unprotected border in the world, the second largest country in land mass, after Russia."
Mr. Moore, who published an alternative newspaper in Michigan in the 1970's, and in 1986 found himself dismissed from Mother Jones magazine, is a round-faced, roly-poly man, who could convincingly dress in a Santa suit. "I was too left for Mother Jones," he said. "Can you imagine being too left for Mother Jones?" His body ripples.
 
An Enemy Restored
 In the movie, to be released next summer by MGM/UA and now being shot on location in Toronto and along the border, Canadian Bacon becomes the military code name for the campaign to whip up anti-Canadian hysteria and give back to the United States the enemy it lost when Russia became an ally.
A national security adviser in the mold of Dr. Strangelove, played by the stand-up comedian Kevin Pollak, convinces a well-meaning President that this is the way to get defense industries humming and lift his popularity in an election year, when he's being murdered in the polls.
"When we started working on this I thought, well, this is fun because it's so preposterous," said Alan Alda, who plays the harried chief executive. "But the more I do it, the more I think it's not so preposterous. The President never intends to get into any kind of war situation. He gets carried away by events."
Mr. Alda said he had no particular President in mind. "It's a bipartisan takeoff," he said, "a bipartisan knock."
 
A City Plays Itself
 The movie is one of scores shot every year in Toronto, which, thanks to the favorable exchange rate, cooperative unions and visual similarities to so many American cities, has been nicknamed "Hollywood North."
But this is one of the few films where Toronto is actually Toronto, not New York, Cleveland or Chicago. Most films shoot around the landmark CN Tower, the tallest free-standing structure in the world. In this one, the 1,800-foot tower, helicopters swarming around it, is not only visible but crucial to the climax.
Grist for this satire is most Americans' lack of knowledge about Canada. While Japan is generally considered the biggest foreign owner of American assets, Canada is actually No. 1, followed by Britain, the Netherlands and then Japan. Polls show that few Americans can name the Canadian Prime Minister (Jean Chretien), while virtually every Canadian can name the American President.
"What do we really know about what they're doing up there," asked Mr. Moore, "with all that fresh water and all that ice and all those Zamboni machines?" His grin was like a wide-angle lens.
Among "un-American activities" the Canadians find themselves accused of in the movie is eliminating the Miss Canada contest.
 
Canadians Abroad
 The plot also benefits from what Mr. Moore calls the "fifth column," the large number of Canadians in the American news and entertainment industry. They include the singer Joni Mitchell; the broadcasters Peter Jennings, Morley Safer and Robert MacNeil, and the actors Donald Sutherland, the late Raymond Burr and William Shatner.
"You round up the Arabs as car bombers of the World Trade Center, but how do you round up Canadians?" Mr. Moore asked. "They look like us. They talk like us. They walk among us undetected."
Mr. Jennings, the ABC anchor and, as that network's publicity describes him, the most-watched man in America, is sinisterly identified by an American in the script as the man who "knows who's won our elections before we do, and he doesn't even vote."
In all the nationality-scrambling, the Canadian-born John Candy stars as an American, the overzealous, superpatriotic sheriff of Niagara Falls, N.Y., whose mobilization in something called the General Schwarzkopf Shopping Mall helps the President improve his ratings. His deputy, a gun nut played by Rhea Perlman, best known as Carla the barmaid in "Cheers," plays the climactic scene in the CN Tower.
Canadians and Americans are depicted in stereotypes. Canadians are portrayed as polite and peace-loving, always willing to bow to the United States. Jokes target bilingualism. Americans are shown as aggressive, bombastic, a shade Teutonic. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, played by Rip Torn, is a loud-mouthed general named Panzer.
When the plot of the movie was described to them, several Canadians expressed amusement. "I don't know anyone who would take offense," said Robert Bothwell, a professor of Canadian history at the University of Toronto.
Although Canada and the United States stopped fighting so many years ago, tensions between them have been an occasional theme of potboilers and the movies. In a 1967 movie, "The President's Analyst," James Coburn, playing a psychiatrist selected to be the President's secret analyst, falls prey to the Canadian secret service as it tries to subvert the United States. But the ultimate villain is the phone company.

HEADLINE: Breast Cancer Screening Under 50: Experts Disagree if Benefit Exists

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
DR. ELLEN B. MENDELSON, a 52-year-old radiologist, had her first mammogram when she was 35. She had another one when she was 38. Since age 40, she has had routine screening mammograms every year, and she passionately urges women in their 40's to do the same.
Dr. Mendelson, who directs the Breast Diagnostic Imaging Center of the Western Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburgh, said she knows four radiologists who had breast cancer that was found after routine mammograms when they were in their late 30's or 40's. Mammography saved them, she said. "It seems really immoral to me to remove this potentially lifesaving benefit from women who are right at the height of their careers and family lives," she said. 
 Dr. Barbara Rimer, the 45-year-old director of cancer prevention and research at the Duke University School of Medicine, used to agree with Dr. Mendelson. She had a screening mammogram two years ago and has written papers on the need for women in their 40's to have such mammograms. But now, after immersing herself in the world's data on mammography, she has decided to wait until she is 50 to have her next mammogram.
"There was something transforming about reading all those articles together," Dr. Rimer said. "The science almost called out to you with the incredible weight of the evidence." And, she concluded, the science convinced her that routine mammograms before age 50 do not save lives.
The question of when to start having regular mammograms has never been more perplexing or more disturbing. After years of recommending that women start having them every year or two at age 40, the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., has now changed its stance, saying instead that their benefits for women under age 50 are not documented and that women should look at the facts and make up their own minds. But, as the opposite views of Dr. Mendelson and Dr. Rimer illustrate, this emotion-laden issue can elicit very different responses even among experts.
Dr. Edward Sondik, the deputy director of the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control at the National Cancer Institute, said he has seen "women who understand the facts and who could not be more convinced and passionate that screening in the 40's is the right thing to do." But he has also seen "others who feel exactly the opposite, and they also understand the facts."
"My view is that if a woman is informed at age 40 and then makes a decision about mammograms, whatever she decides is fine," he said. But he added, "If she makes a decision on a rote basis, without understanding that there may be harms that go along with benefits that have not been proven, then she's making a mistake."
Dr. Ann Flood, director of policy studies at the Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, N.H., agreed. She said that the most important thing is that women in their 40's be informed of the drawbacks of mammography as well as the possible benefits. Too often, she said, the messages they hear stress only the benefits, with the rationale that "if it saves one person in the world, that justifies whatever harm there is."
But more goes into a decision than just a cold look at data, experts say. Dr. Flood said that often the most compelling factor is whether a woman feels she may regret her choice. That means, she said, that even though a woman in her 40's might think that not having a mammogram is the more rational decision, she also might feel she could not live with herself if she made that choice and then developed cancer before she was 50. The question, Dr. Flood said, is "Would you feel guilty and would you say, 'My life could have been saved?' A lot of people feel compelled by the anticipation of regret."
The basic facts are not in dispute. Eight studies over the last 30 years have consistently found that routine mammograms for women over the age of 50 reduce the death rate from breast cancer by 25 to 30 percent. But none of these studies has found a similar effect in younger women. And even when all the world's studies are lumped together and the 173,000 women in their 40's who participated are considered as one group, no benefit has emerged.
This may reflect the fact that most women survive breast cancer, making it difficult to show that mammography saves lives at any age. The cancer institute says that more than 79 percent of women with breast cancer are still alive five years later. Since younger women are less likely to get breast cancer than older ones, the breast cancer death rate becomes so small that it is difficult to show that screening them with mammography saves their lives.
Another difficulty is that mammography is a less efficient tool to examine younger women. Researchers find that mammograms miss as many as 40 percent of cancers in women in their 40's but just 14 percent of cancers in older women. Or it may be that there is a benefit but the studies so far have failed to document it because they have had methodological flaws.
But while they have failed to show that mammography saves lives of women in their 40's, researchers have found some drawbacks associated with it. Dr. Sondik said that in about half of all women between 40 and 50 who have annual mammograms a suspicious lesion that turns out not to be cancer will be detected. About 5 percent will be found to have an invasive cancer, he said.
 
Potential Risks
Some Fear Much Needless Surgery
 Dr. Rimer said that months after a breast cancer false alarm, women show signs much like those of post-traumatic stress syndrome. "It is not a benign experience," she said.
Another drawback, said Dr. H. Gilbert Welsh, a senior research associate at the Department of Veterans Affairs in White River Junction, Vt., is that in 40 percent of the breasts removed on autopsy from women in their 40's who died from causes other than cancer, microscopic lesions in the milk ducts are found; it is unknown which of these common lesions develop into cancer. The lesions sometimes show up on mammograms and few if any doctors or women would ignore them. The standard treatment, however paradoxical it may seem, is a mastectomy.
The dispute over mammography in younger women, however, is not over the facts; it is over how to interpret them. The studies do not prove that mammograms fail to help younger women. Instead, they show that if there is a benefit, the maximum it could be is about a 20 percent reduction in the death rate from breast cancer. However, the same studies, taking into account margins of error, also show that the numbers could be read to show that screening actually increases the death rate, again by about 20 percent. The most likely effect, however, is that mammograms neither helped nor harmed women in their 40's.
In 1990, the death rate from breast cancer for women in their 40's was about 30 per 100,000, meaning that if there were a 20 percent reduction it would save 6 lives per 100,000. If there were a greater effect, the studies would have shown it, said Dr. Peter Greenwald, director of the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control at the cancer institute.
One question the studies could not address is whether mammograms could prolong rather than save lives, because of an inherent methodological problem in asking that question. If a test finds a cancer very early, the woman may not live longer but she will know she has cancer longer. Statisticians say it is impossible to distinguish this "lead-time" effect from an actual effect on survival after diagnosis and say whether mammograms for women in their 40's prolong life even if they do not save lives.
Most nations have decided that the evidence is not sufficient to recommend routine mammograms for women in their 40's. Only Iceland, Australia, one Canadian province, British Columbia, and certain counties in Sweden screen women before they are 50. But experts in the United States are torn between urging women to have routine mammograms in their 40's and suggesting they wait.
 
Past Studies
Some Experts See Flaws in Design
 Dr. Mendelson and others, like Dr. Gerald Dodd, a radiologist at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, are convinced that despite the statistical data, routine mammograms can save the lives of women in their 40's. If the studies did not show this, they say, it is because they are flawed.
For example, said Dr. Dodd, a past president of the American Cancer Society, researchers may simply have to wait longer to see a benefit of mammography in younger women. Most studies of younger women so far followed them for no more than 12 years, but it may take 18 years or longer to see a reduction in the death rate from breast cancer, Dr. Dodd said.
Another drawback to the studies, critics say, is that they used outdated technology. "There is a significant difference in the quality of mammograms and in the quality of interpretation now as compared to even 10 years ago, and most of these studies took place 7 to 10 years ago," Dr. Dodd said. With today's technology, mammograms are more likely to find tumors and save lives, he added.
Yet another potential problem is that many studies provided mammograms every other year to the women in their 40's who were being studied. But the American Cancer Society's guidelines call for mammograms as often as every year, or every two years at the most, for women between the ages of 40 to 49. Some cancer experts believe that breast cancer grows more quickly in younger women, Dr. Dodd said, so to get the maximum benefit from mammography and more reliable data on the benefits of routine screening, the tests should be done every year.
Moreover, Dr. Dodd and others said, there is "compelling" presumptive evidence that mammograms are lifesaving in younger women.
Dr. Clark Heath, the vice president for epidemiology and statistics at the American Cancer Society, said that the best such evidence comes from studies in Sweden and in Edinburgh that show a tendency for mammography to benefit women in their 40's. This tendency, called a trend, is not large enough for statisticians to say it is a real effect. It could just as easily turn out to be a random fluctuation in the data, and could disappear as the study continues.
Dr. Heath said the encouraging trends nonetheless could be hints that mammography is helping younger women after all. "It's not strong enough in many people's minds to warrant saying screening is indicated, but in the A.C.S.'s mind it's strong enough," he said.
 
Scientific Decision
Cost Not a Factor, Cancer Group Says
 Dr. Mendelson, Dr. Dodd and others contend that the reasons for having routine mammograms are so persuasive that the National Cancer Institute must have been motivated by concerns about the high cost of health care when it decided to drop its recommendation that women in their 40's have routine mammograms. A third of American women in their 40's have mammograms, at an annual cost of a billion dollars a year. Biopsies, said Dr. Dodd, cost from $1,500 to $3,500 when done in a hospital and from $500 to $1,200 when done in a doctor's office.
Dr. Rimer and officials at the cancer institute say that they looked only at science, not economics. The institute began examining data on the effectiveness of mammograms even before Bill Clinton was elected President and made cutting health-care costs a priority. In fact, said Dr. Rimer, when she and others were asked to help evaluate the data, "we were forbidden to discuss costs."
Some experts point out that radiologists themselves might be said to be motivated by economics when they argue for testing. Dr. Robert McLelland, a radiologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill, who thinks the cancer institute's position is "a very honest one," said that radiologists sound "biased and self-serving," when they urge women to have screening mammograms.
Cancer experts say they are not persuaded by the arguments of those who believe the studies were flawed.
For example, Dr. Sondik questioned the contention that the studies did not wait long enough to see a benefit. He said that waiting more than a decade will only make it more difficult to analyze the data because most of the women who entered the study in their 40's will live into their 50's, when all should be getting annual mammograms and when the tests will cut their mortality rate from breast cancer. That fact complicates efforts to see if testing the women when they were in their 40's made a difference in their life spans, Dr. Sondik said.
Dr. Greenwald of the cancer institute said that the 10 to 12 years that women in their 40's have been followed is "quite a long period of observation."
Dr. Sondik dismissed the argument that the studies in younger women failed because not all provided annual mammograms. Mammograms every other year seem to be about as good as annual mammograms at reducing the breast cancer death rate in older women, he said. In addition, he added, the survival rate for women in their 40's is virtually the same as that for older women. "Nothing convinces me that the disease is more aggressive," in younger women, he said.
Is it possible that the problem was the outdated mammography equipment used in the studies? Dr. Rimer said it is true that mammography has improved, but it is not necessarily true that today's mammograms would be beneficial when yesterday's were not. Over the last 30 years, while mammograms got better, their benefits for older women held steady. At least for women over 50, "improvements in mammography technology have not translated into clearly saving lives," Dr. Rimer said.
In addition, Dr. Greenwald said, the trends toward benefits in the Swedish and Edinburgh studies do not mean that mammography helps younger women. Picking out a couple of studies with trends in a positive direction and citing them as evidence "is not using a valid interpretation of statistics," Dr. Greenwald said.
Dr. Rimer said that scientists can quibble about each and every study, and when they do not like a study's data they can ask that it be redone. But she said: "The fact of the matter is that these are the best studies we have. We have been doing these studies for 30 years and we can't go out and replicate them. We need an answer today."
 
Opponents Agree
There May Be No Right Answer
 But what about the women who say they had a mammogram when they were in their 40's and it saved their lives?
Dr. Suzanne Fletcher, co-editor of The Annals of Internal Medicine and chairwoman of the cancer institute's panel of experts who looked at the mammography data, said she is always delighted to hear that a woman with breast cancer has had a good outcome. "First of all, I say, 'How wonderful,' " she said.
But then, Dr. Fletcher added, 79 percent of women survive breast cancer for at least five years regardless of whether they had screening mammograms. "As a scientist, I'm saying there are lots of reasons" why a woman could survive breast cancer, Dr. Fletcher said. "A mammogram is one possible reason, and better treatment is another. What you have to do as a scientist is say, 'I don't know how much one versus the other could have contributed. Let's conduct an experiment to find out.' That's what these large studies are. They're experiments."
She added that she was as surprised as anyone to discover that benefits could only be shown for women over 50.
Dr. Rimer and others say that there is no right or wrong answer on mammograms for individual women in their 40's. Instead, she said, women should look at the evidence and decide for themselves.
"It would be nice if this were an easy decision," Dr. Sondik said, "but it's not."

HEADLINE: Rifkin's Mother Testifies About Day of Son's Arrest

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Dec. 13

 BODY:
Joel Rifkin's mother took the witness stand at a pretrial hearing today, charging that the police misled her after her son's arrest on murder charges by implying that he did not need a lawyer.
But the mother, Jeanne Rifkin, 70, also said that after the arrest, Mr. Rifkin, an unemployed landscaper who has confessed to killing 17 women, told her of the killings. 
 "I did question my son," she said, "and he assured me there were no more than 17."
In nearly five hours of testimony in Nassau County Court, she insisted that Mr. Rifkin, 34, had never before spoken of the murders and that she never went into his second-floor bedroom, which was cluttered with jewelry and clothing from his victims, most of them prostitutes.
Mrs. Rifkin was called to the stand by her son's lawyer, Michael L. Soshnick. He said that investigators went to the Rifkin home within hours of Mr. Rifkin's arrest and told his mother only that he had been involved in a traffic accident. Mr. Soshnick argued that the police dissuaded her from calling a lawyer.
 
Contention of 'Stonewalling'
 He said that while police investigators were "stonewalling" Mrs. Rifkin and "denying her son his Sixth Amendment right" to counsel, the police were getting a confession. Mr. Soshnick said that because the confession and much of the evidence in the case were obtained illegally, they should not be admissible in court.
Mrs. Rifkin told the court that when the police arrived at her home on the morning of June 28, they told her that her son had been "involved in a traffic violation, but that he was O.K."
She said the police refused to give her any additional information, including the fact that he had been arrested, until that afternoon, when they said her son was being held at the state police barracks in Farmingdale for questioning.
"They then told me a crime had been committed, but would not say what kind of crime," she said. "I said if a crime was committed, shouldn't I call a lawyer? But they advised against it, said that it was not necessary and that I should wait."
 
Lawyers' Numbers Available
 During cross-examination by the prosecutor, Fred Klein, Mrs. Rifkin said that she had invited the police into her home, that they had identified themselves and that she had the telephone numbers of at least four lawyers in her address file.
Mr. Klein tried to show that Mrs. Rifkin was not influenced by the police investigators and that she was free to act on her own at any time. "The police told her that her son was under arrest for a crime," Mr. Klein said. "What more did she need to know?"
Mrs. Rifkin finally called a lawyer late that afternoon.
Mr. Klein said that Mr. Rifkin had been advised of his rights shortly after his arrest on June 28.
Outside the court, Mr. Klein said, "Mrs. Rifkin is completely lying to protect her son, who she knows killed all those girls."
"She knew about what Joel was doing," he said. "How could she not if he was cutting up bodies right in the house?"
 
'Smell Anything Funny?'
 He said she invited the police into her home and waited so many hours before calling a lawyer "because she wanted to find out what the police knew about her son."
During his cross-examination, Mr. Klein asked Mrs. Rifkin to recall a day last June when her son picked her up in her car after work. He had borrowed the car and placed the body of his latest victim in the trunk, Mr. Klein said.
'Did you smell anything funny?" Mr. Klein asked.
"No," she said, her eyes averting her son, who was slumped in a chair at the defense table, staring out a courtroom window.
"You did learn that there was a body in the car?" Mr. Klein asked.
"Unfortunately, yes," Mrs. Rifkin said, shifting uneasily in the witness chair and wincing from the discomfort of a cast on her left wrist, which she broke in a recent fall.
The body Mr. Rifkin was carrying in his mother's car was that of Tiffany Bresciani, 22, of Manhattan, whom the police said Mr. Rifkin confessed to killing when he was arrested in the early morning hours of June 28 for a traffic violation.

Preaching to a choir of contributors to Sen.

HEADLINE: NEEDIEST CASES;
From Running Family Business to Living in a Shelter

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
For Donald Armstrong, who worked steadily for 20 years and now faces every morning without a regular job, the lowest point was not when he was evicted from his apartment in Astoria, Queens.
It was not when he resigned himself to seeking charity, nor even when he had to move his battered suitcases into a men's shelter on lower Broadway. 
 The lowest point came before all that, when, at the age of 52, was forced to turn to his 78-year-old father for help with his rent.
"I didn't know where I was going to go," Mr. Armstrong said. "I was frustrated, nervous, scared, fed-up."
 
Expected More From America
 Mr. Armstrong, who looks younger than his years, was reared to expect that America would offer more for him than it gave his parents.
But now, after a year and a half without work, he has found himself among thousands of people in the New York metropolitan region who have been transformed from hard workers to public assistance recipients as the recession drags on.
Mr. Armstrong, who once owned an eight-room house with an above-ground pool, spent 10 years as a municipal worker in West Hartford, Conn., before opening an office-cleaning business with his father. During its best year, the company employed 21 people and work was plentiful. But the competition was always stiff.
"We took contracts at a certain price and then bigger cleaning companies would come in and undercut us," he said. "When you lose three big contracts, you can't afford to pay your employees any more." After five years, the business folded.
Part-time jobs kept Mr. Armstrong afloat for a while, and then came a position as a maintenance worker at a Y.W.C.A. in Manhattan. When that job ended with a layoff notice, others did not follow and the truly hard times began.
When he had lost most of his hope, Mr. Armstrong turned to the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, a beneficiary of the UJA-Federation of New York, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
The fund has begun its 82d annual appeal for contributions to support agencies that lend a hand to people like Mr. Armstrong and others who face the holidays with no job, a disability or no home.
Because The Times pays all expenses for the campaign, the contributions go directly to the charities to help out those with both short-term and long-term misfortune. The appeal continues through Feb. 28.
The Jewish Board, which helps people of all faiths, first helped Mr. Armstrong try to keep his apartment by providing emergency rent money. When jobs didn't appear and Mr. Armstrong was evicted, the board helped him get a bed at a 10-man shelter where he has lived since Memorial Day. The board also provides him with a mailing address and takes messages from potential employers for him. Currently, while looking for a steady job, he is working two days a week as a preparatory cook in a restaurant.
Mr. Armstrong desperately wants to get himself out of the shelter, where the rules require that he leave by 8 A.M. every morning and return no later than 6:30 P.M.
"I'm too old, and I have worked too hard all my life to be living this way," he said. "Things have got to turn around."

HEADLINE: Russia's Chastening Vote

 BODY:
Russia's parliamentary elections on Sunday, which produced a large vote for ultra-nationalists and hard-line Communists, represent a rebuff both to economic reform and warm relations with America. But they need not be a calamity.
The passage of a new Constitution gives President Boris Yeltsin new powers, and his allies will occupy ministerial posts. Still, Mr. Yeltsin and his fellow reformers will face a Parliament at least as unruly as the one he forcibly dissolved this fall. The current political mood is likely to limit the pace of reform. And the resurgence of anti-Western nationalists and the Communists is chastening. 
But Mr. Yeltsin and his allies can still outflank the extremists, and while Washington must honor the outcome, it must also do what it can to encourage markets and democracy over the long haul.
Pro-Yeltsin reformers ran second to the Liberal Democratic Party of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who is neither a liberal nor a democrat but a demagogue who preaches contempt for ethnic minorities and urges the restoration of Russia's empire. The Communist Party, which opposes privatization, also displayed strength.
But the party slates will fill only half the seats in the Duma, the lower house of Parliament. About a third of these are extremists, by latest count. The big winners may thus prove to be regional politicians elected individually in local districts. Though their leanings will become clear only when the legislature meets in January, many of them are likely to support reform if, in exchange, they can win local concessions from Mr. Yeltsin.
Adroit maneuvering could thus produce a working coalition of reformers and regional leaders. That coalition would be strong enough to press on with privatization, but not strong enough to risk Polish-style shock therapy. The hope is that the coalition could gradually wean large enterprises and the central bank from their easy-money policies and keep inflation from wrecking reform.
Mr. Yeltsin's Constitution received solid support, though low voter turnout makes the result less than a ringing endorsement. That is likely to invigorate parliamentary challenges to presidential powers. A truly independent judiciary, not yet in place, could play a critical role in bringing the rule of law to Russia.
The President's attempt to remain above the fray certainly shortened his coattails. That will require him to engage in more sustained politicking to muster support in Parliament.
Given the desperate condition in which many Russians find themselves, given also their inexperience with democracy, it is not altogether surprising that extremists of both left and right did well. Yet it is important not to exaggerate the strength of the opposition. A new Constitution is in place. Mr. Yeltsin is in place. And he has a chance to form a parliamentary majority. These are three solid reasons that Washington should do what it can to keep Russia on the road to reform.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Deliver Your President

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Picking them up in North Korea, Russian cargo planes delivered truck chassis to Syria. They are special chassis, used as mobile launchers for Scud missiles targeted at Israel.
For months, the U.S. and Israel have kept the transfer secret from their publics. It was too embarrassing, after all the warm talk from Washington and Jerusalem about how the Russians and Syrians would now help bring peace to the Mideast. On Sunday, the story was broken in The New York Times by Michael R. Gordon. 
 The chassis are helpful to Syria but will not change the military picture in the Middle East. Next month, however, another special delivery can change the political picture to Syria's enormous advantage -- the delivery from Washington of the President of the United States.
To coax Syria back to the negotiating table with Israel, the U.S. has agreed that President Clinton will meet in Europe with Hafez al-Assad. Mr. Assad is the longtime President of Syria. He is also a longtime person-butcher -- the perpetrator of massacres that have killed thousands of his own people.
Under his rule, the arrest, torture and execution of dissidents has been made government policy, Lebanon was gobbled up and colonized, and 10 Mideast terrorist organizations are trained for and carry out attacks against foreign targets -- including American.
For these actions and more, Syria is on the U.S. terrorist list. When President Bush visited with this man in 1992, Bill Clinton richly denounced appeasement of Syria. So did Israelis.
Now Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's current Prime Minister, believes a Clinton-Assad meeting could persuade Syria to make a deal with Israel if the current Israeli mess with Yasir Arafat is patched up.
The Clinton Administration cannot be more cautious about Mideast peace arrangements than Israel, when Mr. Rabin is willing to take the risks. So it may be expected to do everything it can to bring about the agreements -- everything decent and within U.S. interests.
But by this time, the U.S. should have learned that it is neither decent nor within its interests to build up Mideast dictatorships in arms or political stature. In Iran and Iraq the U.S. found it was building up enemies, for terrorism or war.
There is no evidence that Mr. Assad pays off appeasement. He collects political, military or economic advantages in advance, banks them, and does exactly what he then decides best solidifies his hold on power. The deserts are littered with the bones of Western, Arab and Israeli diplomats who thought they were smarter than this fellow. He is not only smarter but can murder anybody at home who raises a voice against whatever he decides to do.
But what harm does it do if a President lends the dignity of his office to a big-time killer? What difference if Washington allows Kuwait to transfer American planes to Syria despite the ban on such transfers to terrorist nations?
Why, none at all, if you do not think America has an interest in promoting democracy and fighting state terrorism. None, if you do not think Clintonian democratic idealism is corrupted to the point of mockery by sidling up to one of the more vicious tyrants. None, if you feel, as do Mr. Rabin and some other American allies, that involving human rights in international deals is sentimental slop. And none if you feel that Syrian complicity in the downing of Pan Am 103 must be covered up.
Despite Western attempts to whitewash Syria, C.I.A. specialists who were on the case from the beginning believe Palestinian terrorists operating out of Syria planned painstakingly to bomb an American plane and when their group was infiltrated handed the job over to their Libyan friends.
As a candidate, Mr. Clinton promised the relatives of the Pan Am dead that he would not accept a cover-up but would answer all their questions about Syrian and Iranian involvement. He has not. It is a bit late now for credibility, isn't it? You don't first chat with a mass murderer for your own purposes and then announce he was innocent all along.
It is not too late to call off the visit with this evil man. Mr. Clinton does not belong with him. If peace is possible between Syria and Israel, it will not be brought a day sooner by allowing the demeaning of the American Presidency.

HEADLINE: In 1990, U.S. Was Still Training Salvador Civilians Tied to Killings

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
As recently as three years ago, American military officers in El Salvador trained a group of wealthy Salvadorans associated with right-wing death squads, State Department documents show.
The training occurred as the threat of Communism was receding and the Bush Administration was pursuing peace settlements in Central America. 
 The documents are the first to describe Americans training civilians tied to political killings in El Salvador, and the first to link American support to Salvadoran death-squad activities in the 1990's.
 
Called 'Gun-Toting Extremists'
 "My worst fears are realized," the United States Ambassador, William G. Walker, said in a cable to the State Department in October 1990. The Ambassador said he had learned that American officers were giving weekly military training to 50 to 60 wealthy Salvadorans who called themselves Los Patrioticos, the Patriotic Ones.
American officers called the unit "the BMW Brigade." Mr. Walker called its members "adventure-seeking, gun-toting, 'Soldier of Fortune' magazine-subscribing, rich young extremists." Citing United States intelligence reports, he said the unit "was being used as a cover for death-squad activities."
Mr. Walker's cable did not say what rationale had been given for assigning military trainers to a civilian group. Nor did it specify the group's activities. But it said the group was affiliated with Roberto d'Aubuisson, a right-wing politician identified this year by a United Nations-sponsored investigation of rights abuses in El Salvador as the mastermind of the nation's death squads. Mr. d'Aubuisson died of cancer in 1992.
Another memo, written by a Defense Department official, argued that the Patriotic Ones "are not the types to compose death squads (fund them, yes, but get blood on their own hands -- certainly not)."
The documents are among some 12,000 Government papers on policy in Central America that were declassified and made available to the public this year. They were found by researchers from the National Security Archive, a private foundation that works for the declassification of documents, and the Center for International Policy, a Washington research group led by Robert E. White.
 
Ties to Death Squads
 Mr. White was Ambassador to El Salvador in 1980 and 1981 and later criticized the Reagan Administration's support for the Salvadoran Government in the face of many reports of rights abuses by the Government in its war against leftist guerrillas.
Those documents and a United Nations investigation showed that the Salvadoran Army and security forces were associated with death-squad activities, including the killing of hundreds of civilians during the 1980-92 war. American military personnel worked closely with the Salvadoran armed forces, providing training, equipment and advice. But none of the $6 billion in military and economic aid received by the Salvadoran Government during the war was earmarked for military training for civilians.
The worst of the death-squad abuses occurred in the early 1980's, and were thought to have been long past in 1989, when the Berlin wall fell, the threat of Communism receded and the Bush Administration embraced regional peace negotiations in Central America.
 
Killing of Jesuits Cited
 But in November 1989, members of the Salvadoran armed forces killed six Jesuit priests in the capital, raising questions of whether a decade of training had increased the Salvadoran soldiers' professionalism, decreased their involvement in rights abuses or helped bring stability to El Salvador.
It was in this context that the question of continuing to train the Patriotic Ones, who had organized only that year, was addressed. Mr. White, the former Ambassador, said, "The idea that subsequent to the Jesuit murders this kind of program continued is repugnant."
Members of Congress and Clinton Administration officials at the Pentagon and the State Department said the fact that the training of the Patriotic Ones continued after the killings of the Jesuits suggested that United States military officers had been working at cross-purposes with United States diplomats.
Representative Joe Moakley, a Massachusetts Democrat long critical of United States policy in El Salvador, said "it shows that there were two centers of power" at the Embassy.
 
Nominated as Panama Envoy
 Ambassador Walker is now assigned to the State Department pending hearings on his nomination to be Ambassador to Panama, State Department officials said. He did not return several telephone messages left at his office.
His cable said the Patriotic Ones, armed with American semi-automatic rifles, received American military training under the supervision of Col. Francisco Elena Fuentes of the Salvadoran Army, who was commander of the First Brigade, the unit in charge of the capital region. The Ambassador identified Colonel Elena Fuentes and his brigade as "among the worst in terms of human rights."
American officers argued that they should not stop training the Patriotic Ones, saying that that would insult Colonel Elena Fuentes and that "we are already 'a little pregnant' with the training that has taken place," Mr. Walker reported.
Nonetheless, the Ambassador halted the training of the Patriotic Ones. That order set off a chain of memorandums that reached Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney in November 1990.
 
Envoy Disputed by General
 In one memorandum, Brig. Gen. M. J. Byron, then the acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Inter-American Affairs, questioned the Ambassador's expressions of shock and outrage, saying American officers had described the unit in messages that Mr. Walker and his aides either "never read or prefer not to remember." General Byron also played down the unit's capacity for violence.
"They are, I believe, pretty much as the Ambassador describes them except that they are not the types to compose death squads (fund them, yes, but get blood on their own hands -- certainly not)," the general wrote to Assistant Secretary of Defense Henry S. Rowen.
Mr. Rowen, in turn, wrote to Mr. Cheney on Nov. 5, 1990, saying he agreed that the training of "the suspect unit" should be stopped. "There is no doubt that this is fertile territory for potential human rights abuses," Mr. Rowen wrote.
"This was really late in the game," Mr. Rowen said in an interview today. "There was no room for argument."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 15, 1993, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about American military training of civilians in El Salvador in 1990 referred incorrectly to William G. Walker, then the United States Ambassador there. He remains with the State Department, but has not been nominated to be Ambassador to Panama.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Fills 2 Top Posts As Transition Presses On

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani turned yesterday to a Democratic insider from the Koch administration to be the city's Corporation Counsel, and he named his campaign manager, Peter J. Powers, as Deputy Mayor for Operations, who will be designated to run City Hall when the Mayor is out of town.
At a news conference at his Madison Avenue transition office, Mr. Giuliani called the appointments of Paul A. Crotty, a former finance and housing commissioner, and of his lifelong friend, Mr. Powers, a demonstration of "what we're trying to accomplish." 
 He said he was seeking "change in government, to bring in new people with fresh ideas and to also have appointments of people who have significant experience in city government."
With his move into City Hall now less than three weeks away, Mr. Giuliani said he would soon name two additional deputy mayors -- one for social services and health, the other for economic development. Earlier this month he appointed Ninfa Segarra, a Board of Education member, as Deputy Mayor for Education and Community Affairs.
 
Fewer Deputy Mayors
 As part of his campaign pledge to streamline government, Mr. Giuliani had promised to "substantially" reduce the number of deputies serving the mayor. His reconfiguration of the mayor's office, he said yesterday, would result in a total of four deputy mayors, two fewer than have served under Mayor David N. Dinkins.
During the campaign, Mr. Giuliani had often criticized Norman Steisel, Mr. Dinkins's First Deputy Mayor, and referred to the "Dinkins-Steisel" administration to suggest that Mr. Dinkins was not actually the one running City Hall. Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he had decided to eliminate the post of first deputy mayor, at least at the beginning of his administration, after listening to the advice of "many, many people," including former Mayors Edward I. Koch and John V. Lindsay.
"It seems to me that this was the most sensible way to start an administration -- to have a mayor in essence not have the kind of relationship where one person has the vast majority of the government reporting to him and then the mayor somewhat more removed," he said.
 
First Among Equals
 Still, he made clear that even without the title of first deputy, Mr. Powers would be Mr. Giuliani's first among equals, calling him the "person that I would designate to act for me if I'm indisposed or out of the city." Although Mr. Giuliani had contemplated naming Mr. Powers as chief of staff, the idea ran afoul of the City Charter, which specifies that only a deputy mayor can be a temporary stand-in for the chief executive.
Mr. Powers and Mr. Crotty, both lawyers who live on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, have both had long relationships with Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Powers has been one of Mr. Giuliani's closest friends since they met as students at Bishop McLaughlin High School in Brooklyn. And Mr. Crotty has known Mr. Giuliani since they worked together as clerks in the office of Federal District Judge Lloyd F. MacMahon in 1968 and 1969.
But in other ways Mr. Crotty and Mr. Powers are a study in contrasts. Mr. Crotty, 52, is already an experienced New York City official from a Democratic dynasty in Buffalo. His wife, Jane, recently narrowly lost a bid for the City Council against Andrew S. Eristoff, a Republican, who had campaigned at Mr. Giuliani's side. In 1989 Mr. Crotty managed Mayor Koch's unsuccessful bid for a fourth term.
Mr. Powers, 49, a Republican lawyer who was the quiet behind-the-scenes manager of Mr. Giuliani's two campaigns for mayor and is also his transition chairman, will be assuming his first public job since he was an intern in the Parks Department more than 30 years ago. "I've known Peter for most of the life that I can remember," Mr. Giuliani said.
As the $112,000-a-year Deputy Mayor for Operations, Mr. Powers will oversee a vast segment of the municipal bureaucracy, including the Departments of Sanitation, Transportation, Personnel, Buildings and General Services and the Office of Labor Relations.
 
To Examine Regulations
 Mr. Crotty, who comes to City Hall with experience running both the Finance Department and the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said that as Corporation Counsel -- the city's lawyer -- he would re-examine a series of laws and regulations to determine if they impede efficient delivery of services and procurement.
Asked whether he would seek to appeal court rulings that have left the city little flexibility on how quickly it must shelter homeless families, Mr. Crotty was noncommittal. "I don't think anybody believes that the consent decrees have led to an entirely rational housing policy," he said.
The Corporation Counsel earns $110,000 a year.
Mr. Giuliani yesterday also named Cristyne Lategano, 28, as his press secretary and Robert E. Huber, 45, the manager of executive communications at Bristol-Myers Squibb, to an $85,000-a-year post as speechwriter.
Ms. Lategano, who was the campaign press secretary, said that her salary had not been decided and that she would "welcome a cut" in the $103,000 salary that accompanies the position of press secretary. She said Leland T. Jones, Mr. Dinkins's press secretary, had been paid a salary of $99,638.

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about two appointments announced by Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani misidentified the Manhattan neighborhood where Paul A. Crotty, who was named Corporation Counsel, lives. It is Stuyvesant Town, not the Upper East Side. In some copies the picture caption with the article misidentified the official who would be designated to run City Hall in Mr. Giuliani's absence. He is Peter J. Powers, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, not Mr. Crotty.

HEADLINE: At Purdue, a Wealth of Data on Consumer Debt

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind.

 BODY:
America speaks to Dr. Robert W. Johnson through credit cards, mortgages and installment loans -- the many voices of consumer debt.
Since 1974, Dr. Johnson and his colleagues at the Credit Research Center of Purdue University have been watching how Americans spend money they do not have, becoming the nation's leading repository of credit expertise. 
 During those years, they have seen the explosion of automobile leasing and the transformation of the traditionally dubious second mortgage into a respectable financial tool of the middle class. Those changes have muddied the basic, Government-collected credit statistics. But Dr. Johnson, by most accounts the dean of a still largely neglected field, has developed a wealth of data of his own.
For instance, what the numbers now say to him is that the nation's surge in installment credit reflects robust spending by venturesome consumers, not what some pollsters contend is desperate borrowing by pinched, pessimistic ones.
 
Consumers More Confident
 "Consumers seem to be more confident," Dr. Johnson said. Just look, he added, at sales -- what people do as opposed to what they say they plan to do -- for confirmation.
[Retail sales rose for the eighth straight month in November, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, climbing four-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $178.93 billion, following a revised 1.8 percent gain in October.
[Besides their work on bankruptcy abuse, which Margie Muller, State Bank Commissioner of Maryland, says is having a "continuing effect" on regulators and others, the Purdue researchers have contributed importantly to the understanding of loan discrimination against minorities. Citing this week's costly settlement of a case against the Shawmut National Corporation, Ms. Muller said the center's study raised the issue of whether the ability of borrowers to repay was being properly measured.]
With the center's $300,000-a-year budget supplied by banks, retailers, credit-card issuers and credit-reporting agencies, the industry largely determines what projects it undertakes. Even so, it is clear that the center, believed to be the only academic group devoted to consumer and mortgage credit, has a mind of its own, and some of its insights and conclusions in recent years have shaken up the field.
 
New Director Named
 "We like to study things that are exciting to us, as well as useful to the industry," said Dr. Johnson, 71, who turned over directorship in 1990 to Michael E. Staten, who is 39.
Two years ago, the researchers startled sponsors by finding banks and other lenders much too eager to extend credit to people who were in bankruptcy, thereby stifling an industry effort to get Congress to make it harder for people to take refuge in the bankruptcy law. Legislators said, in effect, that laxness by lenders themselves -- lending to impaired or unscreened borrowers -- was inviting delinquencies.
In the face of the widely held belief that bankruptcy cripples one's financial life for 10 years -- the length of time it can remain on credit reports -- the center found that one-third of those who had filed for bankruptcy got at least one line of new credit within three years and that half of them got credit within five years. Many, moreover, keep certain lines paid up and undeclared through the process.
"The myth that consumers didn't get new credit was pretty well destroyed," the mild-mannered Dr. Johnson said with evident satisfaction.
 
Issuers' Thinking Changed
 One early impact was the way it "totally revolutionized" thinking among issuers of credit cards, said James F. Smith, professor of finance at the University of North Carolina.
The center brought a fragmented industry -- banks, oil companies, finance companies and others -- together for first time. Before that, Professor Smith said, each issuer looked at the business from its own distinct niche.
Other questions under current or recent study are whether it pays for lenders to waive finance charges and late fees to induce overextended consumers to complete repayment plans and whether privacy-related restrictions on credit information, as proposed by Europrean governments, would be unduly costly. The answer in both cases, the center found, is yes.
In its latest study, the center's preliminary findings suggest that there is some validity to complaints about the highly profitable business of credit life insurance. Critics have long contended that this coverage, bought mainly by blue-collar workers to pay off loans for such purchases as cars and furniture, is too expensive and is often sold with strong-arm tactics.
"That's a sensitive issue, and we want to be darn sure of the results" before publishing them, Dr. Staten said, referring specifically to findings that up to 10 percent of those responding to the survey "strongly agreed" that they felt pressured. One-third of them, moreover, consider the product -- it typically carries a 1 percent premium -- overpriced.
 
Consumer Group Is Critical
 But even a study like that one criticizing the industry is unlikely to persuade, say, Stephen Brobeck that the center does much more than churn out results favorably preordained by those who pick up the tab and whose business is lending money -- often at high rates -- to tens of millions of American households.
"The Purdue Center is funded by the very industry" it is studying, complained Mr. Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, a leading critic of credit insurance. "This kind of research is highly suspect."
To counter the charge that sponsorship taints its results, the center has included a few outsiders as advisers and project participants. One of these, Ralph Rohner, dean of the law school at Catholic University in Washington, said he was "generally impressed" with the quality of the center's work, grading it an A-. His reservation is that the industry majority determines the agenda, the subjects to be studied.
After more than a decade of 12-digit deficits by the Federal Government, which has not been in the black since 1969, one might wonder whether the coincident rise of the credit-card debt and other sources of ready borrowing have eroded the nation's financial and economic health.
 
Carries a Dozen Cards
 Dr. Johnson, who carries about a dozen cards of his own but uses them sparingly and pays monthly bills in full, rejects the idea that abundant credit has been detrimental to American prosperity.
For one thing, modern mechanisms have replaced credit formerly extended by merchants, allowing them to concentrate on primary aspects of their business and making collection more likely by putting it in the hands of third parties, he said.
Moreover, Dr. Johnson said, payment on consumer debt has remained an "extremely stable" proportion of income over the decades, and corporate America, after a binge in the 1980's, is now responding to low interest rates by repaying debt in great chunks.
If there's a credit problem, he concluded, it is that "the market doesn't restrain the Government."

HEADLINE: U.S. Concerns Split Over Japan Law

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Several American computer companies are arguing in favor of a change in Japan's copyright law that the United States Government and many other American companies vigorously oppose.
The break in the unified front of the American computer industry at a hearing here Monday could make it easier for Japan's Government to justify the revision of the law. 
 Many leading American computer and software companies -- including Apple, I.B.M. and Microsoft -- say the change would let Japanese companies "reverse-engineer" and copy computer programs. They argue that such a change would help the Japanese catch up to American software companies. Washington has adopted this position and has said it views the possible change with "gravest concern."
 
Argument for Convenience
 But another group of companies, led by Sun Microsystems, testified Monday that a revision of law would spur innovation and competition and make it easier for different programs and computers to work together.
The hearing "illustrated in high relief how deeply divided the U.S. computer industry is on this issue," said Peter M. C. Choy, deputy general counsel of Sun and chairman of the American Committee for Interoperable Systems, the group of more than 30 companies that presented the testimony. Opponents, however, say Sun and its allies represent only a small minority of the American industry.
At issue is a process known as decompilation, which is one way of reverse-engineering a computer program to find out how it works.
When software is written in a programming language like Fortran, it undergoes a process known as compilation that converts it into the ones and zeroes used by the computer. Decompilation turns the ones and zeros back into programming language.
Japan's Agency for Cultural Affairs set up an advisory committee in the summer to consider possible changes to the copyright law, including allowing decompilation in some cases. After complaints from the United States that the committee was conducting its deliberations in secrecy, the advisory committee called Monday's hearing for testimony by the United States Government and American companies.
 
Gathering Evidence
 American officials said they were told that the committee was still gathering evidence and had not yet formed a proposal. But American opponents of decompilation, citing a position paper by a Japanese business lobbying group, say they fear that Japan is considering unrestricted decompilation.
The opponents say decompilation would allow companies to copy a program in a way that would make it difficult to detect. "It would be a terrific one-shot vitamin pill for the Japanese software industry," Marshall C. Phelps Jr., a vice president of the International Business Machines Corporation, said after the hearing.
But Sun and its allies say decompilation should be permitted, to let one company make programs that work with the hardware or software of another company.
The European Community allows decompilation if it is needed to make one program work with another. In the United States, two Federal appellate court decisions have let video-game software companies use decompilation to evade lockout devices preventing them from making games for Sega and Nintendo machines.
To be sure, many companies opposing decompilation control key pieces of software or hardware that have become almost standardized. Many companies in the other camp make products compatible with those of the leaders. For instance, executives of the Storage Technology Corporation testified Monday that decompilation would help it make data storage devices that would work with the computer systems made by Hitachi and other vendors.
A senior American official said Friday that the Government based its position on the "totality" of American interests. "There is no question that the economic interests of the United States are at severe risk were this proposal to become law," the official said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Amid Concern About the Russian Elections

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most foreign currencies in light trading yesterday amid growing concerns about turmoil in Russia following a hard-line nationalist's success in parliamentary elections.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.7150 German marks, from 1.7080 on Monday. It also rose to 109.40 Japanese yen from 109. 
 Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery was unchanged at $388.60 an ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at $386.75 an ounce, up 25 cents.
Currency traders said the dollar had been bolstered by fears about the strong electoral showing of an extreme Russian nationalist party led by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. In the past, he has threatened to drop "100 bombs" on any country making territorial claims on Russia and insisted on the return of Alaska, Finland, Poland and other areas that once belonged to czarist empires.
"We might get some civil unrest" in Russia, said Alex Braginsky, a vice president at Mitsubishi Bank Ltd. in New York. "Any time that happens, the mighty greenback goes up."
He and other traders said concerns about Russia weighed particularly on the German mark. Most of Russia's debt is to German institutions. The German economy could be upset if Russia failed to repay its loans.
The remarks "gave Europe a bit of a chill," said Margaret Kudarauskas, a foreign exchange specialist at Technical Data, an analytical service.
Traders said the dollar also gained on a news service report quoting an American official as saying the United States would tolerate a stronger dollar if it meant economic growth in Europe and a commitment by Japan to reduce its trade surplus. The official was not identified.
The news reports overshadowed a Commerce Department release showing a modest increase of four-tenths of 1 percent in retail sales in November, traders said.
The British pound slipped yesterday to $1.4885 from $1.4895 on Monday.

Ad agency stocks may fit on a contrarian's shopping list.

BYLINE: By Joshua Mills

 BODY:
THE stores are bustling with shoppers, and newspapers and magazines are thick enough with ads that they can double as barbells. Economic reports of good news have advanced to at least a steady trickle.
All this might seem to portend a bright year ahead for advertising agencies, but it ain't necessarily so. 
 "I have no buy recommendations with any of the traditional agencies," said Alison Folino, who follows advertising for Smith Barney Shearson. "They've done a great job of managing costs, but I'm just not enthusiastic about the environment."
Most investors who want a piece of the advertising action focus on the five big publicly owned companies: WPP Group and the Saatchi & Saatchi Company, both of Britain; Interpublic Group of Companies and Omnicom Group, both based in New York, and Foote, Cone & Belding Communications of Chicago.
WPP owns J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy & Mather; Saatchi & Saatchi owns Backer Spielvogel Bates and CME KHBB Advertising; Interpublic owns McCann Erickson Worldwide, Lintas Worldwide and the Lowe Group, and Omnicom owns BBDO Worldwide, DDB Needham Worldwide and TBWA International. Foote, Cone owns only itself and stakes in two foreign agencies.
Shun the British is the consensus on Wall Street, because WPP and Saatchi remain encumbered by huge debt. James D. Dougherty, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, noted that at WPP, net interest payments are 32 percent of operating profit before interest, while Saatchi & Saatchi is in even worse shape, at 44.5 percent. "It's just brutal for the people running the agencies," he said. "How can you compete with other agencies when it comes to hiring people or having enough space?"

 At Interpublic, Omnicom and Foote, Cone, interest payments are, respectively, 10.6 percent, 14.6 percent and 8.7 percent of operating profit before interest, Mr. Dougherty said. That's one reason he is recommending all three stocks. Interpublic shares closed yesterday at $31.625 and Omnicom at $43.25, each 10 percent under its 52-week high. Foote, Cone ended at $41.50, its high for the year.
"Revenue generation is pretty good, the new business activity is pretty good," he said. "Producing good financial results is a top priority."
The growing economy is another plus, he said, predicting that sometime in 1994 the economic strength "will filter through to the agencies, though Europe is still a big problem."
Alan J. Gottesman, who tracks the industry for Paine Webber, was more skeptical. "The advertising business has its own rhythm, not tied to macro-economic performance, not tied to the real world," he said. Foote, Cone & Belding is the only advertising company he is recommending to clients.
For agencies in general, he said, "business is less than terrific. Even if they were debt-free, their prospects would not be very good."
Two forecasts of advertising spending issued last week seem to bear him out. Robert J. Coen, senior vice president at McCann-Erickson U.S.A., predicted that ad spending would grow only 6.3 percent next year instead of the 7 percent he foresaw in June. Zenith Media Worldwide predicted American advertising spending for 1994 would increase only 3.8 percent.
So why is Mr. Gottesman excited about Foote, Cone? He offered a Zen-like abstraction and contrarian reasoning: "It's more a tonal thing than a specific thing. They've had a spotty record, and they trade very lightly, so it's not an institutional favorite." He also said he liked Foote, Cone's ability to win over customers, most recently the NCR Corporation, and earlier its parent, A.T.& T.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD TRADE AGREEMENT: THE FRENCH STRATEGY
Months of Risk, Moments of Isolation, Now Boasts of Triumph

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Having risked disaster in the GATT negotiations, France said today that it had won an important victory by forcing the United States to be flexible about agricultural exports and to exclude movies and television from a proposed world trade-liberalization package.
Opposition parties and farmers were less enthusiastic over what the conservative Government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur had achieved, but for the Government, the gamble of testing its will against Washington and risking a crisis in relations with its European partners seems to have paid off. 
 "This is a great and beautiful victory for Europe and for French culture," Communications Minister Alain Carignon said after negotiators for the United States and the European Community decided to exclude culture from the proposed accord of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "We got what we wanted from the beginning."
In the dispute over movies and other audio-visual trade, even Jack Lang, who served as Culture Minister in the former Socialist Cabinet, sounded pleased. "It's not a victory of one country over another," he said. "It's a victory for art and artists over the commercialization of culture."
After the United States agreed last week to renegotiate a farm trade deal worked out with the 12-member European Community in November 1992, France said it had achieved a slower reduction in subsidies for farm exports. That was its main purpose in pushing the United States and the community to restructure those provisions of the accord, softening the impact on France's million farmers.
 
The Truculent French Farmer
 Mr. Balladur may have more difficulty persuading the powerful domestic farmers' lobby to accept the agreement. Today, farmers in a number of cities demonstrated against the renegotiated deal. About 30 of them occupied the area around the Arc de Triomphe here this afternoon.
"Europe laid down and France capitulated," a rightist legislator, Philippe de Villiers, told another meeting of farmers near Les Invalides. "The Government of Mr. Mitterrand and Mr. Balladur has purely and simply betrayed the interests of France."
France was almost alone in opposing the original farm deal, but in the end, its repeated threat to veto the entire GATT package won it concessions. On the question of opening European markets to more American films, TV programs and music recordings, -- which France said threatened its entertainment industries -- the European Community stood behind Paris and against Washington.
Tonight, France also claimed success in its campaign to have a new trade organization replace the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The proposal had the backing of most of the 117 GATT members, but the United States has said it will add needless bureaucracy.
Success was hardly assured for the French. At several points over the last year, they became dangerously isolated within the European Community, with even its strong German ally growing impatient with its stubbornness. Some French politicians were alarmed that France would be blamed for yet another failure to conclude the global trade talks, which had dragged on for seven years.
 
Help From the Left
 But crucially, the Socialist President, Francois Mitterrand, continued to back his conservative Prime Minister as he steadily raised the stakes, forcing other Europeans to choose between standing up to the United States and provoking a potentially disastrous split within the community.
It was here that Mr. Balladur proved to be a cool poker player. With community nations badly bruised by economic recession, by a failure to end the Bosnian war, by currency crises and by new doubts about its plan for a single currency, he sensed that the region was in no mood for a bitter fight over GATT. Almost by default, then, it backed France.
Mr. Balladur, who inherited the trade conflict when he took office in March, is expected to present the broad lines of the GATT package to the French National Assembly on Wednesday. He will also seek a vote of confidence which, with conservatives and sympathetic centrists holding 80 percent of the seats, he is certain to win.
Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, whose party, the Union for French Democracy, forms part of the governing coalition, also seemed reluctant to give too much credit to Mr. Balladur. "France has obtained some positive results," he said, "but it hasn't achieved all the aims it had set itself."
Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's reticence had as much to do with domestic politics as with trade. The former President harbors ambitions to again be the standard-bearer of the French right in the 1995 presidential election, but at present, polls show Mr. Balladur to be the strong front-runner.
 
Chirac Also Overshadowed
 A political victory for Mr. Balladur on GATT also poses problems for Jacques Chirac, the leader of the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic. Mr. Chirac also has presidential hopes, but since March he has been increasingly overshadowed by the soft-spoken man he nominated to become Prime Minister.
The opposition Socialist Party has predictably criticized the proposed GATT accord, arguing that it would have been firmer had it still been in power. At the same time, Socialist leaders hope to harvest new support among disgruntled farmers.
In the negotiations with the United States over movies and other forms of entertainment, France called for a "cultural exception," arguing that elimination both of subsidies to the French movie industry and quotas on American films shown on European television would enable Hollywood to crush the arts of European nations.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, warned that the issue was not closed, with Washington likely to seek alternate ways of liberalizing audio-visual trade. "We won satisfaction today," he said, "but we will have to be vigilant tomorrow. The United States will return to the charge."
Jean-Jacques Beineix, a film director who joined the battle for "cultural exception," used a similar metaphor. "The enemy troops are sticking to their positions," he said. "They have not been able to launch their final assault, but they will."
But France's new Culture Minister, Jacques Toubon, who had warned that the nation's culture was at risk in the dispute, said the agreement would at least give the European Community time to develop "a competitive European audio-visual industry representative of our cultural identity."

HEADLINE: Buyers Turn Wary, and the Dow Falls 21.80

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks declined in moderately active trading yesterday as buyers turned cautious following a drop in bond prices that pushed interest rates higher.
Blue-chip stocks gave back much of their gains of the previous day. Usually positive news like lower oil prices, the successful negotiations in Europe on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and a modest gain in November retail sales was discounted. 
 Analysts said surprising election gains made by Russian hard-line nationalists created a drag on the market. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.80 points, to 3,742.63, one day after reaching a new all-time closing high. The Nasdaq composite fell 8.25 points, to 751.47.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 275.1 million, up from the 256.6 million shares on Monday. Losing issues led gainers by 1,376 to 696.
 
A Rebound Possible

 
 Harry W. Laubscher, senior vice president and market analyst for Tucker Anthony, pointed to the combination of lower bonds and Nasdaq stocks as a source of weakness in the market.
"The Dow dropped into a minor support zone near 3,740 and approached a short-term oversold condition," he said.
Mr. Laubscher added: "It should be kept in mind that in triple witching weeks like this week, when futures and options expire, prices of stocks tend to rise into the expiration day more often than not. That means we could see a bounce back by the market." That could come by the end of Friday, he said, when the contracts expire.
Traders said yesterday's selloff in blue chips was likely a result of investors selling to lock in any gains from Monday's rally.
David Shulman, equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, attributed the Nasdaq weakness to continuing erosion in technology and health care stocks, the result of worries over industry pricing and product cycles. "While some investors may have gotten out in November," he said, "others are trying to get out now."
 
Medco Research Jumps

 
 Elsewhere, Medco Research rose 2 1/2, to 15 3/4, after the company received preliminary approval by the Food and Drug Administration for Andenoscan, a heart drug alternative to the exercise stress test. Kemper Securities upgraded the stock to strong buy from long-term buy.
Vical rose 1 1/2, to 12 1/2, as the company and Baxter Healthcare announced an agreement to jointly develop Vical's proprietary gene-based pharmaceutical technology for treatment of hemophilia. Baxter was up 3/8, to 23 1/4.
Anheuser-Busch fell 1 1/8, to 49 1/4. Traders said the stock was down on reports that the company was planning to cut the price of its Budweiser beer brand in its biggest market, California.
Morgan Stanley initiated coverage of Zilog with a buy rating that set $37 a share as a price target. The computer maker's stock rose by 1, to 28 5/8.
Anthem Electron fell 1 7/8, to 26 1/2. The company said it expects fourth-quarter earnings to be below the third quarter's 46 cents a share because of a decline in semiconductor sales and lower gross profit margins at its Eagle Technology unit.
Shares of Federal Express rose after the package delivery company reported quarterly results that were higher than expected. The stock gained 1 1/2 to close at 71 1/2 in active trading.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rule on Contributions Is Delayed

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The board that governs municipal bond dealers said yesterday that it had set April 1 as the effective date for its proposed restrictions on political contributions by underwriting firms.
The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board also made some changes in the proposed rule, which was first revised last month. The additional changes increase the amount of disclosure required of firms and the number of employees covered by the restrictions on political contributions. Officials would not provide details, except to say that the "basic outlines of the rule" had been retained. 
 The proposed rule prohibits a firm from doing business with state or local issuers of bonds for two years if it or any employee covered by the rule has made a political contribution to an official involved in the selection of municipal bond underwriters.
David C. Clapp, the chairman of the M.S.R.B. and head of the municipal finance department at Goldman, Sachs & Company, said he would decline comment until the final language of the proposed rule had been written and reviewed. The board met Monday evening in New York City.
 
Time for Compliance
 The effective date was delayed from Jan. 1. In a statement, the board said the delay would give dealers time to set up compliance procedures.
The rule will go to the Securities and Exchange Commission for final approval, which is expected early next year. But it is facing growing opposition from state and local officials who choose bond underwriters and who often receive political contributions.
The strongest opposition has come from the Florida Association of Counties. It opposes the M.S.R.B. rule and the separate voluntary ban on political contributions that has now been endorsed by more than 40 major municipal underwriters. The group is distributing a letter calling for a boycott of the 17 Wall Street firms that initially endorsed a voluntary ban.
National associations, like the National League of Cities, have also opposed the rule, saying it abridges the right to make political contributions and may entail enormous burdens of record-keeping. The league also said it "takes exception to the presumption that if an elected official accepts a legitimate campaign contribution from a municipal securities professional, then that elected official will be unable to carry out his or her fiduciary responsibilities to taxpayers."
 
Delay Is Sought
 In a statement adopted on Friday, the National Association of Counties asked the rule-making board and the Securities and Exchange Commission to delay approval of a final rule until they had completed a "cost-benefit impact analysis" and consulted with state and local issuers of municipal bonds.
The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt Jr., has not taken kindly to the opposition, especially from the group in Florida. In a statement last week, Mr. Levitt said that "such attempts are self-interested and a misunderstanding of both the potential problems we face and the proposed solutions we contemplate."
"Boycotting the progress we've made," he said, "is counterproductive to our common goal of increasing the integrity and public confidence so vital to the market."
Many of the objections, including the concern over the right to make contributions, have been raised since August, when the rule-making board proposed the idea of a ban. Because of that concern, the board revised its proposed rule last month from a ban on political contributions to a ban on doing business with municipal bond issuers if contributions have been made.
 
Treasury Market
 Prices of longer-term Treasury securities fell sharply yesterday but the bond market continued to trade within a wide trading range as the end of the year approached.
With little interest in trading among investors and with professional traders unwilling to risk losses, the market is easy to drive down. The price of the 30-year bond was down 28/32 in trading around 5 P.M. as the yield, which moves in the oppositie direction, rose to 6.29 percent from 6.23 percent on Monday. Shorter-term interest rates were little changed.
In the weeks ahead, traders are likely to be talking about President Clinton's comment yesterday that there was no need to raise interest rates at this time because inflation was in check. Many market analysts are predicting that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term rates early next year if the economy keeps growing at a 3 percent pace.

HEADLINE: Sales Brisk At Stores Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Spending heavily for big-ticket goods, shoppers kicked off the holiday gift-giving season by sending retail sales in November up briskly, a preliminary tabulation by the Commerce Department showed today.
Consumers shoved $178.93 billion across counters last month, four-tenths of 1 percent more than in October, despite severe wintry weather that curtailed activity in much of the country toward the end of the month. 
 Although the rise was less than some expected, the Clinton Administration and most private analysts expressed satisfaction with it, noting that this was the eighth straight rise in retail spending, a category accounting for one-third of the nation's economic activity.
They also noted that the department revised upward its sales tally for the two preceding months, with October now showing a robust 1.8 percent surge.
"They're really strong," said Susan M. Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers, of today's results. "Consumers are spending with considerable abandon."
 
Furniture Sales Surge
 Perhaps the most impressive reading was a 3.7 percent jump in spending at stores selling furniture and other home equipment, the biggest monthly advance in 10 years, according to C. J. Lawrence, a New York investment house.
This, along with a 1.1 percent rise for building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes, appeared to result from a pickup in the housing market this autumn.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown pointed to this as evidence that cuts in interest rates, which he said were made possible by the Administration's economic program, "are fueling the recovery."
The November gain was achieved even without a contribution from the automotive sector, which edged down one-tenth of 1 percent last month after soaring 5 percent in October.
Leaving out motor vehicles, retail sales rose five-tenths of 1 percent in November, compared with a nine-tenths of 1 percent October gain.
 
Retailers Optimistic
 Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, called last month's sales gain a "moderate" prelude to what is likely to be a holiday season surpassed in recent years only by last year's spending spree.
"Consumers are doing window-shopping in November, trying to size things up," Ms. Mullin said. "We expect them to do the buying in December."
She also predicted that sales would continue strong after the holidays. Between Christmas and Easter, members expect a 5.5 percent increase, up from 4.2 percent last year, she said.
In all, durable goods, those intended to last three years or more, were by far the stronger of the two over-arching sales groups last month, rising nine-tenths of 1 percent.
Commentators were not particularly disappointed by flat sales of cars and trucks, since October was one of the best months in several years. The strength in durable goods lifted sales for the period September through November 12.3 percent ahead of the comparable 1992 period and 3.4 percent higher than in the June through August period.
 
Nondurables Sag
 Nondurables, however, did markedly less well, rising just one-tenth of 1 percent. Consumers seemed to feel a need to balance big purchases with a bit of frugality elsewhere.
Stores selling general merchandise, including department stores, posted a 1 percent decline, and sales fell six-tenths of 1 percent at restaurants and bars.
Spending climbed 1.4 percent at apparel and accessory stores and five-tenths of 1 percent, at drug and proprietary stores, but gains at food stores and gasoline service stations were just one-tenth of 1 percent.
Sales at gasoline stations had jumped 1.5 percent in October as higher Federal fuel taxes took effect. November was marked by tumbling oil prices that continued into December.
Over the last three months, sales of nondurables have been just 3.6 percent higher than in the period September through November 1992, and just 1.5 percent higher than in the June through August period.
The department's figures are adjusted for seasonal, holiday and trading-day differences but not for inflation, discounts or other price changes. Before adjustment, retail sales rose 2.6 percent in November after rising 3 percent in October, today's report showed.

HEADLINE: Victims of Drunken Driving Seek to Heighten Awareness

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
"What you see is the headlights, and you know it's predestined," said Marge Lee, of Franklin Square, L. I. At that moment -- 10:10 P.M. on a crystal-clear summer night in July 1990 -- she told her stepson, as he drove their Suzuki Samurai down Route 7 in New Jersey toward the Holland Tunnel, that it looked like the oncoming Mustang was straying across the double yellow line.
She had always worried about her stepson, Kenney, because he rode a motorcycle. "Typical neurotic mother, right?" she said yesterday at a news conference given by "survivors" of drunken drivers. But he died in a car. 
 It came as if it were in slow motion, she said, although the head-on impact was estimated later at 80 to 100 miles an hour. The dashboard disintegrated and her stepson was impaled on the steering wheel. There was a long silence, Ms. Lee recalled. Then Michael, 5, and Elizabeth, 3, started crying from the back seat. But she could do nothing, could barely call out to reassure them, because her left lung had collapsed.
He was 25, she said. So was the driver of the other car, who died leaving a wife and a 2-year-old child, she said. Ms. Lee, a member of the board of Long Island Mothers Against Drunk Driving, says she lives in fear that it could happen again.
 
Survivors' Stories
 Drunken driving kills all year, at a rate of about 18,000 people a year. At this time of year there are holiday parties with alcohol, raising the risk slightly, and giving public safety officials a reason to raise public awareness, which was the object of a news conference yesterday called a "Celebration of Life," at which survivors, with scars visible and invisible, told their stories.
If the recent past is any guide, over Christmas weekend about 20 people will die and about 2,700 will be injured in 11 New York counties and 7 in New Jersey, officials say, roughly a third of them in accidents involving alcohol. Separate statistics for southwestern Connecticut were not readily available from that state's Department of Transportation, but 130 people died in that state last year from drunken-driving accidents.
(Sobriety advocates, though, avoid the word "accident" in describing these deaths, since the drinking, they point out, was deliberate.)
Thomas M. Louizou, regional administrator for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said that there are 385,000 serious injuries each year caused by drunken or drugged driving, and $48 billion in economic losses.
The years have brought some progress. In 1992, there were 17,699 alcohol-related fatalities, representing 45 percent of all fatalities, down from 25,165 such fatalities 10 years earlier, when they comprised 57.3 percent of the total. The drop in fatalities is attributed to increased publicity, to raising the drinking age and to stricter enforcement of drunken-driving laws.
 
Hit on a Parking Lot
 But the toll is still high, cruel, and stunningly random.
For example, there was Melinda Banks, who was reaching for a glass bowl on top of her refrigerator on March 2, 1991, when the bowl broke and cut her forearm. She woke her husband Christopher, a 26-year-old motorman for the Transit Authority, and he drove her to Caledonia Hospital in Flatbush. While she was in a curtained enclosure for stitches, she heard someone in the emergency room declare a "code blue," for extreme emergency, and another patient was brought in.
When Ms. Banks had been bandaged and went into the waiting area, she was directed to a police officer, who handed her her husband's wallet. He had gone to the parking lot to check on the car, where he had been hit, and was the patient in the next cubicle; he died there.
"The drunk who hit him got out of the car and staggered," said Ms. Lee yesterday. "He didn't know what he had hit."
The driver who killed him, a 50-year-old man, had "two priors" for drunken driving, she said. He received five years' probation, and served weekends at Rikers Island for four months, she said.
The consensus among the victims is that the courts are not nearly strict enough. "It's the only crime that John Q. Public can relate to," Ms. Lee said. Jurors will sympathize with a drunken driver, she said, perhaps thinking to themselves, "oh, what about that time I went to a wedding and drank too much." In contrast, she said, if they are hearing a burglary case, they do not think to themselves, "what about that 7-Eleven I knocked over last week."
Another victim at the news conference yesterday illustrated the tenacity of the problem. Timothy Flynn has been using a wheelchair since he broke his neck in the spring of 1981, when he was home in Carmel, N.Y., on vacation from Kenyon College, in Gambier, Ohio, where he was a freshman. The drunken driver at fault was Mr. Flynn himself; he had consumed about half a bottle of Canadian Club, he said, and had gone with a friend to a local bar where he had a beer. On the way home he lost control of the family's Ford station wagon.
Eager to talk about the problem, Mr. Flynn extended a hand to shake but he does not have enough control over it to open it.
It was not his last drunken-driving accident, though; on his 30th birthday, a year and a half ago, he became intoxicated and crashed his Plymouth Reliant with special hand controls into the car in front of him. Finally he gave up drinking.
Mr. Flynn now works for the Manocherian Foundation, a traffic safety group established by Fraydun Manocherian, which helped sponsor the event yesterday, lobbying for stricter laws. Tough penalties would help, he said, but so would better enforcement of existing laws. "You can have the death penalty for drunk driving, and it's not going to do a thing, unless it's enforced," he said.

"You can have the death penalty for drunk driving, and it's not going to do a thing, unless it's enforced," said Timothy Flynn, who has been in a wheelchair since the first of two accidents he had while drunk.

HEADLINE: State Sales Of Old Guns Are Faulted

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 14

 BODY:
New York State agencies sold or traded more than 6,800 guns to licensed gun dealers over the last five years, at least one of which might have been used in the commission of a crime.
The gun sales were legal and were carried out in an attempt to reduce the cost of buying replacement weapons for state law-enforcement officials. But the transactions, which are detailed in a report released today by Republican Assembly members, are likely to fuel an emerging national debate over what law-enforcement agencies should do with their old guns as they upgrade to rapid-fire semiautomatic weapons. 
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has repeatedly called for tougher gun-control laws, including a ban on assault weapons. Some weapons that have been sold or traded by state agencies in recent years -- mostly semiautomatic rifles -- would be outlawed under Mr. Cuomo's proposal.
But aides to the Governor yesterday defended the gun trades as good fiscal policy during a time of tight budgets. During the five years studied in the report, the state saved $1.57 million through the trades.
 
Similar Trades Common
 Federal officials and gun control advocates said it was common for law-enforcement agencies around the country to trade old weapons for discounts on new ones. Though statistics are not available, state and local police departments in Michigan, California and Ohio have routinely engaged in such trades.
"It's a thoroughly counter-productive practice," said Jeff Muchnick, legislative director for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, a gun-control lobbying group in Washington. "It's an instance of how re-inventing government has gone awry."
Among the agencies now grappling with the problem is the New York City Police Department, the nation's largest, which is switching from .38-caliber service revolvers to 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistols, which can be fired more rapidly and hold more bullets.
In a recent television appearance, Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani said he would try to prevent police officers from selling their old guns on the open market as they upgrade to semiautomatics.
 
Officers Buy Own Guns
 But a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani said today that because New York City police officers purchased their own guns, unlike many state law-enforcement officers, it would be difficult to regulate how they dispose of their old weapons.
For New York State agencies, trading old weapons for new increased in the late 1980's as law-enforcement officials worried that they were being outgunned by criminals.
Among the state agencies that took part were the Division of Parks and Recreation, the Division of State Police, the Department of Taxation and Finance and the Division of Parole -- all of which employ law enforcement agents authorized to carry weapons.
The largest of the transactions occurred in 1990, when the State Police sold 4,553 guns to a federally licensed gun dealer in Billerica, Mass., called Interstate Arms Corporation, according to the report.
 
Savings on Glocks
 In exchange, the state police received 4,310 Glock 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistols. The deal saved the state $1.2 million, the report said.
The vast majority of the guns sold by the state were .38- and .357- caliber handguns. But state agencies also sold 702 semiautomatic pistols, 39 12-gauge shotguns and at least six semiautomatic rifles.
In a sampling of about 100 guns sold by the state, the Assembly Republicans found that at least one, a 9-millimeter handgun, has been traced by the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, indicating that it was used in a crime. The trace was requested by police in Detroit. Because the report did not contain the gun's serial number, it could not be determined why the trace was sought.
At the request of the Assembly Republicans, the A.T.F. is now checking all 6,807 guns sold by the state since 1989 to see if others have been used in crimes.
 
The State as Gun Dealer
 "This just isn't consistent policy," said Assemblyman John J. Faso, a Republican from Kinderhook, who helped write the report. "We shouldn't put the state in the position of being a gun dealer."
Richard H. Girgenti, the state's Director of Criminal Justice Services and Mr. Cuomo's top adviser on crime issues, said today that he would recommend that state agencies destroy their aging weapons in the future.
Mr. Cuomo's office did not return calls for reaction to Mr. Girgenti's recommendation. But his aides called the Assembly report a politically motivated effort to help Mr. Faso, who is running for state Comptroller next year.
The gun sales were not irresponsible, said Claudia V. Hutton, a spokeswoman for the state Budget Division.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD TRADE AGREEMENT;
A Realignment Made Reluctantly

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 14

 BODY:
For all its arcane murkiness, the trade agreement struck today has traced important contours of the post-cold war era. The negotiations that began seven years ago in moderate obscurity have ended as a pivotal political event, engaging heads of state in discussions about rice and placing the likes of Steven Spielberg and Mario Vargas Llosa in heated debate about cultural values.
Most fundamentally, this unlikely transformation reflects the collapse of the Iron Curtain. In a world no longer defined by military and ideological conflict, what counts for politicans are economic success and the creation of jobs. That is why President Clinton and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany have been as involved in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks as their predecessors were in negotiations to station new missiles in Western Europe. 
 For artists, the barricades are at a different place in a different ideological war, dividing those for and against a completely free market for their creations. That is why Hollywood and the Rive Gauche now talk GATT.
 
Beneath the Visions
 But if the GATT discussions were supposed to be about the end of conflict and the laying out of a commercial framework for a new world -- offering a vision of a planet without barriers enriched by freer trade and open to the invitations of an unfettered market -- they came instead to reveal something more akin to unease than to enthusiastic expectation.
Although failure was averted by an outline agreement today that will cut tariffs by about one-third and extend trade rules to a host of new areas including agriculture, what emerged from the 117-nation talks was a world suspicious of American economic and cultural domination and reluctant to accept an invitation to the global mall.
While, in the end, nobody was prepared to countenance a collapse of the talks -- tantamount to inviting political and economic dislocation within the Western alliance and the emergence of regional economic blocs in the Americas, Asia and Europe -- there was little evidence that nations felt sufficiently reassured by the demise of Communism to embrace a global economic opening that would transcend narrow self-interest and national traditions.
"The hope was that the GATT talks could be the centerpiece of a new era in which global institutions and opening would replace the old postwar alliances and provide a new sense of cohesion for the international system," said Robert D. Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "But there was resistance to that. If the global economy is a glue, it's a weak one."
 
Not Entirely Successful
 Thus, although agreement was reached to establish a new Multilateral Trade Organization to symbolize the world's common interest in orderly commerce, the effort to extend GATT rules to the more than $1 trillion in annual worldwide trade in services had limited success.
Shipping was set aside, and the opening of markets to financial services like banking and securities trading was effectively postponed to a later date. Most significant, the world's, and particularly America's, booming trade in movies, music and other entertainment became a subject not for agreement but for unresolved and vitriolic conflict between the United States and Europe.
"Services, intellectual property and investment should have been the core of this round, because they are the core issues in the real world," said Alan Stoga, the managing director of Kissinger Associates. "In the end, these issues were put on the agenda, but not much more than that."
Even the appearance on the agenda of the movie question -- part of the debate on trade in intellectual property -- was enough to provoke an extraordinary European outcry, rooted in but not confined to France. The target was Hollywood, portrayed as a marauder as mindless as the dinosaurs of "Jurassic Park," intent on devouring the vestiges of European culture.
It was "Dallas" versus Depardieu, culture as commerce versus culture as art -- and the result was an impasse hailed by Jack Lang, the former Culture Minister of France, as "a victory for art and artists over the commercialization of culture."
 
Presidential Reaction
 In Washington, President Clinton told reporters that he was disappointed that the audio-visual portions of the agreement remained unresolved, but that no one "thought it was worth bringing the whole thing down over."
But, at a deeper level, it was Europe against the most visible symbol of the spread of American culture and economic influence in a world that is no longer bipolar. And for several French intellectuals and writers, the conflict assumed global dimensions.
Did the world, by endorsing the free-trade principles of GATT, really want to demolish national identities in favor of a blanket American-dominated culture and so encourage the emergence, in angry reaction, of the likes of the Russian nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky?
"Should we really convert the planet into a supermarket in order to leave people with a choice between Coca-Cola and the local ayatollah?" the French philosopher and writer Regis Debray asked.
 
Baseball Caps and Dinosaurs
 That may sound like an extreme point of view -- and there has been much relentless caricaturing of the United States in Europe in recent weeks. But it has become clear that GATT does raise the delicate political question of how far national traditions and policies are prepared to cede to the economic globalization symbolized by universal baseball caps and universal screen dinosaurs.
For example, in opening its market to imported rice for the first time, Japan was taking more than a small trade step. Rice cultivation is central to Japan's religion, culture and folklore and the bar on imports symbolized its sacredness. Each spring, the Emperor plants the first seedling on the grounds of the Imperial Palace. But in the end, the Japanese Government decided that access to markets outweighed these considerations.
Europe, however, balked, preserving its quotas and subsidies that penalize American films and limit the prospects in Europe of fast-expanding American services like pay-per-view and cable television channels.
As a result, the GATT accord emerged as a two-headed beast. On the one hand, said John Lipsky, chief economist for Salomon Brothers, "This is far better than no agreement, an encouragement to economic growth and a vital statement that the world still believes in trade liberalization."
On the other hand, the limits of that liberalization have been shown. By standing up for what they see as their threatened culture, European governments effectively said no to globalization. They also insured that the GATT accord will fall significantly short of its target, and suggested to many economists that regional agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement may prove to be more of a model for the future than a much-vaunted, but somewhat hollow, multilateralism.

HEADLINE: U.S. Surpasses Japan on Chips

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Dec. 14

 BODY:
United States semiconductor makers surpassed their Japanese rivals in total sales in 1993 for the first time since 1985, according to Dataquest Inc., a leading market research firm.
American chip makers, led by the Intel Corporation, controlled 41.9 percent of the worldwide semiconductor market this year, up from 41.5 percent in 1992, according to preliminary figures released today by Dataquest. 
 Japanese companies, led by NEC, accounted for 41.4 percent of worldwide sales, down from 42.3 percent last year, Dataquest said.
Intel had 9.6 percent of worldwide sales, up from 9.4 percent last year, when it regained its position as the largest semiconductor producer in the world. NEC had 7.4 percent, Motorola 7.2 percent, Toshiba 6.9 percent and Hitachi 6.1 percent.
Texas Instruments sold 4.8 percent of the chips on the world market, followed by Samsung with 3.7 percent, Fujitsu 3.5 percent and Mitsubishi 3.4 percent.
Gene Norrett, vice president of Dataquest's semiconductor group, attributed the change to "a declining Japanese economy coupled with increased foreign competition in the Japanese semiconductor market" as well as booming Intel sales and penetration of the personal computer market.
Dataquest said that chip sales by the International Business Machines Corporation, estimated at $2.5 billion, were not factored into the survey so that valid year-to-year comparisons could be made. I.B.M. , which formerly produced only for itself, has aggressively entered the open chip market.

HEADLINE: Japan's Trade Surplus Dips; Long-Term Decline Is Seen

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus, which has been a political sore point worldwide, has peaked and is starting to decline, according to a growing number of economists.
The strongest evidence came today when the Government reported that the excess of exports over imports fell 2.2 percent in November from a year earlier to $7.4 billion, the first such decline in 35 months.
"This really confirms that the direction of the Japanese surplus basically has turned," Mineko Sasaki-Smith, senior economist in the Tokyo office of Morgan Stanley & Company, said. "The decline will continue." 
 Economists said that the sharp rise of the Japanese yen against the dollar, from about 123 to the dollar a year ago to about 108 now, was finally having an effect on the trade surplus. The yen's rise makes Japan's exports less competitive while making foreign products cheaper and more attractive to the Japanese.
But the surplus with the United States continues to grow, climbing 13 percent in November to $4.3 billion from $3.8 billion a year earlier. That is because the United States economy is recovering, pulling in more Japanese products, while Japan's economy remains mired in recession.
If Japan's economy starts to recover next year, analysts say, the nation will buy more imports, speeding the decline of the overall surplus and perhaps beginning to reduce its surplus with the United States.
However, some analysts have noted, Japan's surplus has grown in the long run despite a steady rise in the yen's value in the last two decades. The Plaza Accord in 1985, in which the United States and its allies agreed to reduce the strength of the dollar, led to a sharp jump in the yen's value, and the surplus declined for a couple of years. But it then rose to record levels as Japanese companies adjusted cost structures.
Japan's overall trade surplus, the largest of any nation in history, is expected to exceed $115 billion this year, compared with $106.6 billion in 1992, as measured by the Japanese Government on the so-called customs clearance basis.
Using the balance-of-payments method, which is preferred for international comparisons, the trade surplus is expected to top $140 billion this year compared with $132 billion in 1992. Geoffrey Barker, economist with Baring Securities in Tokyo, said he expects the figure to drop to $125 billion or less in 1994.
A decline in the surplus could lead to a weakening of the yen, since the yen's value has been propped up by the belief of currency traders that the United States favors a strong yen to bring down Japan's trade surplus.
A declining surplus could also take some pressure off Japan from its angry trading partners.
In discussing a new trade framework accord in July, the United States sought Japan's commitment to reduce its current account surplus, a broader measure of trade in goods and services, to less than 2 percent of economic output in three or four years from more than 3 percent now. Japan said it could not control its trade surplus by itself and thus could not set a target.
But now, Japan might achieve the goal anyway. Jesper Koll, an economist with S. G. Warburg Securities in Tokyo, estimated that Japan's current account surplus is likely to fall to 1.8 percent of gross national product by early 1995.
For much of this year, Japan's trade surplus has been declining in volume terms and when measured in yen. But when measured in dollars it has continued to rise because the dollar is worth less now than it was a year ago. Economists call this temporary rise in the dollar-denominated surplus the J-curve effect.
Now, however, exports are becoming weak enough and imports strong enough to show a decline in the surplus even when measured in dollars.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	Japanese Stocks Higher
 TOKYO, Wednesday, Dec. 15 (Reuters) -- Stock prices were higher here today. At the close, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up 180.42 points, or 1.04 percent, at 17,489.15. On Tuesday, the Nikkei fell 18.60 points.

HEADLINE: Fewer Are Insured For Medical Care

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
The number of people without health insurance reached 38.9 million last year, up 2.3 million from 1991, new Government data show. The increase was greater than in the two previous years combined.
The Employee Benefit Research Institute, which tabulated the data, said today that "a major reason for the 1992 increase in the number of uninsured is a decline in coverage among people working for small firms." 
 But it also reported that 19 percent of the uninsured -- 7.2 million people -- are in families headed by those who work for businesses with 1,000 or more employees.
 
Fuel for Debate
 The data show why there is a political clamor to overhaul the nation's health care system. They also suggest that the clamor will not abate until the number of uninsured people begins to decline. But the data do not necessarily support any specific proposal for extending health insurance.
President Clinton wants to require employers to provide coverage for their workers. His proposal has provoked vigorous protests from owners of small businesses. The rise in the number of uninsured does not necessarily increase the cost of Mr. Clinton's plan for the Government. But it probably does increase the number of employers who would, for the first time, have to contribute to the cost of coverage for employees.
From 1989 to 1992, the number of uninsured people increased by 4.2 million, the report says. More than half of the increase, or 2.3 million, occurred last year.
 
Higher Cost a Factor
 William S. Custer, research director of the institute, a nonpartisan research organization whose members include businesses and labor unions, said the rise in the number of uninsured probably reflected increases in unemployment in 1992 and increases in the cost of health insurance, which rises along with the cost of health care.
The civilian unemployment rate averaged 7.4 percent in 1992. That was higher than for any year since 1984. As for the rising cost of insurance, some small companies are reacting by dropping coverage, and some consumers say they cannot afford coverage on their own.
Hawaii and Connecticut had the highest rates of coverage, with less than 10 percent of residents under age 65 uninsured in each state. Residents of Southern states were more likely to be uninsured. In each of four states -- Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma and Nevada -- and in the District of Columbia, more than one-fourth of the residents were uninsured. In New York, 16 percent of those under 65 had no health insurance. The comparable figure was 15 percent in New Jersey.
The number of people without health insurance has been a source of fierce debate in the last year. Conservative members of Congress say the most commonly used estimate, 37 million, overstates the problem because it includes people changing jobs, people uninsured for just a few months and healthy young people who choose to go without insurance.
The data in the new report are drawn from interviews conducted in March by the Census Bureau with 57,000 households chosen to be representative of the entire population. If people answered accurately, the results mean that 38.9 million people did not have health insurance at any time in 1992. But in this year's survey, as in past years, researchers say that many people seem to have misunderstood the questions and to have described the insurance coverage they had at a particular point, rather than for the full 12-month period.
Mr. Custer, the research director of the institute, said the most cautious reading of the data suggests that, on any given day last year, 39 million people were uninsured.
In other words, he said: "A snapshot would show 39 million people without insurance at a given point in time. But some of those people will gain coverage, while others with insurance will lose coverage. Over the course of a year, as many as 53 million Americans may be without insurance for a month or more. But as few as 22 million people may be uninsured for the entire year."
"Our numbers show that the uninsured are not a homogeneous group," Mr. Custer said in an interview. "Some are between jobs. Some have fairly high incomes. But the chronically uninsured are low-income people who work or live in families with workers. They tend to be low-skilled workers employed by small firms."
The report shows that 177.5 million Americans had private health insurance last year, while 63.2 million had public health insurance through programs like Medicare and Medicaid. There is some overlap between the two groups because, for example, many elderly Medicare beneficiaries buy private coverage to fill gaps in the Federal program.
 
Three-Year Pattern
 In its report, made public today, the institute made these points:
*Over the last three years, there has been a gradual decline in the number of people with private health insurance and in the number getting coverage through employers.
*The probability of having health insurance rises with a person's earnings. Among those earning less than $10,000 a year, 50 percent lack coverage.
*Nationally, 17.4 percent of Americans under 65 were uninsured last year. In 1989, the comparable figure was 16.1 percent.
*The probability of having health insurance rises with the size of the company for which a person works. Among people in families headed by workers in small businesses with fewer than 10 employees, 39 percent get health insurance through employers. But in families headed by workers at large companies with 1,000 or more employees, 81 percent have such coverage.
In a separate action, three groups of doctors said today that employers should be required to provide health insurance for their employees. The groups, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Physicians, distinguished their position from that of the American Medical Association, which last week urged Congress to consider alternatives to such an employer mandate.
"The most certain way to achieve universal coverage is through an employer mandate," said Dr. J. Robert Graham, executive vice president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.
The three groups supporting employer mandates say they have a total of 200,000 doctors as members. The A.M.A. says it has 290,000 members.
Charles Leonard, a spokesman for the Health Care Reform Project, a coalition of 32 organizations seeking health insurance for all Americans, said: "The A.M.A. is not the sole voice of the nation's doctors. One-third of the physicians in America are represented by these other groups, which support an employer mandate."

HEADLINE: Real Estate Investment Trusts Face a Sour Market

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
The fortunes of two much-anticipated initial public offerings yielded more signs yesterday that the market for real estate investment trusts appears to be souring because of fears of rising interest rates and a glut of issues.
A $600 million offering from the DeBartolo Realty Corporation was postponed after the company announced that it would not lower the stock price to the level that investors seemed to be demanding. And an $840 million offering from the Simon Property Group Inc., the largest REIT in the nation's history, went through only after the company dropped its stock price.
 
A Blow to the Market
 Investor reaction to the two offerings was another blow to the REIT market, which has stumbled recently after soaring the last two years because of an influx of money from investors fleeing low rates of returns on bonds and bank accounts. Several other REIT offerings were also been postponed in recent weeks. 
 REIT's are a kind of mutual fund that buys real estate or mortgages, converts them into securities and passes on dividends to investors. They are generally considered a relatively risky equity, and some investors suffered enormous losses in the mid-1970's and late 1980's.
DeBartolo, based in Boardman, Ohio, and headed by the real estate entrepreneur Edward J. DeBartolo, had sought to raise capital to pay off huge debts incurred in part from buying shopping centers and other properties during the real estate boom of the 1980's.
The company had planned to sell 31.6 million shares at $18 to $19.25 each. The REIT would have controlled a 51 percent stake in DeBartolo Properties Partnership L.P., which owns 51 retail malls and seven strip shopping centers in 14 states.
"We gave notification on Sept. 14, and since that time, the REIT market as a whole has declined 15 to 20 percent," Marie Izzo Cartwright, a spokeswoman for DeBartolo, said. "Our decision today was based on the fact that we were not willing to continue with the offering at a discounted price."
Shares in Simon, based in Indianapolis, closed at $22.50 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday on volume of nearly 7.2 million shares, making it the most active issue on the Big Board.
But Simon had to cut its initial stock price to entice investors. In its preliminary prospectus filed on Nov. 8, the company announced that it would sell 36 million shares in the range of $23.75 to $26.25. On Monday night, it decided to sell 37.75 million shares at $22.25.
The Simon REIT is the largest offering since a $750 million deal by Rockefeller Center Properties in 1985. The Simon REIT controls a 52 percent stake in Simon Property Group L.P., which owns 54 malls, 53 shopping centers and three mixed-use properties in 28 states.
DeBartolo and Simon, which is headed by another major real estate executive, Melvin Simon, are the latest in a string of big real estate companies that have tried to dive into the REIT market in the last year.
Many of these companies turned to the investments because they had trouble obtaining money from banks and other traditional sources, which sharply reduced their real estate lending after suffering losses during the real estate slump in the late 1980's.
So far this year, 40 REIT's have raised a record $8 billion in initial public offerings, topping the previous record of $3 billion in 1987. Another $5.5 billion are on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission waiting to be sold.
But with a growing number of real estate companies considering REIT's, the market has become bloated, according to some analysts. And anxiety about rising interest rates has further driven away investors.
Among the REIT's that have been postponed or canceled in recent months are Glimcher Realty Trust, Macerich Company, Prime Retail and Mid-America Apartment Communities.
 
 
Offering Termed a Victory
 Martin J. Cicco, a managing director at Merrill Lynch, the lead Simon underwriter, contended that even though Simon had to drop its initial price, it was still a victory to issue so much stock in such a climate. And he pointed out that the stock price did not fall yesterday.
"The market is not being friendly now to these issuers, which is why DeBartolo was pulled," said Mike Kirby, a principal at Green Street Advisors, a research firm in Newport Beach, Calif.
DeBartolo executives "looked at Simon, and they said, 'Even though we are hard-pressed here, even though we have bankers holding a gun to our heads, it is just foolish for us to sell these assets at this price,' " Mr. Kirby said. He added, "So they are going to explore the private market."

HEADLINE: U.S. Aide to Seek New Policy on Fleeing Haitians

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Dec. 14

 BODY:
With human rights abuses increasing and the number of people leaving Haiti on the rise, the United States should review its policy of forcibly returning all Haitian boat people, the Administration's top human rights official said today.
At the end of a 24-hour trip to Haiti, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, John Shattuck, said he would return to Washington and advise that the policy be re-evaluated. 
 "I'm going back with a view that a policy review is necessary," Mr. Shattuck told reporters at a news conference shortly before leaving Haiti.
Mr. Shattuck did not say what the alternatives might be but said a fact-finding mission would precede any changes.
The announcement came on the same day that the United States returned 110 boat people, the third boatload to be sent back to Port-au-Prince in a week. The recent increase in the number of boats picked up heading for Florida has prompted fears that a mass exodus may be imminent, similar to the one that came after the overthrow of the country's President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The forced repatriation order of May 1992 stemmed the tide of flimsy, overloaded boats but American officials fear increased repression, especially in the provinces, may force more and more Haitians to take to the seas. Almost 40,000 Haitians have attempted the trip since the September 1991 coup.
Haitians' discontent with the current political climate has also been illustrated by the huge jump in the numbers seeking asylum at refugee-processing offices.
Mr. Shattuck said the deteriorating situation may cause the United States to seek a broader means for assuring that those with legitimate claims for asylum receive consideration.
A relatively low percentage are accepted under the present program and officials say many of those applying do so for economic, not political reasons. Applications have more than tripled in recent weeks, with many applicants blaming a stepped-up campaign of violence by the army.
Reports of repression surged at the end of October as the military and its civilian allies used all means to block the scheduled return of Father Aristide. Under an accord negotiated at the United Nations, Father Aristide had been scheduled to reassume the presidency on Oct. 30, but the plan was aborted after the army leader, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, failed to honor his promise to resign.
Father Aristide, a leftist priest elected with more than two-thirds of the vote, is living in exile in Washington.
Necker Dessables, head of the Roman Catholic church's human rights organization, Justice and Peace, said that if the military does not yield "people will continue to try to leave to save their lives," adding "most people are leaving because of the repression."

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Haiti's Rulers Get New Warning
 PARIS, Dec. 14 (Special to The New York Times) -- The United States, France, Canada and Venezuela warned Haiti's military rulers today that they would face tougher United Nations sanctions unless they restored democracy and permitted the return of the country's ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
The four governments, which comprise the so-called "Friends of the Secretary General" group on Haiti at the United Nations, said the new measures could include imposition of a universal and mandatory trade embargo as well as a ban on noncommercial flights in and out of the country.
After a two-day meeting here, they also announced the dispatch of a high-level mission, including military officers, to Haiti "to transmit this message of resolute determination to the Haitian military authorities." But the four did not say when the additional sanctions could go into effect.
Western diplomats said the idea of banning noncommercial flights in and out of Haiti was to make it more difficult for international drug traffickers to use the country as a refueling stop for small aircraft heading from South America to the United States.

HEADLINE: Picking a Class of '98: The Early Returns Are In

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
After an 11-day struggle that started on Dec. 3, the admissions team at Brown University began assembling the class of 1998, selecting the first members from among the 1,975 high school seniors who applied last month for early-decision admission.
Today, Brown, like many universities across the country, is mailing out its acceptances, deferrals and rejections to these applicants. Of them, 535, or 25 percent, have been accepted, 15 percent rejected and 60 percent held over for consideration in the spring, when they will have to compete with 20,000 other applicants for the remaining 2,000 acceptance spots. About half will go elsewhere, leaving an entering class of about 1,350. 
 The admissions committee opened the process to a reporter on the condition that the applicants' names not be used, though their qualifications could be described. Among them were these four:
*A young woman from Westchester County who had Scholastic Assessment Tests scores of over 1,400 but who had so-so recommendations from her teachers and wrote a personal essay considered prosaic.
*A four-time class president from North Carolina whose test scores were low for Brown.
*The son of two Brown alumni from a wealthy suburb of Albany. He had respectable, but not outstanding, test scores.
*A young woman from Queens with brilliant test scores. Final action on her application was delayed by the dean of admission because of her personal essay.
Like many universities, Brown offers the early-decision option to high school seniors who apply by early November and who say they are sure of their first choice of college. For these students, the institutions agree to act on their applications by Dec. 15, leaving students a couple of weeks to meet the Jan. 1 deadline for regular admission elsewhere. Brown, like Harvard, Yale and Princeton, does not make early acceptance binding.
For the universities, the early-decision option creates an opportunity to cement their relationship with superior students in a highly competitive market. For the students, the option may provide a better chance to receive financial aid when the coffers are relatively full. Brown's total cost, on a par with the other Ivy League universities, is $24,618 a year. More than half pay the full amount; the average scholarship is $11,500.
In recent years, Brown, like many other elite colleges, has dropped its long-standing policy of considering applicants for admission without regard to their ability to pay. Previously, if an applicant had been accepted the means would always be found to meet the student's financial need.
Because of difficult economic times and, in the case of Brown, the fact that its endowment of $643 million remains the lowest of any Ivy League institution, the need-blind admission policy could not be sustained.
 
Scramble for Money
 Dean Eric Widmer, the college's admissions officer, said last week that the scramble for money mainly takes place in the spring, after the annual financial aid budget of $24 million had been dipped into repeatedly. Students who apply for early-decision admission do not face such a scramble. "It's only in the last few cases," Dean Widmer said, "that an applicant's need for scholarship assistance may work to his or her disadvantage."
In fairness, experts in higher education point out that many other institutions are less forthright about this matter than Brown. In addition, some colleges practice what is called admit-deny, in which the applicant is admitted but the request for financial aid is denied.
The work of Brown's admissions staff got under way on Dec. 3, when Dean Widmer, 53, who has been dean of admission and financial aid since 1988, summoned 10 admissions officers to the ornate committee room of the 19th-century mansion where the admissions office is housed.
In front of each officer was a three-inch stack of computer print-outs that listed each of the 1,975 candidates for early-decision admission to the Providence, R.I., campus and a quantity of coded information about them. M40 signified Asian-American, for example; M11 meant African descent, and L indicated a "legacy," meaning that a parent, aunt, uncle or cousin attended Brown. These notations are all pluses in an application. Thirty percent of Brown's students are from minorities, and the school is committed to sustaining that percentage.
Only rarely had applicants been interviewed. Decisions were based on S.A.T. scores, grade point average, class rank, recommendations from teachers, a hand-written essay on "who you are and how you think" and anything else that would disclose, in Dean Widmer's words, "the sentient human being behind the application."
Each admission officer made a recommendation about candidates from the geographical areas for which the officer was responsible, spelling out the pros and cons of each applicant, and, except in the most obvious cases, the officer, or presenter, was questioned sharply. Sometimes spirited debate followed with remarks such as these:
"Her teachers say she's an intellectual powerhouse."
"He retains information, but has no creativity."
"Academically, he can't cut it."
Dean Widmer gave his associates their head, only occasionally steering the discussion with low-key remarks like "I'm waiting to be inspired," or "I'm beginning to hear, 'Hold Over.' "
 
'She Can Even Juggle'
 The discussion of the application by the young woman from Westchester consumed half an hour. Her S.A.T. scores and grade point average are "out of sight," the presenter began. The presenter added: "She's a very successful student. She can even juggle, but when I look at her recommendations I say, 'Yuk!' "
Another officer concurred, "She has no real sense of engagement."
The discussion reversed course when one officer observed that the woman's application would have been stronger had she asked different teachers to write her recommendations. "Her guidance counselor," he said, "quotes a teacher who says her love of language is lyrical, and he himself says she's the brightest student he's ever worked with."
Someone else said, "Here's a case where we have to dig deeper into the application to find out what's really there."
Finally, Dean Widmer said: "She seems to have the intelligence to succeed. The chair proposes A," meaning accept.
She was in.
When the class president's turn came, the presenter explained his low verbal test scores. "His parents run a restaurant, and they speak Korean at home," she said. "But he's been elected class president every year. I like him."
The discussion seesawed until Dean Widmer supported the presenter. "It's tough for us to get kids out of North Carolina," he said. "Duke is there. Sure, we're doing something for the candidate, but also for ourselves and our future in that part of the country."
Another "A."
 
Fighting Back Tears
 "I can't make much of an argument for this kid," began the officer who presented the alumni's son. "Grades and tests are nice and solid, and both parents went here, but there's nothing special."
"Looks mediocre," said another.
"He's not in any way a unique personality," somebody else said.
"This is hard," said the presenter. "But let's hold over. He'll be around in the spring if we want him then."
When the young woman from Queens was presented, it was immediately clear that she would be accepted. Her tests scores, grade point average and recommendations were dazzling. What delayed action was Dean Widmer's desire to have all of his colleagues read her essay.
When they did, at least one admissions officer was fighting back tears.
The woman, who is black, began her essay in a bold hand by saying that returning to her impoverished community as a doctor was her "most precious dream." Then last summer, she continued, she became frightened when she learned that her 45-year-old mother, who is burdened with the care of an autistic child, had become pregnant.
Two days before her 17th birthday, the woman wrote, she had overcome her fear and held her mother's hand as she helped her mother deliver the child.
As a result, she wrote, she came to understand that as a doctor she could be not only a life saver but "a life giver."
Slowly -- sometimes agonizingly -- the class of 1998 is taking shape.

HEADLINE: Head of Failing S.& L. Helped Clinton Pay a $50,000 Personal Debt in 1985

BYLINE: By JEFF GERTH with STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
The owner of a failing Arkansas savings and loan association raised money for Gov. Bill Clinton in 1985 to help relieve the Clinton family of a $50,000 personal debt that the Clintons would otherwise have had trouble repaying, newly discovered documents show.
The disclosure that the money covered a heavy private debt, rather than a less personally onerous campaign obligation, shows that the savings and loan executive, James McDougal, performed a more valuable favor for Mr. Clinton than has been previously known. 
 Federal investigators and Congressional officials are looking into the costly collapse of Mr. McDougal's savings and loan, and one aspect of the inquiries is whether his friendship with the Governor influenced the state regulatory treatment he received.
The Government took over the institution, Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of more than $60 million. That was five years after Federal regulators first found numerous violations at Madison and three years after they acted to remove Mr. McDougal.
Three months before Mr. McDougal helped Mr. Clinton cover his debt, the Governor had appointed as the new state regulator in charge of savings and loans a Little Rock lawyer who had previously represented Mr. McDougal's troubled institution.
Over the next 18 months, up to the point where Federal officials removed Mr. McDougal, the new regulator took no significant action against Madison, even as she was moving vigorously against another failing institution with similar problems.
Bruce Lindsey, a senior Presidential adviser chosen by the White House to respond to questions about Mr. McDougal, said today that the relationship between the Clintons and the savings and loan owner had been entirely proper.
But Mr. Lindsey said he was unable to answer specific questions about the $50,000 debt or its repayment. As for the appointment of the regulator, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, he said, "The President felt she was a respected securities attorney and turned out to be a respected securities commissioner."
 
$50,000 Loan From Aide's Bank
 A Federal investigation uncovered evidence some time ago that Mr. McDougal had diverted money from his institution to help repay debts left over from Mr. Clinton's 1984 re-election campaign.
But the newly discovered documents, and interviews with onetime political aides to Mr. Clinton, show for the first time that the campaign's only debt was to Mr. Clinton, who had contributed $50,000 to help finance his own candidacy. Mr. Clinton borrowed the money from the tiny Bank of Cherry Valley, which was owned and run by a senior aide to the Governor.
By borrowing the money and giving it to his campaign, Mr. Clinton was incurring a liability that his financial records suggest he barely could have met without help.
Just a few weeks after Mr. McDougal raised the money for him, Madison Guaranty won approval from Mrs. Schaffer, Mr. Clinton's new financial regulator, for a novel plan to sell stock. And Federal investigators have learned that Mrs. Schaffer previously served for a short time as one of Madison's lawyers.
In her legal work, the investigators say, she gained inside knowledge of some of Madison's wrongdoing. Yet when she became a regulator, she never told her subordinates that she had worked for Madison, present and former state officials say. And she continued to make decisions about the institution despite state ethics guidelines that, according to leading ethics experts in Arkansas and nationally, suggest she should have stepped aside.
Mrs. Schaffer, now a lawyer in Arkansas, denied in an interview that Madison had received preferential treatment and said her predecessor in the post had allowed Madison to pursue risky investments. She said Mr. Clinton had not intervened on behalf of Madison, adding of her own role: "I didn't try to protect anyone. And I didn't try to hurt anyone."
In an interview last year, Mr. McDougal said the appointment of Mrs. Schaffer and his role in retiring the campaign debt were part of a relationship in which he and Mr. Clinton had done favors for each other. Mrs. Schaffer was his preferred candidate for the post of regulator, he said.
By 1985, however, he had come to resent Mr. Clinton's requests for help on such matters as the campaign debt, Mr. McDougal said.
"I was beginning to feel I was getting used," he said. "I would have gotten Bassett anyways," he said of Mrs. Schaffer.
 
Rapid Growth, 'Willful' Violations
 Mr. McDougal's relationship with Mr. Clinton dates from the 1960's, when they met while working as aides to Senator J. W. Fulbright, Democrat of Arkansas.
Mr. McDougal later served for a year as Governor Clinton's economic development aide, then left government and in 1982 bought a savings and loan in Augusta, Ark., a sleepy rural town. The institution, Madison Guaranty, quickly got caught up in the go-go ethos of the early 1980's. Its growth was exponential, from assets of $3 million to more than $120 million by 1985.
Federal auditors took a dim view of Mr. McDougal's activities. A 1984 review found "unsafe and unsound lending practices" and concluded that "the viability of the institution is jeopardized."
Mr. McDougal promised to make amends, and state and Federal regulators eventually allowed him to go forward, provided he made adjustments to his books and obtained required state approval for several large real estate projects.
One of those was a project to sell land on a foggy Canadian island off the coast of Maine. In violation of Federal land law, Madison had sold scores of lots without making disclosure of risks to purchasers and had failed to register any such disclosure statement with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to state and Federal records and former Madison officials.
Madison's lawyers learned of these omissions in 1984. Mrs. Schaffer, then at the Little Rock firm of Mitchell, Williams, Selig, Jackson & Tucker, wrote a memo describing the failure to comply with land law as "willful," Federal officials say.
Madison registered with HUD in February 1985 and began providing buyers the federally required disclosure on the project's considerable risks. One year later, roughly half the buyers of Canadian lots had canceled their purchases, increasing Madison's losses and pushing it to the brink of insolvency, according to a 1986 Federal examination of the institution.
As Mr. McDougal faced questions from Federal regulators, Mr. Clinton was gearing up for his 1984 re-election campaign for governor. By the fall of 1984, he had raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the drive, and polls showed him comfortably ahead.
Still, in the final week Mr. Clinton put himself at significant personal financial risk to inject an additional $50,000 into the coffers. He and his wife, Hillary, applied for a loan from the Bank of Cherry Valley, a tiny institution in northeast Arkansas then run by W. Maurice Smith, who was also a senior aide to the Governor.
Mr. Smith said in an interview that the loan had been unsecured, meaning that the Clintons had not been required to pledge any collateral and would repay the loan on the basis of their joint income. According to the Clintons' tax returns, their combined income in 1984 and 1985 was about $100,000 a year.
Further, they had only modest personal assets. They did not own a home, and they had substantial debts. Records released by the Clinton Presidential campaign in 1992 show that in 1984, the couple owed more than $75,000 in bank loans stemming from their investment in Whitewater Development, an unsuccessful real estate company that they owned jointly with Mr. McDougal and his wife.
Asked whether he was aware of the Clintons' debts when he approved the loan, Mr. Smith said that "if it was in their financial statement" that they filed with the bank as a requirement for the loan, then "I knew about it."
 
A Spring Evening Worth $35,000
 In January 1985, Mr. Clinton named Mrs. Schaffer as head of the State Securities Department, the Arkansas agency that shared with Federal regulators the responsibility for overseeing state-chartered savings and loan associations.
Separately, his political aides began raising tens of thousands of dollars for his 1986 re-election bid. At the same time, according to Mr. McDougal and Betsey Wright, who had managed the 1984 campaign, Mr. Clinton asked Mr. McDougal to take care of the debt still left over from 1984.
"He asked me to knock out the deficit," Mr. McDougal recalled.
In the spring of 1985, Mr. McDougal held an early-evening fund-raising event at Madison's office in Little Rock, near the governor's mansion. There, he says, he delivered about $35,000 in checks to Ms. Wright.
The records reflecting the contributions from the fund-raiser are missing from campaign documents on file with the Pulaski County clerk in Little Rock. But among the documents that are on file there are those listing Mr. Clinton's $50,000 contribution to his own campaign.
Investigators reviewing Madison's records in the wake of its collapse found evidence that led them to suspect that some of the campaign donations assembled by Mr. McDougal had been improperly diverted from the savings and loan, Federal officials have said.
The investigators traced checks totaling $12,000 from Madison to the Clinton campaign's account at the Bank of Cherry Valley. Those checks were issued on April 4.
The day before, senior Madison officials met in Dallas with Federal regulators who wanted to know how the savings and loan intended to meet minimum requirements for capital. Madison said it planned to raise the money by selling stock, according to a Federal memo describing the meeting. The institution planned to issue preferred stock, the sale of which had rarely, if ever, been attempted by an Arkansas savings and loan.
The search for new capital took Madison to the offices of Mrs. Schaffer, who had the ultimate authority to approve any such stock sale. One of the lawyers employed by Madison to argue its case before the state regulators was Mrs. Clinton.
Within weeks, Mrs. Schaffer wrote a letter to Mrs. Clinton giving preliminary approval to Madison's stock plan.
The sale never went forward. But this fall the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency that disposes of failed savings and loans, asked the Justice Department to examine a number of Madison's transactions, and Federal officials say the state's approval of the stock plan was among the matters raised by investigators.
The R.T.C. noted that Mrs. Schaffer's approval of the stock sale had come in the face of her own, prior knowledge that Madison had failed to comply with Federal land-sale laws.
Mrs. Schaffer says that even in not stepping aside in matters involving Madison, she acted properly. Citing lawyer-client confidentiality, she declines to discuss what she learned when she represented Madison. Whatever she learned, she now says, did not seem important later, when she became a state regulator.
 
2 Institutions, 2 Approaches
 Mr. McDougal, who was acquitted of Federal bank fraud charges in 1990, maintains he did nothing wrong. He blames overzealous regulators for his problems.
But a blistering Federal report in 1986, three years before Madison was seized, found that records were missing or inaccurate, that the institution was probably insolvent and that millions of dollars had been improperly diverted to Mr. McDougal, his friends and his family.
State records show that from 1984 to 1986, as Madison hurtled toward collapse, Arkansas regulators imposed no special requirements on it. The state's only action against Madison was to concur when Federal regulators removed Mr. McDougal in the summer of 1986.
But Arkansas regulators were not hesitant to move against another failing institution.
Mrs. Schaffer said she had urged Federal regulators to shut down Guaranty Savings and Loan, a $450 million institution based in northern Arkansas that was closed in December 1985. She said the problems at Guaranty had been growth that was too rapid, bad loans outside of Arkansas and reliance on large deposits brokered by other financial institutions -- virtually the same problems that regulators found at Madison.
Mrs. Schaffer said she had moved against Madison as soon as legally possible, relying on her own staff and acting in conjunction with Federal regulators. Even looking back now, she said, "I don't see what I could have done differently."

HEADLINE: THE RUSSIAN VOTE;
RESULTS IN RUSSIA SHAKE WASHINGTON

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Despite their confident public comments, President Clinton and senior officials in his Administration were "startled and shaken," one of them conceded today, by the results of Sunday's parliamentary voting in Russia.
Several said that while it was not clear precisely how American policy would change toward Russia, the other former states of the Soviet Union and the former Soviet satellites, it was clear that the policy would have to be rethought. At a minimum, several officials said, Mr. Clinton will have to find some way to ease the exclusive identification of American policy in the region with the success of the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin. 
 "We don't want to look in any way as if we're dumping Yeltsin and moving toward the fascists," a State Department expert said, referring to the ultranationalists who ran surprisingly strongly on Sunday, "but we need to find some way to take account of them and to strengthen contacts with them."
 
Reform Program's Future
 In Moscow, a senior official accompanying Vice President Al Gore on his current trip in the area said that strong nationalist and Communist blocs in the new Russian Parliament could slow Mr. Yeltsin's reform program and force a change in American aid plans.
"If this result holds, it's very bad," the official commented.
Representative Lee H. Hamilton, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he viewed the ultranationalists with alarm but was not sure how strong they would be once a decisive result had emerged from the complex Russian electoral system.
He said Congress would continue to support substantial American aid for Russia as long as the general trend seemed to move in the direction of reform, even if there were setbacks. But on the other hand, he warned, "if Russia moves decisively or even modestly" in the nationalists' direction, "Congress will either be less supportive or just won't approve any aid."
Today's on-the-record comments by the Administration had a bit more bite than Monday's, although President Clinton continued to speak of "a protest vote" that was not very surprising, given the Russian people's "high level of anger because they've been through a lot of tough times."
 
Nationalist Assailed
 Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, delivered a scathing indictment of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the nationalist leader propelled by the elections into the center of Russian politics. Mr. Zhirinovsky's statements, the spokesman said, "embody views that are obviously completely an anathema to principles of democracy, to our own views on issues like human rights and the democratic process, economic reform and relations among sovereign states."
Among the many things that will be complicated by the nationalists' success will be the President's planned trip next month to a North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit conference in Brussels, to Prague, to Moscow and to Minsk, the capital of Belarus.
"I have talked to nobody about anything," he said today when asked to discuss the trip. "I have not had time to think about it."
James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress, who is one of the nation's leading students of Russia, said of Mr. Clinton's visit to Moscow:
"This is not going to be the victory celebration he had hoped for. We now have a very tough row to hoe there. Yeltsin and the reformers have behaved with staggering political ineptness, but they remain the real democrats in Russia, the people who have committed themselves to what we believe in. The danger now is that we might act in such a way as to insure what is now only a possibility, albeit a larger one than before -- the downfall of reform."
 
East Europeans Are Uneasy
 The President's stop in Brussels could be equally fraught. On the agenda for the meeting there is the question of enlarging NATO by admitting or promising eventually to admit Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics and Hungary. The United States and western Europe have resisted the idea, arguing that such an action might make the Russians feel dangerously isolated.
But the eastern European nations, who have been pressing the West to reconsider, are sure to press harder now, given the renewed specter of Russian nationalism to the east.
Andrzej Olechowski, the Polish Foreign Minister, who is on a visit to Washington, said in an interview today that he thought Mr. Yeltsin would find it necessary to "find some accommodation with the nationalists and speak more about Russia's role in the world -- about Russia's sphere of influence."
"We were concerned until now," he said. "Now we are worried."
Some analysts of the region think that the United States now runs the danger of letting Moscow's fears deform its policies in the rest of the area.
"At a certain point, enough's enough," said Robert Zoellick, a key figure in the State Department in the Bush Administration. "We need a more unified approach, because we shouldn't allow Russia to dominate the attitude of the United States to central and eastern Europe. Sooner or later, if we do, we will be accused of another Yalta sellout and all of that."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD TRADE AGREEMENT: The Overview;
U.S. AND EUROPE CLEAR THE WAY FOR A WORLD ACCORD ON TRADE, SETTING ASIDE MAJOR DISPUTES

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 14

 BODY:
The United States and Europe agreed to put aside major trade disputes today, clearing the way for a world trade accord covering more industries in more countries than any other trade agreement in history.
Though the negotiations involved 117 countries, the major sticking points lay between the United States and the European Community, principally over agricultural issues and greater access for American films and television programs in Europe. Seven years of talks had resolved some of them, notably some of the farm-subsidy disputes. 
 But in the end, the two sides were compelled to agree to disagree over some of the thorniest issues: movies, television and music; civil aircraft, and shipping and financial services like banking and stock brokerage.
 
Less Than Hoped For
 Therefore, while the overall pact includes some industries that have never before been covered in a world trade agreement, the accord is smaller in scope than intended and may bear the seeds of future trade wars.
The agreement would reduce tariffs by a third, on average, over six years, and bring industries like accounting and farming into the purview of global trade agreements for the first time. Worldwide, tariffs on manufactured goods average only about 5 percent, but they add up to billions of dollars a year.
As the first world trade accord since 1979, it is expected to provide a quick boost to investment and business activity through much of the world by opening markets for goods and services and encouraging countries to specialize in producing whatever they can make most efficiently and exporting those products.
 
Clinton Is Guardedly Optimistic
 President Clinton hailed the pact today.
"The stakes are immense," the President said. "This would be the single largest trade agreement ever. It writes new rules of the road for world trade well into the next century."
Although Mr. Clinton cautioned that "thorny issues remain," he said the United States was "on the verge of a historic victory."
At the end, the thorniest issues involved cultural trade and access between the United States and Europe, and today, the American film industry expressed heavy reservations that its needs had been deferred.
But the President's deputy national security adviser, Samuel I. Berger, said the agreement signaled Mr. Clinton's success in elevating "national economics to the top echelon of American foreign policy, to put international economics on the front burner of American foreign policy."
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the United States would probably gain $100 billion to $200 billion a year in new output as a result of the agreement.
Carla A. Hills, who as President George Bush's trade representative had sought a much broader package, said tonight that the Clinton Administration might have done the right thing by accepting what could be agreed upon and postponing the rest.
"I believe that you have to compare what was achieved with the status quo," she said.
As with the North American Free Trade Agreement, the GATT accord must be approved by Congress, but American officials won many changes during the final days of the talks to address concerns on Capitol Hill. Mr. Clinton is expected to notify the House and the Senate on Wednesday that the United States will sign the accord on April 15.
Senator Max S. Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who heads the Senate Finance subcommittee on trade, said today that while the pact would face some criticism in Congress, "I believe the agreement will ultimately be approved."
 
U.S. Industry Not Delighted
 But the American movie and television industries responded angrily to the Europeans' refusal to budge on their limits and fees on American-made programming.
"I am disturbed by the refusal of the European Community to negotiate seriously," said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America. He called the European stance "blatant protectionism."
Still, he praised the American decision to pull the issue out of the pact entirely, which preserves the Administration's right to take retaliatory measures, like raising tariffs on European wine or other goods.
A few details of the agreement remain to be worked out over the coming months, but Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, told reporters here today that he did not consider any of them significant. Among these are specific tariff cuts, rules for the occasional copying of patents and copyrights without permission from the owner, and the extent to which developing countries must open fabric and clothing markets in exchange for similar openings by richer nations.
The pact would modify the existing General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has regulated most of the world's trade since 1948. This round of negotiations, begun in 1986 in Uruguay, is scheduled to end officially Wednesday about 5 P.M., but trade officials here said that Peter Sutherland, the Director General of GATT, might be forced to delay the final gavel for hours because of dissatisfaction among developing countries that they were not offered more concessions by the industrial nations.
 
Disparity With Poorer Nations
 One example of this disparity is that the United States and the European Community agreed to reduce their tariffs with each other by half, but agreed to cut their average tariffs on goods from the rest of the world by less than one-third.
It is conceivable that objections from developing countries might delay the conclusion of the talks, but that is considered unlikely and is not expected to affect the overall agreement.
The agreement is tentatively scheduled to take effect on July 1, 1995, allowing the 117 GATT nations a year and a half to approve it.
There is no minimum number of those 117 nations required for approval, and the pact goes into effect among all who sign it. The way out for those who wish a way out is by withdrawing their signatures, presumably because of legislative rejection in some cases.
 
Worldwide Approval Process
 In the meantime, subsidiary trade talks will continue for as long as a year as lawyers work out the precise legal language of the last-minute deals. Each country will also be formally committing itself to making specific changes in each of tens of thousands of categories of internationally traded goods.
Although the French had expressed concern that a further influx of American movies and television shows would overwhelm European national cultures, Mr. Valenti called this issue irrelevant. "The negotiation has nothing to do with culture unless European soap operas and game shows are the equivalent of Moliere," he said. "This is all about the hard business of money."
Privately, some international financial experts in Hollywood said Mr. Valenti had overstated the case. They said the agreement would not prove especially damaging because American films and television shows are so popular in Europe, and the use of tariffs and other taxes and levies to protect and promote local markets is common procedure.
But Glenn J. Gumpel, executive director of the Directors Guild of America, which represents more than 10,000 directors, said in a telephone interview from Geneva: "The results were exceedingly frustrating, disappointing. The Europeans led by the French had no bona fide intention of actually negotiating an agreement to cover the audio-visual issue within the GATT, other than in the most minimal terms. I don't think they ever came to the bargaining table."
Mr. Gumpel said there was no displeasure at all with President Clinton or Mr. Kantor, his trade representative. "Obviously, this was not a negotiation over one single issue or one single industry," he said. "No one on our side believed we should ask the President or Mickey Kantor to walk away from the GATT negotiations at this point after America has achieved what it reported in other areas and other industries."
Under legislation passed last summer, if President Clinton notifies Congress by Wednesday that he intends to sign the agreement, the House and Senate must vote yes or no, with no amendments allowed.
The April 15 signing ceremony is planned to be held in Marrakesh, Morocco.
Each country signing the agreement must lower its average tariff, which is a tax on imports, by a third for manufactured goods. Also, farm trade is included in a world trade agreement for the first time. The increases in government assistance to farmers that have drained national treasuries will be reversed. Subsidies for food exports will drop fastest, over a six-year period, beginning when the pact takes effect in 1995. Subsidies for domestic programs, like crop price supports, will also be reduced.
Tonnage limits on food imports, such as the very low United States quota for imported peanuts, which works out to half a dozen peanuts for each American each year, will be replaced with less restrictive tariffs on peanuts that would open the door a bit to imports.
Copyrights, patents and trademarks will all receive new international protection, as will cross-border investments. Preferential government purchasing practices, including some Federal, state and local "Buy America" rules, will be banned. A new international agency, the Multilateral Trade Organization, will replace the GATT Secretariat in reviewing violations of free trade rules and will have greater powers than the Secretariat to authorize international trade penalties, like higher tariffs, on countries that break the rules.
 
Extension to Services
 The pact will also take steps toward extending GATT rules to cover services, but these steps will be much more modest than anything envisioned when the current round of trade talks began in 1986.
The Uruguay Round's Final Act, as the pact is officially called, sets forth many principles calling for countries to write laws, regulations and licensing procedures that treat service companies of other nations the same as domestic ones. But countries have made only very modest commitments to change their rules to reflect these principles.
Mr. Kantor and Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community's top trade official, agreed this morning that they would make no commitments whatsoever concerning movies, television programs and music recordings. The stickiest issues in the final days of talks had been the community's refusal to share the proceeds of levies on blank videocassettes and tapes, and its refusal to clarify limits on the broadcast of foreign films and television programs.
Sir Leon said at a news conference in Geneva that the community had been willing to discuss sharing the taxes that are collected in Europe on the sale of blank tapes, which are used by consumers to copy domestic and foreign entertainment without payment of royalties. But Mr. Kantor described Sir Leon's offer as inadequate because it set no time limit for these talks.

Chart: "The Shape of the Accord"
 
The Overview
Negotiators from the United States and 115 other nations agreed yesterday to reduce tariffs and rewrite the free trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the organization that has governed most international trade for 45 years.
The negotiations, the eighth round of talks to broaden the original postwar agreement, began seven years ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay, and became known as the Uruguay Round. One of its main goals was to expand GATT rules to cover trade in agriculture issues, and after years of dispute, the negotiators succeeded in reaching an agreement to phase down government subsidies and other market distortions and barriers in farm trade. The other goal was to expand rules to cover insurance, banking and other financial services, but here negotiators accomplished relatively little.
In order to conclude the talks, negotiators for the United States and the European Community, after battling intensively on cultural issues for a week or more, agreed yesterday to disagree on greater access to Europe for American movies, television and music, and on cutting European subsidies for commercial aircraft.
President Clinton is expected to notify the House and the Senate today that the United States will sign the world trade pact on April 15. By meeting the deadline, set by Congress last summer, the President retains "fast track authority -- the House and the Senate must decide on the GATT agreement by simple yes-or-no votes, without amendments.
The pact is tentatively scheduled to take effect on July 1, 1995.
 
What Is At Stake Stays The Same
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based consortium of 24 of the more prosperous nations, estimates that a successful completion of the trade talks would mean about $270 billion more in annual trade by the year 2002. The extra economic output would come from the more efficient use of labor, capital and other resources.
 Some American economists, industry groups and labor unions say that the proposed accord will channel most of the benefits to other countries, at least in the short run, and some economists question whether the overall gains have been overstated.
 But most economists believe that over the course of years, free trade allows each country to specialize in products that it can make most efficiently, trading them for products made more effeciently elsewhere.
 
The Basics
 
Tariffs
The 117 nations have agreed to reduce their tariffs by an average of one-third. The United States and the European Community will reach this average by cutting their tariffs on each other's goods in half, while cutting tariffs on goods from the rest of the world by much less. In addition, agricultural tariffs will be reduced by 36 percent in industrial nations and 24 percent in developing nations. Agricultural tariffs vary widely because they are often charged by the penny per kilogram or liter, rather than as a percentage of the product's value.
 
Quotas
These are limits on the quantity of imports, like American limits on the number of tons of imported peanuts. Previous talks have eliminated most manufacturing quotas except for textiles and finished apparel. The Urugay Round would eliminate this exception and also require countries to replace their extensive quotas or bans on farm imports with tariffs that provide comparable protection. Quotas are pervasive in international farm trade, and the United States imposes them on dairy products, peanuts and sugar. Some of the new tariffs could start as high as several hundred percent, and would gradually be reduced.
 
Intellectual Property
The agreement, as it now stands, requires that all countries, including developing ones, protect patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks. For years, pirated computer programs, record albums, videocassettes and prescription drugs have been available in developing countries.
 
A New Trade Organization
The current text would create an institution in Geneva to enforce GATT's free trade rules. The new institution would be much more powerful than the GATT Secretariat is now, having the power to assess trade penalties against countries by a vote of two-thirds or three-quarters of the nations. The Secretariat can act only when the members unanimously vote to do so - something that is rare.
 
Investment
The proposed text would ban the widespread practice of requiring high local content in some products like cars and of requiring factories to export as much as they import. The aim of that practice is to preserve local jobs and discourage imports. The proposed agreement would limit the ability of countries to favor domestically owned factories at the expense of foreign-owned ones.
 
Anti-dumping
American law bans foreign companies from selling goods here for less than they are sold in any other country, or for less than they cost to produce, a practice known as dumping. At the request of American companies, which must prove to the Government that dumping exists and has caused them financial harm, the Commerce Department and International Trade Commission periodically impose steep anti-dumping tariffs on imports. Until Sunday, the new pact would have barred many cases and reduced the tariffs in other cases. Changes made on Sunday at the United States' urging mean that cases will still be filled but the tariffs may be slightly smaller than before.
 
Health and Safety
The agreement bars countries from administering health and safety standards in ways that restrict trade and have no scientific basis. For example, a country that raised cattle without hormones could not use health grounds to ban imports of beef with hormones unless it could prove that the hormones were unsafe for human consumption.
 
Safeguards
Countries may temporarily raise tariffs or other import barriers an import surge causes rapid, severe damage to domestic producers. If a country keeps these temporary barriers in place for more than three years than countries losing sales have the right to impose retaliatory trade barriers.
 
MAJOR INDUSTRIES AFFECTED BY THE TALKS
 
Agriculture: The big dispute holding up the talks for the last three years has been a quarrel between the United States and the European Community over farm subsidies. Last year, the Untied States and the Europeans agreed to reduce the tonnage of subsidezed grain exports by 21 percent, and to limit other farm subsidies. But France, Europe's biggest agricultural exporter, wanted the subsidy deal renegotiated. Last week, in negotiations in Brussels, the United States tentatively agreed to allow the Europeans to subsidize more grain exports over the next six years than previously planned. In exchange, the Europeans tentatively agreed to convert some of their quotas on farm imports into low tariffs, as Washington demands.
 
Automobiles: Over the years, the United States and the European Community have each force Japan to accept limits on its auto exports. The current agreement text would virtually ban these restrictions. Each country would only be allowed one such export limit on any foreign industry, and Detroit car makers worry that they might not get the exemption.
 
Textiles and Apparel: The current text would phase out more prosperous nations' quotas on clothing imports over a 10-year period. The quotas would then be replaced by less restrictive tariffs. But only poor countries that reduced their own quotas on Western fabric and clothing imports would be allowed to take advantage of the phase-out.
 
MAJOR INDUSTRIES NOT AFFECTED BY THE TALKS
 
Aircraft: The United States and the European Community agreed today to continue talking for a year about how to limit government subsidies to civil aircraft makers. Meanwhile, a 1992 deal stays in effect that requires the European aviation consortium Airbus Industrie to reapy many European subsidies and limits indirect American subsidies in military contracts.
 
Audio-Visual. The United States and the European Community agreed today that while the final text of the trade accord contains broad principles espousing free trade in movies, TV programs and music recordings, neither side will put these principles into effect. Because the United States still objects to the Europeans' restrictions on the broadcast of American movies and television programs, further trade confrontations on this issue are likely.
 
Financial Services Companies. This covers commercial and investment banks, insurance and leasing companies, traveler's-check issuers and mortgage brokers. The pact sets forth broad principles calling for these companies to be allowed to do business around the world, but few nations are expected to put the principles into effect.
The United States currently limits the activities of many foreign financial services companies because their home countries do not give American companies access to their markets. The United States has agreed to accept license applications from any foreign financial services company for the first six months after the pact takes effect in mid-1995, but will dismiss these applications if their home countries do not open their financial markets during that time.
 
Shipping. The pact contains broad free trade principles, but the United States and the European Community have agreed to exempt all their current shipping-trade restrictions from these principles.
 
Steel. The United States and the Europeans agreed last week that they would keep talking next year about limiting European subsidies to steel makers.
 
Telecommunications. The United States and the European Community have agreed to continue talking about allowing telecommunications companies to offer long-distance telephone service and other services anywhere. Most European nations still have a giant telephone company like the old Bell System. (pg. D18)

HEADLINE: THE RUSSIAN VOTE;
Russian Nationalist Leader Offers To Cooperate in New Government

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 14

 BODY:
While Russia continued its painfully slow counting of votes from Sunday's election, its biggest vote-getter, the acerbic nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, offered today to play a responsible part in any new government.
Appearing at a news conference in a black tuxedo, Mr. Zhirinovsky, who appears to have won nearly a quarter of the vote from a population angry with the price of change, was by turns reasonable and bombastic, promising to do nothing to destabilize the Government while he waits for a presidential election to be called.
 
Willing to Wait
 Even if President Boris N. Yeltsin completes his five-year term in June 1996, Mr. Zhirinovsky said, "then my election to that post would be a nice present for my 50th birthday." 
 His jauntiness was not shared by the reformist parties, which continued their angry hand-wringing and mutual accusations about who was to blame for the showing of Mr. Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic Party, which favors a restored Russian empire, an end to Western-style economic reform and a harsh crackdown on crime.
Moskovsky Komsomolets, a liberal daily, had a banner headline that read: "Russia! Think About It! You Must Be Stupefied!" Vitaly Tretyakov, the editor of the independent Nezavisimaya Gazeta, urged the Government and Mr. Yeltsin "to try to assess the situation soberly" and "admit your mistakes."
Nor were Russia's neighbors any happier, with officials of the three formerly Soviet Baltic nations planning to meet on Wednesday to discuss Mr. Zhirinovsky's success and President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine saying he was alarmed, especially at any prospect that Mr. Zhirinovsky's imperial reach could become state policy.
 
Parallel to Czarists Drawn
 "So many people voted for the Czarist empire," Mr. Kravchuk said today in Kiev. "We are talking here about revanchism."
[Despite confident public comments, President Clinton and senior officials in his Administration were "startled and shaken," one of them conceded, by the results of the parliamentary voting. Several said it was clear that American policy would have to be rethought. Page A18.]
Even though two days have passed since the election, it is still not possible to predict with certainty the power balance that will emerge in the new Parliament. No single party will have a majority, but if the Zhirinovsky nationalists unite with the Communists in a so-called brown-red coalition, they could command as much as 45 percent of the lower house, within striking distance of a working majority. That would be unsettling to the Western nations backing the new Russia.
It is also possible to conceive of coalitions in which the pro-Western, reform-minded parties might combine with centrists to control the new Parliament. In any event, the new legislature seems likely to be just as contentious as the old one that Mr. Yeltsin abolished, although this time it will lack the authority to block the President that the old one had.
In preliminary results from 68 of Russia's 89 regions, Mr. Zhirinovsky has won 24 percent of the party preference votes for the lower house of Parliament. These votes will be the basis for apportioning half of the lower house's 450 seats, with the rest filled by candidates elected from districts, as is the entire upper house.
 
Minimum Vote Needed for Seats
 If parties do not gain more than 5 percent of the national vote, they cannot win party-list seats and their seats are distributed among the other parties. So Mr. Zhirinovsky's 24 percent, if it holds up, would translate into about 67 seats, or 30 percent of the 225 seats at stake.
Second was the pro-Government Russia's Choice, led by First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, with 13.66 percent of the votes and an estimated 38 party-list seats.
The revived Communist Party led by Gennadi A. Zyuganov was third with 11.65 percent, or about 31 seats, and their ideological ally, the Agrarian Party, came next with 9.59 percent, or about 29 seats.
The reformist parties appear to have done better in the district seats, which are being filled mostly by well-known local officials, who may dislike the reform but also dislike the radicals.
Still, a Yeltsin aide predicted that the reformists in the lower house would be outnumbered by the followers of Mr. Zhirinovsky, the Communists and the Agrarians, making the unpredictable centrists key players.
"Zhirinovsky is the bete noire du jour," a senior Western diplomat said. "But I wouldn't be surprised if the Communists and Agrarians together ended up with more seats than Zhirinovsky. Once the single seats are counted, the big concern will be a red-brown coalition."
 
Willing to Join a Coalition
 Mr. Zhirinovsky said today that he would work with anyone, either within the Government or outside it. "Let Yeltsin form any government he wants," Mr. Zhirinovsky said. "For the salvation of Russia, we are prepared to cooperate with Russia's Choice, with Communists, with anybody."
He did say that he would prefer a government without three top Yeltsin deputies: Mr. Gaidar, Privatization Minister Anatoly B. Chubais and Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev.
Mr. Gaidar again ruled out any deal with Mr. Zhirinovsky and urged a deepening of economic reform, but Mr. Zyuganov, the Communist leader, suggested that a deal with the Liberal Democrats might be possible if they dropped "everything connected to restoring the Russian empire," which he called "not serious or constructive."
"When someone calls us to form an alliance for Russia, we'll be there," Mr. Zyuganov added. But he indicated that he did not consider Russia's Choice to be for Russia.
"Gaidar is responsible for the destruction of the society," he said, "and we cannot back such a policy."
If the "red-browns" have a majority, the senior diplomat said, "the question becomes whether the democrats can really work together." But he cautioned that results from key areas of the country were still unknown.
The vote count is going so slowly that some responsible politicians are raising the prospect of fraud, especially on the question of the real turnout for the constitutional referendum. Yeltsin officials have repeatedly announced that the new Constitution received a majority of votes from the necessary 50 percent of the electorate.
 
Vote on Constitution Questioned
 But the figure for Russia's eligible voters keeps shrinking as the figures are released by the Central Electoral Commission and its Yeltsin-appointed head, Nikolai Ryabov. The figure has gone from 107 million to 106.3 million on Sunday to 105.284 million in today's Izvestia. Turnout is said to have been 52.3 percent of that last figure, and of the 55.987 million who are said to have voted, 29.337 million are said to have voted yes. While Yeltsin officials have said the yes vote was "around 60 percent," these figures indicate that it was only 52.4 percent.
The Communist leader, Mr. Zyuganov, said today that he thought the Constitution had not in fact received enough votes, a charge echoed in an interview today by Oleg D. Beznisko, the deputy chief of staff for Mr. Yavlinsky's bloc. "We have reasons to think less than 50 percent voted," he said.
But several diplomats said Mr. Yeltsin was very unlikely to acknowledge the invalidity of the constitutional referendum, if in fact it is invalid.
"A strong presidency in this Constitution is what saves Russia from Zhirinovsky," one Western diplomat said bluntly. "Yeltsin needs this Constitution, and in a way, so does everybody."
Asked if Western countries would now stop complaining about Mr. Yeltsin's apparently broken promise to hold a presidential vote in June instead of serving out his full term, the diplomat said, "We're not complaining."
In his news conference, Mr. Zhirinovsky ranged from Chinese astrology to the idea of inviting South African farmers, "who might be facing ethnic problems," to come live in Russia. He denied being anti-Semitic and said he envied the Jews, "the richest nation in the world." Pressed to address widespread speculaton that his father was Jewish, Mr. Zhirinovsky finally said that both his parents were "Russian."
He said voters had asked him to do something to reduce the number of "non-Russian announcers on the television" and replace them with "good, kind Slavic faces who can speak a good Russian without any accent."
Asked if he meant Jews, he yelled, "If people of a certain kind speak to the nation every day and every hour, this creates anti-Semitism!"
 
Explanation for Success
 Mr. Zhirinovsky explained his success by "our sincerity, openness and faithfulness." For many years, he said, "Russians have felt the way we do but had no chance to express those feelings. But thanks to the elections, we were able to speak openly and they could support us."
Ivan Rodin, writing in Nezavisimaya Gazeta, summarized a popular judgment: "A few years of tumultuous reforms -- political and economic -- have not changed Russians' liking for convinced leaders who promise quick change without great difficulty. Once Boris Yeltsin capitalized on this; now it's Vladimir Zhirinovsky's turn."
Some well-known names won seats in Parliament in votes tallied thus far. They include an ultranationalist television reporter from St. Petersburg, Aleksandr Nevzorov, who was removed from the air after calling for rebellion against Mr. Yeltsin; Yuri Vlasov, a former Olympic weightlifting champion and a nationalist, and the world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, a Russia's Choice supporter.

Graph: "The Tally So Far"
 Preliminary results in Sunday's vote for party preference, from 68 of 89 Russian republics and regions, according to the President's Information Center. Half of the 450 seats in the lower house of Parliament are assigned to parties in proportion to their stregnth in the party-preference vote; the other half is filled by the winners in 225 individual districts. The second column estimates seats won. Five parties show as "other" appear to have received less than 5 percent of the vote, disqualifying them.
 
Liberal Democratic Party (Ultra-nationalist) -- 24.00% (67 seats won)
 
Russia's Choice (Reforist) -- 13.66% (38 seats won)
 
Communist Party (Communist) -- 11.65% (31 seats won)
 
Agrarian Party (Communist; peasant-based) -- 9.59% (29 seats won)
 
Women of Russia (Centrist; feminist) -- 8.20% (20 seats won)
 
Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin Bloc (Reformist) -- 6.84% (15 seats won)
 
Russian Unity and Accord Party (Reformist) -- 6.34% (13 seats won)

HEADLINE: In America;
Nurses On the Advance

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Nurses have been moving steadily, relentlessly toward more autonomy and responsibility, advancing ever more boldly in the last few years into territory previously controlled by physicians. Now the doctors, feeling threatened, are counterattacking.
The issue is whether registered nurses with advanced training should be allowed to deliver primary health care on their own. Primary care refers to the first contact a patient has with the health care system. It's the basic, initial care that you receive when visiting a clinic or a doctor's office -- the care you get before being referred, if necessary, to a specialist. 
 Registered nurses have been delivering this kind of care for decades, but almost always under the supervision of doctors.
In recent years, however, nurses with advanced training -- such as nurse practitioners and nurse midwives -- have been moving toward greater independence. This has occurred as the country has experienced a growing shortage of primary-care physicians.
In many states, including New York, nurse practitioners are allowed to write prescriptions and to be reimbursed by third-party insurers. A growing number of health maintenance organizations are using nurses as primary care providers, and some nurse practitioners are going into practice on their own.
As long as the nurses were working for the doctors, there wasn't much of a problem. The nurses lightened the workload. They helped bolster profits. For routine visits, the doctor told the patient, in effect: "See the nurse, and have your insurance company send me a check."
Now the Clinton Administration, with its health reform package emphasizing primary care, has added its considerable weight to the move toward greater responsibility for advanced-practice nurses.
Hillary Rodham Clinton could not have been clearer last month when she told a group of Georgia physicians, "We are increasing the scope of practice opportunities for advanced-practice nurses because we don't have adequate numbers of primary-care practitioners in either the private or the public sector."
Last week the doctors struck back. The American Medical Association issued a report that could easily have been titled, "Enough Is Enough." It criticized virtually every argument on behalf of greater autonomy for nurses. "Quality medical care," the report said, "requires that a physician be responsible for the overall care of each and every patient."
The A.M.A. even rejected the idea that nursing care is less expensive than physician care. The report said, "There is no convincing evidence that nurses are the most cost effective health care providers."
That is particularly interesting when you consider that the average income for doctors last year was $170,600, while for nurse practitioners it was $43,600.
But the cornerstone of the doctors' argument is that nurses acting independently would be a threat to the health of their patients.
There does not seem to be any evidence at all for that argument.
Mary Mundinger, dean of Columbia University's School of Nursing, noted that nurse practitioners have been delivering primary care since 1965 and that hundreds of studies have examined the quality of their work, including their diagnostic ability and management effectiveness.
"There is not a single study that shows any lapses," said Ms. Mundinger, "and most of the studies have been done by physicians."
When asked if any studies had shown any problems with the quality of care delivered by advanced-practice nurses, Dr. Lonnie Bristow, the A.M.A.'s chairman, said: "No, certainly not. In fact, we believe the quality of care is quite good." But he stressed that the nurses studied had all worked with -- or for -- doctors.
Every team, he said, "needs a quarterback."
With health care costs creating economic havoc, it is not likely that doctors or anyone else will be able to slow the movement toward greater independence for advanced-practice nurses.
If nurses with special training are delivering high-quality health care at a reasonable cost, then we need a reason other than doctors' anxiety to stop them.

HEADLINE: Don't Blame Slovakia for Gypsy Problem

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A report on Gypsies in Slovakia surprised me by its subjective approach and lack of objective information (some editions, Nov. 28). 
 You point to the $71 monthly welfare payment a Gypsy widow receives. It is necessary to compare the value of the dollar in Slovakia against its value in the United States. For example, the average income of one working person in Slovakia is $150 a month. Thus, $71 is quite adequate to sustain a moderate life style in Slovakia, compared with the United States.
You give the number of Gypsies in Slovakia incorrectly. According to the 1991 census, there are 80,000 Gypsies in Slovakia. Because of the number of Gypsies who did not respond to the census, experts estimate their population to be approximately 5 percent of Slovak inhabitants, totaling 250,000 Gypsies in the country and not, as you estimate, 400,000.
I find it inexplicable that you did not make any effort to give more information on Gypsies in Slovakia, except for personal impressions and descriptions of what was seen and heard in one village.
You did not mention, for example, that the Slovak Government supports Gypsy society with approximately 70 million Slovak crowns a year (average monthly income is about 4,500 crowns). The money is used for improving living standards in Gypsy villages, education and children's summer camps, including 3.6 million crowns for Gypsy periodicals, and 10.7 million crowns for Gypsy cultural activities.
The negative approach of some Slovak citizens toward Gypsies is not based on racial intolerance, but on a significant difference in life styles and standards. You failed to note, for example, that approximately 40 percent of all crimes are attributed to the Gypsy population, and that Gypsy teen-age criminality accounts for 40 percent to 50 percent of all youth cases in Slovakia each year. Similarly, the Gypsy population is plagued by a high percentage of alcoholism.
The Gypsy problem is not unique to Slovakia. It is common to most states of Europe. Slovak efforts to solve the problem through special programs and policies are being coordinated with the European Community.
The situation in Slovakia is not simple. Yet the Slovak economy, now rid of the old Communist regime, is based on a free market system, which is increasingly stabilizing.
The free market in Slovakia has created a market for labor. Only the most qualified and hard-working citizens can be employed, as in all democratic free market economies. The Slovak Government aims to create the same opportunities for all citizens.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD TRADE AGREEMENT: U.S. AND EUROPE CLEAR THE WAY FOR A WORLD ACCORD ON TRADE, SETTING ASIDE MAJOR DISPUTES;
How Free Trade Prompts Growth: A Primer

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Free trade means growth. Free trade means growth. Free trade means growth. Just say it 50 more times and all doubts will melt away.
Those who dutifully followed the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement and are now struggling to figure out what the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has to do with the price of peas in Peoria may be excused for a dash of skepticism about a link that is more often asserted than explained. It is, in fact, one of the most widely held yet most difficult to prove ideas in economics. 
 In the end, the nearly universal conviction that open trade drives global prosperity rests more on observation than on well-developed theory: "We all noticed that the countries doing well were exporting like crazy," said Stanley Fischer, the World Bank's former chief economist.
College instructors love to illustrate the British economist David Ricardo's insight about the gains from free trade with a story about Woodrow Wilson. President Wilson, they say, could type faster than his secretary. But it made sense to leave the White House correspondence to others so he could concentrate on making the world safe for democracy and other higher-productivity endeavors.
 
A Victorian Example
 By this same rule of "comparative advantage," it made economic sense for Victorian England to break the political influence of its cosseted farmers by opening its borders to wheat from central Europe and North America. That allowed entrepreneurs to focus more capital and labor on manufacturing, where it could (and did) make Britain the richest country on earth.
These gains from economic specialization are still nothing to sneeze at. The World Bank estimates that in 1985 free trade in dairy foods would have lowered average prices by two-thirds and doubled global output. All told, free trade in grain, meat, milk and sugar would have added $40 billion to world income -- mostly by shifting production away from Western Europe and toward lower cost producers.
And the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development calculates that the combination of reduced tariffs and more generous import quotas penciled into the new GATT accord would increase world income by $270 billion annually by the turn of the century.
Big as these numbers are, though, they are modest compared with the total world output, which will probably exceed $30 trillion a decade hence. And even if one imagined free trade nirvana in which shirts sewn in Jakarta could be sold as freely in Seattle as shirts made on Seventh Avenue, the direct impact of the resulting global specialization of production would not be overwhelming.
Gary Hufbauer and Tim Elliott of the Institute for International Economics in Washington estimate that free trade would add about 1 percent to the average American's income.
Why, then, is Sebastian Edwards, a development specialist at the University of California at Los Angeles, convinced that "free trade is the cornerstone to modern economic systems?" Because it does not take an econometrician to tell which way the winds of prosperity have been blowing.
In the 1890's, Argentina had roughly the same income per person as the United States and seemed as well endowed with resources, both human and physical. A century of protectionism, though, left Argentina with hundreds of inefficient industries serving only local markets and a living standard roughly a third as high as that of the colossus to the north.
 
Asian Comparisons
 Or compare the economies of Asia that stumbled into the 1960's in more or less wretched condition. Those that focused on the expansion of trade (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia) have done very well. Those that tried to develop by pushing for self-sufficiency (India, Vietnam, Myanmar, North Korea) have done very badly. And those that came late to the open trade game but are now big players (Indonesia, China) seem to be on their way to a chicken in every wok.
In the end such comparisons may be the only hard evidence that economists have. But it has not stopped them from speculation about the inner workings of the machinery translating trade into growth.
The puckish explanation, suggests Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is that the relationship is, in fact, specious, that cause has been confused with effect.
Countries ready to grow may be more inclined to gravitate toward open trade. More specifically, the cultural values that seem to underpin growth -- thrift, rule of law, respect for property rights, fiscal discipline -- may also create political systems that are better at defending the interests of efficient, export-minded producers against those of groups demanding a free economic ride.
Certainly the view of the overwhelming majority of economists, though, is that trade kindles growth. "Trade is a vehicle for technology transfer," Mr. Fischer points out, flashing what many see as the free traders' trump card. The successful Asian economies that protect local producers of consumer goods, he notes, have been careful to permit easy access to modern foreign equipment and materials.
What's more, openness to imports generally pays greater dividends than access to faster computers and tougher plastics. It also offers the chance to "learn by looking," suggests Mr. Edwards -- "to be exposed to foreign ideas on a massive basis."
Trade is also a source of competition for would-be local monopolists, keeping prices down and disciplining the locals to reduce waste. And it can have a critical impact on competition out in less obvious ways. "Without the Japanese to lead the way on quality control and fit and finish," argues Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution, it is hard to imagine Detroit would have pulled up its socks.
 
The 'British Disease'
 Mancur Olson, the director of the Center on Institutional Reform and the Informal Sector at the University of Maryland, offers another connection between trade and competition-spurred growth. In every economy special interests are organizing to slow change, he suggests, creating sinecures for themselves and generally preventing boat-rocking innovation. This, he believes, goes a long way toward explaining the failure of many poor countries to grow and the tendency of industrialized countries to catch what has come to be known as "the British disease."
But economic systems can be made more resistant to the infection by increasing the number of actors -- companies, unions, property owners -- who must be organized and kept in line in order to stifle competition. "The smaller the economy," Mr. Mancur reasons, "the greater the likelihood of successful collusion."
Thus, he explains, expanding the economic borders of economies helps, as in the case of the European Community or the North American Free Trade Agreement, "But global free trade helps even more."
 A news analysis article in Business Day yesterday about the agreement referred incorrectly in some copies to the number of participating nations. There are 117, not 116.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 16, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page chart yesterday about the highlights of the world trade agreement referred incorrectly in some editions to the timetable for its approval by Congress. The agreement requires the President's signature by April 15; he may submit it to Congress at any time after signing it. The pact is scheduled to go into effect July 1, 1995. If Congress has not approved it by then, the United States will be vulnerable to trade sanctions.
A related front-page article yesterday about how free trade promotes growth misstated the first name of an economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. She is Kim Elliott, not Tim.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Highlights"
 
The United States and 116 other nations agreed to substantially reduce tariffs and rewrite the free trade rules that have governed most international commerce for 45 years.
 
Changes: The United States and the European Community will cut their tariffs on each other's good in half. Tariffs on good from the rest of the world will be cut less. Agricultural tariffs will be reduced by 36 percent in industrial nations and 24 percent in developing nations.
 
Effects: The agreement is expected to boost business and investment activity by opening markets and encouraging countries to specialize in producing whatever goods they can make most efficiently.
 
Unresolved Issues: Negotiators could not reach agreement on free trade involving movies, television programs and music; civil aircraft; shipping and financial services like banking and stock brokerage. Rather than jeopardize reaching an agreement, the issues were put aside for the time being. They have the potential to fuel future trade disagreements.
 
Approval: Under a Federal law, Congress must approve or disapprove the agreement by an April 15 deadlin. The other countries have until mid-1995 to ratify it.

HEADLINE: New York Struggles to Lure Coveted Biotech Labs

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
Innovir Laboratories, a small company seeking cures for hepatitis, leukemia and other maladies, plans to leave New York City soon.
"We need to expand," said Allan R. Goldberg, Innovir's president. "There's all this empty office space in Manhattan, but it's practically impossible to find anything that's right for us. Believe me, I've tried." 
 So what? Companies migrate from New York all the time. Why fret about one more, particularly since Innovir's entire work force could fit comfortably in two elevator cars?
Because Innovir, like other biotechnology companies, was supposed to be different. City and state planners have chosen biotechnology -- in which living organisms, usually bacteria, are modified genetically to help produce better drugs, hardier plant species and new solutions for environmental problems -- as one of New York's most promising new industries to nurture.
 
Vulnerable to Boom-and-Bust
 Experts say the field has the potential to employ tens of thousands of people, ranging from Nobel laureates to lab technicians and bottle-washers. It would be a welcome addition to an economy vulnerable to the boom-and-bust cycles of its two mainstays, finance and real estate.
By most accounts, New York City has nearly all the ingredients for a thriving biotech industry -- strong academic medical centers, talented researchers and sources of venture capital. But the can't-lose formula has failed to jell.
Today the city has fewer than a dozen biotech companies, employing barely more than 200 people. More than two dozen other start-up companies, using technology developed on the island of Manhattan at institutions like Rockefeller University, Mount Sinai Medical Center and New York University, have settled elsewhere.
They complain that for all the talk, the city, the state and the renowned medical centers have given them little financial support or even help in finding and equipping the advanced laboratories they need. They say such sustenance is vital for survival in the biotech industry, where fledgling companies commonly lose money for years before producing a marketable product. And with competing states and localities (Rhode Island, San Diego, North Carolina, Montgomery County, Maryland) dangling dazzling incentive packages, several local companies are pressing the city and state to offer comparable help.
 
Lack of Effort Is Seen
 The problem is not a new one. Molecular Tool, a genetic engineering company now in Baltimore, was founded by two scientists at Columbia University who started their business in Hoboken. A year ago, its co-founder, Philip Goelet, complained: "Other cities have created industrial parks and made a real effort to streamline the location process for high technology. But New York just isn't prepared to handle it.
"If you're not finance, insurance or real estate," Mr. Goelet said, "they don't know what to do with you."
Samuel D. Waksal, president of ImClone Systems, the city's largest biotech company, says that New York can renew its economic base only by fostering new industries. His company, on Varick Street in lower Manhattan, close to New York University, employs 120 people.
"We want to help make the city come alive again," Dr. Waksal said. "Just look at our work force. I've got a guy who started out as a janitor who is now a lab tech trained in growing tissue cultures. We've got black, white, Indian, Hispanic employees. It's a mirror of New York."
But Long Island has a much larger cluster of biotech companies, and several have found homes in Westchester County. Others are scattered throughout New Jersey, closely tied to its major pharmaceutical companies. This growth also benefits New York City because it buoys the region's prosperity and these nearby companies maintain some cooperation with the city's medical centers.
 
Far Behind San Francisco
 Still, the New York region, with about 4,500 people directly employed in biotech companies, is far behind the San Francisco Bay area, which has about 20,000 biotech jobs. It also trails a rapidly expanding core of companies centered on Cambridge, Mass. Many experts fear that New York will slip further and further behind.
A public-private commission under the aegis of the New York Academy of Medicine concluded in a report to be issued soon that the region's declining status as a magnet for the biotechnology industry was "alarming." The industry, the report warns, "has come to view the region as an unfavorable environment for locating new initiatives."
The exodus of biotechnology companies like Innovir highlights one of New York City's most daunting economic difficulties. Although the city, particularly in Manhattan and Queens, remains an important incubator for new businesses, it often fails to keep such companies as they grow.
"New York's biggest economic problem may be not so much the loss of the headquarters of very large corporations, but rather the tendency of smaller firms that are born here to leave," said Thierry Noyelle, deputy director of the Eisenhower Center, an economic research office at Columbia University.
 
Same Problems and More
 Biotech is plagued by the same problems that afflict all those doing business in New York: high taxes, an often-paralyzed political system, intrusive regulations, a reputation as a difficult place to live and work.
Some unusual obstacles, though, also stand in the way of biotech's development in and around New York. Researchers complain, for example, that academic or medical centers in the area have offered comparatively little support for researchers to start their own businesses. The primary exception is the State University of New York at Stony Brook, where the state has financed the Long Island High Technology Incubator, which rents office and laboratory space to new biotech companies.
But the city, even with its abundance of major medical research centers -- in whose shadow biotech companies tend to thrive -- is lagging badly. Perhaps the most damaging problem has been the difficulty of finding space in buildings near Manhattan's major health institutions and converting them into the costly laboratories biotech companies need.
"New York cannot afford another missed opportunity," said Herbert E. Berman, chairman of the New York City Council's finance committee.
 
Health-Care Industry's Health
 Though the biotech industry today is small, its fate is expected to have much broader implications. A healthy biotech industry is considered essential to sustain New York as a pace-setter in biomedical research. And that research is considered vital to the region's vast health-care complex. Collectively, health care is by far the biggest agglomeration of private employers in the region.
Dr. John W. Rowe, president of Mount Sinai and chairman of the public-private commission on biotechnology, said New York, once at the vanguard of the nation's biomedical research, must do more. "Why do we always have to wait until the situation reaches a crisis before acting?" he asked.
Local officials reply that their first responsibility during the recession has been to hang on to New York's economic base in financial services. They say they have begun to address the problems that bedevil newer, smaller industries like biotech.
"We've had to rethink our economic development strategy," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
 
Seeking Venture Capital
 This fall, a task force led by Barry F. Sullivan, New York's Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, selected nearly a dozen industries, such as biotech, computer software and fashion, for particular attention. The city is seeking a private venture-capital company to help direct more investment to local companies in those fields. And today the Economic Development Corporation plans to start soliciting bids to remodel an older building to provide laboratory space for smaller biotech companies.
After long delays, the city and state governments, together with Columbia University, are financing the construction of the Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Center in Harlem, close to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, as a place to nurture start-up companies.
It is too early to say whether the administration of Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani will follow through. And none of these projects is likely to be ready before 1995 at the earliest.
As far as some representatives of the biotech industry are concerned, the actions are too little, too late.
 
'Almost No Concrete Action'
 "There's been a lot of talk, but almost no concrete action," said Jack Huttner, executive director of the New York Biotechnology Association. "These are fast-moving companies. They are looking for space to locate or expand right away. They don't need a plan to give them a building a year and a half from now."
Innovir is looking for expansion space in the nearby suburbs. It is likely to settle in Westchester County, in Tarrytown, next to Regeneron, one of New York's largest biotech companies, employing more than 200 people. (Albany helped start Regeneron with an early investment from a state-run venture-capital fund and recently lent it $7 million to buy and remodel a factory in Rensselaer County.)
Several small companies have left the city recently. Biotechnology General Corporation moved in October to the Metropark center in Iselin, N.J., near New Brunswick. American Bioresources, AM6 and Hemazyne have either moved or gone out of business.
Local governments, of course, have only a marginal impact on where companies choose to move. And sometimes a government subsidy, by distorting supply and demand and encouraging enterprises that the market rejects, can do more harm than good.
 
Biotech Clusters Elsewhere
 Still, state governments in California and Massachusetts have helped cultivate growing biotech clusters around San Francisco and Cambridge. Michael Porter, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of "The Comparative Advantage of Nations" (The Free Press, 1990), found that such clustering of closely related companies is a key to success in building industries with large profits and high-paying jobs.
Cambridge and Massachusetts, for example, have already helped build a major real-estate project to house new and growing biotech companies, and they have made extra efforts to cut through institutional red tape for the industry. Similarly, California has provided extensive financing for biotech companies to settle in South San Francisco, once the home of thousands of traditional manufacturing firms that have abandoned the city or gone out of business.
Long Island has had some success in fostering small biotech companies around Stony Brook and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a pioneer in genetic research. Ten years ago, the state established a biotechnology center on the Stony Brook campus, which receives about $1 million a year to promote collaborations with industry and the transfer of academic research to biotech companies. The center will spend another $3 million to expand.
As a result, Long Island has become home to more than 30 biotech companies employing more than 3,000 people. These include companies like BioCogent (founded by a Stony Brook faculty member), Curative Technologies (lured from out of state by the incubator), and Olympus Biotechnology Development Center, a spinoff of the Japanese-owned Olympus Corporation.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 15 about the biotechnology industry in New York City described the status of one company, Hemazyme, incorrectly. The company changed its name to ZymeQuest Inc. in May but retains its corporate offices and research laboratory in Manhattan; it is not among the biotechnology companies that have left the city or gone out of business.
