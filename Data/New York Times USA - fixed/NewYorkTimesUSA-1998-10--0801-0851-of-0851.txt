'Footloose' Shows Vigor

BYLINE: By Jesse McKinley 

 BODY:
All along, "Footloose" bore the signs of a potential "Carrie"-size disaster. First the tryout run in Washington was a critical bust, and when the show got to New York, the set didn't fit into the theater. Dancers were injured, an actor was replaced and even the poster design -- a giant pink F -- seemed ominous.
But despite those problems and generally dismissive newspaper reviews, the musical has shown surprising vigor since opening on Oct. 22. As of Wednesday, the show's weekly gross was more than $525,000, with average daily box office receipts running just under $100,000, the producers say. (The show's weekly running cost is estimated to be under $350,000.) Curiously, the biggest attendance day so far was Oct. 23, the day most of the worst reviews ran, when sales topped $120,000. 
 "They're doing fantastic, better than most expected," said Ronald Lee, president of Group Sales Box Office, a ticket sales service. "It's encouraging."
Part of the buzz, to be sure, has been manufactured. The producers have already spent nearly $1 million to market "Footloose," most of it on radio and television advertisements. New radio spots with snippets of what good reviews the show had hit the air hours after the opening.
And producers are wasting no time exporting their product. The show's touring company, which was casting before the Broadway run opened, will begin rehearsals in two weeks, with an opening in Cleveland planned for mid-December. Ticket sales on the road also indicate that "Footloose" may have commercial legs; in Green Bay, Wis., for instance, producers say an early January run is 85 percent sold, with subscriptions plus single tickets being sold.
The production, which cost $6.5 million, has deep pockets; its main producer is Dodger Endemol Theatricals, known for salvaging such critical pariahs as "Titanic" with advertising and marketing.
Still, producers insist that it is far too early to handicap the show's staying power on Broadway.
"It's premature to speculate," said Michael David, one producer, picking his words carefully. "But I'm very optimistic at this point."
Unusual Equity Move
The decision last week by Actors Equity to extend its agreement with the producers of "The Beauty Queen of Leenane" to allow the Irish actress Anna Manahan to stay in the cast through March was a good example of the politics -- and economics -- at play on Broadway.
The union has final say on how long foreign actors can perform in the United States, a contentious issue that promises to surface several times this season as British imports arrive on Broadway. Alan Eisenberg, the executive director of the union, called the extension -- the show's third -- "very unusual."
But he said Ms. Manahan's presence was needed to keep the show open and to preserve the eight Equity jobs for the play's other actors, understudies and stage managers. "We want to keep the show running," he said. "The critics close enough of them anyway."
Ms. Manahan plays the toadish mother. The other three Irish cast members will leave "Beauty Queen" early next year. In their place, Kate Burton is expected to play the beleaguered daughter, Maureen, while Stevie Ray Dallimore takes the role of Pato, her suitor, and Chris Carley the part of Pato's dimwitted brother.
 
 Enough Is Too Much
It seemed like a swell idea. About two weeks ago, Mandy Patinkin was approached by an elderly woman after a performance of "Mamaloshen," his concert of Yiddish folk songs at the Belasco Theater.
"This little old lady looked at me, after I sang my guts out, and said, 'So, you don't think you could give me a little more than an hour?' " Mr. Patinkin recalled.
So, last Thursday, he took off his formal wear, his usual costume for the show; put on a pair of tennis shoes, and added an extra half-hour English-language encore, singing such show stoppers as "Trouble in River City," and "Bring Them Home," from "Les Miserables."
The crowd loved it, and so did Mr. Patinkin, who has performed for some half-full houses. "I could just feel they needed a little more," said Mr. Patinkin, who had previously performed the show in a smaller space downtown. "Downtown, we did enough for everybody, but it seems up here everybody wants a slice of pizza to go with the meal."
While the fare may have been delicious, it wasn't easy to serve. And on Wednesday after his matinee and a week's worth of "impromptu" encores, Mr. Patinkin announced that he was dumping the idea.
"It adds an extra three and a half hours of singing a week," he said. "That's exhausting."
Still, Mr. Patinkin said he might revive the practice before his run is over on Nov. 7. "If I walk out with my gym shoes," he said, "I'm doing it."
 
 What an Ending
Recently, Spalding Gray fell asleep during a performance. And he couldn't be happier about it.
Mr. Gray, you see, has been fine-tuning "Morning, Noon and Night," a new monologue that, as the title suggests, takes place over the course of a day in the life of the writer.
Last week, during a run of the show on Long Island, Mr. Gray found what he believes will be the ending of his piece: slumber.
"I closed my eyes, put my head down, the lights went out," he said. "I finished the arc."
The reason for Mr. Gray's fatigue is familiar to parents everywhere. After 20 years of performing monologues on everything from the Vietnam War to skiing, Mr. Gray has taken on fatherhood as a subject, riffing on his experiences raising a toddler, a kindergartner and a daughter bordering adolescence.
"I think one of the funnier lines is at the end when I say, 'Oh my God, I'm totally wrecked and I haven't gone to work,' " he said.
Not that he's resting now. For the next eight weeks, he will perform the piece on Monday nights at Performance Space 122 in the East Village. The show is billed as a work in progress, which for Mr. Gray means recording each performance and later listening to the audience reaction.
"The audience is teaching me what's funny," he said. "They make me self-conscious in a good way."

Deutsche Bank Says Losses Are Worse Than Expected

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Oct. 29

 BODY:
Deutsche Bank A.G., Germany's biggest bank, said today that huge trading losses in the securities of emerging markets, primarily Russia, had virtually obliterated its third-quarter profit.
Deutsche Bank said its net income for the quarter that ended on Sept. 30 plunged 83.5 percent, to 147 million marks, or $89 million, compared with 890 million marks, or $539 million, in the quarter a year earlier. Operating profit fell 95 percent, to 69 million marks, or $42 million, down from 1.3 billion marks, or $787 million. The bank had a big one-time gain from a special dividend on Daimler-Benz stock, of which Deutsche Bank holds 21.4 percent. 
 The bank, which is based here, said that trading activities had earned a record 2.5 billion marks in the first half of the year only to run up a loss of 224 million marks, or $136 million, in the third quarter. The bank also set aside 300 million marks, or $182 million, for bad Russian loans.
Though analysts had known that Russian problems would take a huge bite out of Deutsche Bank profits, the results were even worse than the two-thirds drop they had expected and did little to relieve the gloom that hovers over large banks in both Europe and the United States.
Germany's two other big international banks, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank, are expected to post big declines in profit when they report their results next week. Bankers Trust, the New York financial group that has been reported to be a takeover target of Deutsche Bank, reported an even bigger loss, $350 million, from securities trading in the third quarter. UBS and Credit Suisse of Switzerland have acknowledged losing hundreds of millions of dollars in Russia, and most analysts expect more losses to come.
Deutsche Bank's stock, which like many other money-center banks has lost nearly half its value in the last few months, rose 2.2 marks today, to 102.95 a share. Analysts said the market reaction showed that most investors had expected a steep decline in profits and were not shocked by the latest numbers.
The real question is whether profits will sink in the bank's basic lines of business because of a sustained decline in world economic growth and in the global security markets.
Deutsche Bank has been trying to cut costs to bring its overall returns closer to those of United States banks, but some analysts worry that the effort may not be enough if a downturn begins to erode revenue from interest income, investment banking or asset management.
Despite the problems, Deutsche Bank has avoided some of the spectacular problems that have beset other banks. UBS, and to a lesser extent Credit Suisse and Dresdner, all lost money through investments in Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn., that had to be rescued with a $3.5 billion bailout from creditor banks. Deutsche Bank has said that it has no exposure to Long-Term Credit, though it joined the bailout in the interest of averting a broader financial crisis.
Deutsche Bank and the other German banks have also been more cautious than others about risks from Russian loans. Though the German banks are the world's biggest lenders to Russia, most of those loans are guaranteed by the German Government, and the banks have covered about half the remaining risk through previous provisions.
That does not resolve all the problems, however. Mark Hoge, banking analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in London, said today that Deutsche Bank and other German banks remained threatened by a general downturn in the financial markets -- a move that would probably reduce interest income, investment banking commissions and revenue from asset-management activities like mutual funds.
Though Deutsche Bank has vowed to cut costs enough to bolster profits, its costs in the most recent quarter climbed by 6 percent. In the event of a continued downturn, some analysts say that the bank is likely to fall short of its promises even if it does achieve its targets on cost-cutting.
"The targets that these banks had were based on the belief that the income they had last year will be sustainable next year," Mr. Hoge said. "My concern is that we are at the beginning of a point where income will be under pressure for a long time."

HEADLINE: Wages Turn Hot for Workers, With Gain of 1.2%

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Despite signs that the labor market has cooled a bit since spring, the pay of workers is rising faster than it has in years.
The nation's employment cost index -- a broad gauge of compensation trends and one of the most closely watched yardsticks of inflationary pressures -- rose a surprisingly strong 1 percent this summer, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Though increases in benefit costs remained subdued, wages and salaries spurted 1.2 percent in the three months that ended on Sept. 30, the fastest rate since the summer of 1990, at the end of the long, strong 1980's economic expansion. 
 Wages and salaries rose 4.3 percent in the last year, substantially more than the 3.6 percent gain in the previous year. For workers, that means some of the best real gains in take-home pay in years. "It's a workers' paradise with no inflation and lots of cheap imports," said Ed Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.
Workers in financial services, from bankers to mortgage brokers, are getting the biggest raises. Thanks partly to the boom in mortgage refinancing, their pay has shot up 8 percent in the last year. But the pickup in pay is widespread, especially in the service sector, in contrast to a year ago when fat Wall Street bonuses temporarily increased the compensation figures. "What we're seeing is a fairly broad-based increase in the rate of growth of compensation," said Katherine Abraham, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
So far, however, the good news for workers has not translated into higher inflation, which has been running between 1 percent and 1.5 percent this year. And it may not, Mr. Yardeni and others pointed out, because wages will not necessarily keep climbing this fast for long.
By and large, companies have not passed along labor cost increases by raising prices; instead, they have bolstered productivity and accepted thinner profit margins. And Mr. Yardeni, among others, predicts that slower growth in coming months may well ease the pressure on wages.
Investors seemed to share this sanguine view yesterday, shrugging off the fresh evidence of a pickup in wage inflation and bidding up the prices of bonds and stocks.
Meanwhile, despite economic crises in Asia and Latin America, plummeting exports and manufacturing job losses in the United States, the labor market has not loosened as much as might be expected.
Help-wanted advertising has slipped, the Conference Board reported, but it remains strong. In October, more job seekers reported that positions were harder to find -- 16 percent compared with 14.3 percent in September -- but nearly three times as many said that jobs were abundant. And initial jobless claims, which had jumped two weeks in a row, are back down near a 10-year low, the Labor Department said.
Probably most important, the unemployment rate remains nearly a full percentage point below the level of three years ago -- 4.6 percent versus 5.5 percent -- when wage and benefit inflation accelerated.
David Levine, an economist at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said: "It's widely believed that the old link between the unemployment rate and price inflation has been broken. But the link between unemployment and wage inflation is still solid."

HEADLINE: Budget Backsliding

BYLINE: By Sam Nunn and Warren B. Rudman; Sam Nunn, a former Democratic Senator from Georgia, and Warren B. Rudman, a former Republican Senator from New Hampshire, are co-chairmen of the Concord Coalition.

 BODY:
For several years, we and other deficit hawks have traveled the country warning that mounting deficits were undermining the economy and jeopardizing the well-being of future generations. Until recently, we were optimistic that great progress had been made. Last year a Democratic President and Republican-led Congress reached a bipartisan plan to balance the budget. This year the Government actually took in more than it spent for the first time since 1969.
But it seems that this good news has brought on a widespread case of political amnesia. Indeed, the ugly conclusion to this year's budget process should remind us that fiscal discipline, like democracy, requires constant vigilance. The leaders of both parties are reverting to bad habits that, if not checked, will quickly lead us back into the old days of galloping debt.
First there was a lack of candor in explaining the budget to the people. Leaders of both parties have been patting themselves on the back for this year's surplus. What they have not been saying is that without the Social Security surplus, the 1998 budget would show a deficit of nearly $30 billion rather than a surplus of about $70 billion.
Then there were the calls to raise spending and cut taxes -- the classic recipe for a spend-and-borrow deficit. The first instinct of many in Washington was to use the surplus for something other than the most fiscally responsible choices: paying down the $5.5 trillion debt or paying future Social Security benefits by investing the surplus beyond the reach of the Government. Only gridlock over how to spend the surplus allowed even a portion to survive intact. 
 Finally, there were shell games. Most egregious was the use of the loophole that allowed Congress and the President to exceed this year's $551 billion non-entitlement spending cap simply by mutually designating any item they wanted as an "emergency." Instead of making hard choices, they divvied it up for pork-barrel projects and then cheerfully pushed another $21 billion through the "emergency" spending loophole.
Emergencies should be limited to things that are unexpected, one-time and urgent. Few of this year's so-called emergencies fit that definition. Sure, fixing government computers for the year 2000 is important, but the problem was scarcely unexpected. Of course we all want to help Americans devastated by natural disasters. But shouldn't the hurricane, flood, fire and quake aid needed nearly every year be financed through the regular budget process? Congress and the President agreed last year that, by 2002, they would reduce discretionary spending by 10 percent, adjusted for inflation. Projected surpluses are based on the assumption that this 10 percent reduction will occur along with resulting lower Federal interest payments.
The flagrant abuse of "emergency" spending was a collapse in fiscal discipline just when such discipline is becoming increasingly important; after all, staying tough on spending will become more difficult when the baby boomers begin to retire in 2008.
Social Security is projected to begin running annual cash deficits in 2013. Soon thereafter these deficits will be measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars. And Medicare is in even worse shape than Social Security. If our leaders do not have the will to hold the line on spending our first surplus in 30 years, how can we expect them to have the courage to fix Social Security and Medicare?

Concerns Over Slow Growth Lift Treasuries

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bond prices rose for the third time in four days yesterday as expectations for slower economic growth, together with declines in Brazil's stock market, kept demand alive for Treasury securities.
"The world economic situation is in dire trouble, and there's little hope" that the United States will escape the global slowdown, said John Breazeale, who oversees $200 million at Weiss Money Management in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. 
 The price of the benchmark 30-year bond rose 21/32 , to 106 15/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.08 percent from 5.12 percent.
A rally in Treasury bonds, whose yields fell to a 31-year low of 4.69 percent on Oct. 5 as investors sought safety, has since faltered as signs of stability in world markets prompted some investors to move out of Treasuries and into riskier securities again. Even so, investors have been fretting for months that Brazil's currency might be the next to be devalued, which could unleash financial turmoil throughout Latin America.
"People still like Treasuries -- the nervousness is still in the market," said Eric Cheung, who oversees about $2.8 billion of fixed-income investments at the Wilmington Trust Corporation in Wilmington, Del.
So far this year, 30-year Treasury bonds have returned 17.5 percent when price gains and interest payments are taken into account. That compares with a rise of 8.4 percent in the Dow Jones industrial average, including reinvested dividends.
Treasuries do face some hurdles, though. Investors may be reluctant to buy before the United States auctions $38 billion in new securities next week. The Treasury will sell 5-year notes on Tuesday, 10-year notes on Wednesday and 30-year bonds on Thursday in its quarterly refunding.
Investors "aren't going to rush to buy this market with that much supply looming," said Tim Harris, a market strategist at National Australia Bank. "The risk is that yields will move up ahead of the auctions, maybe as far as 5.25 percent" on the 30-year Treasury bond, he added.

Brazilian Economic Plan Encounters Some Naysayers

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: BRASILIA, Oct. 29

 BODY:
The Government's $23.5 billion austerity package intended to reduce the budget deficit next year, crucial for securing International Monetary Fund credit and restoring Brazil's fiscal credibility, moved to Congress here today, where reaction foreshadowed bitter political wrangling to come.
While most legislators embraced the need for the savings, they contested the formula that the Government announced on Wednesday, which relies on tax increases and pension payments from workers to meet more than half the promised amount. The program does not include a currency devaluation, which could stimulate growth and tax receipts but also increase inflation and force smaller Latin American countries to devalue as well. 
 For four hours today, Finance Minister Pedro Malan and Gustavo Franco, president of the central bank, fielded questions and criticism from senators, many belonging to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's party or to allied parties in the governing coalition.
Investors appeared wary of Government promises, and Brazil's benchmark stock index closed down 4.2 percent on a day most other Latin American markets rose. Paulo Mallman, an economist with Bic Banco in Sao Paulo, predicted that the Government would deliver its promised savings, but added that negotiations toward reaching that would be "slower and more tortured" than initially thought.
Daniel Gleizer, chief of emerging markets research for Latin America at CSFB-Garantia Bank in Sao Paulo, agreed. "The market is extremely nervous," he said.
The austerity plan represents Brazil's long-awaited answer to the battering its finances have taken on world markets since Russia defaulted on some debts in August. The Russian default intensified fear of a collapse here that could cripple other Latin American economies and hurt the United States, which depends on Latin America to buy more than 20 percent of its exports.
The I.M.F. has been working out a standby loan for Brazil, which is expected to combine at least $30 billion from the fund and other lending agencies, as well as a direct contribution from the United States and other big industrial nations.
Brazil's spending cuts are essential to convince the I.M.F. that the Government is serious about austerity, while another element of the plan -- a timetable for confronting structural economic changes -- is meant to show that Brazil will use the help to find permanent solutions to bring public spending in line with revenue.
Because the I.M.F. and Brazil have a history of confrontation and disappointment in the 1980's, Mr. Malan and other officials are playing down the I.M.F.'s importance domestically. Instead, they are selling the austerity plan as the only route to restore Brazil's standing in world markets, and so bring down interest rates that are choking business.
As a Brazilian team prepared to visit the I.M.F. in Washington, Mr. Malan told Congress, "Why should the rest of the world have faith in us if we don't demonstrate faith in our own ability to identify problems and not only announce solutions, but carry them out?"
A year ago, Brazil reacted to the financial collapse in Thailand by announcing a series of 51 measures to raise $18 billion. Though Congress passed the measures in record time, the Government adopted only tax increases, and abandoned spending cuts, worsening Brazil's position when crisis set in again this year.
Senator Jeferson Peres, of President Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democracy Party, assailed the administration yesterday, asking, "Were there grave mistakes in our economic policy that we made?" He said the country's future appeared now to hinge on an I.M.F. endorsement.
The cornerstones of the current austerity package include the near-doubling of a tax on all checks and financial transactions, to 0.38 percent from 0.20 percent, and the impounding by the national Government of 40 percent of taxes earmarked for states and municipalities until 2006.
The program also cuts into the interests of Brazil's highly protected civil service, increasing employees' pension contributions and calling on retired workers collecting more than $1,000 a month to pay as much as 20 percent of their benefits back into the system.
The measures that promised to draw the most resistance appeared to be the pension changes, and by day's end, many politicians here suggested that one of the taxes on financial transactions was likely to rise less than requested.
Opposition governors gathered at a private club here to chart their strategy to defeat the extension of the impounding of local tax revenue, which was to have expired in 1999, and another proposal that would force states to limit payments to active and retired civil servants to 60 percent of the budget.
Vicente Paulo da Silva, leader of the biggest union, the Central Labor Union, called the measures recessionary and said they would "deepen the country's crisis." He pledged that workers would protest from Nov. 3 to Dec. 10, roughly when Congress is expected to debate the pension changes.
Senator Jader Barbalho, of the Government-allied Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, said that "in a democracy, nobody has the monopoly on truth," adding that his party would be open to alternative suggestions for savings, whether they came from the governing coalition or the opposition.

Chart: "Severe Measures"
In hopes of receiving a $30 billion package through the International Monetary Fund, Brazil plans to adopt austerity measures that would cut its budget deficit by $80 billion, about a third, over three years. First-year savings are supposed to add up to $23.5 billion.
 
TAX INCREASE -- Tax on financial transactions like writing checks and selling stocks would be increased from the current from 0.38 percent to 0.2 percent. A tax on all corporate billings which are destined for Social Security will rise to 3 percent from 2 percent.
SOCIAL SECURITY -- $2.2 billion would be saved by raising the social security tax on civil servants and collecting 11 to 20 percent from retired Government workers' benefits.
SPENDING CUTS -- The Government hopes to trim spending by $7.3 billion. The areas to be cut remain undetermined.
GOVERNMENT REFORMS -- Changes in the Social Security, civil service and tax systems would save $3 billion.
STATE ACCOUNTABILITY -- Brazilian states could pay a penalty for failing to meet specific goals on deficits, spending and tax revenue.

HEADLINE: Southwest Air to Try Its Continental Wings

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Southwest Airlines, the granddaddy of no-frills, discount carriers, has made its name flying short hops between secondary airports. But on Thanksgiving Day, the airline plans to offer its first nonstop, transcontinental service -- for $99 one way.
Southwest is known for lowering fares where it flies, so its potential entry into the lucrative transcontinental market will be closely watched by the rest of the hypercompetitive airline industry. 
 Perhaps for that reason, the airline is playing down the significance of the inaugural flight from Oakland to Baltimore and back, calling it a one-time test.
"It is an opportunity to generate some revenue on a relatively slow travel day because it is a holiday," said Linda Rutherford, a Southwest spokeswoman. "It is using a plane that would otherwise sit idle."
But few people who have watched Southwest grow from a Texas commuter carrier in the 1970's into one of the nation's larger airlines think that it is testing for nothing. "This is the best news for consumers in a long, long time," said Terry Trippler, editor and publisher of the Airfare Report, an industry newsletter.
Other industry specialists say Southwest faces some serious challenges if it tries to become a long-haul carrier. The airline's success has been based on frequent daily flights between destinations. By getting its flights in and out of airport gates in 20 minutes, it has been able to use its planes and staff more productively than other carriers.
"Southwest's cost advantage is most notable on short-haul flights," said Brian D. Harris, an airline analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. "I don't think their margins will be as good and their competitive advantage will be as good if they are flying transcontinental."
Southwest is also known for bare-bones service. Its planes have no first-class cabins and no assigned seating. On most flights, the only food is peanuts, and the in-flight entertainment is supplied by wisecracking flight attendants. Regular transcontinental passengers are used to first-class upgrades and movies.
But Southwest is wildly popular and has had success adding longer routes. It now offers coast-to-coast service using a change of planes in Nashville. It also has a direct flight from Providence, R.I., to Los Angeles that stops in Kansas City, Mo., but passengers do not have to change planes.
Southwest has a strong incentive to lengthen its flights because of a new Federal law that will eventually charge $3 a passenger each time a plane takes off and lands. Airlines used to be charged an excise tax on each ticket, but in a deliberate swipe at Southwest and other low-fare competitors, the large carriers pressed to have the tax reduced in exchange for takeoff and landing charges.
Southwest faces other problems. After expanding from Texas into California, Florida and more recently into the Northeast in Baltimore, Providence and Manchester, N.H., it is facing stiffer competition. "Their growth markets are not as robust as they were a few years ago," Mr. Harris said.
But he added that Southwest, which has grown faster and has been more profitable than most larger competitors, is still a growth airline. While concern about a weakening economy has other carriers talking about scaling back plans to expand next year, Southwest intends to grow by 13 percent and is hungry for more.
By the end of this year, it expects to have taken delivery of 20 new Boeing 737 jets with 29 more arriving in 1999. These planes, which fly farther and burn less fuel than previous models, also allow Southwest more flexibility to fly coast to coast.
Transcontinental service is certainly where the money is. United says the number of nonstop, coast-to-coast flights by all airlines has doubled since 1990. United has increased its transcontinental routes 12 percent this year compared with growth of 3 to 4 percent on its full network.
And Southwest cheers consumers. The unrestricted, last-minute transcontinental fares often paid by business travelers can rise above $900 one way in cities where Southwest has no presence. But from Providence to Los Angeles, United and others have matched Southwest's one-way unrestricted fare of $302.

Trading Losses Deplete Profit at Deutsche Bank
Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, said that it lost $136 million on trading in the securities of emerging markets, primarily Russia, virtually obliterating its third-quarter profit. The bank said net income for the quarter plunged 83.5 percent. 
 Though analysts had known that Russian problems would take a huge bite out of Deutsche Bank's profits, the results were even worse than the two-thirds drop they had expected and did little to relieve the gloom that hovers over large banks in Europe and the United States. Page C3.

Some Gains Are Noted in N.B.A. Talks

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
National Basketball Association owners and players took a respite from negotiations yesterday after some narrowing of their positions on revenue distribution in a late-night bargaining session.
Lawyers from the N.B.A. and the union spoke on the telephone yesterday, but another round of bargaining was not likely to take place until the weekend at the earliest. 
 With nearly 100 players and ownership representatives from all 29 teams scattering throughout the country after a marathon day in New York on Wednesday, the momentum that created a sense of optimism over the league's labor impasse might have left with them.
But during an 8 1/2-hour negotiation at a midtown law firm that concluded at 1 A.M. yesterday, progress was made on the key economic issue in a dispute that has brought the cancellation of 194 games in November.
According to officials on both sides, the players reduced their requested share of total revenues from 63 to 60 percent, and the owners, who have maintained that they want the players to make no more than 48 percent of revenue by 2002, raised that number to 50 percent.
The players last year earned 57.1 percent of all basketball-related income, a figure that enabled the owners to reopen the old collective-bargaining agreement and declare a lockout this past summer.
Total revenue share and a limitation on individual salaries are the biggest stumbling blocks in the negotiations. The players have moved off their luxury tax proposal that would place a 50 percent tax on all salaries over $18 million, indicating they will lower the annual salary figure. The owners, meanwhile, are still wedded to absolute limits on upper-echelon salaries.
The parties have also discussed arrangements for rookies. The N.B.A. and the union have said they would agree to a system that would prevent young players from moving to another team until the fourth year of their contracts. But the league is pushing for the right of first refusal by the player's current team, a restricted form of free agency.
The two sides have also closed ground on limiting annual raises of players. Those discussions involve both free agents who re-sign with their teams under the so-called Larry Bird exception and players who are looking for deals with new clubs.
"Obviously, the parties are apart on variety of issues," Commissioner David Stern said. "We have to see where the next place might be to make some progress. There might be a framework, but there are so many issues on the table -- and they are not trivial. We're going to continue losing time."
Asked if the lockout might be resolved in the next week, Stern shook his head and said: "I just don't know. I just don't know."
After nearly 20 players, a group of owners and lawyers for both sides met on Wednesday, Stern and his deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, negotiated between about midnight and 12:30 A.M. directly with Michael Jordan; the union's president, Patrick Ewing, and the union's executive director Billy Hunter.
Ewing asked Jordan to attend the negotiation even though Jordan is not on the union's executive committee. His presence in the talks was welcomed by both sides. After drawing the ire of Abe Pollin, the Washington Wizards' owner, during an afternoon question-and-answer session, Jordan verbally sparred with Stern until 1 A.M.
"A lot of these guys aren't in a position to talk back to these guys, but Jordan is," said a union official, speaking on condition of anonymity. "He is a tremendous deal-maker, someone who knows how to negotiate. He understands leverage, strength and how to play the game."

NBC May Face Boycott by Players After Lockout

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
When a reporter from the NBC affiliate in Las Vegas, Nev., asked Chuck Person if he could have a few minutes last week, the San Antonio Spurs guard shook his head and declined. Several other National Basketball Association players soon followed his lead. Walking away they muttered, "We're not going to do NBC."
On the surface, saying no to one of the broadcast outlets that has helped line the coffers of the N.B.A. for the past decade -- a network that has helped make the players incredibly famous and wealthy -- did not seem like prudent business. But in what can be construed as either sincere animosity or merely a labor bargaining ploy, dozens of the league's players have said they are weighing the possibility of a network boycott. 
Labeling NBC and the Turner Sports cable network as "co-conspirators" in the current lockout, the union equates the approximately $475 million in guaranteed television rights fees that will be paid to the N.B.A. this season -- regardless of whether games are played -- as giving the owners more clout in their economic fight with the players. It has elicited talk from the players of penalizing the two networks by not doing interviews both during and after the current labor impasse.
Patrick Ewing, the union president, said that the players, "to a man," were angry that NBC and Turner Sports "have taken the active role that they have in promoting this lockout."
"When all is said and done," Ewing added, "this lockout will have cost the players a lot of money, and NBC's role will not be forgotten."
Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC sports, declined to comment on the union's statements. Greg Hughes, the vice president of public relations for Turner Sports, said the cable network was not taking sides in the dispute, regardless of the way the deal was structured.
"There have been clauses for work stoppages in our deals with the N.B.A. for the past 15 years, so this one is no different," Hughes said. "We're not taking sides throughout the whole process. We have been partners with the league and with the players. We hope the players wouldn't hold the contract against us."
Said Billy Hunter, the union executive director, "We're not going to do anything that would be negligent or detrimental to the overall success of the league, but our players are not looking very favorably" on NBC and Turner Sports.
"A lot of players have actually stated that they're not going to do interviews with either network," Hunter said.
The consequences for a network boycott could be costly, resulting in huge fines for players who refused interviews. The owners and the union are still negotiating player-conduct issues, some of which entail how much players should be docked for failing to make themselves available for mandatory news media sessions.
At any rate, it is one thing for the league and the players to brood about lost games and lost paychecks in a lockout that has already led to the cancellation of the first month of the regular season. But that NBC and Turner Sports -- which shows games on TBS and TNT -- could emerge as the next casualties of the four-month-old stalemate left N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern befuddled.
"These are outlets that provide interviews, that provide studio jobs for our players, that do additional shows and that provide new careers for them," Stern said yesterday. "If anything, they are the most responsible for the growth of this sport and the success of the sport and the salaries that our players earn."
He added, "I'm comfortable that when we make the deal, reality will be reaffirmed."
The new four-year deal between the league, NBC and Turner Sports was announced last fall, a total $2.6 billion package that was awarded without competitive bidding. While the contract provided for work-stoppage protection for the league, the networks did include clauses to recoup the losses incurred in paying for games that might not be played. In NBC's case, the compensation will be either a rebate or reduced rights fees in the final three years of the deal. Turner Sports will be given extra games to broadcast.
Privately, league officials believe the players are trying to pull the networks into the fray in order that NBC and Turner Sports might exert pressure on the owners to cut a deal and get the season started. During a news conference in Manhattan on Wednesday, Hunter alluded to NBC's recent layoffs.
"One of the things you also have to look at is what's happening with NBC," Hunter said. "NBC is one of the networks that has underwritten the latest TV deal, which in a way helps finance the lockout. I read the papers every day, and I saw that NBC is experiencing some rather significant problems themselves. I don't think NBC and TNT will stand by and let there not be a season."
The union believes that the approximately $16 million in guaranteed revenue for each of the 29 teams this season has essentially amounted to a savings account for owners. And Hunter singled out the lack of competitive bidding on the contract, saying: "David's position has always been because NBC has been with the N.B.A. for so long, they've become like a family. They've helped insure the success of the league. So he's inclined to enter into some agreeable arrangement with them."
Hunter continued: "Had the TV contract not been structured the way it is, it would have made it a lot more difficult for the N.B.A. to load up. If they're sure they're going to be paid, the economic impact on the owners is not as severe."
NBC's first scheduled television date this season is a Christmas Day game between the Knicks and the Chicago Bulls, part of an N.B.A. doubleheader. TNT and TBS televise on Tuesday, Wednesday and Fridays of each week during the regular season.

HEADLINE: Hurricane Pounds Honduras for Third Day

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LA CEIBA, Honduras, Oct. 29

 BODY:
A hurricane continued today to pound the coast for the third day. Flooding has led more than 150,000 people to seek safety.
The hurricane, called Mitch, formerly among the most powerful of the century, has weakened. But its downpours flooded dozens of rivers, and its waves attacked the shoreline. At least 32 people have been killed. This afternoon the storm had sustained winds of 75 miles an hour, well below the peak of 180 on Tuesday. 
 After having been practically stationary for more than a day, the center of the 350-mile-wide storm had moved slightly southeast, moving inland near Limon, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. The hurricane could strengthen if it moves over water, forecasters said.
Officials in Mexico eased emergency measures on the Yucatan coast, where hundreds of people remained in shelters on Wednesday night. More than 20,000 tourists had abandoned Cancun and nearby resorts, leaving hotels at 20 percent of capacity.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: INDIANA;
District May Be a Barometer, Thanks to a Tight Race and Early Results

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: JEFFERSONVILLE, Ind., Oct. 28

 BODY:
One of the first clues next Tuesday night about the trend in this year's elections will be the early returns from the Congressional race here in southeastern Indiana.
Representative Lee H. Hamilton, a Democrat, is retiring after 34 years in Congress. The race to succeed him, which by all accounts is extremely close, matches two aggressive, well-financed candidates who take positions that vary not a whit from the dogma of their respective national parties. 
 The polls in Indiana close by 7 P.M., and the results are usually among the first to be announced. The outcome of the contest, in the Ninth District, may be a harbinger for results in swing seats everywhere, especially in the 32 other districts where incumbents are not seeking re-election.
"This could be a barometer for the country," said Amy Walter, who tracks House races for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter in Washington. "It may say something about turnout and about what's happening in other places where good Democratic candidates are running in rural, conservative-leaning districts."
This is the third time the Republican, Jean Leising, a former State Senator, has run for the seat. She lost a close race to Mr. Hamilton in 1994, the year of the Republican sweep nationally, and was badly beaten in 1996.
Because of these two races, Ms. Leising, 49, began this campaign well known throughout the sprawling district, which has 21 counties and no town large enough to support its own television station. Republicans in Washington see the race as a prime opportunity to pick up a seat that has been Democratic for a generation. Speaker Newt Gingrich and the 1996 Presidential and Vice Presidential nominees, Bob Dole and Jack F. Kemp, have been here to campaign for Ms. Leising (pronounced LYE-sing).
Her Democratic opponent, Baron Hill, 45, started out without the same degree of name recognition. Mr. Hill served in the State Legislature in the 1980's and ran unsuccessfully in 1990 against Senator Daniel R. Coats. But Mr. Hill, a retirement planner at Merrill Lynch, has been out of the public eye for most of this decade. He tried to overcome this by raising more than $800,000 and beginning television advertisements much sooner than his opponent.
But it is extraordinarily expensive to reach all the voters with television advertisements. People in the district get their television from five cities: Indianapolis; Louisville, Ky.; Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio, and Evansville, Ind.
As a result, both candidates spend their days crisscrossing the district from one town to another, giving their standard speeches and then hopping back into their cars to rush to the next rally.
On Tuesday, Mr. Hill, accompanied in a van by Mr. Hamilton and Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon, hit seven towns. Ms. Leising wound up her day after 9 P.M. at a Farm Bureau meeting in Madison, on the Ohio River about half-way between Louisville and Cincinnati. She was an hour late, and the meeting was over by the time she arrived. But she gathered the 20 stragglers who were downing the last of the cookies and cider and gave her speech anyway.
The issues that divide Ms. Leising and Mr. Hill are the ones that separate Republicans from Democrats from coast to coast. Ms. Leising emphasizes lower taxes and smaller Government. Mr. Hill stresses the importance of Government programs like Social Security, Medicare and aid to education.
Mr. Hill favors gun control; Ms. Leising opposes it. He supports abortion rights; she would outlaw abortion in almost all cases.
Ms. Leising would allow Social Security money to be invested in the stock market; Mr. Hill would not. She wants to give parents vouchers to pay for tuition at private schools; he talks about reducing class sizes in public schools.
The scandal in Washington almost never comes up. Ms. Leising has called for President Clinton's resignation, but she never raises the issue. Mr. Hill says he will not make up his mind until the impeachment investigation is concluded.
Mr. Hill says he is following in the footsteps of Mr. Hamilton, a studious, mild-mannered Democratic stalwart who is popular at home and who, when his party was in the majority, was chairman at various times of the Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Joint Economic Committees, as well as the panel that investigated the Iran-contra matter.
Speaking on Mr. Hill's behalf at a rally in this suburb of Louisville, Mr. Hamilton said: "He's a centrist, a moderate, fiscally conservative. He's a Hoosier to the core."
Ms. Leising takes issue with that. In an interview, she said of Mr. Hill: "He is much more liberal than this district. The people here are fiscally and socially conservative, and they're pro-business."
She is right about the conservative nature of the district, but President Clinton carried the district, by about 500 votes in 1992 and about 1,500 in 1996. Governor O'Bannon, whose hometown, Corydon, is in the district, carried it handily in 1996.
Ms. Leising says she is confident she will win. Mr. Hill says the race is a toss-up. Governor O'Bannon said that Ms. Leising had probably been ahead but that Mr. Hill had drawn even.
The answer will come on Tuesday night, well before most of the other close races in the country are decided.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE PUBLIC;
G.O.P Given Ethics Edge in Poll, but Democrats Rate Higher on 3 Issues

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE with JANET ELDER 

 BODY:
As Republicans and Democrats compete for advantage in the dash toward Election Day, Americans view Republicans as more ethical but say Democrats can better tackle the pivotal issues of education, health care and the future of Medicare and Social Security, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows. And nearly 7 out of 10 said the drama that has dominated the news throughout the year -- the White House sex scandal -- would not affect how they voted in Congressional races.
The survey also found that the outcome of Tuesday's Congressional elections could shift significantly, depending on which party can best move -- maybe even goad -- its supporters to the polls. 
 If turnout is average for a midterm election, for example, neither side has a particular edge in the popular vote. But the poll showed that Republicans' prospects would surge if, as some political analysts predict, turnout is unusually low.
The poll helps explain why House Republicans decided unexpectedly late this week to inject the scandal into the closing debate with a multimillion-dollar advertising blitz. It also explains why Democrats fired back with a commercial of their own that emphasizes issues -- and the need to move beyond the scandal.
At the close of a seemingly mercurial election season, featuring a stormy and late session of Congress, Democrats and Republicans are playing to their strengths: The poll found that one issue on which Republicans have a decided advantage over Democrats -- 41 percent to 24 percent -- is who has higher moral standards.
By contrast, people expressed far greater confidence in Democrats on a host of consequential issues. Fifty-one percent voiced confidence that Democrats could improve education; only 30 percent said that of Republicans. And 57 percent said Democrats were more likely to improve the health care system; only 24 percent said that of Republicans.
Perhaps most striking, in what may be a sign of peril for Republicans well beyond next week's election, the survey found that the party had lost its edge on the issue of tax cuts, long a centerpiece of Republican campaigns.
While many candidates are still hammering away about taxes this year, the poll found that the public no longer associates Republicans with reducing taxes any more than Democrats.
Also encouraging for Democrats, the survey found a wide public view that President Clinton is doing a good job, a belief that has prevailed despite the reverberations since January about his affair with Monica S. Lewinsky.
Sixty-five percent of Americans gave Mr. Clinton a high job approval rating; the same proportion approved of his handling of foreign policy. And 74 percent approve of how he is handling the economy.
The nationwide telephone poll of 1,118 adults was conducted Monday through Wednesday. It has a margin of sampling error of three percentage points in either direction.
Unlike Presidential campaigns, when the public's interest increases closer to Election Day, the midterm election has failed to generate such movement this year, the poll found. That may be because there do not seem to be any galvanizing issues, as is often the case in midterm campaigns.
In fact, despite the broad perceptions of the parties, many contests for the House, the Senate and governor will turn on local issues, strengths and weaknesses of individual candidates and the potency and force of local advertising.
"Voters are all over the map," said Fred Yang, a Democratic pollster. "There's no roiling issues. And there aren't any roiling themes."
Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster, said, "Neither side has really had a rallying cry."
It is a far different, and certainly calmer, environment than at this point four years ago when voters were furious about the proposed Clinton health care plan and uncertain about the economic picture. At that time, barely half of Americans rated the national economy as good; now the figure is more than 80 percent. Then, more than 70 percent disapproved of the way Congress handled its job; that figure is now 49 percent. In the subsequent elections of 1994, voters ousted Democrats from control of the House for the first time in 40 years.
But this year, incumbents in both parties can take solace that the public is far less restless than in past elections. Half the respondents said that their own representative deserved re-election. And 65 percent disagreed with the notion that Government would work better if all new people were elected this year. In November 1994, 54 percent disagreed with that notion; in June of 1992, 49 percent disagreed.
While no national poll can anticipate what will happen in specific states and Congressional districts on Election Day, the survey found that neither Democrats nor Republicans are enjoying any significant advantage. More than anything else, the outcome may be tied to turnout.
If turnout remains relatively steady for a midterm election -- at about 39 percent of the voting-age population -- the poll showed 48 percent favoring Republicans and 43 percent favoring Democrats. But that is within the margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points if 39 percent vote.
If turnout is unusually high, about 47 percent, the vote would be 45 percent for Republicans and 44 percent for Democrats. But the fewer people who go to the polls, the greater the Republicans' advantage. If turnout is only 31 percent, 51 percent would support Republican candidates while 41 percent would back Democrats.
The poll also underscored why even some Republicans fear that the commercials capitalizing on Mr. Clinton's troubles could backfire. The public continues to view the impeachment inquiry in Congress as having more to do with attempts at political gain by Republicans than a sincere investigation of serious crimes.
A majority of Americans view the House Judiciary Committee's handling of the matter negatively; most expressed little faith that the hearings would be conducted fairly. The public is three times more likely to blame Republicans than Democrats for that partisanship.
More than two-thirds of the public said Mr. Clinton's actions were not consequential enough to warrant his being impeached and removed from office. A plurality (39 percent) want the matter dropped entirely. Nearly three-quarters of all Americans say it would be better for the country if Mr. Clinton finished his term rather than resigned, a seven-point increase from a poll conducted two weeks ago.
Though a plurality chose Republicans over Democrats on the question of who has higher moral standards, neither party is viewed as putting forward candidates who are more honest. But 47 percent say Republicans are seen as better able to uphold traditional family values, compared with 31 percent for Democrats.
But Democrats are viewed as more likely to understand the needs and problems of American families by a margin of 50 percent to 28 percent. On issue after issue, Democrats had an advantage over Republicans.
For instance, 53 percent of those polled said Democrats were more likely to make the right decisions about Medicare; only 28 percent said that of Republicans. Fifty-two percent said Democrats would make the right decisions about Social Security; for Republicans the figure was 29 percent.
People also said, by 44 percent to 33 percent, that the Democratic Party had better ideas than the Republican Party for leading the country into the 21st century.
Upholding a pattern that has persisted for years, even though people are relatively satisfied with their own representatives, voters registered harsher evaluations of Congress as a whole. Nearly two-thirds said that most members of Congress had not done a good enough job to deserve re-election.
In particular, most Americans give low marks to the current session of Congress. A majority said Congress accomplished less in 1997 and 1998 than lawmakers do in a typical two-year period.
Asked whether their own representative cared more about their needs or those of special interest groups, 45 percent said their needs and 39 percent cited interest groups. But asked about Congress in general, 64 percent said most representatives were more interested in doing the work of special interest groups than in addressing the concerns of voters.
Lambasting the Republican-controlled Congress, one poll respondent, Emmajean Dry, 59, of Dallas, said in a follow-up interview, "Congress has done nothing except try to get rid of Clinton -- and ruin the Democrats." Ms. Dry said she planned to vote for Democrats next week.
William Selby, a Republican respondent to the poll who installs garage doors in Maryland, said he was not dissatisfied with Congress. "Congress is doing well, doing what they were elected to do," said Mr. Selby, 32. "Impeachment hearings are what they should be doing by law." But, he said of the scandal, "they could probably be doing more if they didn't have the Presidential issue."
The public was divided over whether the country needed a Republican Congress to keep a check on a Democratic President.
The survey also found that Speaker Newt Gingrich's low positive rating had dipped to its lowest levels since January 1997, when he was embroiled in an ethics case. His positive rating now stands at 18 percent; his negative rating is 43 percent.
Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, is still unknown to most Americans even though he is presiding over the impeachment inquiry. Sixty-two percent of Americans said they did not know enough about him to register an opinion.
In a year when as many as two-thirds of Americans are expected to stay clear of the polls on Election Day, the survey found that those people stand out in several ways from those who plan to vote.
The nonvoters, for instance, are younger, less educated, have lower incomes and tend to prefer Democratic candidates. Sixty-three percent of those who said they would not vote had not attended college, while only 43 percent of the expected voters had not attended college. Forty percent of the nonvoters have family incomes of under $30,000 a year, compared with 24 percent of the expected voters. And 32 percent of non-voters are under the age of 30, compared with 13 percent of the voters.
When it comes to whom they prefer for Congress, 49 percent of the nonvoters said Democrats and 27 percent said Republicans. Those who were expected to vote were evenly divided.
Even people who say they plan to vote expressed dismay with the state of American politics.
"I disagree with all the negativism," said Mathew Feldman, 65, a Democrat from Maryland. "It has turned me off to a degree. I wish it focused on what individuals can and will do, not just knocking down the other person. There is a lot of money being wasted on all campaigns."

AS EARNINGS FALL, COOPER CAMERON WILL CUT MORE JOBS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Cooper Cameron Corporation said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings fell 5.3 percent and that it would cut more jobs and take additional charges to pay for an expanded revamping, as low oil and natural gas prices reduce demand for its equipment. Cooper Cameron, a Houston-based oil-field services and equipment company, said it would cut about 1,000 jobs, an increase from the 500 it announced last month. The jobs represent 10 percent of its work force. It will also take charges in the fourth and first quarters totaling $17 million. Shares of Cooper Cameron fell 68.75 cents, to $33.1875.

WITH MARKETS WEAK, AGCO PLANS TO ELIMINATE 1,400 JOBS

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
The farm equipment maker Agco Corporation said yesterday that it would cut 1,400 jobs and take a fourth-quarter charge of $35 million to $40 million in the face of continued weakness in world agricultural markets. Agco, based in Duluth, Ga., earned $17.9 million, or 30 cents a diluted share, on sales of $665.7 million in the three months ended Sept. 30. In last year's third quarter, which included a one-time charge, Agco earned $47.3 million, or 75 cents a share, on revenue of $759.5 million. The job cuts represent 12 percent of Agco's work force and will be concentrated in its manufacturing operations in Europe, North America and South America.

EUROPE
 
BRITAIN: BLAIR AIDE FORCED TO QUIT -- The Government of Prime Minister Tony Blair has suffered its first forced resignation since taking office 18 months ago. Ron Davies is out as Secretary for Wales after he was robbed Monday night by strangers he invited into his car in an area known as a meeting place for homosexuals and drug dealers. Mr. Blair has often attacked the previous Conservative Government for the number of its members who left office in disgrace. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
BRITAIN: NEW VOTE PROCEDURES PROPOSED -- A commission headed by the former Finance Minister, Lord Jenkins, proposed new proportional voting procedures in elections for the House of Commons that would give small parties greater representation and make Continental-style coalition governments more likely. Prime Minister Tony Blair has promised a referendum on the current "first-past-the-post" electoral system, in which the winner takes all, sometimes even without a majority of votes. Warren Hoge (NYT) 

NORTHERN IRELAND: A MISSED DEADLINE -- The Irish Foreign Minister, David Andrews, and Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, said a pivotal deadline would be missed in Northern Ireland because of a dispute over disarming the Irish Republican Army. They said the issue would not be resolved before the Saturday deadline for setting up a new North-South ministerial council. The I.R.A. says it will not disarm until the entire peace accord is enacted. Protestants insist some disarmament must begin soon. James F. Clarity (NYT)
 
RUSSIA: A CAVEAT ON FOOD DONATIONS -- Russia warned the United States that while it welcomed offers of food to help it through the winter, it did not want donor countries to "dump" their produce in Russia. Agriculture Minister Viktor Semyonov said Moscow would welcome help only if it did not hurt struggling domestic producers. (Agence France-Presse)
 
RUSSIA: KAMCHATKA SEEKS FUEL AID -- The Far Eastern region of Kamchatka appealed for United Nations aid to buy fuel after two weeks of daily power cuts and practically nonexistent heating in subzero temperatures, the daily newspaper Trud reported. It said the regional government had lost all hope of receiving aid from Moscow. This week residents on Shitokan in the Kurile Islands southwest of Kamchatka threatened to rent their island to the Japanese unless the Russian Government fixed the electrical plant. (Agence France-Presse)
 
GERMANY: ISRAELIS IN BERLIN IN 2000 -- Israel said it would open its first embassy in Berlin in 2000 on the former property of a Jewish businessman, Herrmann Schoendorff, who fled Germany for Paris in 1934. Berlin will become the German capital again next year. Roger Cohen (NYT)
 
TURKEY: CASPIAN OIL ROUTE -- Leaders of countries around the Caspian Sea declared today that they want to export their new-found oil along a pipeline route favored by the United States. Competition for the pipeline is nearing a peak as oil companies prepare to announce which route they favor. They may make their choice as early as next month. President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan said he and his counterparts had signed "a declaration of historic importance." Joining Mr. Aliyev at today's signing were the Presidents of Georgia, Turkey, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Stephen Kinzer (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
CHINA: DEFICIT WITH U.S. DEFENDED -- China defended its growing trade surplus with the United States, saying the situation would have been far worse had Beijing devalued its currency because of the Asian financial crisis. The United States trade deficit with China reached $5.9 billion by the end of August. (Agence France-Presse)
 
CHINA: EUROPE PRESSES TRADE TIES -- The President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer, began a six-day visit to China, the first visit in 12 years by a head of the European Union. The Europeans hope to strengthen trade ties, and will encourage China to use the euro, to be introduced on Jan. 1, as an alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency and means of financing foreign debt. Erik Eckholm (NYT)
 
KYRGYZSTAN: SEIZED ARMS GOING BACK TO IRAN -- Kyrgyzstan, which intercepted an Iranian train carrying munitions bound for forces opposed to the Taliban in Afghanistan this month, will send the arms back to Iran soon, Kyrgyzstan officials said. The train was intercepted in the southern town of Osh on Oct. 10. (Reuters)
 
JAPAN: AFRICAN DEBTS FORGIVEN -- Japan will in effect forgive 90 percent of the debts incurred by 10 African countries in the 10 years up to last March, the Kyodo news agency reported. Kyodo quoted Japanese officials as saying Tokyo will give the countries grants equivalent to what they would have had to repay Japanese lenders in the coming years. The grants amount to $510 million. (Agence France-Presse)
 
AFRICA
 
NIGERIA: EUROPEAN SANCTIONS EASED -- The European Union has decided to partially lift sanctions on Nigeria as a reward for the military Government's commitment to return the country to civilian rule next year, officials in Brussels said. The sanctions to be lifted include a ban on high-level visits to Nigeria and the issuing of entry visas for members of the Government, and a ban on sporting contacts. But the European body decided to maintain its arms embargo and a ban on military cooperation. It will also withhold most forms of development aid until it is clear that Nigeria's new ruler, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, left, will honor his commitment to hold elections. (Agence France-Presse)

PARAGUAY: LEBANESE SUSPECT HELD -- The Paraguayan police have arrested Sobhi Mahmoud Fayad, a Lebanese suspected of being the link between the Iranian Embassy in Brazil and the guerrilla group Hezbollah operating in Paraguay. Diana Jean Schemo (NYT)

HEADLINE: GLENN RETURNS TO SPACE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
After the Fuss, the Launching Does Look Magical

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES 

 BODY:
During the weeklong media drumbeat leading to John Glenn's voyage into space, the former astronaut Scott Carpenter described one benefit of the flight. As he told MSNBC, "The nation gets to revisit a time of imagination and hope and magic." That sounds more like a description of a Disney film than rocket science, yet it succinctly captures the gilded tone of the television coverage up to and including yesterday's high-profile launching. The networks and all-news channels quickly found their common theme: the return of an American hero. And after 10 months of wallowing in the Lewinsky sex scandal, you could almost feel their relief as they leaped on this wholesome story.
In the last decade television news has virtually ignored space unless a satellite seemed about to tumble from the sky. But all week the network newscasts have been sounding the puffy theme of heroism, interviewing Mr. Glenn and doing features on his historic flight in 1962. 
 And while Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather and Peter Jennings were all there for the launching yesterday, the story was shaped by other voices, from the past. A medium devoted to youth suddenly had an amazing amount of gray hair on display, as former astronauts turned television commentators. There was Mr. Carpenter on NBC, Wally Shirra on ABC and James Lovell on the Fox News Channel. It says a lot about how we have come to perceive the space program that Mr. Lovell may be best identified as the guy Tom Hanks played in "Apollo 13." Most nostalgic of all, covering the flight for CNN was Walter Cronkite, who at 82 is five years older than Mr. Glenn and a far more beloved icon.
There is conspicuous irony, even wrong-headedness, in the way a future-oriented endeavor like space travel has been cloaked in this nostalgic glow. The hoopla over the Glenn flight says a great deal about the media and this social moment. The last year has seen several attempts at media-manufactured heroes. The popularity of Steven Spielberg's World War II movie "Saving Private Ryan" was depicted as a longing for old-time heroes. So was Mark McGwire's race to break Roger Maris's home-run record. And the cover of this week's TV Guide pictures Mr. Glenn and Mr. Cronkite with a headline that reflects the television coverage: "A Time for Heroes."
How much this feeds a genuine public thirst, and how much comes from the media trying desperately to counterbalance its Lewinsky coverage may be an unanswerable question. But there are many hints of media desperation. Mr. Glenn has always inspired greater respect for his place in history than the warmth and affection that the most popular heroes evoke.
And as the week went on, it became impossible to ignore the skeptics' questions: Was Mr. Glenn part of a valid scientific study? Or was his trip about politics and public relations? To the reporters' credit, those questions were not ignored. But they could never become dominant; television was invested in enticing viewers to watch a genuine hero. Subtly, the questions shifted. Even if the science is make-work, Brian Williams asked on MSNBC, "Does John Glenn deserve his victory lap?" Mr. Rather simply added public relations to the equation, and signed off CBS's coverage by calling it "a history-making, publicity-making, sentimental science trip to space."
Oddly, the weeklong television buildup didn't create excitement so much as it made the smooth countdown and launching seem perfunctory. We are accustomed to seeing space televised in more dramatic terms, whether in Mr. Hank's popular miniseries, "From the Earth to the Moon," with its glittering views of the Earth as seen from space, or NASA's own astonishing live television pictures from Mars last year. Listening to anchors and astronauts explaining the details of the flight yesterday seemed anticlimactic.
Yet if you're going to throw a nostalgia-fest, you might as well have a loved figure like Mr. Cronkite around. His very presence, in his own well-earned victory lap, seemed more notable than anything he or any other reporter had to say, and captured the nostalgic essence of the day.
Viewers expecting Mr. Cronkite to take charge of the coverage were bound to be disappointed, though. The hard truth is that he spoke a bit more slowly and seemed less energetic than he used to. And CNN's anchor, Miles O'Brien, seemed slightly uncomfortable through the day, sitting between Mr. Cronkite and other gray-haired guests.
In his most substantial contribution, Mr. Cronkite interviewed President Clinton, who said politics played no role in the selection of Mr. Glenn for this flight and that he would ask Congress for additional money to keep the planned international space station in business if the collapse of the Russian economy calls for it.
And it was strangely satisfying to see Mr. Cronkite compete with himself. At one odd moment, the taped Mr. Cronkite was on CBS, being interviewed by his successor, Mr. Rather. Meanwhile, the live Mr. Cronkite was interviewing the legendary test pilot, Chuck Yaeger, on CNN. Both interviews, of course, were about the past.
For all the backward looks at 1962, the coverage glossed over the public relations and politics that shaped that cold war era. The need to beat the Russians drove the space race, and the pride in Mr. Glenn's orbiting the Earth came with constant fear that the evil Russians would blow the Earth to bits. So much for hope and magic.
Yet after all the fuss, yesterday's launching did look magical. "However you felt about John Glenn and his mission," Mr. Brokaw astutely observed in his sign-off on NBC, "I am confident that it must have changed when those big solid rocket boosters lit up and he left for space at the age of 77." It was a sight spectacular beyond hype. For that brief time, the "Hero Aboard" slogans fell away and the wondrous accomplishment of space travel blazed through.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Out of Politics, but Not Out of Opinions

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
DO you want to take my pulse?" Hugh L. Carey, the former Governor, inquired on the other end of the phone.
Actually, yes. Mr. Carey, 79, was responding to an interview request -- who does he like in the Senate race? what's he been up to? etc. -- and within minutes had reduced the situation to its essence. But as it turned out, he was speaking in classic Carey black humor as well as metaphor. 
 On Oct. 14, Mr. Carey had surgery for an inflamed prostate, and on Oct. 19 he came home. Then the day before yesterday, his pulse evidently strong, the former Democratic Governor of New York held forth for more than two hours in his Upper East Side apartment, hurtling from descriptions of his friendship with Gov. George E. Pataki to his admiration for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to his bizarre second marriage to Evangeline Gouletas who, he said, threw plates at him.
"She was pretty good with those plates," Mr. Carey said. "She had a Mediterranean temper, yeah."
In brief, Mr. Carey's wit is intact, and he looks good.
"I have a pretty active pulse, they tell me," Mr. Carey said yesterday, when he called back to insist that he had not become more politically conservative. "Except for the plumbing that's just been fixed, they say I have the physique of a moderately middle-aged man." His hair, which was varying shades of orange throughout his political career, is now a light brown, with small bits of gray. "It's pretty close to my natural color," Mr. Carey said. "Whatever that is."
Unlike former Mayor Edward I. Koch and former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Carey has stayed largely out of politics since finishing his second term in 1982. Considered brilliant by his fans, quirky by everyone else, Mr. Carey is the governor who rescued New York City and State from financial collapse. But he did not seek a third term, or run for President, after he married Ms. Gouletas, a real-estate developer whose third ex-husband -- she at first said she had two -- surfaced only after her marriage to Mr. Carey.
Still, Mr. Carey has opinions. He thinks the Senate race between Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato and Representative Charles E. Schumer is far too close to call, but that if "Schumer doesn't make this, he might be in the run for Mayor. Either way, Schumer's made his mark." Mr. Carey wouldn't say who he was voting for, but did say he differs with Mr. Schumer on some issues, including Mr. Schumer's vote against the ban on "partial-birth" abortions.
Mr. Carey was not overly enthusiastic about Mr. D'Amato, either, but did say in an interview five years ago, "I suspect if somebody drops a watch down a culvert, he calls D'Amato and he'll get the watch out."
In the governor's race between Mr. Pataki and City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, Mr. Carey said that "here you've got two very competent men." His favorite is clearly Mr. Pataki, who in 1994 put Mr. Carey on his transition team. "I made a habit as Governor of courting former Governors," Mr. Carey said. "I would always make the mansion available, or send a plane or a car to pick them up." Unlike Mr. Cuomo, whom Mr. Carey said never invited him to the mansion, Mr. Pataki has.
Mr. Carey described his life as the pleasant one of a country squire who enjoys 12 children and 15 grandchildren on some 30 acres the family bought last year on Shelter Island. (Mr. Carey retired as executive vice president of the W.R. Grace & Company in 1995, and is now of counsel to two law firms. He also serves on boards.) It was Mr. Carey's idea to buy the property, which he saw was for sale while he was laid up for spinal surgery in 1996.
"So I was in the hospital, the kids keep coming in to check on me, and I say, 'The will is not in action yet! No will yet!' " Mr. Carey said. The Carey Trust -- Mr. Carey said he has turned over all his assets to his children -- eventually bought the property. "We do everything by caucus," he said. "I'm really not the patriarch. I'm one lonely vote. Especially since they now have control of the loot."
Mr. Carey said he would have run for President in 1984 against Ronald Reagan had he not married Ms. Gouletas, and that he looked back on his failed marriage with her as "a religious lesson" for which he paid a high price. "It made me look ludicrous in the eyes of the state," he said. Before, he added, "I was respected as a Governor, I was a sole parent, I had dates with nice girls. So the worst is, I gave scandal. You do not give scandal. When I gave scandal, I left politics."
Mr. Carey's first wife, Helen, died in 1974. Two of his sons died in an automobile accident in 1969. His 36-year-old son, Paul, a Securities and Exchange commissioner, is recently back at work after treatment for cancer of the endocrine system, but stays with his father when he is in New York. The younger Mr. Carey said yesterday that he remembers how his father was lauded as a "Governor for hard winters," but in his eyes he is a "father for hard winters."
In the mornings these days, Mr. Carey takes an early walk, stops in to chat with his old friend the doctor, Kevin Cahill, and goes to daily Mass at St. Vincent Ferrer Church on Lexington Avenue. "It's a very easy half-hour in beautiful surroundings," Mr. Carey said. "Not a bad way to kick your day off." And, he said cheerfully, "I figure as I'm getting to the evening of my life, I'm beginning to pack my bags for the journey."

From the hushed executive floor of the International Monetary Fund, where he reigns as the No. 2 official, from his car and from the airplanes he is always rushing to catch, Mr. Fischer has been engaged in a constant negotiation with Pedro Malan, Brazil's Finance Minister. They have tangled over just how to cut the Brazilian budget, raise taxes and deal with an overvalued currency even as they are united in their determination that Brazil's unpredictable and sometimes recalcitrant Congress buy the deal the Government made public this week. 
 All the while, Mr. Fischer has been involved in an equally complex byplay with Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, who is trying to persuade the I.M.F. to contribute more to Brazil's cause -- to have a better shot at stabilizing the country and to assure that the United States will have to put up less money of its own. The I.M.F. will contribute at least $15 billion and the United States is expected to throw in between $3 and $5 billion.
As Mr. Fischer, a 55-year-old former professor of economics from M.I.T., performs this political and economic highwire act, he is, typically, keeping his own counsel. But hovering over his every calculation is the knowledge that the I.M.F. cannot afford another failure. Another Russia or another Indonesia would be a disaster not just for the I.M.F. but for the world economy, too. If what he delicately calls the "Brazil stabilization plan" fails to stabilize Brazil, once again the institution that was designed to bring order to the world economy will be accused of fueling the disorder.
"Look, I know we've become everyone's favorite whipping boy," Mr. Fischer, whose formal title is first deputy managing director of the I.M.F., mused one summer afternoon, when Moscow's troubles dominated the day and Brazil's were still germinating. "But remember that in most cases governments call us in only after they discover they are in a mess, usually because they didn't do things they needed to do long ago. If the problems were easy to solve, they'd do it themselves. And it's our job to convince people to do things that we believe, and they probably know, are good for them. Even if those things are politically unpopular -- and they usually are."
But while Mr. Fischer coaxes along crisis-wracked politicians from Brasilia to Moscow to Seoul, he is also fighting a rearguard action against the traditions of the I.M.F., and against the institution's legions of critics.
He is trying to reinvigorate a tradition-bound, often narrow-minded bureaucracy that has never quite adjusted to a world of 24-hour markets and has proven astoundingly ill-prepared for the challenge of designing economic plans that will fit the political realities of the countries where the I.M.F. is sent in as the lender of last resort.
But while he tries to change the fund from the inside he is also defending it against outsiders -- other economists, members of Congress, even ostensible colleagues across the street at the I.M.F.'s sister institution, the World Bank. Few of the critics agree with each other about what the fund should have done differently. But each is certain that it has been wrongheaded, insensitive, beholden to big bankers and prone to make its patients sicker.
Mr. Fischer is lucky: Most of the public heat for the I.M.F.'s prescriptions are directed at his boss, Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, who plays Mr. Outside, dealing with presidents and prime ministers.
But when it comes to the hard bargaining, negotiating the programs countries promise to carry out in return for the I.M.F.'s help, it is Mr. Fischer who signs off on the details. He cuts the deals over how much countries must rein in their spending, how they will arrange to collect extra taxes, what kind of pet projects they must kill, and how they should attack crony capitalism and corruption. Just how much power he holds is a matter of debate.
Finance ministers around the world claim that Mr. Fischer is the first button on their speed-dialers. This summer, as the I.M.F. team was working out the final details of what turned out to be a doomed-from-the-start deal with Russia, Mr. Fischer conducted the final talks from a cell phone as he stood atop a sand dune on Martha's Vineyard, where he was on vacation.
"It looked like a bad scene out of 'Lawrence of Arabia,' " he said.
The I.M.F.'s critics insist that Mr. Fischer's power is overstated. To them, he seems to mostly do the bidding of the United States. He was put in his job four years ago, chiefly because of American influence, suggested for the job by Mr. Summers, who clearly sought a like-minded economist for the post.
But as the United States, the largest power in the fund, intercedes in the biggest bailouts, there is also some tension in the relationship. "It's fair to say," one senior United States official noted this summer, as tempers rose over how to deal with the financial collapse of Russia, "that Stan is getting a little tired of us."
Others say that Mr. Fischer struggles to work within the confines of Mr. Camdessus's I.M.F. "A complete French bureaucracy," one official at the neighboring World Bank calls it. Mr. Fischer has tried to invigorate that bureaucracy, pushing its staff, long accustomed to leisurely reviews of the state of national economies, to stay more on top of developments. They drew the line, though, at wearing beepers.
He has tried to convince the fund to monitor markets and political developments around the clock -- much as the United States Treasury does -- rather than simply lock all the doors of its headquarters at nights and on weekends. According to I.M.F. lore, at least one desperate Asian finance minister, caught in the midst of an off-hours currency crisis, found himself explaining his problems to a security guard, who was the only one around to answer the phones at night.
Mr. Fischer has also directly taken on the I.M.F.'s critics, most recently in an unusual essay in The Economist, explaining the rationale behind the fund's more controversial bailouts. In speeches he has even admitted to occasional self-doubts about whether the fund's approach was always right, sentiments rarely heard from Mr. Camdessus.
"The only way I know how to do this job is to read the criticisms, many of them by my former colleagues, and then ask the question 'Are these guys right?' " Mr. Fischer said recently. "If the answer is yes, you adjust."
The adjustments have been particularly visible in Indonesia, where, stung by the criticism that it was punishing 100 million desperately poor people to pay for the sins of a handful of extraordinarily rich bankers, the fund is now relaxing the austerity measures to allow the Government to spend more on food subsidies and dropping its demands that the food distribution monopoly be broken up.
Even some of the harshest critics of the I.M.F.'s approach give credit to Mr. Fischer for changing course -- at least a few degrees -- once he recognized that the fund's traditional remedies were failing.
"He can't escape blame for some of the fund's blunders," says a longtime friend, Allen Sinai, the chief economist of Primark Decision Economics. "But he is more flexible, more balanced, more able to walk a delicate line between the I.M.F.'s principles and what will actually work politically than anyone I've ever seen over there."
Mr. Fischer is the first to defend the I.M.F.'s orthodoxy over the last 16 months of turmoil. The best way to get a country back on its feet, he says, is to put a stop to wild government overspending and to pump up interest rates to prevent currency devaluations.
Mr. Fischer says that the passage of time is proving that his formulas can work. "When we were called into Korea they were essentially out of resources," he said. "Now, in Korea and Thailand, stabilization of the currencies has clearly succeeded. We expected that if the currencies stabilized, interest rates would come back down. And that's exactly what has happened.
"Why did we focus so much on stabilizing the currencies?" he asked rhetorically. "Because if you do not, you get a takeoff of inflation."
Within the I.M.F. pantheon, Thailand and South Korea are emerging as success stories. Even there, however, Mr. Fischer cannot escape the critics who argue that those same high interest rates choked off growth and fostered unnecessarily severe recessions.
This week, Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard professor and a strong critic of the I.M.F., contended that the fund was about to make the same mistake again in Brazil. "The budget cuts and those high interest rates are going to send Brazil into a very deep recession," he said. Mr. Sachs advocates letting the Brazilian currency float, a path Mr. Fischer has rejected as too likely to encourage a price spiral.
Mr. Fischer's closest friend in economics, Rudiger Dornbusch, who wrote a textbook with him, has offered an alternative. Brazil should adopt a currency board, which would require the country to keep huge foreign reserves on hand to fix the real, the Brazilian currency, against the dollar.
It is no surprise that Mr. Fischer is attuned first and foremost to the dangers of hyperinflation. He made his name in academia, and his debut as a global economic player, fighting it. But it was a circuitous path that began in Northern Rhodesia -- now Zambia -- where his father was an immigrant merchant from Latvia and his mother from Lithuania.
A British education in Rhodesia led him to the London School of Economics, then the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned his Ph.D., before going on to the University of Chicago at the end of Milton Friedman's era. "At M.I.T. you did the mathematical work," he said, "and at Chicago you asked the question of how this applies to the real world."
Mr. Summers dates his first encounters with Mr. Fischer as a student of his at M.I.T. "I think I was auditing, so he didn't have to grade me," Mr. Summers said, recalling that "he was a first-rate macroeconomic theorist who stayed first rate as his interests became more applied and policy-oriented."
Mr. Fischer was pushed into that transition by George P. Schultz, the Secretary of State during the Reagan Administration. In the mid-1980's, Mr. Schultz was trying to figure out how to halt hyperinflation in Israel. With the analytical help of Mr. Fischer and Herbert Stein, a former chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, Mr. Schultz did to Israel what the I.M.F. does to many countries today: He presented a painful plan for straightening out the economy, with the promise that aid could follow. "Stan did a remarkable job with it," Mr. Schultz remembered a few months ago.
That dip into public policy hooked Mr. Fischer forever. He went to the World Bank as chief economist and, after returning to M.I.T. for several years, moved to the I.M.F.
But today even Mr. Schultz has parted ways with Mr. Fischer by leading a drive to abolish the I.M.F. (He stopped short of repeating that call a few weeks ago, however, when he was on a panel with Mr. Fischer.)
Meanwhile, the current occupant of Mr. Fischer's old job at the World Bank, Joseph Stiglitz, has been among the I.M.F.'s fiercest critics. Mr. Stiglitz complains that the fund has ignored the social impact of its austerity programs and has pushed countries to open their markets too quickly. Far more gently -- at least in public -- the president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, has joined in the carping.
"It's unfortunate that this conflict has surfaced, and at times it has made things difficult," Mr. Fischer said. "But the fact is that we have adjusted as the situation has changed, and as the crisis got worse than we expected."
The justification for the coming Brazil package -- more than $30 billion in all -- is finally to get a step ahead of the crisis, to inject money and reforms before the country's reserves are depleted and its last investors have fled. Mr. Fischer, though, is seared by the experience in Russia, and wants to gauge how sincere the Brazilians are about carrying through on their belt-tightening before he sends money.
"What Stan learned in Russia," one of his colleagues said, "is that you can look pretty foolish if you mail the check and then the legislature rejects the reforms."
But Mr. Fischer seems to hint in his speeches these days that the I.M.F. may have little choice: If it can't stop the global economic contagion soon, it is unclear where or when it will stop.
"We now have to deal with a crisis in Latin America," he said a week ago, "and most of all, in Brazil. It is a difficult time, but not impossible by any means."

HEADLINE: Amid Diversity Onstage, Passion's a Mother Tongue

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
For a place as wildly diverse as New York, the city's major commercial theater can often seem considerably less so. Sure, "The Beauty Queen of Leenane" is an Irish play, and "Art" is French. The list, and the world, seem pretty much to end right there.
But while Broadway's idea of exotic fare may be a West End import, in neighborhoods throughout the city, smaller nonprofit theaters are serving up a feast of original work, seldom-seen plays and new translations from a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds. 
 On any given night, an intrepid theatergoer might encounter a reading of new German plays, a modern romantic comedy performed in Yiddish or a Bengali-language production of Arthur Miller's "View From the Bridge."
This weekend is no exception. Tonight, for example, at Repertorio Espanol, on East 27th Street in Manhattan, audiences can see one of the first American performances of "She Looks White (Parece Blanca)" by Aberlardo Estorino, a Cuban playwright. It is being performed by a company of eight Cuban actors allowed into the United States through an exchange program between the theater and the Cuban authorities.
Across town tonight, on West 22d Street, the Irish Repertory Theater is offering the first preview of "The Shaughraun (The Vagabond)," a 19th-century comedy by Dion Boucicault advertised as involving "swashbuckling swordplay, lots of kissing and a dog." And uptown, on Theater Row, the Intar Center for the Hispanic Arts just began a two-month festival of the works of Federico Garcia Lorca, considered Spain's greatest modern playwright. It includes a pair of rarely produced works, "The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife," a 1929 farce, and "As Five Years Pass," his Dali-inspired experiment with Surrealism.
Some of the fare has a political edge. On Sunday, the Jewish Repertory opens its 25th season with a revival of "Kuni-Leml," a 1984 musical based on an 1880 play about an arranged Hasidic marriage and a young woman's rebellion against it. And at the New Federal Theater, the city's oldest professional black company, the current production is "The Trial of One Shortsighted Black Woman vs. Mammy Louise and Safreeta Mae," a satire described by the playwright, Marcia L. Leslie, as "what Aunt Jemima would say if she popped off the pancake box."
All in all, the city is home to more than 30 so-called ethnic theater companies, a loose term for troupes that devote their efforts to producing plays from and fostering appreciation for a specific cultural heritage. They range from established veterans like Repertorio Espanol and the Irish Repertory, both with annual budgets of more than $1 million, to young experimental troupes like the Slant Performance Group, a trio of Asian-American performers whose rock-infused presentations include satirical show stoppers like "Secret Asian Man," and "The Buddha Blues."
And unlike the Broadway and Off Broadway houses, these theaters span the city, from Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, where troupes made up of recent Russian immigrants are beginning to form, to the Bronx, where longstanding Irish and Italian communities have their own local companies.
Here's a look at some of the groups that add spice to the city's theatrical melting pot.
 
Spanish Spoken Here
As the home of hundreds of thousands of Dominicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Mexicans and other Latin Americans, the city has encouraged a vibrant Hispanic theater scene, with older companies like Intar, the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater and Repertorio Espanol, all founded in the late 1960's, and smaller new troupes.
The Repertorio, started in 1968, is perhaps the most active ethnic theater in New York. Its resident actors sometimes perform as many as five different shows in a week. Next weekend, they will perform "La Gringa," a play by Carmen Rivera, on Friday night. On Saturday, it's "Yerma," by Garcia Lorca, and "She Looks White," and then on Sunday, the Cuban play "Strawberry and Chocolate." All performances are in Spanish with simultaneous English translation by an offstage actor.
"I came to America feeling I had a duty to bring to life one of the world's great bodies of work," said Rene Buch, the company's Cuban-born artistic director. He added with a laugh, "And I'm still at it."
Mr. Buch, 70, also seems intent on exporting the company's work; this year the troupe traveled to Havana to perform Eduardo Machado's "Broken Eggs." The actors were the first Americans to appear onstage in Cuba in nearly 40 years.
Meanwhile, at Intar, founded in 1966, Max Ferra, the artistic director, has been organizing an ambitious program of performances and lectures to commemorate the centennial of the birth of Garcia Lorca, who was killed by Franco's soldiers in 1936. The festival began on Wednesday and runs through Dec. 20.
"Everybody's always talking about Lorca, Lorca, Lorca," Mr. Ferra said. "But it's funny: almost nobody's seen much of his work."
While the Puerto Rican Traveling Company, founded in 1967, will not present a new show until the spring, the Pregones Theater, established in 1979 in the South Bronx, will present "San Miguel, Amarra tu Perro!" in late November.
Then there's the Thalia Spanish Theater in Sunnyside, Queens, which performs in Spanish, as Repertorio does. The company's next production is "The Fanlights," by the Puerto Rican playwright Rene Marques, which it will present with another Manhattan company, Teatro Circulo. The play, dealing with three sisters (not Chekhov's), opens on Nov. 7.
The younger troupes include the Teatro Experimental Blue Amigos, which opens a trio of short plays next Friday. It will be performing in the basement of the Ecuadorean community Center in Long Island City. And on the Lower East Side, three Hispanic companies -- La Tea, Delmar Productions and Vaso de Leche Productions -- perform at the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center, housed in a turn-of-the-century schoolhouse. Tonight you can catch two shows there, "Cimarron II," a collection of Afro-Caribbean scenes and songs presented by La Tea, and "Shophell: Shop Till You Drop," a mystery by the Puerto Rican playwright Jesse Mojica produced by Vaso de Leche.
 
Across the Pacific
Like the Hispanic troupes, Asian-American companies include actors, writers and directors from a number of countries. Different performance traditions influence each company, from the meditative grace of Japan's Noh theater to the frenetic, balletic stick fighting of the Philippines.
Pan Asian Repertory is the oldest of the companies, founded by Tisha Chang in 1976.
"I think the Asian community was one of the last to regard the theater as a respectable or legitimate profession," Ms. Chang said. "It's not so bad now, but 25 years ago it was a few very brave people doing this."
Pan Asian's next show, "Carry the Tiger to the Mountain," opens on Nov. 12. It tells the story of Vincent Chen, a Detroit resident beaten to death by two unemployed auto workers in 1982. The title comes from a move in tai-chi.
Ms. Chang said the Chen case had special resonance in light of the recent brutal slaying of Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student. "It shows, unfortunately, how very relevant it is," she said.
There are also three young companies at work in the city: the Slant Performance Group, the National Asian-American Theater Company and Ma-Yi, a Filipino-American troupe.
The National Asian-American Theater Company, which was started in an East Village basement, emerged in July with a well-received production of "Falsettoland," an Asian take on William Finn's musical of Jewish angst. The group's next show, in February, will also be a revival, this time of a pair of little-performed Brecht plays.
Ma-Yi, too, is not producing till next spring, but Slant is working on its new show, "Hotel California," which deals with a 1977 incident in which hundreds of elderly Filipinos were evicted from a low-income residential hotel in San Francisco. The show opens on Nov. 19.
The group, which mixes rock music, dance and comedy skits in its performance, was started in 1995 by Wayland Quintero, Richard Ebihara and Perry Yung and has since won critical praise.
"Slant must be incapable of dullness," D. J. R. Bruckner wrote in The New York Times in 1996. "No matter how much fun they poke at other people, they laugh at themselves more."
 
Brogue in the Bronx
New York has been flush with imported Irish theater, from Broadway's "Beauty Queen" and Off Broadway's "Night in November" to the agitprop vehicle "Binlids," which just completed a very noisy run at the Angel Orensanz Foundation in the Lower East Side.
But the city's own Irish theaters have also been active. The Irish Repertory, celebrating its 10th year, has settled into the theater it built on the site of a chemical factory on West 22d Street. Besides "The Shaughraun," on the main stage this week, the troupe will open "Krapp's Last Tape" by Samuel Beckett in the 60-seat basement studio.
"We are absolutely mad," said Charlotte Moore, the theater's artistic director. "Beckett in the basement and farce upstairs. Can you imagine the crowd?"
The Irish Arts Center has also been busy, producing "Binlids" downtown and "Moonshine," by Jim Nolan, which closes tomorrow at its performance space on West 51st Street.
Much lower-budget is the three-year-old Macalla Theater Company, formed by Irish expatriates in Woodlawn, the Bronx, a longtime Irish neighborhood. The group, which is presenting the play "Paddywack" through Nov. 16, makes its home in the basement of the Korean-American Presbyterian Church on a quiet residential street.
While Macalla's goals are modest -- its mission statement includes a desire to "break the endless cycle of bar hopping" in the neighborhood -- it has touched a nerve. At a performance on Saturday night, the audience applauded between scenes and lingered long after to discuss the play, which deals with racism by and against the Irish.
"If you put it on at home, it's a bit old hat," said Eamonn Dornan, the group's president, who was born in County Down. "But when you bring it to the Bronx, where each neighboring community is a different ethnic group, it hits home."
Another Bronx company working in a traditional enclave is the Belmont Italian-American Playhouse, on Arthur Avenue in the heart of the borough's Little Italy. The group, founded in 1991, concentrates on modern Italian-American writers and classic Italian drama, including commedia dell'arte and works like "La Mandragola," by Niccolo Machiavelli. Its next show, "Rockaway Boulevard," opens on Nov. 20.
"We wanted to try to change some stereotypes," said Dante Alberti, the artistic director. "We wanted to show that there's Italian characters other than just mafia hoods."
 
Flying the Yiddishkeit
When Ran Avni produced the Jewish Repertory Theater's first show in 1974, the reaction was, well, mixed. "People came and said it's not Jewish, it's not repertory, and it's not theater," Mr. Avni said. "Over the years, we got better."
Today, he said, the company focuses on "plays that relate to the Jewish experience," a wide mandate that allows for productions as varied as Chekhov's "Ivanov" (with its beleaguered Jewish heroine) and "The Merchant of Venice" (with its crude Jewish villain).
This weekend, the Jewish Rep opens "Kuni-Leml," an English-language musical adaptation of a play by Abraham Goldfaden that apparently was an enormous hit in Kharkov, Russia, in 1880. The piece was musicalized and became a hit for the Jewish Rep in 1984. (Talk about a long out-of-town run.)
Goldfaden was one of the fathers of the Yiddish theater, which had a large audience in the immigrant population of turn-of-the-century New York. That heritage has faded; the only remaining representative is the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater, now in its 83d year.
But even the Folksbiene is changing. The theater's artistic management turned over last summer, with Eleanor Reissa and Zalmen Mlotek taking the reins. The next production, "Zise Khaloymes," begins performances on Dec. 5, and though it is in Yiddish, it is a considerable departure: an original, modern musical with a multiracial cast and musical help provided by Frank London of the hipster klezmer group the Klezmatics. The show will also have simultaneous English and Russian translations.
 
Black Companies Persevere
Woodie King Jr., the founder of the New Federal Theater, remembers when the black theater scene was so vibrant in New York that the Black Theater Association, a trade group, had more than 60 dance and theater companies as members. "Now, it's out of business," he said.
The scarcity of black theater was a hot topic during last year's much-ballyhooed debate at Town Hall between Robert Brustein, the artistic director of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., and August Wilson, the playwright. The debate touched on everything from race-blind casting to segregation of black and white theater companies.
But while acclaimed troupes like the Negro Ensemble have folded, the New Federal and several other black theaters remain. There's the National Black Theater in Harlem, where a musical based on the life of Tupac Shakur is playing,, and the Billie Holiday Theater in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, which yesterday opened "Rolling on the TOBA," a musical about the black entertainment circuit in the 1920's and 30's.
Farther afield are the Open Cage Theater in Mount Vernon, N.Y., where the actor Denzel Washington cut his teeth, and the Crossroads Theater in New Brunswick, N.J., considered the nation's foremost black theater company. The Open Cage has just moved into a new theater and will not stage a new show until the spring, but Crossroads is presenting Pearl Cleage's "Blues For an Alabama Sky," which closes on Sunday. The company's next show, "It Ain't Nothing But the Blues," a musical revue, begins on Nov. 18.
While the Brustein-Wilson debate was generally considered a disappointment, Mr. King says it has had some positive effects.
"It brought attention from foundations to the plight of black theater," he said. "They've opened up and are listening now. That's all we've wanted, to be heard and seen."

HEADLINE: More to Food Than Meets The Tongue

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
What is it about New York Jews and Chinese food? During a recent rainy afternoon in a basement classroom at New York University, graduate students were discussing why Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe were originally drawn to such an alien cuisine and how Chinese restaurants became integral to the experience of Jewish assimilation.
The class, called "Culture and Foods," is part of the Department of Nutrition and Food Studies at New York University's School of Education, which for the last two years has been training students in nutrition, food studies and food management. 
 It was once thought that you are what you eat; now it also seems true that you study what you eat. While N.Y.U. remains one of the few schools with a formal food studies program, courses are increasingly being offered at colleges across the country. Meanwhile, scholarly journals and books are increasingly dealing with food issues, like Calaloo, an African-American literary journal, and the journal Southern Folklore and Food and Culture: A Reader.
Perhaps it is because food is one of the great universals and one that people can relate to as a source of pleasure. Perhaps it is because food studies taps into larger scholarly trends. The development of women's studies has taken areas that were once relegated to the realm of mundane domesticity -- like food -- and examined them for clues to the larger culture.
"There has been a trend in scholarship and academia in general to pay more attention to the contemporary and the everyday," said Lucy Long, an assistant professor in the department of popular culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. "Food is an everyday kind of item that everyone can relate to, but you can extract from this very, very theoretical ideas."
Ms. Long, who has a background in folklore, said she studies "how food is being used to express personal identity, how it is being used to affirm the place of an individual or a group within society, how food is used in rituals to help individuals find meaning in everyday activities."
Among the topics she has explored, for example, are how Friday night pizza parties have become occasions for parent-child bonding; how the very unwieldiness of the Thanksgiving turkey demands extended family socializing; whether Americans' acceptance of Mexican food translates into a more general acceptance of Mexicans.
Ms. Long also cited the work of another scholar, George H. Lewis of the University of Pacific in California, who has examined the image of Maine lobster, how it changed from a poor man's food to a national delicacy and thereby alienated the local people.
At the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Warren Belasco, a professor of American studies, also examines the folklore of food and questions of agriculture, business and the environment. In a senior seminar on the American food chain, for example, Mr. Belasco's students trace a single food product from farm to factory to supermarket to kitchen.
Mr. Belasco said this kind of analysis encourages students to think about the consequences of their food choices: "When I eat this hamburger, what chain of events am I taking part in here?" he said. "We talk about the ethics of meat and agricultural products; who picks our food, raises it, grows it, transports it, what goes into it; the relationship to big business."
Mr. Belasco is vice president of the Association for the Study of Food and Society, a group of sociologists, historians and nutritionists who meet annually in conjunction with a group of rural sociologists, agronomists and philosophers. Next week, the New School in Manhattan, together with its journal, "Social Research," plans to have a three-day conference to examine the connections between food and culture, featuring 25 scholars, scientists and policy makers. Everything from the impact of environmental changes on food production to the food and drink of ancient Egypt will be discussed.
Although N.Y.U.'s department has been around since 1926, when it taught home economics, it has shifted its focus over the years. Nutrition, food and hotel management were emphasized in the early '90s; in 1996, the school began emphasizing the roles food plays in culture, health and commerce. "I was hearing an enormous interest in learning more about the role of food in society and the role of food in culture," said Marion Nestle, a professor and chairwoman of the department.
The course Culture and Foods, for example, explores how crayfish became an ethnic emblem of the Cajuns; how the Molokans, a Russian Orthodox group in Los Angeles, buy food only from stores that are owned by other Molokans; how culture is transmitted throughout community cookbooks; how the Hare Krishnas limit what foods they eat and how much, yet use food as a way to proselytize, having an elaborate weekly "love feast" for the public.
In class the other day, students seemed most interested in the discussion of Jews and Chinese food. They had read "New York Jews and Chinese Food: The Social Construction of an Ethnic Pattern" by Gaye Tuchman and Harry Levine, an essay in the book "The Taste of American Place: A Reader on Regional and Ethnic Foods," published this year by Rowman & Littlefield.
In the essay, the authors argue that Jewish New Yorkers were attracted to Chinese food because they viewed it as cosmopolitan, a way to move beyond their greenhorn status. What's more, the overcooked vegetables and chicken soup typical of Chinese fare were more familiar and less threatening than other types of food: safe treyf (Yiddish for nonkosher food). By the second generation, the authors said, Jews had come to identify Chinese food as "a New York Jewish custom, an aspect of group identity."
"There is a passionate interest in food and health, taste, travel," Ms. Nestle said. "It used to be more about how to make this or that, but the quality of the writing about food has dramatically improved. It is much more connected to what's happening in the world."
Besides, she noted, "Everybody eats."

HEADLINE: An Eye for Patterns In the Social Fabric;
Patriarch of Sociology Sees His Insights Become Just What Everyone Knows

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN 

 BODY:
The Bloomington airport had the feel of a dinky Greyhound bus station in 1978 when Robert K. Merton arrived to deliver a lecture at Indiana University. So Tom Gieryn, who had studied the sociology of science with Mr. Merton, could wait outside while his guest stepped off the plane. As they stood catching up by the chain link fence, they could hear the puddle jumper Mr. Merton had flown in on groan to life.
"He said, 'My bag is still on the plane,' " Mr. Gieryn remembers. Don't worry, Mr. Gieryn assured him; after all, how could he be certain that the baggage handlers hadn't removed his suitcase? But Mr. Merton was insistent. A few moments later, the plane began rolling forward. In an instant, the rangy Mr. Merton bounded past the gate, across the tarmac and onto the runway. 
 "He walks out in front of this plane that is beginning to move," Mr. Gieryn said. "I was scared that he was going to die." Confronted by the formidable Mr. Merton, however, there wasn't much choice. The plane stopped. "He insisted they open it up," Mr. Gieryn continued, "and sure enough, the bag was in there."
The story of Mr. Merton's wayward suitcase has a lot in common with the story of his career as one of the most influential sociologists, if not one of the most influential theorists, in America: the supreme self-confidence, the exacting attention to detail, the knack for being right.
Even if most people haven't heard of Mr. Merton, they have probably heard of his ideas. He coined the phrase "self-fulfilling prophecy" and developed the idea of "role models." He invented the focus group interview, which has turned into the bedside tool of every political consultant and advertising executive. He formed a theory of "deviant behavior," explaining why people broke the rules when they couldn't achieve success playing by them.
If those ideas have seeped into daily conversation, dozens of other, less familiar ones have helped lay the foundations of modern sociology and are still invoked in today's battles over the nature of scientific truth. Indeed, before Robert K. Merton, there was no sociology of science. Scientists were considered a breed apart, singular geniuses who didn't conform to normal rules. But Mr. Merton treated the scientific profession as he would any other social entity, pulling it apart like a house made of Legos to figure out how knowledge is produced and how scientists behave. In 1942, he laid out the "ethos of science" and single-handedly founded a new field, an achievement that contributed to his becoming the first sociologist to win a National Medal of Science in 1994.
These days, Mr. Merton works mostly out of his Riverside Drive apartment. His narrow, overstuffed office is barely three paces from wall to desk. Rows of black-and-white photographs -- of Freud, of his first publisher, Alfred Knopf, of his former neighbor the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz -- solemnly gaze out over greetings from some of his nine grandchildren and his Macintosh computer. Mr. Merton's face has grown thinner, and his jawline juts out sharply against his slender neck; his hands have an ever-so-slight tremor. But at 88 he is still a lanky six feet with a patrician bearing and a passion for conversation.
Over the last six decades he has delved into everything from the workings of a biracial public housing project to the availability of baby sitters in a New Jersey town of shipbuilders to Kate Smith's skill at selling war bonds. All the time he was on the lookout for the repeating threads, the patterns that could illuminate how society operates.
"The objects are trivial," he explains, sitting erect at his desk in a pressed checked shirt, argyle socks and polished black shoes. But they offer what he calls "strategic research sites," like using fruit flies to figure out the mysteries of heredity. His example of a successfully integrated community was used in Kenneth Clark's Supreme Court brief for the Brown v. Board of Education case; the surfeit of baby sitters illustrated how trust develops in a close-knit neighborhood; the war bond drive showed how telling people you're close to a goal encourages them to give more.
But that's not all. Mr. Merton taught sociologists to think about the world in a different way -- not to focus on piddling minutiae or to ponder some grand theory-of-everything, but to aim for the "middle range." No one really cares, for example, when a particular Harry met a particular Sally; and it is impossible to devise a theory about when every Harry met every Sally; but one might be able to figure out under what conditions some Harrys met some Sallys, and then draw conclusions about their socioeconomic status or marriage and birth rates.
What distinguishes Mr. Merton, then, is a remarkable ability not only to identify a problem, puzzle out the research method and make sense of the significant details, but also to articulate it all with literary grace. This flair for exposing the unrecognized patterns that lie beneath a society's skin tends to elicit a slap on the forehead. ("Of course!") As Eugene Garfield, an information scientist, has written: "So much of what he says is so beautifully obvious -- so transparently true -- that one can't imagine why no one else has bothered to point it out."
Jonathan R. Cole, a former student who is now the provost and dean of faculties at Columbia University, said, "If there were a Nobel Prize in sociology, there would be no question that he would have gotten it."
 
A House of Cats, As Many as 25
Instead, his son, Robert C., won the Nobel Prize in economics last year. (More recently, the younger Merton -- who was introduced to the stock market along with baseball by his father -- has been in the press again as a founder of the notorious Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, which nearly collapsed with multibillion-dollar losses.)
The "father of the economist," (as he frequently signs himself) is also the father of two daughters, Vanessa, an associate dean at Pace University Law School, and Stephanie, an automobile safety activist. They grew up with as many as 25 cats in Hastings-on-Hudson, a Westchester County town that was populated by wire-and-cable company employees and a handful of Nobel laureates.
"File cabinets and file cabinets filled with 3-by-5 and 4-by-6 cards, neatly typed," Robert C. says of his childhood home, "endless files of them." Aside from research, they have enabled the obsessively fastidious Mr. Merton to produce obscure articles with the easy flourish of a nightclub conjurer. And like a magician who graciously presents a patron with a spontaneously produced bouquet of flowers, he sends colleagues copies of this or that story, stamped with a kelly green finger pointing out where to read.
Mr. Merton's vast collection of books now fills six libraries, including the ones in the Upper West Side and East Hampton homes that he shares with his second wife, the sociologist Harriet Zuckerman, a former graduate student of his with whom he has been since the late 1960's.
Robert C. is particularly close with his father. They have talked at least once a day for more than 30 years. Still, he admits: "It wasn't always easy to have someone of his talent and caliber around, to be surrounded by Pulitzer Prize winners and laureates. It's nice, but it's a high bar."
 
Advice to Keep One's Distance
One thing his father taught him, says Robert, is that a student of people and science had to be "sort of distancing." It is a stance of reserve that the elder Merton has maintained throughout his life. He rarely grants interviews; for a 1961 profile in The New Yorker, he first demanded that the writer take his course in sociology. In 1982, 10 years after an operation for throat cancer, he issued a "Self-Emancipation Proclamation": "I hereby declare that I shall not again agree to write, revise or edit a book; deliver a public lecture; contribute to a symposium . . ." and so on for a page.
Still, someone who has so intently studied the development of other people's reputations is bound to develop an exquisite sensitivity toward his own. For this article, there were extended negotiations over an interview. All the while, he was sending over packets of articles and books with the dependable green finger insistently pointing the way.
Yet there may be better pointers to his character. Mr. Merton has proposed the "self-exemplifying character" of the sociology of science -- how the field itself may exhibit the same traits or patterns as the subject it's studying. Perhaps the same can be said of Mr. Merton. If so, then his various theories may provide a useful road map to his own unusual life.
Consider his work on the word "serendipity." (He just this year agreed to publish a 400-page manuscript on the word that he collaborated on 41 years ago.) "My coming upon 'serendipity' was itself an instance of serendipity," he has said.
Serendipity has functioned as a silent partner in his life in other ways as well. "My life of learning has been largely shaped by a long series of chance encounters and consequential choices," he has written. Even the name "Robert K. Merton" was something of an accident. Born above his father's milk-butter-and-egg shop on Philadelphia's rundown south side, this son of Jewish immigrants was named Meyer R. Schkolnick. He aspired to be a made-in-America magician, and so, in the style of that generation of assimilating immigrants, called himself Robert K. Merlin at the age of 14. But his next-door neighbor and future brother-in-law, Charles Hopkins, advised him to consider something a bit less hackneyed; the "l" transmuted into a "t".
His mother, a self-taught philosophical anarchist, pushed him to supplement his education at the Carnegie Library, (better lighting than the gas lamps at home), in the last six rows of the Academy of Music, and at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Later, on a scholarship at Temple University, he wandered by chance into a sociology class. Soon he was hooked.
It was at Columbia University, his academic home since 1941, that Mr. Merton, began his "improbable collaboration," with Paul Lazarsfeld. For years, the sociology department there was so riven that it could not agree on whom to hire. Finally, the department added two men: Mr. Merton, the theorist, and Mr. Lazarsfeld, the empiricist. An unplanned excursion to study a radio show led to a lifelong friendship and professional partnership that gave sociology a scientific edge. (The failure to use research to test theory is one of the reasons Mr. Merton complains about focus group research as "being mercilessly misused." Still, he says, a wry smile on his lips, "Wish I'd get a royalty on it.")
Then there is his work on role models. Mr. Merton had his own series of mentors: Houdini and Mr. Hopkins, in whom he found a "surrogate father" after he was confronted by his own father's indifference; his teachers at Temple and in graduate school at Harvard.
More important, though, is how Mr. Merton himself has been the classic role model, mentoring hundreds of students.
Mr. Gieryn was one of the research assistants who inhaled the fusty smell of aging books and were rationed a small clearing in Mr. Merton's large Columbia office. They would fetch his Bulgarian pipe tobacco, and later the candy mixture that a local shop invented especially for him, or his single-malt scotch (Glendronach is a favorite). In return, he would shepherd their research, help them publish and subject them to his famously ferocious editing.
Mr. Cole remembers that when he misused "stipend" in a paper, he received in return a six-page memorandum, single-spaced, on the history of the word. (Origins are one of Mr. Merton's compulsions: a letter to a friend on the origin of an aphorism attributed to Isaac Newton -- "If I have seen farther it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants" -- ended up as a 290-page book and earned him a footnote in "Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.")
Finally, there is one of the four scientific norms, "organized skepticism." Mr. Merton made his own reputation, in part, by taking on sociology's sacred cows.
And in the last couple of decades, he has found his own pioneering work subjected to skeptical scrutiny. While Mr. Merton studied scientists' system of rewards and credit, a new generation of sociologists began to shift the focus to knowledge itself, questioning accepted definitions of truth. This school argues that scientists don't discover truth, they construct it. At one time it was a scientific fact that the earth was flat.
Meanwhile the field was changing in other ways as well. The new sociologists started hanging out in laboratories and found that many scientists were failing to live up to the noble ethos Mr. Merton had laid out..
Mr. Merton disdains the bitter warring between the two schools. Pressed, he does say that "it is a vast misunderstanding of the norms of science to imply that they are unchanging, as though I had promulgated the four commandments as permanently etched in stone." He cites the recent partnerships between universities and biotechnology companies as just one example of a development that has the potential to undermine the practice of the free exchange of scientific knowledge.
Still, he maintains that "the founding fathers are honored not by zealous repetition." Mr. Gieryn, who has himself left the Mertonian fold, insists: "If his views were still unquestioned, that would violate every Mertonian assumption of science. It would mean we're dogmatic. We practice organized skepticism at every meeting when we trash Merton -- and it was his idea."
Yet as even Mr. Gieryn concedes, skepticism has its costs. The sociology of science has lost some of the theoretical richness it had during Mr. Merton's heyday. The post-modern reflex to question whether anything can be known for sure has created an atmosphere of doubt, replacing the fledgling field's sense of hopeful possibility and self-confidence. The kind of self-confidence that enables a scholar to have faith that he can distinguish fact from falsehood, to believe his work can make a difference, or to walk in front of a moving plane.

Don't Look Back

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif.

 BODY:
Let the old folks get misty-eyed about John Glenn's return to space. Here in the self-proclaimed capital of Silicon Valley -- the true epicenter of science and industry in America, 1998 -- nostalgia doesn't play. Most of those who run the high-tech industry that now fires the world and much of its economy are too young to remember the first Glenn mission. Their scientific explorations venture into virtual space, not outer space, and their means of propulsion, the microchip, must be examined through a microscope, not a telescope. The only prospect of danger comes from hair-raising gyrations of the Nasdaq exchange.
There has been a countdown here all week long -- second by second on the San Jose Mercury News Web site -- but it wasn't for Mr. Glenn. Today is the official opening -- the "plugging in" -- of The Tech, a nearly $100 million mango-and-azure downtown showplace for Silicon Valley's revolutionary accomplishments. The full title of the place is The Tech Museum of Innovation, but as Peter Giles, its C.E.O., explains: "The word 'museum' carries a stigma here. People really aren't interested in what's come before but in what's coming." To get more than 300 of the valley's high-tech companies -- from Hewlett-Packard and Intel to Adobe and Infoseek -- to pitch in, The Tech had to be conceived as an un-museum too busy rushing toward the future to reflect upon the past. 
 Only a little history peeks through: a small panel describes the advent of the first microprocessor in that ancient year of 1974. Otherwise The Tech aspires to be something new in the run of science centers and museums. Reflecting the values of a restless, hypercompetitive industry whose products become outdated almost the second they are released, it does not expect any of its "permanent" exhibits to last more than five years. Reflecting the gestalt of the people who built and run that industry, it contains no grandiose monuments to the valley's founding geeks or even any biographical descriptions of them. In one exhibition area, there's the facade of a garage -- the prototypical birthplace of Apple and so many legendary valley start-ups -- but the interactive displays all celebrate the cult of the chip, not the personality of a Wozniak or Jobs.
San Jose has passed its neighbor San Francisco in size and is now the 11th-largest American city; its metropolitan area exports more goods than those of New York or Detroit. But as a cultural force, it ranks nowhere near so high. Part of the idea of The Tech -- which secured $41 million in city redevelopment funds -- is to anchor a cluster of downtown arts institutions and to make the city "a destination," as the outgoing Mayor, Susan Hammer, puts it. But The Tech is also designed to solve two more practical problems. It has a huge educational outreach program, aimed at local teachers and students whose science training has been gutted by Proposition 13. And it hopes to be the area's unofficial visitors' center; tourists who come to Silicon Valley looking for spectacular sights in tune with its giant achievements have been baffled to find mainly office buildings and modest computer history exhibits. Cape Canaveral it's not.
In my hours exploring The Tech's efforts to fill this vacuum, I enjoyed touring a mock "cleanroom" (where microchips are fabricated) and using computer software to design my own personal roller coaster (which I could then take for a virtual ride). The ethics exhibits -- on phenomena like E-mail privacy and the digital retouching of news photos on magazine covers -- are unusually tough.
But what most impressed me was how The Tech captures the meeting of science, commerce and culture of its moment much as the Air and Space Museum did in the 1970's. "Start-ups and venture capital typify the valley more than technology," said Mr. Giles, as we talked in The Tech's New Venture Hall. And so what you find here is not just an explication of the science that is our current new frontier but the cultural coordinates of all our frontiers: the buzz of impatient youth, of gold-rush booms and busts, of new immigrant talent and burgeoning community. In other words, The Tech is a snapshot of the national idea as it stands at the turn of our century. See it before these restless American pioneers, like all those before them, come up with a better idea and tear it down.

HEADLINE: Kellogg's Earnings Off 31% in Quarter

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: BATTLE CREEK, Mich., Oct. 30

 BODY:
The Kellogg Company said today that its third-quarter earnings dropped more than 31 percent because of softness in the cereal market and the cost of investments intended to strengthen its international position.
Kellogg earned $141.9 million, or 35 cents a diluted share, in the three months that ended on Sept. 30, compared with $207.2 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier. The results matched expectations of analysts. 
 Sales edged up to $1.81 billion from $1.80 billion a year earlier.
The company had warned earlier this month that its earnings would fall this year because of the global economic crisis. Kellogg shares rose 81.25 cents today, to $33, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Arnold G. Langbo, chairman and chief executive, said the third-quarter results reflected the costs of increased marketing, accelerated product development and other initiatives that are meant to restore growth to the cereal category.

At 100, Still Teaching, Learning and Joking

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
ABRAHAM GOLDSTEIN scanned the gathering at Baruch College and wondered what he, a contract law professor, should discuss. Anticipatory breach? Economic duress? Estoppel? Oh, that reminded him. . . .
"Little Johnny told his teacher, 'I ain't going,' " he said. "His teacher corrected him. 'That's, I'm not going. You're not going. He's not going. We're not going. They're not going.' So, Little Johnny says, 'Ain't nobody going?' " 
 Estop kidding. If Mr. Goldstein's habits are any indication, he certainly isn't going anywhere. He has been an adjunct professor at Baruch for 70 years, since Herbert Hoover was President and the school was called the City College School of Business and Civic Administration. Officials of the City University of New York say he is the longest-serving instructor in the system, if not the country. Yesterday was cause for a double delight among his friends, family and colleagues when they gathered at the college for a luncheon to celebrate his 100th birthday next Friday.
Mr. Goldstein wasn't sure about people making such a big deal a week before the fact, since he didn't want to tempt fate. But it was evident at the luncheon that Mr. Goldstein is a big deal. New faculty members observe his classes. He's also the one whom students trying to figure out the complexities of contract law -- a required course for business majors -- seek out when they want an explanation in plain English. And he has enough jokes to rival a Catskills comic.
"Why am I being honored?" he asked. "For 100 years of continuous breathing? I was legally obliged to breathe. For services rendered? That's known in the legal profession as past consideration. Abe Lincoln, he was named after me, he passed a law that said if past considerations are put in a contract and signed, that makes it legal. Well, this party is legal."
He never set out to be a teacher. He had a solo commercial law practice in 1928 when, serendipitously, he handled a private matter for the college's dean. Impressed, the dean recommended him for a teaching post a few weeks later. The department chairman warned him it was only a temporary appointment. No contract was ever needed.
It was not easy balancing the demands of a full-time case load with a part-time course load, but Mr. Goldstein prepared himself by drawing on copious notes and his own experience.
"It's one thing to practice law and have time to look up the law," he said. "But standing in front of a class you can't say, 'Excuse me while I look up the law.' "
He does not dwell on the past, unlike some CUNY critics who can't resist a chance to criticize current students. Mr. Goldstein said that apart from ethnicity, today's students are similar to their predecessors.
"They are good students," he said. "They're intelligent and they're willing to learn. I always point out to them, it's a lot of work. Nothing worthwhile is obtained without working."
This comes from a man who knows about precedents. Although he retired from his practice in 1975, he continued to teach as well as taking on the added responsibility of researching and summarizing appellate court decisions that he distributes among the faculty.
"HE keeps us current," said Elliot Axelrod, the chairman of the law department. "He loves that intellectual stimulation. He loves young people. He's an inspiration."
Perhaps his students are surrogates, since he never married or had children. He was too busy supporting relatives through bumpy times. Yet, the best part of him, his mind, will live in future generations.
"I enjoy the idea of teaching somebody things that never occurred to them," he said. "That's the satisfaction, that you're doing something for somebody."
At yesterday's fete, his family did something, too, when they endowed a scholarship for needy students. People praised him and ribbed him, saying he was born before the Dead Sea was even sick. Relatives hugged him and recalled his love of jelly doughnuts, long walks and quick laughs. They all raised Champagne glasses amid toasts of cheers, l'chaim and salud.
"Speaking of making a toast, there were two men in a cab," Mr. Goldstein began. He cracked a few jokes, then turned serious. "I want you to know you're doing something real wonderful teaching these students," he said. "I don't know if they appreciate it. But try it anyway."
Take his example. Please. You might learn something.

HEADLINE: Gap to Create 1,000 Jobs at Fishkill Site

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Gap Inc., the giant clothing retailer, announced yesterday that it plans to build a $150 million regional distribution center in Fishkill, N.Y., about 40 miles north of New York City, and create 1,000 jobs during the next five years.
The company, which is based in San Francisco and owns the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic clothing chains, is buying a 200-acre tract at Interstate 84 and Route 9 in the Merrit Park section of Fishkill and is expecting to begin construction in January. 
 State officials, who had pursued the company for months, said Gap's decision to open the distribution center in Fishkill was a boon for the Hudson Valley.
"It's a great prize for New York," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. "They had considered 70 sites in four states."
In the first phase of the project, Gap expects to build a 1.3 million-square-foot Northeast distribution center for the Old Navy chain and employ about 700 workers. According to the company's plans, the warehouse would swell to 2.3 million square feet, the equivalent of 53 acres, by 2003, and possibly serve all of the company's brands. The company operates more than 225 Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores in New York, as well as its product design offices.
Under its agreement with the state, Gap would be eligible for up to $3.5 million in economic development grants and loans, including $1.5 million in cash for the construction of the building.
Gap said the site was all the more attractive because the State Department of Transportation is completing a $28 million project to reconfigure the intersection of Interstate 84 and Route 9, which has been a traffic bottleneck.
"We looked long and hard at a bunch of places," said Jonathan Mudd, a spokesman for the retailer. "Ultimately, the Governor did an outstanding job in working quickly. We had an aggressive time frame to get it going."
Gap's distribution center would be another spur for the economy in Dutchess County, which has staged a remarkable comeback since 1993, when I.B.M. eliminated 10,000 jobs in the area. According to the State Labor Department, the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.6 percent last month, from 10.1 percent in 1993, as new companies moved into the county.
Micrus, a joint venture of I.B.M. and the Cirrus Logic Corporation of Fremont, Calif., has built a plant in East Fishkill that now employs about 1,200 people. Last November, state officials and I.B.M. announced plans for the largest single industrial investment in state history: a $700 million computer chip development plant in East Fishkill, N.Y. But the project was put on hold for one year after a dip in the international market for computer chips, said the Dutchess County Executive, William R. Steinhaus.

HEADLINE: Pilots Sign Contract At Continental Unit

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Pilots at the regional commuter unit of Continental Airlines Inc. signed a tentative contract with Contintental, the fifth-largest United States airline, today after several weeks of Federal mediation.
The Houston-based airline said it would not release details of the contract agreement until the Continental Express pilots, who are members of the Independent Association of Continental Pilots, have a chance to vote on ratification of the proposal. 
 Details will be released to the 1,200 Continental Express pilots in the next several weeks during the ratification process, the company said.
Continental Express pilots rejected an earlier five-year contract proposal in June and had become increasingly upset over negotiations, saying they might strike and take pilots at the main line with them.
Half of the commuter pilots earn less than $15,000 a year, the union says.
Pilots at the main airline, who are represented by the same union, voted in favor of a new five-year contract in June.
Last month the union asked the National Mediation Board to declare an impasse in the talks even though Federal mediators had only been involved for a few weeks.
Class B shares of Continental rose $2.125, to $39.625.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: MINNESOTA;
Candidates Are Neck, Neck and Neck in Governor's Race

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: LITCHFIELD, Minn., Oct. 28

 BODY:
Norman Degeest poked his head into the Main Street Cafe this morning to catch a glimpse of Norm Coleman, the Republican candidate for governor, giving the breakfast crowd a peppy plug for his campaign.
Then Mr. Degeest strolled a few yards across Main Street to where the Democratic candidate, Hubert H. Humphrey 3d, was politely pressing the flesh on the sidewalk outside Jimmy's Pizza. 
 It was a stroke of serendipity that both candidates happened to be in this small southwest Minnesota farming town at the same time (forcing the candidates to shake hands gamely with each other in front of Doffing's Smart Wear). But it did not help Mr. Degeest make up his mind.
"This is really too close to call for me," said Mr. Degeest, 63, who drives a tanker for a chemical company. "I like them both. That's why I'm undecided. In fact, there's three good people running for governor."
Mr. Degeest is hardly the only one expressing confusion about what has become a surprisingly close governor's race.
While Mr. Humphrey, the state Attorney General who is the son and namesake of the former Vice President, had been way ahead in the polls, that is no longer the case. Two polls in the last two weeks have shown Mr. Humphrey, known as Skip, running neck and neck with Mr. Coleman, the Mayor of St. Paul -- each favored by a little more than a third of those surveyed.
And in a strikingly strong performance by a third-party candidate, Jesse Ventura, a former professional wrestler, action film star and talk radio host who is running on the Reform Party ticket, was the favorite of nearly a quarter of the voters.
"This is now a three-way race," said Chris Gilbert, chairman of the political science department at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter. "Frankly, we the analysts and the media, we regarded Ventura as a cute curiosity before the recent poll numbers."
Experts still think it is unlikely that Mr. Ventura, a musclebound and mustachioed 47-year-old nicknamed the Body, can win. But the fact that Mr. Ventura, a former Navy Seal demolition expert who has shown up at candidate forums in camouflage and whose governing experience consists of a four-year stint as the Mayor of the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park, has made such headway has spun the election into near unpredictability.
"Nobody saw it coming," said Steven Schier, chairman of the political science department at Carleton College in Northfield. "You got about a third of the state that's Republican and a third that's Democrat. Very few people beyond those reliable votes are moving toward Coleman and Humphrey."
Something about the colorful, straight-talking Mr. Ventura, who describes himself as "fiscally conservative and socially moderate and liberal," has resonated in a state where populist messages have often held sway and where 24 percent of the voters supported Ross Perot, the Reform Party candidate for President in 1992.
A more substantive candidate than experts expected, Mr. Ventura has easily articulated opinions on most issues, like his pledge to give the entire state budget surplus back to taxpayers and his opposition to merit pay for teachers.
"I'm going Jesse," said Greg Uken, a 28-year-old aircraft mechanic in Willmar, about 100 miles west of Minneapolis. "I don't wear a suit and I don't put up with a lot of stuff and neither does he."
Mr. Humphrey, 56, has the advantage of his venerable name, his father's revered reputation and his achievements during 16 years as Attorney General, including his highly publicized fight against tobacco companies. His views are largely in the tradition of the state's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, including a more modest tax cut than his opponents have promised, a proposal to expand the Head Start preschool program and a pledge to give tax credits to families for help with day care, elder care and college tuition.
But Professor Gilbert said that Mr. Humphrey had not managed to excite voters enough and that as a result his party risked losing both the race for the governor's mansion and the party's control of the state House of Representatives.
Around noon today, in Willmar, shaking hands at the Town Talk Cafe, Mr. Humphrey's low-wattage Scandinavian-prairie style was on display. He apologized for interrupting a meal and deferentially asked people to vote for him on Tuesday.
A few blocks away, Mr. Coleman was showcasing a different style. From a makeshift stage in the parking lot of Willmar Electrical Services, he energetically promised the small crowd that he would give $3 billion of the state's $4 billion surplus back to the taxpayers. Somewhat more conservative than the outgoing governor, Arne Carlson, a Republican, Mr. Coleman opposes abortion rights and recognition of gay marriages, and favors the expansion of Minnesota's existing school choice program, which does not involve vouchers.
Mr. Coleman, 49, seems quite a bit younger than Mr. Humphrey and in the rough cadence of his speech it is easy to hear the grit of the Brooklyn neighborhoods where he grew up. A long-haired child of Woodstock in the 1960's and a Democrat until two years ago who once worked for Mr. Humphrey in the Attorney General's office, Mr. Coleman has been trumpeting his success in bringing economic development to St. Paul, often considered the scruffy, rundown twin to Minneapolis. Critics call him an opportunistic political chameleon.
Meanwhile, Mr. Ventura continues his unconventional, low-budget campaign, waged largely through interviews on talk radio stations. He has just broadcast his first radio and television advertisements, including one where children play with a Jesse Ventura action figure who fights with Evil Special Interest Man.
"I'm a warrior at heart, I'm an ex-Navy Seal," said Mr. Ventura, who is clearly enjoying his campaign. "I'm too old to wage war anymore and so now I wage it mentally. And so I find politics very stimulating; it's war without guns."

 BODY:
Stock prices barreled ahead yesterday after industrialized countries agreed on a new mechanism for stabilizing distressed economies and the United States said its growth was faster over the summer than analysts had predicted.
Large stocks again set the pace, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 97.07 points, or 1.14 percent, to finish at 8,592.10. It was the average's best month since January 1987 and its highest level since Aug. 25. At one stage yesterday, the average was up 165 points. 
 Other gauges also rose solidly, including the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which has rebounded 21.9 percent from its low of three weeks ago to qualify this group as entering a bull market.
"The mood perception has shifted," said Gordon Fines, senior portfolio manager at American Express Financial Advisers in Minneapolis. "There's a continuing flow of money back into the markets."
The bond market, which interpreted the rapid 3.3 percent third-quarter growth pace of the economy as diminishing the chance for another cut in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, tumbled enough to push rates on Treasury securities up by as much as one-eighth of a percentage point. Bonds also suffered from the continuing withdrawal of money that had earlier swung to them from stocks.
Agreement by the Group of Seven industrialized countries on a stabilization fund seemed to clear the way for a rescue package fashioned for Brazil by the International Monetary Fund. The Bovespa stock market index in Brazil soared 7.78 percent and the Bolsa in Mexico jumped 4.28 percent.
American financial issues were outstanding performers yesterday, especially brokerage stocks. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette jumped 5 3/4, to 35 3/4, after having traded as low as 20 3/8 three weeks ago, while Charles Schwab rose 3 13/16 , to 48, and Lehman 3 7/16 , to 38.
The Commerce Department's report of a hefty economic expansion over the summer gave a clear lift to stocks tied to the business cycle. Dow Chemical was up 3 7/16 , to 93 9/16 , International Paper 2 1/8, to 46 7/16 , and Union Pacific 1 1/2, to 47 5/8. Most airline stocks boomed.
"It gave more confidence to the market," said Cummins Catherwood, a managing director at Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood in Philadelphia, referring to the third-quarter growth. "The economy's O.K., not out of control." Some analysts have forecast a recession next year as the impact of foreign distress intensifies.
While not predicting a contraction in business activity, William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, was leery about stocks, noting that the prices of issues comprising the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were nearing a lofty and almost unheard-of 30 times earnings.
"If we have any earnings growth next year, it'll be negligible," Mr. Meehan predicted.
American Express, up 2 13/32 , to 88 13/32 , was the biggest factor in the blue-chip index, which has rebounded about 1,050 points, or 14 percent, from its low at the end of August. The gain for October alone, usually one of the weaker months, was 750 points.
Elsewhere, Kellogg was one of the few major companies to report third-quarter earnings yesterday, and despite a 34 percent decline, its stock managed a gain of 13/16 , to 33.
Among the airlines, Delta climbed 5 7/16 , to 105 5/8; AMR rose 3 1/8, to 67 1/16 , and UAL was up 3, to 64 15/16 . Oil issues were mixed, with Chevron up 1 5/8, to 81 1/2, and Exxon down 1 1/16 , to 71 5/8.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 12.74 points, or 1.17 percent, to finish at 1,098.67, with Citigroup, up 1 1/2, to 47, making the biggest impact. Ford rose 2 7/8, to 54 1/4, while General Motors rose 2, to 63 3/16 .
Lesser companies with big moves included King Kullen, up 17, to 112; Starwood Financial up 5 1/2, to 71; Tandy, up 4 9/16 , to 49 9/16 ; Reno Air, up4 1/2, to 22 3/4, and Telebras, the Brazilian phone company, up 4 3/16 , to 76. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outnumbered declines by 2,215 to 880. Volume was 785 million shares.
European shares were higher, with chief indexes up 2.65 percent in Frankfurt, 1.49 percent in London, 1.13 percent in Paris and 3.11 percent in Stockholm.
In East Asia, the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong climbed 2.25 percent to finish above the 10,000 mark for the first time since May.

Bond Prices Tumble
 (By Bloomberg News) -- The prices of 30-year bonds plummeted yesterday, rounding out their worst month since August 1997, as a wealth of good news sapped demand for Treasury securities.
"Signs that Armageddon is not imminent, or less imminent, have dried up the safe-haven demand" for United States bonds, said Scott Grannis, who helps manage $47 billion of bonds at Western Asset Management in Pasadena, Calif.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 7/32 , to 105 8/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.15 percent, from 5.08 percent on Thursday.
Traders were reluctant to buy before the Government sells $80 billion of Treasury bills, notes and bonds next week, including $10 billion of 30-year debt. That is on top of expected sales by the Raytheon Company and other corporations looking to exploit improved demand and low borrowing rates.

HEADLINE: A Nostalgic Hong Kong Gives Old Governor a Big Welcome

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Oct. 30

 BODY:
Christopher Patten, the outspoken last Governor of this former British colony, returned this week to a rapturous welcome from the Chinese city that sent him packing 16 months ago.
Mr. Patten is on a private visit to promote his new book about Hong Kong and China. But as thousands of people lined up at bookstores to buy copies signed by Mr. Patten -- with many bursting into cheers when he appeared -- the visit took on the feel of a campaign swing, heavily tinged with nostalgia. 
 "After all he has done for Hong Kong he deserves our homage and respect," said Yan Chun-yue, 44, a government worker who waited on line for more than an hour today outside a store in a fancy shopping mall.
Mr. Patten said the response to his visit was on the "overwhelming end of the scale." Chatting in a rented limousine as he sped from one book signing to the next, he said, "I think I represented and fought for the things that make Hong Kong special such as the rule of law."
That is quite a reversal of fortune for Mr. Patten, who left a deeply ambivalent population and an openly hostile Chinese Government when he sailed out of Hong Kong Harbor on July 1, 1997. Chinese officials called him a "serpent," a "whore of the East" and even a "tango dancer" for his efforts to strengthen democracy in the colony before the handover.
But Hong Kong's fortunes have turned, too. For many here Mr. Patten, a rumpled 54-year-old British politician, symbolizes a time when the economy boomed and the politics crackled. These days Hong Kong is staggering through its worst economic downturn in decades, while Mr. Patten's successor, Tung Chee-hwa, has been criticized for lackluster leadership.
Mr. Patten's book, "East and West: China, Power, and the Future of Asia," has sold more than 30,000 copies here, according to executives at Macmillan Publishers Ltd., the British publisher. They said the average sales for an English-language nonfiction book in Hong Kong were 500 to 1,000 copies.
Mr. Patten received a public-relations windfall in February when his first publisher, HarperCollins, part of the News Corporation, abruptly canceled the book under orders from its owner, Rupert Murdoch, because the book was critical of China. In the United States, "East and West" is published by the Times Books unit of Random House, part of Bertelsmann, AG.
Although Mr. Patten was studiously diplomatic about Hong Kong -- he met Mr. Tung today -- the former Governor was far less restrained about China. He said the Chinese Government was still violating human rights. And he accused Western leaders of coddling Beijing in their zeal to forge business ties. In particular, Mr. Patten criticized Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain for not making more of an issue of human-rights abuses on a recent visit to China.
"If whispering behind their hands at meetings with Chinese officials works it would be good news for all those who are locked up in Chinese jails," Mr. Patten said. "But the truth is if you proclaim you have an ethical foreign policy, you do rather raise people's expectations."
Mr. Patten also condemned Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia for imprisoning former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. When he was in Singapore this week, Mr. Patten said, he telephoned Mr. Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Ismail, who has become the unofficial leader of a growing opposition movement.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
BraziliansAre Upbeat Over I.M.F.

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 30

 BODY:
While wary of coming negotiations in Congress over an austerity package to reduce Brazil's crippling deficits, investors here celebrated today over an agreement by the industrialized nations that opens the way for replenishing International Monetary Fund coffers with $90 billion.
Two days after the Brazilian Government presented an $80 billion, three-year package of spending reductions, tax increases and pension cutbacks, a team of Brazilian officials left for Washington tonight, where they will go over the austerity package with I.M.F. officials. They are also expected to work out the details of a letter of intent between Brazil and the I.M.F., one of the final steps before a formal agreement is announced that will create a special line of credit for Brazil. 
 Markets here also surged after a syndicated column in the local press said the I.M.F. could come up with as much as $45 billion to back up Brazil. The report was not attributed to any Government official, and Finance Minister Pedro Malan said that no firm figure had been fixed for the aid, but it was sufficient to lift the markets.
The Bovespa index in Sao Paulo jumped 7.78 percent today, leading markets across Latin America in a general upswing. In Argentina, the Merval rose 2.36 percent, while the Bolsa of Mexico jumped 4.28 percent and Venezuela's main index was up 3.57 percent.
"People have been waiting for this I.M.F. package and wondering if it's being put off for some reason," said Rick Johnston, a managing director at Offitbank in New York. The agreement by industrialized nations, he said, was "certainly part of the pop today."
The Group of Seven industrialized nations today accepted a series of demands laid out by the United States Congress when it approved an $18 billion contribution to the I.M.F. The measures are intended to make the lending agency less secretive and more likely to help countries well before their economies are in deep trouble.
The agreement should bring in $90 billion that wealthy nations said would provide the framework for a system to protect emerging markets from the turbulence that has ravaged their economies for more than a year. Brazil, Latin America's largest nation, is considered the most likely candidate for such aid.
In a news conference here today, Mr. Malan said the amount that Brazil would borrow from the I.M.F. had not been determined. He noted that Brazil, unlike South Korea, Indonesia, Russia, and other victims of the financial firestorms over the last year, has not devalued its currency, the real, or defaulted on debt.
"It's not simple to define the amount, because there is no immediate need for the money," Mr. Malan said. "What there is is a bet that it's possible to re-establish confidence, and the greatest demonstration of success of an operation like this will be precisely a low use of the resources that are made available to us."
"We are not talking about a rescue operation," Mr. Malan said.
The cost of protecting the currency from devaluation, however, has been soaring interest rates, which make investments denominated in reals more attractive but make loans prohibitively costly to many Brazilian businesses, choking economic growth and increasing joblessness.
In a sobering reminder of the impact of high interest rates, the auto parts industry in the Sao Paulo industrial area announced yesterday that it would be laying off 30,000 workers, of a work force that now totals 80,000.

EUROPE
 
RUSSIA: YELTSIN LEAVES FOR VACATION -- An exhausted President Boris N. Yeltsin left for a vacation at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, and a senior aide said the leader would announce a reduced political role early next year in a speech to Parliament. Mr. Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, Oleg Sysuyev, acknowledged earlier that Mr. Yeltsin had turned over control the economy to Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov. (AP)
 
RUSSIA: U.S. GRAIN DEAL NEAR -- Russia and the United States are close to a deal for Washington to ship millions of tons of wheat and other grains to help the Russians stave off hunger this winter, said a Deputy Prime Minister, Gennadi V. Kulik. Mr. Kulik, after two days of talks with a visiting American delegation, said the United States was offering a favorable loan for Russia to buy American grain, food under the AID program and humanitarian aid. (Agence France-Presse) 

RUSSIA: DOUBLING OF SOLDIERS' SALARIES -- Faced with sinking army morale, the Government has agreed to double soldiers' salaries in January, the Defense Ministry said. Soldiers and noncommissioned officers now earn from $1 to $4 a month. Officers receive $50 to $100. (Agence France-Presse)
 
GERMANY: INQUIRY ON HOLOCAUST REMARK -- Prosecutors have opened a formal investigation into a comment by a French nationalist leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, left, last year in Munich that the murder of six million Jews in Nazi gas chambers was a "mere detail" of history. It is illegal in Germany to deny or trivialize the Holocaust. Mr. Le Pen's immunity as a member of the European Parliament was lifted on Oct. 6. (NYT)
 
SLOVAKIA: NEW GOVERNMENT INSTALLED -- A new Government took power, and Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda promised that Slovakia would again seek to join NATO and the European Union. Mr. Dzurinda forged a four-party coalition after an election last month ousted Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, who was criticized for shunning changes that would foster democracy and free markets. (AP)
 
BULGARIA, MACEDONIA, ROMANIA: ANTI-DRUG EFFORT -- The United Nations and the European Union gave $7.5 million to Bulgaria, Macedonia and Romania to help fight drug traffic. Romania became a main section of a new Balkan link between the Middle East and Western Europe after the war in Bosnia forced traffickers to find alternatives to the more direct route through Turkey, Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia. (Reuters)
 
ASIA
 
JAPAN: INTELLIGENCE SATELLITES -- The governing Liberal Democratic Party has agreed on a $1.7 billion proposal to use multiple intelligence satellites to warn of security threats, officials said. The proposal is widely expected to be submitted to the Government next week. (Agence France-Presse)
 
AFGHANISTAN: PRISONER EXCHANGE SUSPENDED -- The Taliban Islamic movement and its opponents suspended a prisoner exchange because of arguments and shooting, the Afghan Islamic Press said. The two sides agreed to free 1,000 detainees each under a weeklong truce. But the agency said 106 prisoners had been exchanged. (Reuters)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN AND IRAQ: U.S. PLANS BROADCASTS -- The United States-sponsored Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty said it would start two new radio services into Iraq and Iran. Baghdad and Teheran have attacked the planned broadcasts as interference in internal affairs. (Reuters, Agence France-Presse)
 
AFRICA
 
ZIMBABWE: CHANGE IN FARM OWNERSHIP -- President Rob- ert Mugabe announced a policy to acquire white-owned farms to resettle blacks and pay for them later. Mr. Mugabe said identifying farms, appraising them and paying the owners was taking too long. The Government intends to acquire 12.5 million acres from commercial farmers, mainly whites, to give to 100,000 landless black families in five years. The program will cost more than $2.2 billion, and the cash-strapped Government hopes that the bulk of that sum will come from international aid. (Agence France-Presse)
 
CONGO: REBEL CLAIMS HALF OF COUNTRY -- A rebel leader, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, said on a visit to South Africa that his forces controlled almost half of Congo. United States mediators arrived in the capital, Kinshasa, for talks with President Laurent Kabila to discuss the civil war. (Reuters)
 
LESOTHO: WITHDRAWAL BY SOUTH AFRICA -- South Africa announced it was withdrawing 1,400 troops from Lesotho, leaving 2,100 in the troubled kingdom. Troops from South Africa and Botswana entered on Sept. 22 to quell an expected coup. (Agence France-Presse)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CHILE: PENSION FUNDS INVEST ABROAD -- Privatized Government pension funds, which have become a model for many Latin American countries, have increased investments in foreign stock and bond markets 314 percent in the last year, according to regulators. The funds began to send money abroad late last year, as the Chilean stock market stumbled. By September the funds had invested $356 million abroad, mostly in Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and the United States. Clifford Krauss (NYT)
 
COLOMBIA: 5 TONS OF COCAINE DESTROYED -- The police destroyed more than five tons of cocaine in a raid on a drug complex, the country's biggest effort this year. The raid, by antinarcotics officers, in a jungle region of eastern Meta Province, brings the total of cocaine seized this year to 43 tons. (Reuters)
 
MEXICO: 30 SALINAS ACCOUNTS FROZEN -- The Government has frozen 30 more bank accounts said to belong to Raul Salinas de Gortari, brother of former President Carlos Salinas, the newspaper Reforma reported. One account had $16 million that Raul Salinas said he had given to his wife. Mexico is scrutinizing at least 289 accounts here and abroad totaling $250 million for possible graft and money laundering. Julia Preston (NYT)

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: CALIFORNIA;
Middle Ground Is Good Ground, 2 Candidates in California Find

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30

 BODY:
When this election year began in California, the big political questions were whether the Republican nominee for governor, State Attorney General Dan Lungren, a staunch foe of abortion, was too conservative to appeal to swing voters in this diverse and giant state and whether Senator Barbara Boxer was too liberal to do the same.
Now, as the election season winds down here, Mr. Lungren trails his Democratic opponent, Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis, by double digits in the polls. And Ms. Boxer finally appears to have opened a solid lead over her Republican challenger in the Senate race, State Treasurer Matt Fong, but only by outspending him 2 to 1 in television advertisements that paint him as extremist. 
 In sum, moderation is the watchword in the Golden State this year, and Mr. Davis, a 23-year veteran of state government widely mocked as the dullest politician in his party, appears on the verge of a major victory that will put him in charge of the most populous state, with the world's seventh-largest economy and a political redistricting two years from now for a big chunk of Congress.
That blandness has become the dominant political virtue in a state that not so very long ago produced the polar partisan opposites of Ronald Reagan and Edmund G. Brown Jr. -- and at a time when partisan divisions are deeper than ever in many aspects of national political debate -- says much about current feeling in a place long viewed as an incubator of American trends.
"It's like bookends," said Bill Carrick, a South Carolinian who has been a Democratic political consultant in Washington and for nearly a decade here in California. "On the one hand, you have a national Republican Party increasingly dominated by Southern politicians, with a unique, Southern-fried Republicanism exemplified by Trent Lott, Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey and Tom DeLay.
"While California has a big pile of Republican moderates who are pro-choice, very sensitive to environmental protection, worried about the coast and offshore oil drilling, afraid of random violence and therefore more supportive of gun controls -- basically 25 percent of the party with a political philosophy that is more like the philosophy of independents than it is like other Republicans."
For months, Mr. Davis, a decorated Army veteran of the Vietnam War who supports the death penalty, has relentlessly exploited those tensions in the Republican Party in a state where party registration is about evenly divided but where Republicans have controlled the governorship for 16 years.
Mr. Davis has succeeded to such a degree that in the most recent Los Angeles Times Poll on the election last week, he led Mr. Lungren 53 percent to 42 percent among people whom the pollsters considered likely to vote, and drew nearly 5 in 10 of the voters who described themselves as moderate Republicans. By contrast, more than 5 in 10 moderate Republicans had an unfavorable impression of Mr. Lungren.
In a particular bit of bad news for Mr. Lungren, more voters viewed Mr. Lungren negatively than they did former Governor Brown, for whom Mr. Davis worked as chief of staff in Sacramento and whom Mr. Lungren has tried to turn into a hot-button liberal bugbear by association in this race. Instead, Mr. Davis has made Mr. Lungren's old voting record as a conservative Congressman -- against creating the Department of Education, against reparations for Japanese-Americans interned in World War II -- stick against him.
On the other hand, Ms. Boxer, an outspoken liberal from Marin County, just north of San Francisco, was locked for months in a tight race with Mr. Fong, a soft-spoken, fresh-faced political newcomer, because voters perceived her as out of step with California's prevailing political order. In her six years in the Senate she has not managed to expand her base of support, and only broke 50 percent in her job approval ratings for the first time last week.
Only in recent weeks, with a series of television commercials attacking Mr. Fong's opposition to new gun control laws and accusing him of opposing tougher environmental standards, did Senator Boxer gain the upper hand in the campaign give-and-take. A statewide Field Poll made public on Thursday showed her leading Mr. Fong 51 percent to 42 percent among people it regarded as likely to vote.
Ms. Boxer's biggest break came when The San Francisco Examiner disclosed this week that in June Mr. Fong gave $50,000 in campaign funds left over from a past race for State Treasurer to the Traditional Values Coalition, an Orange County group that opposes abortion, birth control and gay rights and favors school prayer and tougher obscenity laws.
That disclosure so angered Mr. Fong's gay supporters that he promptly signed a letter agreeing to support most of their legislative priorities, including a series of bills outlawing discrimination against homosexuals in employment and housing and working to increase funds for AIDS research. And that, in turn, angered Mr. Fong's conservative religious supporters.
"Fong has damaged himself terribly," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at the Claremont Graduate School. "Barbara Boxer is a very polarizing politician, but the reality of it is, she is closer to the views of those moderates on issues that Democrats have skillfully made wedge issues, particularly gun control and abortion rights. What she has managed to do is push those buttons that concern moderate and independent voters."
On Wednesday, Ms. Boxer basked in the glow of the most popular politician in the state, Senator Dianne Feinstein, who in her six years in office has managed to build broad appeal with her sponsorship of controls on assault weapons and a tough anti-crime stance. At a joint appearance in Santa Monica, which has recently seen an unusual wave of gang-related shootings, Ms. Boxer and Ms. Feinstein complained that Mr. Fong opposes new gun control measures, including a ban on cheap handguns and a requirement for child safety locks on guns.
It has helped that Mr. Fong, a former Air Force officer and member of the State Board of Equalization and Assessment, has been tentative in debates and has not drawn the unalloyed support of the national Republican Party, which can get a bigger bang for its advertising dollars in battleground states where television time is less expensive.
In a brief appearance in Chinatown here on Thursday, intended to rally support among Asian-American voters, Mr. Fong left without taking any questions. Instead, he turned the podium over to his campaign manager, who played videotapes of new television commercials, including one featuring the candidate's mother, March Fong Eu, the longtime former Democratic Secretary of State here, saying Ms. Boxer "should be ashamed" of her attacks, and another branding the Senator "too liberal and ineffective for California."
For his part, Mr. Lungren has been hard-pressed to move his campaign much beyond the issue of crime. On a visit to the Robert E. Lee Elementary School in a minority neighborhood in Long Beach, his hometown, on Wednesday, Mr. Lungren read a Halloween story but spoke listlessly to parents and teachers about education, never mentioning his main proposal: giving government vouchers to allow parents of children in troubled public schools to send them to private or parochial schools.
Only the next morning, at a ceremony honoring crime victims in which Mayors Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles participated, did Mr. Lungren seem to come alive.
Part of the problem for the Republicans here, Ms. Jeffe said, is that their own base of party stalwarts is increasingly dominated by conservatives who produce candidates like Mr. Lungren, while elections are won in the center. President Clinton showed the national appeal of that brand of centralism two years ago.
Mr. Carrick, the Democratic consultant, noted that Californians of both parties tended to migrate here from other states in search of one kind or another of freedom from their old worlds, "and that by definition makes them more open-minded and far less judgmental" than voters in many other regions. But he predicted that California's penchant for moderation could become its latest export.
"Obviously, it's a big influence in and of itself, just because of its size," Mr. Carrick said. "But in terms of the ability of the political trends here to translate to other places, I think there's going to be a continuing counterreaction to the increasingly conservative brand of Republicans in other parts of the country, and then we're going to look back in 10 years and say it started in California."

Nation's Economic Output Surpasses Expectations
The nation's gross domestic product grew at a surprisingly strong 3.3 percent pace this summer, as auto makers rebuilt inventories after the General Motors strike and consumers spent money as fast as they earned it. In addition, the inflation rate fell to its lowest level since 1963. The most comprehensive measure of inflation rose at a mere eight-tenths of 1 percent annual rate. 
 The figures indicate that America's economy is holding up far better than most experts had expected despite months of financial turmoil and heightened anxiety about contagion from the rest of the world. The news sent stock markets soaring. Page A1.
 
Plan to Contain Turmoil Endorsed
The leading industrial nations endorsed President Clinton's proposal to help protect vulnerable but healthy nations from the kind of currency and stock market upheavals that have battered nations from Asia to Latin America in the last year. The proposal would establish a line of credit making billions of dollars available to some countries to thwart speculative selling of their currencies. A1.
 
Brazil stocks surged 7.78 percent on the agreement, which could lead to a $45 billion credit line for Latin America's biggest economy. Other Latin markets also rose sharply. C2.
 
Bonds Tumble, Pushing Up Yields
The price of 30-year bonds plummeted as a wealth of good news sapped demand for Treasury securities. The declines rounded out the worst month for 30-year bonds in more than a year, as signs of stability in world markets and two interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve prompted investors to begin buying riskier securities again. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 5.15 percent from 5.08. C3.
 
Airlines Seek to Phase In Alliance
British Airways offered to phase in its alliance with American Airlines over the next five years as the link faced objections from European and United States regulators. C2.
 
Casinos Spending Heavily for Votes
Facing vital ballot initiatives and continuing to fight for increased acceptability across the country, the gambling industry and its supporters this year have contributed about $85 million in campaign funds leading into next week's election. A11.
 
Hang Seng Index Jumps 2.25%
Hong Kong stocks closed higher as cash-rich foreign investment funds streamed into the market, putting sidelined money back to work. The Hang Seng index gained 223.48 points, or 2.25 percent, to close at 10,154.94, its highest point since May 4. C2.
 
Kellogg Earnings Decrease
Kellogg said third-quarter earnings dropped 31 percent because of softness in the cereal market and the cost of investments intended to strengthen its international position. C15.
 
Protests in Cyberspace
Until they declared "Netwar" against the Mexican Government, Ricardo Dominguez and Stefan Wray earned their activist credentials the old-fashioned way, attending rallies in support of the Zapatista rebels, handing out pamphlets, shouting political slogans. Now, the two New Yorkers, founders of the Electronic Disturbance Theater, organize "virtual sit-ins" and recruit computer programmers to attack the World Wide Web sites of any person or company they deem responsible for oppression. Their new rallying cry: "The revolution will be digitized." A1.

HEADLINE: U.S. Ambassador to Eritrea Quit Amid Sex Inquiry, Officials Say

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The United States Ambassador to Eritrea resigned last year after State Department investigators determined that he had engaged in sexual misconduct, the White House said today.
Clinton Administration officials said an investigation by the department's inspector general supported accusations of sexual harassment made against the Ambassador, John F. Hicks, by two secretaries in the American Embassy in Asmara, the capital of the East African nation. 
 While refusing to discuss details of the inquiry, the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Mr. Hicks resigned in September 1997 after a report by the inspector general concluded that the Ambassador had "engaged in sexual misconduct."
Mr. Lockhart was responding to a report today in The Washington Times that President Clinton had dismissed the Ambassador at a time when Mr. Clinton was involved in what he has since acknowledged was an inappropriate sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.
Asked today whether Mr. Clinton had known of the Ambassador's resignation when it occurred last year, Mr. Lockhart replied, "Not that I'm aware of."
Asked if the resignation might suggest a double standard in light of Mr. Clinton's acknowledgment of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, the spokesman said, "I don't know the details of the case, so it suggests nothing to me."
Reached by telephone at his home in Silver Spring, Md., Mr. Hicks, a career diplomat and 22-year veteran of the Agency for International Development, said, "I'm not commenting and don't intend to comment."
Mr. Hicks's lawyer, Thomas J. Trgovac, said the embassy secretaries had "improper motives" in bringing the accusations against the Ambassador, but he would not say what those motives were. Mr. Trgovac denounced the accusations in the inspector general's final report as "false and supported only by flawed and deficient investigation."
"Mr. Hicks denied the accusations and was prepared to vigorously defend himself at an administrative hearing," the lawyer said. "However, Ambassador Hicks decided to pursue employment opportunities in the private sector rather than have his family go through the personal indignities and legal expenses that would result in him defending himself against these baseless accusations."
The inspector general, Jacquelyn L. Williams-Bridgers, had no comment on the investigation.
While Administration officials refused to make available a copy of the inspector general's report, they confirmed that the inquiry began after the two secretaries accused Mr. Hicks of repeatedly groping them and of other crude sexual advances.
The officials said the investigation had largely validated the accusations and found that Mr. Hicks had created a hostile work environment for the two women. They said the Justice Department reviewed the case for possible criminal prosecution but declined to bring charges.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: THE SENATE;
D'Amato and Schumer Make Appeals to Core Supporters

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
As the fiercely contested Senate race entered its final weekend, Representative Charles E. Schumer campaigned across Queens and Brooklyn with President Clinton yesterday, appearing before elderly groups, Jewish Democrats and black ministers in communities where a strong Democratic turnout is essential for Mr. Schumer to win.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican running for his fourth term, yesterday brought out his own big-name supporter, Jack Kemp, the former Congressman and Vice-Presidential candidate, as he also sought to energize his core Republican supporters in a visit to Buffalo. Later, Mr. D'Amato joined Gov. George E. Pataki in the final leg of their four-day tour of New York, with events in Watertown, Plattsburgh and Staten Island. 
 In a series of appearances that were largely devoid of partisan oratory, Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Schumer, a nine-term Democrat from Brooklyn, as having "the ability to turn ideals into action," and urged his audiences to go to the polls on Tuesday for what he called "an extraordinary election."
"I can tell you that, especially for New York, to have somebody like Chuck Schumer in the United States Senate, someone who could serve in the tradition of the greatest New York senators, and the greatest senators of this country, would be a great gift to this country," Mr. Clinton told a group of Jewish contributors at a fund-raiser near the Flatbush neighborhood where Mr. Schumer grew up.
This political season, Mr. Clinton has attended mostly fund-raisers and very few rallies for candidates, in part to shield the candidates from any association with the Lewinsky scandal.
During Mr. Clinton's visit, his second on behalf of Mr. Schumer this year, Mr. D'Amato was shifting gears in his upstate swing yesterday, largely dropping the issue that has been the centerpiece of his campaign for the last month: Mr. Schumer's numerous missed votes in Congress this year.
Instead, Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Kemp returned to a bedrock Republican theme, criticizing Mr. Schumer for voting to increase an array of taxes, including on gasoline and Social Security benefits.
"If you're under-taxed, I invite you to vote for Chuck Schumer," Mr. Kemp said. "If you're under-taxed, don't vote for D'Amato. You'll be disappointed. He is not going to Washington to return to the United States Senate to raise taxes."
To those in the Schumer camp, Mr. D'Amato's decision to drop the missed-vote refrain was clear evidence that they had successfully blunted the issue by releasing documents showing that Mr. D'Amato, as Presiding Supervisor of Hempstead Town, on Long Island, missed hundreds of votes in 1980 when he ran for the Senate the first time.
"It shows that he has finally abandoned the fraudulent issue, having been confronted by the fact that he missed more votes in 12 months than Chuck Schumer did in 18 years," said Howard Wolfson, Mr. Schumer's spokesman.
Asked why he had virtually dropped the subject of missed votes yesterday, Mr. D'Amato replied, "I think I focused on something that is rather important."
But having shifted away from that theme, the D'Amato campaign continued on the new line of attack that it unveiled on Thursday, flooding the airwaves again yesterday with an advertisement that invokes a 1980 investigation into Mr. Schumer. The investigation was dropped, but the D'Amato camp contends that the spot undermines Mr. Schumer's efforts to cast himself as trustworthy and ethical.
Mr. Clinton's foray into Brooklyn and Queens underscored again the New York race's importance to the White House, which is concerned that the Republicans could gain a 60-vote majority, enough to block Democratic filibusters, on Election Day. The Republicans hold a 55-to-45-seat advantage now.
Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to campaign with Mr. Schumer on Sunday. Hillary Rodham Clinton has already appeared with the Congressman three times since he won the Democratic primary in September.
Although there has been a furious debate among political strategists over whether Mr. Clinton will help or hurt Democrats on Election Day, Mr. Schumer's advisers firmly believe that the President -- and particularly the President's policies -- are so popular in New York that his presence can only encourage voters to turn out on Tuesday.
At each of his appearances, Mr. Clinton focused heavily on policy, promoting his plans to protect the Social Security system at a senior center in Woodside, Queens; his role in bringing about a Middle East peace accord to Jewish contributors in Brooklyn, and his proposal to build 5,000 new schools before black ministers and politicians in Jamaica, Queens.
Although some Democratic strategists contend that public weariness with investigations into the President's life could help Democratic candidates on Tuesday, Mr. Clinton did not directly address his problems stemming from the Lewinsky affair. But at each stop, he made passing reference to his problems with the Republican leadership in Congress.
"In the last year, I was deeply frustrated at all the things I tried to do that we couldn't do because of the increasing partisanship of the other party in Washington," Mr. Clinton said at the Flatbush fund-raiser. "To have a few more Democrats like Chuck Schumer may mean the difference in whether we save Social Security or forget about our obligations to our parents and our children."
Mr. Schumer voted against opening impeachment proceedings against Mr. Clinton, saying the President should suffer some lesser form of punishment, perhaps censure. Mr. D'Amato, whose aides acknowledge that Mr. Clinton continues to have strong approval ratings in the state, has been silent about what should happen to Mr. Clinton.
Yesterday, Mr. Schumer was not shy about wrapping himself in the President's mantle. "I'm happy to tell you I stood with this man on issue after issue after issue," he said at the St. Sebastian's Parish Center in Woodside, a heavily Irish, Democratic neighborhood that has supported both Mr. Clinton and Mr. D'Amato in past elections.
Yesterday's tour with Mr. Clinton was the first time in days that Mr. Schumer had campaigned before sizable crowds -- between 100 and 200 people at each of his events. Throughout the week, when Mr. D'Amato had been repeatedly appearing before groups of 300 or more people, the Senator's supporters had contended that the Democrat was not well known or popular enough to draw a crowd.
During Mr. Schumer's event in Flatbush, the police closed off roads throughout the area for more than an hour late in the afternoon, clogging traffic just as many Orthodox Jews in the neighborhood were rushing home for the Sabbath.
"I was stunned he would pick a Friday afternoon to come here," said Len Gams, a resident, who said it took him an additional hour and a half to make his commute home. "Luckily I made it to synagogue 10 minutes before sundown."
In his upstate tour with Mr. Pataki and Mary Donohue, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, Mr. D'Amato attacked Mr. Schumer for voting in 1993 for Mr. Clinton's plan to close the budget deficit, a plan that included raising taxes.
"It was the Congressman who said by raising taxes he would help the economy," Mr. D'Amato said in a news event at Buffalo International Airport. "I don't know what economy he's talking about. Did you ever hear of raising taxes to create jobs? It doesn't work."
Just as Mr. Schumer drew close to the President, Mr. D'Amato tried to draw some warmth from Mr. Pataki's high ratings in the polls. "Support this great team led by Governor Pataki, and don't forget Al D'Amato," he said in Watertown.
Mr. D'Amato also got an infusion of support from the National Rifle Association, which announced yesterday that it was spending $160,000 to send fliers to more than half a million homes warning that Mr. Schumer, a leading advocate of gun control, would try to outlaw guns if elected.
The mailing features a fake newspaper article bearing the headline "Schumer elected to U.S. Senate; gun ban, confiscation law likely to pass."
Mr. D'Amato is a steadfast opponent of gun control, and Mr. Schumer has used the issue to contrast his record with the Senator's, calling it evidence that Mr. D'Amato is beholden to the N.R.A. and is an extreme conservative.
A consensus of polls have shown that the Senate race is extremely close, and for that reason a State Supreme Court justice took the unusual step yesterday of ordering that paper ballots in Tuesday's election be impounded. The order by the justice, James Yates, was the result of a joint request by the state Republican and Democratic Parties, which are concerned about getting accurate counts from absentee and other paper ballots.
Although it is typical for paper ballots to be locked away after Election Day, it is unusual for a judge to order them to be impounded days before the election. The paper ballots will not be opened until Nov. 9.

HEADLINE: THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: IN CONNECTICUT;
A New Rowland Preaches Flexible, 'Fun' Republicanism

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

DATELINE: WATERFORD, Conn., Oct. 25

 BODY:
Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut, a Republican, was elected on a promise to eliminate the state income tax, and didn't do it. He tried to slash the state budget, but retreated after protests from priests, pupils and park rangers.
He was fined by the State Ethics Commission for accepting box seats at a Jimmy Buffett concert, his wife became a punch line when the state leased her a Chevrolet Suburban, and one of his children helped himself to surplus camping equipment at a state warehouse. 
He changes his positions so often that the editorial cartoonist at The Hartford Courant, Bob Englehart, habitually draws him with a weathervane on his head. Opponents complain of cronyism in his appointments and laxness in punishing companies that fouled waterways.
Who would have thought that after four years, Governor Rowland would be poised for re-election, most likely in a landslide?
To his challenger, Representative Barbara B. Kennelly, the latest model of Mr. Rowland is the result of a cynical "election-year conversion" that gave the emperor new clothes just in time to hit the campaign trail.
But Mr. Rowland, basking in a 48-point lead in the polls and a 76 percent approval rating, contends that voters are rewarding a warm and flexible brand of Republicanism that he hopes someday to export beyond Connecticut.
"We've made it fun to be a Republican again," he told a group of giddy supporters recently at a fund-raising reception on the terrace of a Waterford mansion overlooking Long Island Sound. The autumn afternoon was chilly, but Mr. Rowland was coatless and the top two buttons of his shirt were taking the day off. No longer, he told his guests, did they need to apologize for being Republicans.
"Yes, we are pro-business," he said. "But we also are making investments in the environment, in education, in health care for children. Now, we have the chance to define ourselves as a party that we're proud to tell our neighbors about."
Preaching moderate policies that he defines as "fiscally conservative, socially aggressive," he says the focus of his second term will be renewing the blighted cores of the state's largest cities. His broad strategy, according to aides, is this: Don't "die on ideological lines," and don't "get bogged down" in the pet causes of the party's most conservative wing.
"Our party doesn't get it at the national level," Mr. Rowland said in an interview. "Beating up on gays -- all that stuff. That turns my stomach. We're never going to win the White House again unless we have an ability to reach out to people. It's a generational thing, I think. We're really missing it, in terms of our generation."
Such talk of a more appealing, hipper party seems quite fitting for Mr. Rowland, who celebrated his inauguration in 1995 by inviting over some former fraternity brothers and demonstrating that he can still stand on his head and chug a 12-ounce beer. Four years later, Mr. Rowland is only 41 and still the nation's youngest governor. But now he has streaks of gray, and is seeking a more statesmanlike image. All he will say about his fluid feat now is, "That defies gravity."
He could also be talking about his standing in opinion polls. With the twin gifts of a weak opponent and a bubbling economy, Mr. Rowland is riding a wave that he could not have dreamed of as recently as a year ago. Last fall Mrs. Kennelly was considered to be running about even with Mr. Rowland. And when his advisers took their own poll in preparation for the campaign, they found that voters had doubts about Mr. Rowland's ethics, resented his frequent flip-flops on issues and gave him little credit for the recovery in the state's economy.
One of these strategists said the situation looked "dire." They went to Mr. Rowland and told him bluntly that he was not re-electable if he did not take act boldly to improve his record on education and other issues. Mr. Rowland, who likes to use the expression "command focus" for whatever tops his agenda at any given time, attacked his assignment cheerfully and relentlessly.
By the summer, Mrs. Kennelly could argue only that he had stolen her best issues. Voters, on the other hand, seem unmoved by the charge, and Mr. Rowland has to struggle not to gloat.
 
Political Beginnings
A Young Republican On a Fast Track
Mr. Rowland peppers his speeches with salutes to "the Connecticut comeback." But the story of this election is turning out to be the story of his own audacious rehabilitation.
John Grosvenor Rowland has breathed Republican politics ever since he was born on May 24, 1957, into an Irish-Catholic family in Waterbury, a blue-collar town 32 miles west of Hartford that he incessantly refers to as "the center of the universe." Both his grandfather and father were elected the city's Comptroller. In high school, Mr. Rowland was the senior class president. He majored in business administration at Villanova University in Pennsylvania and after graduating returned to Waterbury to work in the insurance agency that has been in his family for four generations. The next year, he was elected to the State House of Representatives, becoming the first Republican to hold the seat in a century.
In 1984, he was elected to Congress at age 27, upsetting a three-term incumbent. The mellow, moderate Mr. Rowland had yet to emerge: When imports were a hot topic, he took a sledgehammer to Toshiba stereos and televisions on the steps of the Capitol. His seat was safe, but Mr. Rowland was in a hurry.
He quit in 1990 to run for Governor, and that was where he picked up his most enduring knock -- a reputation as a chameleon on issues great and small. Five days before he announced his candidacy, he abandoned his longtime anti-abortion stance and voted for Federal financing for abortions for the poor.
Mr. Rowland lost in a three-way race to Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the former Republican Senator who ran as an independent, but four years later he was back running again, this time successfully. After promising to eliminate the state income tax, he defeated three opponents with 36 percent of the vote. Mr. Rowland never introduced a plan to eliminate the tax, nor has he ever officially abandoned the pledge. But he says it would never pass the Legislature, and he has made it a point to avoid futile battles.
Mr. Rowland's inaugural address would have pleased the most committed conservative. "I implore every town and each individual," he said, "to wean yourself from the notion that the state government is the fountain of endless favors." During his early years in office, Mr. Rowland concentrated on such conservative staples as cutting taxes, making the death penalty easier to impose, and moving welfare recipients to jobs. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group that focuses on low- and middle-income people, said Connecticut's new 21-month, lifetime limit on welfare benefits is the harshest in the nation.
For all his notorious evolution on abortion and other issues, his one line in the sand as Governor has been tax cuts, and he has won them in all four budgets. His campaign says they total $1.3 billion, including cuts in the income, gasoline, inheritance and corporate taxes. And even though he gave up on trying to eliminate the state income tax, a budget surplus linked to the strong economy allowed him to push for the state's first income-tax rebate, which he promoted with the slogan, "It's your money. We're giving it back."
The Governor's relations with legislators were rocky at first. After one news conference, Thomas D. Ritter, the Democrat who retired this year as the Speaker of the House, ripped the gubernatorial seal off the lectern and then rebutted Mr. Rowland.
At another point, after Mr. Rowland refused to meet with legislators, Mr. Ritter said, "We have to treat him like a little kid." By 1997, Mr. Rowland was describing himself as a "compassionate conservative, or pragmatic conservative." Today, Mr. Ritter praises Mr. Rowland as a skillful, mature politician. "He's very unpartisan and open to Democratic ideas when he wants to be, and he's very charming about it," Mr. Ritter said.
Even as his relations improved with lawmakers at the Capitol, Mr. Rowland was entangled in a parade of controversies over his ethics. He became the first Governor to be fined by the State Ethics Commission, and paid a $2,000 fine and $1,919 in reimbursement for accepting upgraded seats at concerts by Mr. Buffett and other performers.
Further questions arose about the state lease of a Chevrolet Suburban for his second wife, Patricia. (Between them, they have five children ranging in age from 10 to 14, all of whom live at the Governor's Residence in Hartford.)
In 1997, Democrats questioned his purchase of a lakeside cottage in Litchfield County, for a down payment of $5,000, from a foundation headed by one of his appointees. The State Ethics Commission declared the deal proper.
 
The Evolution
A Fiscal Conservative Turns to Social Issues
 In the first three years of his administration, Mr. Rowland seemed to follow the script of a traditional fiscal conservative, proposing sharp cuts in budgets for state colleges and universities and calling for a reduction in subsidized health care for children. Environmentalists assailed his efforts to trim staff for state parks and money for cleaning up hazardous spills.
In 1997, Jewish, Catholic and Protestant leaders bought a newspaper ad to say Mr. Rowland's budget proposals would "increase the pain and suffering of the poor." Most of the cuts were restored and in the end, Mr. Rowland declared the Legislative session "lousy."
The sour taste apparently rubbed off on voters. That fall, Mr. Rowland's consultants began doing research to prepare for his re-election campaign. In focus groups, voters said they saw Mr. Rowland as a family man -- but that was about the only good news. "Let's just say it was not a glowing appraisal," said Neil S. Newhouse, Mr. Rowland's pollster since 1984. "They brought up flip-flops. They brought up ethics, and a lot of other issues."
The Governor also got bad marks on taxes -- a potential catastrophe for a Republican -- because of the broken promise to eliminate the income tax.
The Rowland camp set out to use this winter's session of the Legislature to take away one or two of Mrs. Kennelly's potential issues like education, health care and the environment.
The Governor's two defining characteristics were well-suited for the task. Democrats control the State Senate, and Mr. Rowland's chatty self-deprecation helped him win over lawmakers who originally scorned him as a right-wing lightweight. In September, Mr. Rowland was one of two Governors (Gov. William J. Janklow of South Dakota was the other) who were awarded an "A" for tax and budget policies by the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank in Washington. "Only 'A' I ever got," Mr. Rowland quipped in speeches.
Secondly, his stances seem to be infinitely malleable, becoming more moderate by the year and sometimes by the month. With barely a blush, he supported vouchers to give children a choice of schools, and then opposed them. He scoffed at raising the state's minimum wage, but later became the booster of such an increase.
Mr. Rowland said that he grew up in a very conservative family, but that he has learned the value of pragmatism. As an example, he pointed to vouchers, which would provide state funds to help parents pay for private or parochial schools. "I can go make the voucher fight, and it's a great fight," he said. "It's a great story to tell, and it's a great play to certain groups. But at the end of the day, what do you have? We're not going to get vouchers in this Legislature."
He said his switch to supporting abortion rights was partly a matter of just growing up. "I don't think a 27-year-old guy lives the issue, breathes the issue, is invested in the issue," he said.
Mr. Rowland's allies concede his many shifts on issues, but some even point to it as a strength. "Governor Rowland has learned a lot of things, and he hasn't been afraid to stand up and say he supports things based on the fact that he has matured and gotten a different perspective," said Jay F. Malcynsky, who is known as Hartford's most powerful lobbyist and is one of Mr. Rowland's closest advisers.
This winter, Mr. Rowland surprised Democrats by championing health insurance for poor children, as well as preservation of open space and construction for schools and colleges. "His State of the State address this year was a rebuttal to the first three," marveled Representative Michael P. Lawlor of East Haven, a Democrat who is co-chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
In addition to the legislative offensive, the other prong of the Rowland plan was to take a page from President Clinton's 1996 campaign and buy television advertising long before voters had begun to think about an election. In January, Mr. Rowland began running an advertisement that opened with gloomy music and black-and-white images of boarded-up buildings. "Connecticut, 1994 -- an economy in shambles," the narrator said. Then the ad switched to sunny music, with shots of Mr. Rowland at construction sites. "John Rowland takes over, determined to turn the state around," the ad continued.
By Memorial Day, the Rowland team believed the election was in the bag. This month, respondents to a poll by Quinnipiac College said Mr. Rowland would do a better job than Mrs. Kennelly on every issue they were asked about, including -- by wide margins -- the Democratic touchstones of education, welfare and the poor.
 
A Governor Remade
Is a National Stage In His Future?
These days, critics of Mr. Rowland are scarce. State Senator George C. Jepsen, a Democrat from Stamford who is the Majority Leader, explained the silence of the legislators and organizations who had once mocked Mr. Rowland. "It's hard to whack someone, when they're doing what you want," he said.
Joseph S. Grabarz Jr., the executive director of the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, had tangled with Mr. Rowland early in the administration, but now has only praise. "The John Rowland who is Governor today is a different person than he was four years ago," said Mr. Grabarz, who was the state's first openly gay legislator when he served in the House of Representatives. "He's become less of an ideologue and more of an administrator."
The Hartford Courant, which Mr. Rowland has called his "mortal enemy," endorsed him on Sunday. "It wasn't an endorsement -- it was a concession," the Governor said.
If Mr. Rowland wins a landslide re-election, his youth and charisma are sure to fuel speculation about how he would play on a bigger stage, and what the Republican Party can learn from his moderate formula. His advisers hope he could be a Vice-Presidential candidate or a Cabinet secretary in a Republican administration, and Mr. Rowland was tickled to see himself referred to as "the George W. Bush of the North" in a recent article in U.S. News & World Report.
He said that by focusing on such issues as education and the environment while still holding the line on spending, Republicans could do better in cities and among minorities. "That's the mantle, I think, that is still very vacant," he said. "The Contract with America -- that was, like, a hundred years ago, right? What is our national message for Republicans, right now? This campaign should be a layup. This should be a huge opportunity for us nationally. But what's our message nationally? I have no idea."
A potential pitfall for Mr. Rowland as he looks ahead is an overconfidence that comes from skating through a re-election campaign without being attacked or pinned down. As he campaigned recently in New Britain, which proudly called itself the Hardware City but now is lined with closed factories, he was stopped on the street by Alice R. Leibowitz, the training coordinator at the city's Y.W.C.A. Ms. Leibowitz said the state's new emphasis on work for welfare recipients meant that even less job training was available than had been before.
Mr. Rowland protested that training had been increased. Ms. Leibowitz persisted, and he walked away -- apparently neither curious about whether she might be right, nor bent on convincing her that she was wrong.
"It's working well," he called over his shoulder.

HEADLINE: Wealthy Nations Back Plan To Speed Help to the Weak

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 30

 BODY:
The leading industrial nations today endorsed President Clinton's proposal to help protect vulnerable but essentially healthy nations from the currency and stock market upheavals that have battered nations from Asia to Latin America in the last year.
The proposal establishes a new line of credit that would make billions of dollars available to some countries to ward off attacks on their currencies or markets that are set off by economic troubles elsewhere. 
 The plan, announced by the Group of Seven industrial nations this morning, offers a new strategy for the International Monetary Fund, which has usually offered money only after a country is in deep economic trouble. Under the new plan the fund could act more quickly to help countries before their economies become far sicker.
"With substantial new resources at the I.M.F.," Mr. Clinton said at the White House before leaving for campaign appearances in New York, "this line of credit gives us a powerful new tool that can be used when it will do the most good at the lowest cost before the trouble starts."
The plan requires no new money from countries that give money to the fund, although the announcement noted that individual countries could give additional money.
The idea was developed by Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and his aides, who want to send a message to speculators about big risks if they sell a currency or other assets in the hope of a decline in value. Frequently those sales force devaluation of currencies. In theory speculators could lose money if the credit line helps a country stabilize by buying back its currency or bolstering its reserves.
The Group of Seven also announced other longer-term actions that Congress demanded in return for $18 billion in additional payments approved this month. The changes included new requirements that the fund charge relatively high interest rates for many loans, so that countries are encouraged to repay back the money as soon as private lenders are willing to step in, a strategy that worked in Mexico in 1995.
Latin American markets rose with the news today, perhaps less for the specifics than for the evidence that the leading industrial nations, which appeared to be drifting without a firm policy a month ago, were finally acting. Although the statement by the finance ministers and central bankers committed the group to "limit the swings of boom and bust that destroy hope and diminish wealth," many specific longer-term actions were left vague.
For example the statement supported "an orderly and progressive approach" to the continued opening of financial markets around the world, a subject of fierce debate in smaller economies in Asia and Latin America. In those economies many experts say pressure from Washington to allow investors to move billions of dollars freely across borders has contributed to enormous volatility and the panic that dried up credit around the world after the Russian economic implosion in August.
"This kind of wording could mean almost anything, including the ordaining of some kind of controls," said John Lipsky, chief economist at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
Mr. Rubin refused to reveal what part of the I.M.F. money would be devoted to the new "precautionary fund." His aides said Mr. Rubin, a former currency trader, knew the importance of keeping secret the size of the economic arsenal.
"If people want to bet against house, we'd rather keep them guessing," one White House official said.
Congress approved the added $18 billion payment as part of a $90 billion infusion from member nations.
The first test of the new approach may be as early as next week, in Brazil. The country is putting the final touches on a package of $30 billion to $40 billion in aid provided partly by the fund Brazilian officials, fresh from the announcement of an austerity plan intended to convince global investors that Brazil is finally mustering the will to end wild overspending, are flying to Washington this weekend to close the deal. The United States is expected to pay $3 billion to $5 billion.
Brazil has had currency runs, but it has resisted devaluation and has more than $40 billion in foreign currency reserves. By the time the I.M.F. entered the crises in South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia, their currencies had dropped drastically, and their reserves were nearly depleted.
American officials continued today to be coy about their participation to the Brazil package.
One Administration official left little doubt that Brazil would be the test case of the new strategy. "Some of the ideas involved with contingency financing could possibly find application in Brazil, although that will of course depend on how the situation in Brazil progresses," Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said at the White House.
A senior official of the I.M.F. who insisted on anonymity, welcomed the announcement, saying it would make it possible for the fund to be more flexible. "It's a new way of doing business, and that alone may be useful," the official said.
Three major risks are associated with the new strategy. The first is that the fund, desperate to stop the economic contagion, could end up supporting a country that fails to carry through on its promised changes. In fact the presence of the shield created by the line of credit could reduce pressure on a Government to clean up its financial act.
"My concern would be, 'Are we throwing good money after bad?' " Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of the Norwest Corporation, asked. "Will they waste resources put in by the G-7 and the I.M.F.?"
Brazil's unpredictable Congress already shows signs, Mr. Sung said, of resisting many of the budget cuts and increased taxes that the Government is proposing to stabilize the economy and qualify for I.M.F. aid.
Mr. Summers addressed that criticism, saying, "That's obviously a crucial issue."
 The second concern is that after the fund extends the credit line it would be virtually impossible to withdraw the offer, even if the country's fiscal discipline fell apart, as it in the case of Russia.
By ending the credit line the fund would essentially be announcing to the markets that it was now open season on a country's currency, and could set off a panic. In short the fund would be handcuffing itself to the country it is helping.
The third concern is that the fund, in trying to speed approval of a "precautionary" loan, may impose conditions a country that are considerably less strict than the conditions on an ordinary fund loan.
"Fewer conditions and more money is not the direction the I.M.F. should be going," Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist and a longtime critic of the fund, said this week.
"These problems will take considerable time to work out," Mr. Rubin said today. "I've said that many, many times."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC GROWTH SURPRISINGLY SOLID IN THIRD QUARTER

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Despite months of financial turmoil and heightened anxiety about contagion from the rest of the world, America's economy is holding up far better than most experts expected.
The nation's economic output grew at a surprisingly solid 3.3 percent pace this summer, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, as car makers scrambled to rebuild inventories after the General Motors strike and consumers spent money as fast as they earned it. 
 Although significantly slower than the dizzying pace at the beginning of the year, the increase in the nation's gross domestic product for the July-September quarter was nearly twice the 1.8 percent annual rate of the spring, when the Asian crisis first hit American industry. And it was a lot faster than the 2 percent gain Wall Street forecasters had predicted.
On the eve of a midterm election, evidence that the economy is performing better than anticipated was welcome news for Democrats. And President Clinton was quick to take credit for the low interest rates and a balanced budget that have contributed to the healthy economy.
"In the face of worldwide economic turmoil," Mr. Clinton said at the White House yesterday morning, "our economy remains the strongest in a generation."
Along with the robust growth in the economy, now expected to deliver more than $8.5 trillion in goods and services this year, the inflation rate hit its lowest point since the year that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The most comprehensive measure of inflation, the so-called G.D.P. deflator, rose at a mere eight-tenths of 1 percent annual rate.
Forecasters expressed surprise at the economy's continued vitality. "Reports of the expansion's demise are greatly exaggerated," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist of PNC Bank in Pittsburgh.
Investors in the stock market, who have been worrying about the prospects for corporate profits, celebrated the brighter economic picture by sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 97 points to close above 8,592. Page C1.
"The question has been: Is the U.S. economy strong enough to drive through the problems of the world?" Jeffrey Davis, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told Bloomberg News. "The evidence suggests it is."
Bond investors, however, were disappointed, selling off some of their bond holdings and pushing interest rates higher.
Together with the rebound in the stock market and fresh signs that wage inflation is heating up, the latest evidence that the seven-and-a-half-year-old expansion remains on track makes it somewhat less likely that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again right away.
"The G.D.P. report has lowered the odds of an immediate easing," said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities.
Although yesterday's report eased fears that a recession lay around the corner, most economists still expect growth to slow in the coming year. The 50 forecasters in the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey expect the economy to advance by just 2.1 percent in 1999.
One source of the current strength may well turn into a source of restraint in coming months. The buildup of business inventories at a $57 billion annual rate, which mostly occurred in the auto industry, added nearly a percentage point to economic growth in the summer. That pace of accumulation is not expected to be sustained in coming quarters.
At the same time, all categories of domestic spending, including consumer outlays, were somewhat weaker in the summer than in the first half of the year.
Trade was the biggest drag on growth, though not as much as earlier in the year. In the summer, the widening trade deficit shaved three fourths of a percentage point from G.D.P., compared with a sharp two points in the spring. Exports fell at a 2.9 percent annual rate while imports rose at a 3.4 percent rate. The trade gap is likely to widen further as growth in Latin America slows.
But the global picture is not completely bleak, William Dudley, chief economist at Goldman, Sachs, points out. Most Asian countries are now running large trade surpluses, which means that they are no longer under extreme pressure to slash imports from the United States.
Business investment in new plants and equipment, which powered growth during most of this expansion, is suddenly idling. Over all, investment fell 1 percent in the summer after soaring at a 26 percent annual rate in the first half. Equipment spending edged up at a mere 1 percent rate while factory and office construction contracted at a 6.5 percent annual rate.
The prospects for further growth in business investment are mixed. On the one hand, industry is not utilizing its existing capacity as much as before, suggesting the need for new plants is waning. On the other, cash flow is holding up well, despite weaker profits, giving business the wherewithal to spend more. And orders for everything from computers to heavy machinery were surprisingly strong in October.
"Companies still want to be more efficient, get ready for year 2000 and substitute technology for workers," said Mr. Rippe, who thinks spending will stay sluggish but will not dry up.
In the main, America's consumer households are still the economy's stalwarts.
The growth of home building slowed in the summer, only partly because of a spate of tropical storms. The National Association of Realtors reported yesterday that new-home sales continued to slip after Labor Day. In some areas, real estate agents report that stock market jitters are affecting the high end of the market.
Yet housing has rarely been more affordable for the average family. Incomes are rising smartly, house prices have not moved up much and mortgage rates are near a 30-year low. That suggests that housing will continue to be a plus for the economy.
Consumption also slowed from the spring, but remained at a very robust 3.9 percent annual rate. The rate is all the more remarkable in light of the fact that the G.M. strike prevented consumers from buying all the cars they evidently wanted. Vehicle production and sales, which fell sharply in the spring, continued to shrink in the summer, but both appear to be on the rebound this fall.
There are several reasons for thinking that consumers will become a bit more cautious. For one thing, Americans spent virtually all of their income this summer, anAugust, fell to 97.1 in October despite the fact that the Federal Reserve twice lowered interest rates. "Confidence is still very positive, but the direction of change is unambiguous," said Richard Curtin, director of the Center of Consumer Surveys at Michigan. "It indicates that spending growth will weaken."
There are several important factors, however, that should keep the slowdown from turning into outright retrenchment.
The stock market is rebounding, for one, and the Dow delivered its best performance for the month of October since 1982. Wages are rising at a very solid clip. And the job market, though a bit looser than several months ago, is still quite tight. Help-wanted advertising is strong and first-time claims for unemployment insurance, which were drifting up a few weeks ago, are back down close to 10-year lows.
All in all, said Mr. Dudley at Goldman, Sachs, "the most likely scenario is that we'll slow down more but avoid recession."

HEADLINE: COLLEGE FOOTBALL: Small Schools With Big Hearts;
In a Hotbed of Football, Passion for the Game Still Burns

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE 

DATELINE: BEAVER FALLS, Pa.

 BODY:
Up and down Interstate 79, along an 80-mile stretch of western Pennsylvania from Pittsburgh to Meadville, the rhythm of small-college football is found in the beat of outsized hearts -- not in the cheers for outsized talents. It is a region once considered a cradle of stoic coal miners, hard-nosed steelworkers and a who's who of native sons that became football heroes. Hall of Famers like Joe Namath and Tony Dorsett.
Like western Pennsylvania's economic prosperity, football's riches seem to have shifted south. To Texas, where 20,000 people gather under Friday night lights to watch high school teams play on synthetic turf fields. To Florida, where bigger, faster athletes are as abundant as sunshine and are exported like oranges to major college programs. 
 But the air is not completely out of the football. More than a half-dozen small local colleges compete here in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Divisions II and III, or in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. When Penn State plays, more than 93,000 people pour into Beaver Stadium in the central part of the state. Here at Geneva College, a capacity crowd of 6,000 rarely strains the bleachers of Reeves Stadium. While Ohio State drives to a national championship game and a $13 million bowl payout, Geneva's Golden Tornadoes march toward the N.A.I.A. playoffs, where traveling expenses aren't guaranteed.
The value of the football played here is found in the coaches who look at what they are doing as a calling rather than a career path. They are often professors, like Slippery Rock's George Mihalik, and can be found in the classroom more than the weight room. The value of the game is found in players like Allegheny College's Dave Buchanan, who needs student loans and financial-aid grants to play through the season before heading to medical school. It is found throughout the corridor -- at Thiel College and Westminster, at Robert Morris and Grove City. It is an area where football means character.
"It's the kind of place where you can be a successful neurosurgeon, but if you were a lousy football player, people still look at you funny," said Geneva Coach Geno DeMarco, who grew up in neighboring New Brighton. "But if you are the town drunk and you won a few big games 20 years ago, they'd still worship you every Friday night."
The players play to win, but they all know the score.
"I'm slow; I don't have any moves; I run straight ahead; I broke an 80-yard run last year and was sucking wind," said Rick Magulick, a 21-year-old senior running back at Slippery Rock, whose father works in the back office for a mine company. "What I got is what a lot of us small-time guys have -- a lot of heart. I'll teach and coach and try to push those behind me to a better life."
Slippery Rock is 7-1, ranked No. 4 in Division II. It is gunning for its second consecutive playoff berth. Geneva, 27 miles away, is 5-2, ranked No. 11 by the N.A.I.A. and closing in on its fourth consecutive playoff appearance. In Meadville, the Allegheny Gators are 5-2 and are trying to return to the Division III playoffs.
Virtually all the players from the three schools grew up in western Pennsylvania. The Namaths and Dorsetts are harder to find now, mainly because the region is one of the nation's leaders in losing population, especially its young people, according to the Census Bureau.
"We aren't the fastest or biggest or even the smartest, but we can play football," said Justin Myers, the Geneva quarterback. "We'll outwork you."
 
A Father's Lesson Is Taken to Heart
In the study of Mihalik's home, a miner's helmet and lamp are displayed more prominently than the signed footballs and other mementos of more than three decades in football -- all but one of them at Slippery Rock. For 42 years, the helmet and lamp belonged to his late father, George Sr. It explains why so many young men here want to wear football helmets.
Twenty-five years ago, Mihalik returned to his native Ebensburg, a quarterback who wanted to quit school. He broke the news at dinner, but his father just kept eating.
"The next day he took me to the mine," Mihalik said. "We used a hammer as a third leg to crab through the tunnels. I was an athlete. My back hurt. I couldn't keep up. When we came up, I joked to him that I already had black lung disease.
"He told me to think about that, because beginning Monday that's where I'd be for the rest of my life. I headed back to school the next day."
So the coach has been lighting the way for players ever since. He spent a year as an assistant coach at Kentucky on a staff that included John Cooper, now the Ohio State head coach, but that brief stint with big-time football was enough. He returned to "The Rock," got a master's degree, taught and coached part time.
For nine years, twice a week, he drove 240 miles round trip to earn a Ph.D. in safety management at West Virginia University in Morgantown. Now, Mihalik is a tenured professor in Slippery Rock's Department of Allied Health. He is paid as a professor, not a coach. He teaches year-round.
"I wanted to see these kids as people, not just athletes," he said. "I want to stand in front of them and say, 'I don't ask you to do anything I don't do. I go to class. I work hard. I sacrifice.'
"At this level, football is not a business," said Mihalik, 46 years old, who is in his 11th year as head coach. "It's a step to a fuller life."
Slippery Rock offers a scholarship in his father's name. It is used for players like Magulick, who needs just 74 yards to break the school's career rushing record, a feat that has put the four previous record-holders in the National Football League. But Magulick's ambitions are as earthbound as his bowling-ball style of running. In December, he will finish course work for a double major in special and elementary education.
Coaches at this level work at making their players feel like blue chippers on blue plate budgets. For Mihalik, it means helping his coaching staff renovate a locker room during the summer. It means staying at George Steinbrenner's Radisson Bay Harbor Hotel when Slippery Rock traveled to Tampa to play South Florida in the season opener. Mihalik even buttonholed the Yankees' principal owner at dinner and talked him into addressing his team. They presented him with a Slippery Rock hat. The next morning, Steinbrenner had Yankee caps waiting at the breakfast table for each player.
"You try to give them the impression they're big time because they are playing for no money and really not the promise of any," said the Slippery Rock assistant Keith Willis.
He should know. Willis spent 12 years in the National Football League as a defensive end with Pittsburgh. He was also a member of the Buffalo Bills' 1992-93 team that went to the Super Bowl.
"If you make it to the pros from here, you've done it on pure heart," Willis said.
As unreal as it may be, the dream of playing professionally is resurrected each Saturday afternoon as soon as the familiar clatter of helmets crashing into shoulder pads rings in the stadiums along I-79.
"You always think, 'What if?' " said the Slippery Rock quarterback, Randy McKavish. "I really feel like I'm in a big game every week -- even if there are only 10 people in the stands. Then you remember, we're just all sort of average guys."
But not that average. At 5 feet 9 inches and 170 pounds, Buchanan is a wide receiver who leads the Allegheny team in all-purpose yards. He is smart enough to spend hours in the college's animal lab studying the effects of Huntington's disease on rats -- a project he chose to fulfill the demanding independent study project required for graduation at the liberal arts school. He knows his $23,000-a-year education and a summer spent interning as an emergency room attendant were not intended to propel him toward a career in professional football, but he also knows it will not be easy to let go of the game.
"I was talking to my mom the other night and I told her I'm really going to be sad when this is all over," Buchanan said. "Football has pretty much made me what I am."

Rivalries Endure, And So Do Friendships
On Friday nights, the lights from high school stadiums shimmer off the Ohio River as blood rivalries between neighboring towns unfold for coveted prizes and bragging rights. Last night, Rochester High School played Monaca High for "The Battle of the Bridge." At stake was the name of the bridge that crosses the Ohio and connects Monaca, a town of 6,800, and Rochester, a town of 4,200.
If Rochester prevailed, it would remain the "Rochester-Monaca Bridge." If Monaca won, the sign would be changed today to the "Monaca-Rochester Bridge."
Four years ago, Justin Myers and Mike Holaren played in such a game. They were the opposing quarterbacks when Forest Hills met New Brighton in the state playoffs. Myers's Forest Hills team won and he became a legend. Both ended up not far away at Geneva College, where they had to be separated from each other at the first practice because of the lingering bad blood. But when Holaren was moved to wide receiver, the pair turned clenched-fist conversations into late-night pass patterns run in the dark and, finally, into school passing and receiving records.
"We realized that we wanted to play this game the best we could, so we got over the hard feelings. We needed each other," said Holaren, who, despite being 5-10 and 170 pounds, is the N.A.I.A.'s second-leading receiver, averaging 238.1 all-purpose yards a game as a pass catcher and kick returner.
Now the two talk about being the best man at each other's far-off weddings. Their parents travel together to away games. "We've all made friends for life, and that's far more important than what happens with football," said Justin Myers's mother, Tacey.
Like Mihalik, Geneva's DeMarco served as a major college assistant, at Georgia Tech and West Virginia. He also tries to give his big-hearted team a big-time feel. On a recent trip to Chicago, he arranged for the Golden Tornadoes to have a walk-through on Notre Dame's practice field. He knows how the game can haunt these young men. Six years ago, he quit a six-figure job as a pharmaceutical salesman to make half as much on Geneva's sidelines.
He does not discourage his quarterback and receiver when they talk about playing at the next level. "Wayne Chrebet," piped up Holaren, invoking the pint-sized Jets' receiver from Hofstra as proof that it can happen.
"Our dream is to get paid for playing," Myers said.
A warm smile reach to the top of the coach's shaved head when he heard Holaren, a senior, describe how much his final games at Geneva mean to him.
"We've got three games left and each one that passes is like having a family member go away," he said.
Last Saturday, against St. Francis, Myers found Holaren in the end zone four times -- the last one putting Holaren in the Geneva record book for career touchdown receptions. Long after the game, they stood in their uniforms reliving the big plays.
Holaren clutched the record-breaking ball as if a safety might try to strip it. Myers rested his arm around his friend's shoulder.
From midfield, DeMarco nodded at the pair, "Good kids," he said. "Real good football players."
They may never become neurosurgeons, but they are unlikely to become the town drunks. In fact, Myers and Holaren say they want to be coaches, right in western Pennsylvania, where football matters at whatever level you play.

HEADLINE: Anthony Celebrezze Is Dead; Kennedy Cabinet Member, 88

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
Anthony J. Celebrezze, a storied Cleveland mayor who transformed the city's skyline in the 1950's and went on to spend three productive years as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare in the 1960's and three low-key decades as a Federal appellate judge, died on Thursday at a hospice in Cleveland. He was 88 and a founder of a far-flung Ohio political dynasty.
Judge Celebrezze's family said the cause was cancer. 
 For all the pride he took in the accomplishments of his nine activist years as Mayor of Cleveland, Judge Celebrezze later admitted that his most sweeping achievements came during his brief service in the Kennedy and Johnson Cabinets.
He was appointed by President John F. Kennedy in July 1962, the first Italian-American to serve in a Presidential Cabinet. He remained in the Cabinet until August 1965, when he submitted his resignation to President Lyndon B. Johnson. In that time, Mr. Celebrezze helped shepherd more than a dozen major New Frontier and Great Society bills through Congress, including the Medicare Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Water Pollution Control Act, the Clean Air Act and the law creating the Head Start program.
For all that, Mr. Celebrezze's heart remained in Cleveland. In his 30 years as a member of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, based in Cincinnati, Judge Celebrezze, who had senior status at his retirement in 1995, maintained an office in the Federal Courthouse in Cleveland, a city where he was regarded with something akin to awe.
That was hardly surprising, since throughout his career Judge Celebrezze maintained a reputation as both an urban visionary and a hard-nosed, hardworking and honest politician whose very life seemed to epitomize a cherished American myth of triumph over poverty.
The man who began his political career in Cleveland as the self-proclaimed "boy from the slums" was not born in the United States. The son of an Italian immigrant who never made more than 26 cents an hour as a railroad track walker, Mr. Celebrezze, the middle child of 13, was born on Sept. 4, 1910, in Anzi, Italy. His hometown was a rocky mountain village in the province of Lucania, on the instep of the Italian boot, where his family had repaired to sit out the depression of 1908.
As Judge Celebrezze later recalled, growing up in a Cleveland slum across the street from a house of prostitution and an opium den instilled in him the idea that things could be made better, as they were years later when the neighborhood was cleared to make way for a college as part of a vast urban development program developed in his years as mayor.
From the age of 6 he joined his older brothers and sisters as a shoeshine boy and newspaper hawker on a busy downtown street corner considered such a choice location that they had to fight off others seeking to displace their family monopoly. Long after the children had grown, Clevelanders knew the intersection as Celebrezze Corner.
After working his way through local colleges in Cleveland as a boxer, railroad laborer and freight truck driver, Judge Celebrezze obtained a law degree from Ohio Northern University in Ada in 1936. He worked a while for the Ohio Bureau of Unemployment Compensation, then entered private practice, which he maintained, with time out for service in the Navy in World War II, until he began his political career with election to the Ohio State Senate in 1950.
Widely regarded as the most effective Democratic member of the Republican-controlled legislature, Judge Celebrezze mastered an amazing range of specialties and handily won re-election in 1962, although his impatience, blunt style and outspoken ways alienated some Democratic powers in Cleveland.
Then an older brother, Frank, who had become a Municipal Court judge, organized a "Draft Tony for Mayor" campaign. Campaigning against the Democratic machine as a maverick who could not be bought, Judge Celebrezze was swept into office in 1953. Though initially dismissed as a lightweight by many, he helped transform the city and was repeatedly re-elected by increasing margins.
A tight man with a public dollar, he won a national reputation for his accomplishments and was elected president of the American Municipal Association (now the National League of Cities) in 1958 and president of the United States Conference of Mayors in 1962. However, he lost a bid for governor in 1958.
He also campaigned hard for John F. Kennedy in 1960, but turned down an offer of a judgeship after Kennedy's election, saying he had more to do in Cleveland. In 1962, however, while serving an unprecedented fifth term as mayor, he accepted appointment as Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.
Judge Celebrezze was given major credit for a range of important legislation, most notably in creating Medicare. But living in Washington on a $25,000 salary proved such a personal hardship that after running up $30,000 in debts, he asked President Johnson to name him to the bench in Ohio. The President swiftly obliged, naming him to the Sixth Circuit, which covers Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee.
As a grand old man of Ohio politics, Judge Celebrezze, whose son, Anthony Jr., served as state Attorney General and whose grandson, Anthony 3d, is now running for Franklin County Court Clerk in Columbus, was a highly sought-after speaker in Ohio and elsewhere.
True to form, the man who began his political career proclaiming he could not be bought refused to accept fees for his speaking engagements.
In addition to his son and grandson, Judge Celebrezze is survived by his wife, Ann; three daughters, Jean Anne Porto of Washington, Susan Marie Sullivan of Boston and Mildred Ragucci of Cleveland; two brothers, Salvatore and John, of the Cleveland area, and nine other grandchildren.

Facing vital ballot initiatives and continuing to fight for increased acceptability across the country, the gambling industry and its supporters this year have contributed about $85 million to influence next week's election.
From the more than $71 million being wagered on a California ballot measure that could legalize the state's tribal casinos, to the thousands more being spent in an effort to oust South Carolina's anti-gambling Governor, contributions from casino interests are increasingly affecting the nation's politics. 
 As gambling revenue has grown around the country, the industry has spread its money far beyond the boundaries of Nevada, the nation's gambling capital, and it has increased its contributions to members of both parties. According to an analysis conducted for The New York Times by the Campaign Study Group, a research company in Springfield, Va., contributions from casino companies to candidates for national office and to political parties totaled $4.9 million from Jan. 1 to the second week in October, with the larger share going to Republicans. Of that amount, the largest party recipient was the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which received $925,000, and the largest amount given to an individual candidate went to John Ensign, the Republican candidate for the Senate from Nevada.
By comparison, contributions to candidates for national office and to political parties from the gambling industry are slightly more than half of the amount that the tobacco industry has given them, according to the analysis done for The New York Times.
"Both political parties are obviously heavily dependent on contributions from the gambling industry, which is having a major influence on Washington," said James C. Dobson, a member of the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, a Congressional commission studying the social and economic impact of gambling. "I'm especially concerned about the influence of that money on the G.O.P.," added Mr. Dobson, who is also president of the nonprofit organization, Focus on Family, and opposes gambling. "The gambling industry has bought and paid for the politicians," he said.
In state races, gambling industry dollars are also having a huge impact. In Missouri, voters will decide whether 11 of the state's 15 casinos may continue operating slot machines although the casinos do not sit on the Mississippi or Missouri rivers as state law stipulates. If the amendment fails, casino companies say they will have to close. The casino industry is expected to spend about $8 million blanketing the state with advertisements, while opponents of gambling are fighting with less than $200,000. Still, polls show the vote could be close, as Missouri residents, who legalized gambling in 1992, appear to be unsure about whether they want to keep casinos.
"It's too close to call," said Joe Coccimiglio, an industry analyst at Prudential Securities. "If we don't get a good voter turnout, it could be difficult."
In Maryland, the Republican candidate for governor, Ellen R. Sauerbrey's campaign received a recent boost when the Hilton Hotel Corporation, the owner of casinos around the country, contributed $250,000 to aid the Republican National Committee's attacks on her Democratic opponent, Gov. Parris N. Glendening, according to a report in The Washington Post. Mr. Glendening has opposed installing slot machines at the state's racetracks. Hilton owns a racetrack in Maryland.
California's Proposition 5, which would legalize and likely lead to expansion of the state's Indian gambling business, is being vehemently opposed by Nevada casinos, who receive an estimated 30 percent of their business from California residents. But the spending in the campaign has been large on both sides, with tribal interests matching the deep pockets of Nevada's casino companies. Recent polls show the proposition is likely to pass, but a long court challenge could follow.
Gov. David M. Beasley, Republican of South Carolina, has found that his opposition to establishing a state lottery and his attacks on the state's mushrooming $2.5-billion-a-year video poker industry have caused the gambling industry to contribute heavily to his Democratic opponent, former State Representative James Hodges. The largest video poker operator in the state, Fred Collins, has spent millions on newspaper, radio and television advertisements urging voters to "Ban Beasley." And to make matters worse for the Governor, the Republican Governors Association, whose members receive significant support from gambling interests, recently dropped a plan to spend $500,000 for advertising on Mr. Beasley's behalf.
Arizona voters are expected to approve a ballot measure that would extend the operation of the state lottery through July 2003. Without the passage of Proposition 304, the lottery would end next July, but despite some opposition from religious groups, the measure is expected to win easily. As a result, campaign spending has been minimal.
According to the analysis by the Campaign Study Group, the largest individual contributor to Federal candidates and parties was Mirage Resorts, which gave $327,000 of a total of $442,000 to Republicans. Mirage, a Las Vegas casino company, has projects planned for Mississippi and New Jersey.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about political contributions from the casino industry misstated the amount contributed by Hilton Hotels to the Republican National Committee. It was $150,000, not $250,000. The article also referred incorrectly to the relative amounts spent on the ballot referendum in California regarding Indian casinos in the state. The Indian tribes spent more than twice the amount spent by the casino industry; they did not merely match it.

HEADLINE: 42d St. Revival May Alter Face Of Theater Row

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
Hoping to tap the resurgent energy of Times Square for Off Broadway as well as Broadway, a development that would include as many as 11 smaller legitimate theaters as well as about 250 new apartments is being planned for the heart of West 42d Street's tenement-line Theater Row, west of Ninth Avenue.
Some of the theaters would replace ones currently on the block, and most would be no larger than 99 seats. But the centerpiece would be a 499-seat house jointly sponsored by the Shubert Organization that would be the first new commercial stage ever built expressly for the Off Broadway theater in New York. 
 The large theater and perhaps four smaller ones would occupy the base of a new mixed-income rental apartment tower about 35 stories high at the southwest corner of 42d Street and Dyer Avenue, where traffic spills out of the Lincoln Tunnel.
Three small buildings with theaters occupy the site now. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has agreed to sell a key parcel of land to the 42d Street Development Corporation to advance the project.
The project is sponsored by the development corporation that owns Theater Row, and it has selected the Brodsky Organization as the builder. The plan needs no special zoning approvals, and participants expect a groundbreaking next year.
Financing for the project would come from the purchase of property and air rights by the developer, city and state grants and private sources tapped by participants.
The project would further a remarkable urban transformation. Theater Row is where the reclamation of 42d Street had its first uncertain beginnings more than 20 years ago, when state-sponsored 42d Street Development Corporation uprooted an almost unbroken line of tenement storefront sex shops and massage parlors and replaced them with a group of small Off Broadway theaters, turning the stretch into a New York success story.
Now, with straight plays an endangered species on Broadway, midsize theaters are in hot demand as arenas where potential hits incubated by small drama companies can be transferred for successful runs and possible transit to Broadway.
Beyond that demand, the alliance of three substantial interests, the non-profit Development Corporation, the Port Authority and the Shubert Organization, Broadway's largest theater owner with 16 houses and a half share of a 17th, puts powerful forces behind the plan. "We're really excited about building this new theater and optimistic that construction can begin in 1999," said Rebecca Robertson, vice president for real estate at Shubert.
But for the plan to take full effect, participation is needed by two groups, Playwrights Horizons, an innovative and independent off Broadway company with two theaters on the block, and the Alliance of Resident Theaters, known as ART New York, representing 350 not-for-profit theaters. They are still negotiating their roles with the development corporation.
The talks involve complicated real estate and theater management issues, and the parties declined to discuss them while talks were continuing. Judy Rubin, the chairwoman of Playwrights, said the group had not yet made a decision. But she said, "We'd like nothing better than to have the Shuberts in the complex."
If the Shubert theater goes into the base as planned, three existing 99-seat theaters that would be displaced by the construction -- the Intar, Judith Anderson and Theater Row Theater on the western end of the block -- would be rebuilt on an adjacent 41st Street lot that the Port Authority has agreed to sell to the 42d Street group for about $2 million.
In addition, said Fred Papert, president of the Development Corporation, three or four new theaters of up to 99 seats could also fit into the building. The Brodsky Organization, the developer, has agreed to pay the corporation about $10 million for the property and air rights.
Other financing would come from a variety of sources. Brodsky has two partners, Bob Quinlan and Michael Field. The city and state would each put up $3 million for renovation and administration of the theaters, and the Shubert Organization and Mr. Sprecher would pay for their own construction.
"This deal will turn a minor piece of Port Authority property into a major asset for the arts," said Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority and chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, New York's economic development arm.
If for any reason the large theater plan falls through, Mr. Papert said, the base could be occupied by the three theaters that would be displaced.
The plan also calls for two other existing 99-seat theaters, the Samuel Beckett and the Harold Clurman toward the eastern end of the block, to be renovated or gutted and rebuilt where they are now. (The theaters have odd numbers of seats to take advantage of contract provisions setting minimum pay scales for theaters of a certain size.)
The project would substantially transform Theater Row, a stretch of old-law tenements out of the world of Eugene O'Neill or Clifford Odets lining the south side of 42d Street between Ninth and Dyer Avenues.
Left to their own plans, however, are two midblock buildings, the renovated home of Playwrights Horizons with two theaters, and an adjacent restaurant, Chez Josephine, run by a stepson of the performer Josephine Baker. Playwrights may decide to renovate its own two theaters as well.
The theater project would help the block catch up with the redevelopment frenzy that has gripped the Times Square area since the Walt Disney Company, with generous low-interest state and city loans, bought the New Amsterdam Theater in 1993, setting off a long-awaited land boom.
"Theater Row was once quite nice compared to the rest of the street," said Jean-Claude Baker, owner of Chez Josephine. "Now we look like a main street in East Germany compared to Disney."
Other theaters to the west across Dyer Avenue, the Fairbanks, Pulse and John Houseman, among others, are not part of the project. But redevelopment plans for that block as well are beginning to be explored.
Mr. Papert said the goal was to open the hallmark Shubert theater by Jan. 1, 2001. The Shuberts would jointly own the new theater with Ben Sprecher, who owns the 399-seat Promenade and 499-seat Variety Arts theaters and operates the 299-seat Lortel. (The theaters have peculiar seat totals to take advantage of contract provisions setting minimum pay scales for theaters of a given size.)
Mr. Papert, who would manage the new theater, said he expected the development to become "the flagship of Off Broadway." The city's 15 commercial Off Broadway theaters were all converted to their current purpose from other uses.
Mr. Sprecher put the shared cost of the new theater at several million dollars; others said it might be about $6 million.
Since Dan Brodsky, the designated builder, has an agreement with the 42d Street Development Corporation to buy the necessary air rights to build the tower and the Port Authority has already voted to sell its parcel to the project, no further state, city or community approval is required, Mr. Papert said, although the city must certify that in the end, theater space is undiminished on the block.
Still, the strength of the real estate market is unpredictable. If negotiations toward final agreements drag on well into next year, Mr. Papert said, Mr. Brodsky could risk loss of his financing commitments.
With the vacant parcel that the Port Authority has agreed to sell the 42d Street group and with unused air rights above the three theaters that the apartment building would replace, Mr. Brodsky would gain access to about 200,000 square feet of development space, enough for a tower of at least 30 stories, Mr. Papert said.
For technical reasons, the site does not qualify for additional air rights transfers through a contentious theater district proposal passed by the City Council in August.
The Theater Row plan is the latest act in a long-running redevelopment drama that began in early 1975 when Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Mr. Papert and other preservationists working to save Grand Central Terminal from demolition took a walking tour west on 42d Street and came face to face with the massage parlors and strip tease joints west of Ninth Avenue.
Prodded by Mr. Papert, their efforts evolved into the Development Corporation, which set about acquiring virtually all properties between Ninth and Tenth Avenues. By 1978 the sex parlors had been evicted and the storefronts renovated for lease to small theater companies. By then, too, Manhattan Plaza, where 70 percent of the apartments were set aside for performing artists, was also helping turn around the neighborhood.
Under the new Theater Row plan, the Brodsky building would have 20 percent of its apartments set aside for low-income tenants, a step intended to provide the builder with a tax abatement and secure the support of community groups long wary of threats to over-gentrify a neighborhood still hospitable to local shopkeepers and rent-stabilized tenants.
The Brodsky organization would build the shell of the as yet unnamed Shubert-Sprecher theater into its base, and the construction would be completed by the theater partners themselves. Mr. Papert said Brodsky might also be called upon to build up to four smaller theaters above the large theater.
"Our mandate was to renew a desolate, derelict and dangerous neighborhood," Mr. Papert said. "We chose the tool of the performing arts, like Lincoln Center, and it's worked. There are so many actors now in the neighborhood, when a waiter in the restaurant reads you the specials, that's an audition."

CORRECTION-DATE: November 5, 1998, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about plans to redevelop Theater Row on West 42d Street misidentified the manager of a proposed 499-seat theater and misattributed a comment by him. The manager and co-owner would be Ben Sprecher, who owns the Variety Arts and Promenade Theaters and manages the Lucille Lortel, all Off Broadway -- not Fred Papert, president of the 42d Street Development Corporation. It was Mr. Sprecher, not Mr. Papert, who said he expected the new theater to become "the flagship of Off Broadway."
