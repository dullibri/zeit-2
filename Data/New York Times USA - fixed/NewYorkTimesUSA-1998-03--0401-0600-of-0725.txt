HEADLINE: 2,250 Layoffs Set at Chase, Or 3% of Staff

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Corporation, the nation's largest bank, said yesterday that it planned to lay off about 2,250 employees, or about 3 percent of its work force, as it consolidates administrative and business functions.
About half of the layoffs, or 1,125 jobs, will be in the New York metropolitan region and New York State. The cuts are part of a plan to eliminate about 4,500 of the bank's 69,033 positions over the next 18 months by laying off workers and by not replacing others who depart. 
 When Chase and the Chemical Banking Corporation agreed to merge in 1995, the two banks employed about 75,000 people. The completion of the merger in 1996 brought the elimination of about 12,000 jobs. But the number of employees subsequently grew, in part because of smaller acquisitions Chase pursued, such as last year's purchase of the credit card business of the Bank of New York Corporation.
Chase employees have been aware for some time that layoffs were on the way and a climate of uncertainty has pervaded the bank -- an uncertainty that will now be prolonged as Chase carries out the layoffs.
An internal memo circulated to employees in January indicated that layoffs were coming. At the time, Chase said it was freezing hiring in its corporate and business-support units. Chase also said it planned to trim $70 million a year from its budget by declaring a "moratorium on the use of all management consultants," reducing its sponsorship of events and other measures. Chase said yesterday that many of the cuts would affect the company's back-office operations, though it said the rest would be proportionally shared among the bank's other operations.
"The uncertainty is nothing new," said one employee who insisted on anonymity. "Now we just know what the exact numbers will be."
Chase said it would take an after-tax charge of $320 million against its earnings for the first quarter, related to the layoffs and administrative consolidation. No further layoffs are envisioned for the immediate future, the bank said.
Chase's president, Thomas Labrecque, said that the broad outlines of the layoffs were decided only this week and that he had consulted Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani about them. Mr. Labrecque said annual savings from the moves would be about $460 million.
"It's a meaningful chunk of change that will make investors feel better about the company's earnings outlook," said Diane Glossman, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.
The bank plans to reinvest the savings in highly profitable businesses like cash management, high-yield debt, advising on mergers and acquisitions, stock research and underwriting, originating and servicing mortgages and credit cards.
Mr. Labrecque said the moves would assure that revenue growth would rise to 10 percent annually in the next two years from current rates of 8 percent. He also said the cutbacks would help achieve a goal of an 18 percent return on equity -- a key measure of profitability.
"Where we're really looking for the push is not that the expense base will go down, it's that the revenues will rise," Mr. Labrecque said.
As part of the reorganization, Mr. Labrecque also said that Chase would create a unit, Chase Business Services, that would perform functions common to all of the bank's businesses, like marketing, benefits administration and property management.
Chase also announced that it would raise its quarterly dividend to 72 cents from 62 cents and that it planned a 2-for-1 stock split, pending shareholder approval. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Chase shares rose $6.4375, to $134.75.
Despite the reaction of the market, some analysts said that yesterday's announcement failed to allay some of their concerns about Chase, such as its continued exposure to economic uncertainty in Southeast Asia and the soundness of some of the bank's loans.
"This was a very narrow restructuring announcement and didn't get to some of the more meaningful issues like credit quality," said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company.

HEADLINE: Developer Seeks to Build Another Hotel in (Where Else) Times Square

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The developer Bruce C. Ratner is negotiating with city and state officials to build a 450-room hotel behind his entertainment center now rising on 42d Street in what would be a major revision of the redevelopment plan for Times Square.
The proposal is yet another sign of both the continuing resurgence of Times Square and of a booming hotel industry. Mr. Ratner's hotel is the seventh such project planned for the area and would sit less than a block from another developer's 860-room hotel, which has already received state approval. 
 Mr. Ratner has signed a tentative deal with Doubletree, a hotel chain owned by the Promus Hotel Corporation, to build the moderately priced hotel tower on 41st Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, according to real estate executives and city and state officials. The hotel would loom over the developer's 335,000-square-foot entertainment and retail complex -- which includes a Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum and a 25-screen movie theater -- that is under construction on 42d Street.
But to go forward with the project, Mr. Ratner is also seeking tax breaks from the city and the state's approval to amend the master plan for the redevelopment of Times Square, the once-sorry neighborhood that has become the address in Manhattan most sought after by retailers and office tenants. The plan originally envisioned four new office towers at the intersection of Seventh Avenue and 42d Street; two office buildings are under construction, and the remaining two development sites on Seventh Avenue are up for sale.
The plan also called for the restoration of six theaters in smaller buildings at the center of the block. But Mr. Ratner is proposing a tower for that location.
The Municipal Art Society, a longtime critic of overbuilding in Times Square, says that the once desolate streets are now in danger of being overshadowed by tall buildings.
"The rebirth of entertainment and retail has been so successful that Times Square's sidewalks and streets are congested," said Brendan Sexton, president of the Municipal Art Society. "We're looking at two more office towers with deep public subsidies and God knows how many hotels. I think we're straining the limits of credible urban planning."
Mr. Ratner declined comment, as did city officials. But Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, confirmed that negotiations were under way with Mr. Ratner.
Mr. Ratner's pending hotel deal has not come without the kind of high drama worthy of the theater district. In 1995, he was selected to build the entertainment complex. More recently, he decided to add a hotel, striking a deal with the city's Economic Development Corporation. But three weeks ago, according to people involved on both sides of the negotiations, City Hall scuttled the hotel deal, thinking it was too favorable to Mr. Ratner. The developer then began talking with another set of city officials who are now close to a new deal. If approved by the mayoral administration, the proposal would then go to the state.
"If an agreement is reached," Mr. Gargano said, "a hotel on 41st Street would not only be a perfect complement to the rest of the block, but would bring life and foot traffic to the western end of the street. We all know New York City needs more hotel rooms."
There is no question that the hotel industry is booming, after suffering through a devastating recession in the early 1990's. Most hotels are operating at or near capacity, and the average room rate has jumped 38.5 percent, to $187, since 1991.
"In today's climate, you could do a hotel anywhere in Manhattan," John Fox of PKF Consulting, a lodging consultant, said. "The occupancy numbers are still extraordinarily high, and nothing on the horizon makes me think that's going to change."
Still, the proposed Doubletree hotel would be going up against six other hotels comprising 2,338 rooms planned or under construction in the Times Square area. There are currently more than 4,200 hotel rooms; the largest hotel, the Marriott Marquis, has been running at about 90 percent occupancy. Mr. Ratner is so bullish on hotels in Times Square that he recently submitted a proposal to build a hotel over the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 42d Street and Eighth Avenue.
"More critical mass in Times Square, be it retail, office or hotel, is good news for everyone," said John Livingston, president of the Tishman Urban Development Corporation. "It means more people, more tourists, more consumers will come to this street."
Mr. Livingston's company plans to begin construction next year on a 45-story hotel on the east side of Eighth Avenue, between 42d and 43d Streets. In the meantime, Tishman is building a retail and entertainment complex on 42d Street that will include a Sony cineplex, cafe and retail store, as well as a Museum Company store, restaurants and an arcade.
Across the street, Mr. Ratner is building a $160 million complex that would include, in addition to Madame Tussaud's and the 25-screen theater, an HMV record store alongside the newly restored Liberty, Empire and Harris theaters.
Planet Hollywood International plans to build a 564-room hotel at the southwest corner of Broadway and 47th Street, while Sofitel is putting up a 400-room hotel on 44th Street, near the Avenue of the Americas. Marriott is building a 244-room Courtyard hotel on 40th Street, between Broadway and the Avenue of the Americas. Philip Pilevsky is building a 170-room hotel in the American Radiator building on 40th Street, and Homestead Village is building a 150-room hotel next door.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. FISCAL PLAN REJECTS PROGRAMS SOUGHT BY CLINTON

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee today proposed a Republican fiscal blueprint for next year that rejects nearly all of President Clinton's calls for increased domestic spending but provides smaller tax cuts than sought by many Republicans.
The proposal from Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, is the first detailed Republican budget plan this year and appeared likely to be adopted more or less intact by the committee this week over Democratic opposition. If approved by the full Senate, it would serve as the chamber's broad tax and spending guideline as it confronted the first Federal budget surpluses in a generation and began grappling with the long-term financial crises facing Social Security and Medicare. 
 The plan calls for Federal spending of $1.73 trillion, an increase of 3.6 percent over this year, but turns aside the White House's proposals for new education, child care and health care initiatives.
It provides for tax cuts worth $30 billion over five years, about half what the Republican Party's more ardent tax cutters have been demanding. And it goes along with the Administration's insistence that any budget surpluses be set aside until the nation agrees on a way to shore up Social Security, which will run short of money in coming decades as the enormous baby boom generation retires.
White House officials said that Mr. Domenici's plan attacked the core of their plan to help families by improving public schools and providing more assistance with day care expenses.
"This budget squeezes out education and squeezes out children," said Gene Sperling, the White House's economic policy adviser.
One of the Domenici proposal's main features is the earmarking of any proceeds from a legislated settlement with the tobacco industry over the illnesses caused by smoking to help Medicare, the health insurance program for the elderly.
Although there is no assurance that Congress and the industry will come to terms on a deal, Mr. Clinton's budget proposal allocated $65 billion in anticipated proceeds from any settlement largely to his new spending plans, including $21 billion in new financing for child care over five years and $7.3 billion to reduce the size of classes.
Mr. Domenici said that since 14 percent of Medicare's expenditures -- about $30 billion a year -- go to treat smoking-related illnesses, any tobacco settlement should go to averting the financial problems that Medicare will face as the population ages.
The proposal was criticized by some Republicans, who want to use any tobacco money for tax cuts, as well as by Democrats, who said it would gut their spending agenda. But Mr. Domenici defended it as the most prudent use of the money.
"That's the program that's most justified in having that money," Mr. Domenici said in releasing his plan at a budget committee hearing.
Mr. Domenici also took on the White House in his approach to paying for the lone piece of major legislation passed by the Senate so far this year, a $214 billion highway construction and mass transit bill that exceeds by $23.5 billion the spending limits set by last year's bipartisan balanced budget agreement.
He said that the increased spending should be covered by spending cuts that Mr. Clinton had proposed to help finance his social programs. The proposed cuts include curtailing health benefits given to veterans who have smoking-related illnesses unconnected to their military service and administrative cost reductions in the Medicaid program of health insurance for the poor.
Senate Democrats have been working on an alternative proposal that keeps intact Mr. Clinton's main spending proposals. Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the budget committee, said the Republican plan would not help families as the Democratic plan would. And Mr. Lautenberg said that by allocating the proceeds from any tobacco settlement to Medicare rather than to a variety of other popular proposals including anti-smoking programs, Mr. Domenici's plan risked destroying any chance of a deal with the tobacco companies.
With midterm Congressional elections coming in November, members of both parties said they looked forward to the debate over their differences, with Democrats happy to run as supporters of the social programs backed by Mr. Clinton and Republicans arguing in favor of a less expensive, less powerful Federal Government. The differences between the parties are likely to be even more pointed in the budget proposal that House Republicans plan to introduce late next month, which may call for deeper tax and spending cuts than Mr. Domenici's plan.
"By passing this budget, we will move powerful and effective programs forward while forcing the Federal Government to live within its means," said Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon.
But Senator Patty Murray, a Washington Democrat, said the Republican plan endangered the nation's long-term economic and fiscal health by shortchanging children and education. "If our children don't get a good education," she said, "they won't get good jobs and the economy won't be strong."
For all their differences, though, the two parties are much closer in agreement on fiscal policy than they have been in years. Both Democrats and Republicans have pledged to keep the budget balanced and to live within the spending caps set out in last year's balanced budget deal. Republicans no longer seem intent on forcing showdowns over eliminating entire Cabinet departments or slashing spending on entitlement programs, and appear willing to allow overall spending to grow.
Some of the most contentious debates are likely to be within the Republican Party. Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota told fellow Republicans on the budget committee today that the tax cuts in Mr. Domenici's plan were not big enough, and that surpluses ought to be used for cutting taxes and reducing the national debt.
Republicans are also divided over how quickly to begin backing proposals to rescue Social Security. A growing number of them want to use any surpluses to finance private retirement accounts to augment or partly replace Social Security, while others are fearful of embracing any fundamental change to the system unless Mr. Clinton and the Democrats are also willing to sign on.

2 Top S.&L.'s Will Merge, Creating Formidable Giant
The nation's two largest savings and loan companies, once intense rivals in the takeover game, agreed to merge in a $9.9 billion stock swap that would create a West Coast behemoth capable of competing with the new giants of consumer banking.
The deal, in which Washington Mutual of Seattle agreed to buy H. F. Ahmanson of Los Angeles, would make the new company triple the size of the nearest competitor among savings and loans. Page A1. 

Big Merger in Steel
Ispat International, a London-based steelmaker that has grown rapidly through global acquisitions, will buy Inland Steel of Chicago for $888.2 million plus $538.6 million in assumed debt. Inland's shares rose 18.4 percent on the news, and stocks of several other domestic steelmakers rose as well on speculation that they too could become acquisition targets. D3.
 
Panel Approves I.M.F. Funds
A Senate panel approved $18 billion in financing for the I.M.F., but only if the fund formally voted to make major changes in the way it lends money. A8.
 
Oil Prices Fall Below $13
Crude oil prices slid further, falling beneath $13 a barrel for the first time in nine years before recovering slightly. Prices have been eroding on the diminished likelihood that OPEC will reduce the global oversupply. D7.
 
Mixed Day on Wall Street
After a big run-up the previous day, stocks were mixed, buoyed by merger news but hurt by sagging oil prices.

Starts of Housing Soar 6 Percent
The nation's housing market boomed in February, with starts rising 6 percent, but industrial production was unchanged, signs that domestic demand was offsetting whatever ill effects the economy suffered from Asia's crisis. Manufacturing output also held steady last month. Factory utilization fell to 82.7 percent. D5.
 
S.E.C. Sees Pyramid Scheme
The S.E.C. charged International Heritage, a North Carolina company that calls itself a direct sales organization, and three of its founders with luring 155,000 investors into a $150 million pyramid scheme. D6.

HEADLINE: Biggest S.& L.'s In Merger Deal Of $9.9 Billion

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
The nation's two largest savings and loan companies, once intense rivals in the takeover game, agreed yesterday to merge in a $9.9 billion stock swap that would create a West Coast behemoth capable of competing with the new giants of consumer banking.
Washington Mutual Inc., a once-sleepy Seattle concern that in a very short time has become the largest savings and loan association in the country, said it would buy the second-largest savings unit, H. F. Ahmanson & Company of Los Angeles, to create a new company with $149.2 billion in assets. That would not only make it three times the size of its nearest competitor in the savings and loan business, but would also make it the seventh-largest company in the entire banking industry, far surpassing such West Coast rivals as Wells Fargo & Company, but trailing the BankAmerica Corporation. 
 Nationally, Washington Mutual would come after the Chase Manhattan Corporation, Citicorp, Nationsbank, J. P. Morgan & Company, BankAmerica and the First Union Corporation.
But how long the rankings will remain is far from certain. A wave of mergers and consolidations has swept the once-staid banking industry in the last three years -- among the mega-mergers is First Union's $17.1 billion deal for Corestates and Nationsbank's $15.5 billion purchase of Barnett Banks. Institutions have sought to build national franchises and redefine how they serve customers' needs, with some, like Washington Mutual, focusing on individuals and small businesses, while others like J. P. Morgan and the Bankers Trust New York Corporation seek to compete with Wall Street houses in serving big business.
"Washington Mutual is taking the Wal-Mart approach to consumer banking where they sell simple products like mortagages and checking accounts and don't try to nickel and dime you with fees," said Kenneth A. Posner, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company. "The thrift industry is dead because mortgages alone aren't enough anymore. Consumer banking has expanding margins and that's where Washington Mutual is heading."
Mortgage lending has traditionally been the savings and loan industry's bread and butter. But even though industrywide profits have been rising, and the economic landscape is more favorable than it was earlier in the decade, savings and loan associations have had difficulty in the increasingly competitive mortgage business.
Now, savings and loan associations are merging to make themselves more attractive takeover targets -- as did the Golden State Bancorp Inc., parent of the Glendale Federal Bank, when it agreed to acquire First Nationwide Holdings Inc., the parent of the California Federal Bank, in February. They are also using acquisitions to broaden their products and services, as Washington Mutual is doing.
In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Ahmanson's shares soared $12.375, to $77.875, while Washington Mutual's shares rose $1.1875, to $72.9375, on the Nasdaq stock market.
The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to result in the elimination of 3,000 to 3,500 jobs, or at least 10 percent of the merged company's work force, mainly through layoffs.
Asked if the deal posed any antitrust problems, a spokesman for the Justice Department said the department could not comment until it had studied the agreement. Wall Street analysts, however, said such problems were unlikely.
Washington Mutual and Ahmanson were on opposite sides in a bitter takeover battle last year for the Great Western Financial Corporation, a Los Angeles savings and loan association. Ahmanson made a hostile bid for Great Western in early 1997; it failed when Washington Mutual emerged as a so-called white knight. Washington Mutual proved to be the winning bidder, and the acquisition vaulted the company into the savings and loan industry's top spot.
Although Charles R. Rinehart, Ahmanson's 51-year-old chairman and chief executive, plans to leave the company when the merger is completed in the third quarter, both companies said yesterday that once the battle for Great Western ended, there was little enmity between them.
"It was hard fought, but we're big boys, and we had to get on with running our companies," Mr. Rinehart said.
For his part, Kerry Killinger, the 48-year-old chairman and chief executive of Washington Mutual, said that the merged operation would be able to offer cheaper and more personalized services to small depositors, who were overlooked or shunned by retail banking giants.
"There's a strong opportunity for consumer banking when you focus on consumers and small businesses more effectively than larger commercial banks can," he said.
Washington Mutual, which three years ago had only about $20 billion in assets, will enjoy a formidable presence on the West Coast, assuming the merger is completed. In California alone, it would rank second to the BankAmerica Corporation in terms of deposit share, and it would be the largest mortgage originator in the state.
Washington Mutual entered the California market in 1996 when it doubled its size by acquiring the American Savings Bank. The new merger will enhance its presence there, while also expanding its mortgage franchise nationally and giving it a foothold in Texas.
Washington Mutual and Ahmanson currently have assets of $96.9 billion and $52.5 billion, respectively. The new company is expected to serve 5.9 million households in the West, Texas and Florida, have pro forma profits for 1997 of $896 million, and have a market capitalization as of March 16 of about $27.6 billion.
Under the terms of the deal, Ahmanson shareholders would get 1.12 shares of Washington Mutual for each Ahmanson share they own. Based on Washington Mutual's closing stock price on Monday, that values Ahmanson at $80.36 a share, a 33 percent premium to Ahmanson's closing stock price on Friday.
Washington Mutual was advised in the transaction by Lehman Brothers Inc., while Ahmanson was advised by Credit Suisse First Boston.

HEADLINE: Population Of New York Rises Slightly

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
More than a million New Yorkers moved out of the city during the 1990's, but new immigrants and children born to them have more than replaced those who left, according to Federal Census figures released today.
The city's total population in 1997 reached 7,342,636, half a percentage point higher than the lowest point of the decade, in 1991, the Census figures show. 
 But the mostly static total figures for the 1990's mask huge flows of people: 1.07 million New Yorkers left the city; 677,000 foreigners moved to New York; there were 937,000 births and 516,000 deaths.
The slight growth, in large measure, helped push New York State's population to 18 million last year, giving it a 0.8 percent growth rate since 1990. Neighboring New Jersey saw the greatest growth in the region, with its population expanding by 4 percent, taking it slightly over eight million.
Overall, states in the Northeast and Midwest continued to lose ground to the booming growth centers of the South and West, the Census report showed, sustaining the steady trend that is inexorably shifting the nation's political and economic might toward the Sun Belt and Rocky Mountains.
"What we're seeing is the Northeast and Midwest losing its political clout," said Richard Munson, executive director of the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a bipartisan research organization for members of Congress. "The leadership of this Congress is decidedly Southern. And they are doing a pretty good job of getting dollars for their states."
The survey of population changes in the country's 3,142 counties showed that while the country grew by 0.9 percent last year, the Northeast's population increased by only 0.2 percent and the Midwest by 0.6 percent. At the same time, the West's population grew by 1.6 percent and the South by 1.3 percent.
 The one-year increase in New York City's population was small according to the Census Bureau's estimate: 7,812 people, or barely a 0.1 percent increase over 1996. But it was symbolically important for the city and its Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has been trumpeting the city's revival across the nation.
But demographers said the rapid turnover of New York City residents documented in the Census Bureau report could also create problems for the city. New immigrants are likely to need more services, taxing overstretched city resources. They will also be unable to vote, leaving them with little voice over government. And the swift in-and-out migration of people does little to bring stability to city neighborhoods.
"It makes New York look more like a jumping-off spot," said Andrew A. Beveridge, a professor of sociology at Queens College. "Turning over a seventh of your population in seven years is a very big shift."
The figures were part of a survey of population changes in the nation's counties that were based on estimates and not an actual accounting of the nation's population.
 The changes were most starkly evident in a roster of the country's fastest growing larger counties between 1990 to 1997. The first three slots were held by communities just south of Denver, where the sprinting growth of high-technology industries and the charm of Rocky Mountain living has attracted a flood of transplants from California and the East.
 But at the other end of the spectrum, the list of counties that lost the most population since 1990 was laden with Northeastern urban areas, including Philadelphia, which was at the top; Hartford, Brooklyn, and the Bronx. New York City's population grew overall because of growth in Manhattan, Staten Island and Queens.
 The political implications of the Census Bureau's new report, which was based on estimates of population growth, are potentially immense. A broad range of Federal policies are based on census statistics, from apportioning seats in the House of Representatives to allocating Federal money for hundreds of programs.
 Since today's report offers the closest thing to a preview of the Census in 2000, which is intended to be the most accurate accounting of the nation's population, it also foreshadows losses in Federal aid and Congressional seats for the Northeast and Midwest come the new millennium.
 The statistics also have broad implications for each state's internal politics. Significant growth in the metropolitan region's suburbs will give them increasing power in state legislatures and over gubernatorial elections.
 Demographers and economists cited a host of reasons for the national trends in the new population figures, including a tide of immigrants from Latin America and Asia to the South and West, stronger economic growth in those regions and the continued allure of warm climates for retirees from the frigid North. They also said that rapid growth in rural areas of the West and South has created a demand for new jobs building roads, sewers and houses, which in turn has attracted even more people to those regions.
 "It's sort of a chicken-and-egg thing," said Rae Rosen, the senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "If there were jobs, counties wouldn't lose population. And on the other hand, a growing population also creates more jobs."
 Between 1990 and 1997, New York State's population increased by 0.8 percent, or 146,448, to 18.1 million. New York City grew by 0.3 percent in that time, with Manhattan, Staten Island and Queens all growing while the Bronx and Brooklyn lost people.
 Ms. Rosen noted that population growth in New York City seemed in large part fueled by the booming stock market, which has brought thousands of new jobs to Wall Street. But the upstate region saw significant population losses, a result, she said, of a shrinking industrial base and the continued exodus of people from farm regions.
 New Jersey, which was the first state in the region to have replaced all the jobs lost during the last recession, showed the strongest population growth in the New York metropolitan region, according to the report. The state's population increased by nearly 4 percent, or 305,099, to just over eight million between 1990 and 1997. That was still below the national average of 7.6 percent, and far below such rapid-growth states as Georgia.
 Only two counties in New Jersey lost population between 1990 and 1997: Hudson, which dropped 0.3 percent, and Essex. Essex includes New Jersey's largest city, Newark, where the population dropped 3.5 percent to 750,842.
 The national pattern of cities losing people to the suburbs was particularly pronounced in Connecticut, where the population declined by 0.6 percent, or 17,258, to 3.3 million.
Modest growth in most of the state's counties was completely offset by the shrinkage of three urban areas: Hartford, New Haven and New London.

HEADLINE: Mississippi Reveals Dark Secrets of a Racist Time

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss., March 17

 BODY:
After a 21-year court fight, the state of Mississippi today unsealed more than 124,000 pages of secret files from a state agency that used spy tactics, intimidation, false imprisonment, jury tampering and other illegal methods to thwart the activities of civil rights workers during the 1950's, 60's and early 70's.
Like an eerie journey into a shadowy past, the files of the agency, the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, provided a profoundly unsettling reminder of the state's determination to maintain Jim Crow segregation, as reporters and individuals named in the commission's files began to review the computerized records. 
 While some of the commission's methods have been known for years, the full files released today demonstrated the scope of its work. Investigators made note of the skin color, associations, religious beliefs and sexual proclivities of the civil rights workers they tracked. They jotted down the license plate numbers of cars parked at civil rights meetings and peeked into bank accounts. Informants, many of them black Mississippians, reported to the commission about plans for marches and boycotts.
In some cases, the potential for using violence against civil rights workers is discussed in commission memorandums. Although none of the documents reviewed to date show a direct state hand in the numerous deaths of rights advocates in Mississippi in those years, they clearly reflect the mindset of the state's white supremacists: to maintain segregation at all costs.
In one 1959 memorandum, for example, Zack J. VanLandingham, a commission investigator, tells of a conversation he had with a Hattiesburg lawyer, Dudley Connor, about Clyde Kennard, a black man who tried to desegregate Mississippi Southern College in Hattiesburg in the late 1950's.
"If the Sovereignty Commission wanted that Negro out of the community and out of the state they would take care of the situation," Mr. VanLandingham quoted Mr. Connor as saying. "And when asked what he meant by that, Mr. Connor stated that Kennard's car could be hit by a train or he could have some accident on the highway and nobody would ever know the difference."
In another memo, this one written by Mr. VanLandingham to Gov. J. P. Coleman in 1959, the investigator related a conversation he had with John Reiter, a campus police officer.
"Reiter had several weeks ago told me that when Kennard was attempting to enter Mississippi Southern College in December, 1958, that he had been approached by individuals with possible plans to prevent Kennard's going through with his attempt," he wrote. "One of the plans was to put dynamite to the starter of Kennard's Mercury. Another plan was to have some liquor planted in Kennard's car and then he would be arrested."
On Sept. 15, 1959, Mr. Kennard was in fact arrested on charges of illegal possession of whisky, after police officers claimed to have found five half-pints of whisky and other liquor under the front seat of his car. His problems did not end. He was sentenced to prison after his arrest for possession of five bags of stolen chicken feed. He died a short time later of cancer.
The release of the Sovereignty Commission files here comes as the South is making fresh efforts to disinter the history of some of its most tortured times.
After years of silence, the family of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is encouraging efforts to discover whether James Earl Ray really was responsible for the 1968 assassination of the civil rights leader. Federal investigators in Birmingham, Ala., have reopened the case of the 1963 bombing of the 16th Avenue Baptist Church, which killed four little girls.
Last week in Little Rock, Ark., former members of the Women's Emergency Committee to Open Our Schools held a news conference to release its membership roster for the first time. Because members feared for their physical and economic well-being, the group largely worked underground between 1958 to 1963 to reopen schools that had been closed by Gov. Orval Faubus to deter court-ordered desegregation.
Here in Mississippi, several civil rights advocates who were the subjects of Sovereignty Commission investigations said today that they may use their newly released records to file lawsuits against the state. Prosecutors said that it was also possible that information found in the files could be used to press criminal charges against suspected perpetrators, if they are still alive.
"Certainly, if there's evidence that comes to light regarding any crime that occurred in our jurisdiction, then we'll certainly investigate that, take a look at it to see whether it's prosecutable, just like we did in the Beckwith case," said Bobby DeLaughter, a Hinds County assistant district attorney here in Jackson, where the mayor is black.
In 1994, Mr. DeLaughter won conviction of Byron De La Beckwith for the 1963 assassination of the N.A.A.C.P. leader Medgar Evers after learning that the Sovereignty Commission had aided Mr. Beckwith's defense in two previous trials in which the juries deadlocked.
A new trial was ordered after Jerry Mitchell, a reporter for The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson's daily newspaper, used information leaked from Sovereignty Commission files to write in 1989 that the commission had secretly aided in Mr. Beckwith's defense by helping to screen potential jurors to weed out Jews and civil rights sympathizers.
The unsealing of the Sovereignty Commission files ended a two-decade legal battle that began in 1977, when the state Legislature voted the commission out of existence but sealed its records for 50 years. The American Civil Liberties Union and several individuals filed suit to keep the records open, and in 1989 Judge William H. Barbour of Federal District Court here ordered that they be released.
It took nine more years to satisfy appeals and to establish a process to allow subjects of the commission's investigations to exert their rights to keep their own files private. Some of the commission's files have been reportedly destroyed, and about 7,700 pages out of a total of 132,000 pages of files remain secret because 42 people claimed privacy rights, said Katie Blount, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, which has maintained and indexed the files.
The commission, which was created in 1956 with a $250,000 budget, formally existed until 1977. It was the model for similar agencies that fought desegregation in other states.
The opening of the Sovereignty Commission files has generated a debate here between those who believe that the ugliness of the past should remain buried and those who believe that only a full airing can bring healing. Some civil rights advocates have fought the opening of the files because they believe their release could hurt the subjects of Sovereignty Commission investigations once again by releasing unsavory, and possibly untrue, details about their personal lives.
"It will probably bring forth some memories of a bad time in the state, which we all acknowledge was a bad time now," said former Mississippi Gov. William F. Winter, a member of the President's Advisory Board on Race. "I hope it'll be the basis for understanding that we can't ever lapse back into the kind of intolerance we once had in this state."
One of the few living members of the Sovereignty Commission, Betty Long, 69, said today that she, too, was pleased that the files had been opened. "I want facts to be known instead of innuendo and rumors," she said, adding that she did not believe that the commission had been involved in murder or other acts of violence. "At the time, everyone in the state was gung-ho to keep things segregated and that was tied in with the idea of the communists taking over. It's something I wish had never happened."
For those who have waited for decades to see what information the state had collected about them, their family members and their friends, the day provided a long-awaited moment of revelation and relief.
"Twenty-one years is a long time to wait to see what is in here," said Ellie J. Dahmer, clutching a packet containing the file on her husband, Vernon Dahmer, who was shot to death in 1966 while fending off a Ku Klux Klan firebomb attack on his house in Hattiesburg.
Mrs. Dahmer, who spoke outside the archives building in front of a memorial to the Confederate dead, said she hoped that her husband's file may help prosecutors retry Sam Bowers, an Imperial Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan who was acquitted in 1968 of ordering the firebombing. That trial, for arson, ended when the jury deadlocked 11-to-1. A second trial, for murder, also ended with a deadlocked jury, this time 10-to-2.
The Clarion-Ledger published an article by Mr. Mitchell last week saying that notes taken from F.B.I. files suggest that Klan members had contacted jurors in the first case.
"When it came up 11-to-1 one time and 10-to-2 the next time, we thought something might be wrong, but we didn't have any way of proving it," Mrs. Dahmer said. "It shows what kind of state we lived in, what kind of environment there was, what they really thought of black people."
A review of Mr. Dahmer's file today revealed no evidence of Sovereignty Commission involvement in Mr. Bowers's trials.
The commission files also show that the commission's director, Erle Johnston Jr., ordered one of its investigators, A. L. Hopkins, to look into the facts surrounding the 1964 murder of three civil rights workers -- Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney.
Mr. Hopkins reported first that some of the local law enforcement officers on the case had assured him that they were working hard to solve it. But by his last report he was noting that some of the officers had themselves been arrested and charged in the deaths and were headed for trial.

HEADLINE: Costs Are Seen On Target To Meet Goals In Curriculum

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 17

 BODY:
State education officials said today that estimates on the amount of financing needed to meet new curriculum standards adopted in 1996 were largely on target and that only a slight increase in spending would be necessary to continue to meet those standards in the next few years.
Since Gov. Christine Todd Whitman adopted the curriculum standards in 1996 as part of her school financing plan, opponents have contended that estimates of the financing needed to meet the standards were inadequate. But state education officials said today that their review proved that the estimates were accurate and that spending to meet the curriculum standards has been equitable for all school districts. 
 Today's announcement came as the New Jersey Supreme Court was weighing a judge's recommendation to spend $312 million a year more on supplementary programs in the 28 urban districts. The Whitman administration has urged the court to reject the recommendation, saying the state is already spending more than enough to insure that urban schools meet the constitutional requirement.
In recommending only a slight increase in spending for the 1999-2000 school year, the state is trying to convince the Supreme Court that its financing plan is equitable, said Lynne Strickland, a spokeswoman for the Garden State Coalition of Schools. "They are in the middle of a court case," she said, "so they need a consistent argument to prove their original plan was valid."
The Governor's plan requires education officials to adjust the spending level every two years. The officials announced today that the recommended spending level would increase to $7,827 in 1999, on average, from $7,426 this year.
Peter Peretzman, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Education, said education officials based the spending adjustments on a report that studied the spending habits of 103 "high performing" school districts. The report recommends that districts spend an average of $7,083 per pupil in elementary schools, $7,933 per pupil in middle schools and $8,500 per pupil in high schools in 1999-2000. New Jersey spends more per pupil than any other state.
"The increase that we are recommending is sufficient and appropriate to provide a thorough and efficient education," Mr. Peretzman said.
By setting curriculum standards and a spending limit, Mrs. Whitman intended to end the decades-old court battle over the disparity between the richest and poorest school districts. The standards sought to insure that all of the state's 1.23 million public-school children received the "thorough and efficient" education guaranteed by the State Constitution.
But the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled last spring that the plan was unconstitutional, because the recommended spending level was not necessarily enough to assure that poor districts can meet the standards. The court required Mrs. Whitman to send an extra $248 million to the 28 poorest urban districts this year, so they could spend as much as the 120 wealthiest districts. Since the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the judge's recommendation, the spending levels recommended today do not apply to those 28 districts.
A spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association, Frank Belluscio, said the increase recommended by state officials today was insufficient because it only kept up with the inflation rate.
"There has never been a clear link between this spending level imposed by the state and what actually goes on in the classroom," he said.

AMERICAN BANKERS INSURANCE TO TALK WITH CENDANT

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The American Bankers Insurance Group Inc., a Miami-based insurer that covers credit card debts when borrowers become disabled, unemployed or die, said yesterday that it would start talks with the Cendant Corporation over Cendant's tender offer of $67 a share, or $3.1 billion. That tops the $58-a-share that American International Group Inc. agreed to pay. "Cendant is now in the driver's seat, and the pressure is on A.I.G. to counter fast or lose out," said Patrick McGurn, director of corporate programs at Institutional Shareholders Services in Bethesda, Md. American Bankers has been at the center of a bidding war between Cendant, a direct marketing and franchising company whose brands include Avis car rentals and Howard Johnson hotels, and A.I.G. since Jan. 27, when Cendant offered $58 a share to wrest the company from its agreement to be acquired by A.I.G. for $47 a share.

HEADLINE: Polls Are Split On Credibility Of Key Figures

BYLINE: By MARJORIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
In the aftermath of newly detailed accusations of sexual misconduct against President Clinton, the American public continues to approve of his job performance, but is divided on whether to believe Mr. Clinton or his latest accuser, Kathleen E. Willey, three national polls have found.
More than 60 percent of respondents said they approved of the way Mr. Clinton was handling his job, according to polls conducted by ABC News, CBS News and by the Gallup Organization for CNN and USA Today on Monday night, after Ms. Willey appeared on the CBS News program "60 Minutes" on Sunday evening. 
 The polls found that most assessments of Mr. Clinton had not substantially changed since the interview, in which Ms. Willey, a former White House aide, said the President made a sexual advance in November 1993 in the Oval Office. The ABC News poll found that evaluations of Mr. Clinton's honesty and ethical standards remained low, while a majority continued to approve of his leadership qualities and economic accomplishments.
Americans are split on whether they believe Ms. Willey's claim or Mr. Clinton's denial. In the poll conducted by CBS News, for example, 48 percent say they believe Ms. Willey and 44 percent believe Mr. Clinton -- a statistical tie.
The polls did reveal some negative opinions about the President. Almost half of the public professes to have "lost respect" for the President "since the start of this year" in the Gallup poll.
CBS News found 52 percent who say they believe Mr. Clinton "has engaged in reckless sexual conduct while President."
According to the ABC News poll, 60 percent say he has engaged in a "pattern of sexual misconduct."
Mr. Clinton may continue to get high marks for his job performance because of the robust national economy and because most of the public -- 58 percent of those surveyed in the ABC News poll -- considers the accusation about Mr. Clinton's sexual conduct to be a private matter. Only a quarter of those polled consider the accusation to be of great importance to the nation, according to the CBS News poll.
On the other hand, the possibility of perjury on the part of the President remains of greater concern. Seventy percent in the ABC News poll said that based on what was known right now, Mr. Clinton should remain in office. But, if it is shown that the President lied under oath, 63 percent said he should resign; 53 percent said that if he did not resign, he should be impeached.
While men and women are equally likely to support the way Mr. Clinton is handling his job, they differ in their assessment of Ms. Willey's accusation. Men are more likely to believe Ms. Willey's account of the incident; women are more inclined to believe the President.
CBS interviewed 529 adults who had been previously polled, while ABC and Gallup each called a new random sample. The ABC poll is based on 655 adults, and the Gallup poll was conducted with 651 adults. All three polls, conducted by telephone, have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.

HEADLINE: Clinton Pushes Plan for Medicare at Age 55

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17

 BODY:
President Clinton went to Capitol Hill today and, at a rally with three dozen Democratic members of Congress, pushed his proposal to open Medicare to millions of people 55 to 64 years old.
Hundreds of supporters, lobbyists and labor union members cheered the President, who clearly relished the opportunity to show that he was doing business, undistracted by any sex scandal or grand jury investigation. 
 Mr. Clinton also expressed alarm at reports that some insurance companies had found ways around a 1996 law intended to make coverage available to people who change jobs or lose their jobs. "These practices have to be stopped," he said.
He ordered the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, "to conduct a thorough review of the options for strengthening the protections" of the 1996 statute, known as the Kassebaum-Kennedy law. "We intend to enforce it vigorously," Mr. Clinton said.
Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who was a co-author of the law, said he would introduce legislation this week to set limits on the premiums that can be charged to people exercising their rights to buy individual health insurance coverage under the law. The insurance industry adamantly opposes Federal regulation of rates.
The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, found that people with medical problems, though theoretically guaranteed access to insurance under the 1996 law, could be "priced out of the market" because they were charged premiums far higher than the standard rates.
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, said: "This is an outrage. It makes a farce of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. If the G.A.O. report is accurate, the industry is circumventing the spirit of the law and may be circumventing the letter of the law."
Charles N. Kahn 3d, chief operating officer of the Health Insurance Association of America, said: "You can regulate rates all you want, but if you have a few million-dollar cases, premiums for everybody will still go up. It would be much better to have broad-based subsidies for the insurance premiums of high-risk individuals, rather than regulating rates."
Republicans have generally been cool to the President's proposal to expand Medicare. But Democrats said they would take the issue directly to the Senate floor, bypassing the Finance Committee and forcing Republicans to vote on expansion of Medicare in this election year.
The President said his proposal "presents no threat to the integrity of the Medicare program or the security of the trust fund."
Mr. Clinton would offer Medicare coverage to two groups: people 62 to 64 who cannot get health benefits through an employer and unemployed people 55 to 61 who lost insurance coverage along with their jobs.
Under the proposal, people 55 to 64 years old could buy Medicare coverage by paying premiums of $300 to $400 a month. People ages 62 to 64 who chose this option would also have to pay surcharges on their regular Medicare premiums after they reached the standard eligibility age of 65.
The premiums and surcharges, combined with measures to crack down on Medicare fraud, would pay for the coverage, Mr. Clinton said. He observed that people 55 to 64 were often unable to find affordable insurance in the current market.
Legislation to carry out the President's proposal is being introduced by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, and Representative Pete Stark of California, the ranking Democrat in the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. Cosponsors include Mr. Kennedy and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader.
Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who headsthe Subcommittee on Health, said, "We first need to fix the current shortfalls in Medicare and Social Security before we consider the President's proposal to increase Government spending and expand yet another Government program."

Even With More Jobs, Unemployment Rises

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
New Jersey's unemployment rate rose a tenth of a percentage point in February -- to 5 percent -- even as the number of jobs in the state increased by 12,500, the State Department of Labor announced yesterday.
Although the figures may seem contradictory, they are not, said Kevin Smith, a department spokesman. Because the unemployment rate incorporates the number of residents who are both unemployed and seeking jobs, the rate can rise simply because jobless people who had not been looking for work have resumed their search, Mr. Smith said. That is probably what happened in New Jersey last month, he added, due to optimism about the economy. 
 The creation of new jobs, although still a positive economic indicator, may not reduce the unemployment rate, Mr. Smith said, depending on how many of those jobs are filled by unemployed residents seeking work. Last month's new jobs were concentrated in the retail, construction and transportation industries, Mr. Smith said.

16 'Brownfields' to Get Federal Aid for Cleanup

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has chosen 16 areas as "brownfields showcase communities" that will share a total of $28 million as well as technical assistance from 15 Federal agencies for environmental cleanup and economic revitalization.
Three of the communities are in the New York metropolitan region: Trenton, which received $2.1 million; Stamford, Conn., which received $979,000, and Glen Cove, N.Y., which received $1.4 million. 
 Brownfields are moderately polluted pieces of land, usually in inner cities, where the contamination is not severe enough to qualify for the Federal Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund list of the highest priority cleanup sites.

HEADLINE: Suburbs' Mass-Market Mansions;
Baby Boom Luxury: Huge Home, Often on a Tiny Lot

BYLINE: By DEBRA WEST 

DATELINE: IRVINGTON, N.Y., March 16

 BODY:
When Evan and Susan Ratner were shopping for a new home, they looked for a community like the one where they grew up in Smithtown, N.Y.: a development with young families, where children skated on cul-de-sacs and called to neighbors over backyard fences. They also wanted, and could afford, more luxury than their parents would have dreamed possible.
It didn't take them long to find both. 
 Much as the generation that grew up with a family station wagon has shown an appetite for even bigger sport utility vehicles, the children of suburbia who were raised in three-bedroom ranches, where elegance meant a basement rec room, are now buying luxury estate houses in subdivisions.
These are not sprawling estates, but instant neighborhoods of supersized tract houses, built on relatively small lots. They are luxurious Levittowns, and they represent a new kind of suburban dream.
"My Dad just dragged my Mom out of Brooklyn," said Mr. Ratner, 35, a vice president of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the investment firm. "It was 1968 and he wanted grass and trees in the backyard. When he got it, he felt like he had achieved the American dream.
"For us it's a little different," said Mr. Ratner, a father of three. "We grew up there. We're kind of going on to the next step, in size and process. My parents had no choice in the house they bought. It was there, take it or leave it. We could say, 'Here is what we want and this is how we want to do it.' "
In June, the Ratners will be moving from West Orange, N.J., into their new home, a 7,000-square-foot white clapboard colonial on 1.7 acres, among 55 luxury homes here overlooking the Hudson River. The house has six bedrooms, seven baths, a mudroom as big as a kitchen, a library and a blue stone patio. It sits on a cul-de-sac with five other mansions. Prices in the development start at $799,000 and exceed $1 million.
In 1996, the most recent year for which figures are available, nearly 14 percent of new houses built nationally were 3,000 square feet or larger, said Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research at the National Association of Home Builders.
The trend is seen mostly in the suburbs of big cities. Nearly 18 percent of new houses built in the Northeast, 15 percent in Texas and Florida and 12 percent in the West are larger than 3,000 square feet. The measurement itself is a reflection of how houses have changed in the past decade.
"Ten years ago they didn't even have that category," Mr. Ahluwalia said. In 1986, the largest category measured was 2,400 square feet or larger and it included 18 percent of new house construction nationally. At last count, 30 percent of new houses were at least 2,400 square feet.
It is not only size but luxury that makes the subdivisions of estates stand out, said Alexander Garvin, a professor of architecture and planning at Yale University.
"They call them McMansions," Mr. Garvin said. "Mass-produced large homes that sell for three-quarters of a million dollars. You haven't seen anything until you see what they are doing in Texas, where they build these homes on one-fifth of an acre. The house takes up the whole property."
The sheer mass of these houses has already caused a backlash.
The Town of Eastchester, in Westchester County, passed a law in September restricting home size based on the size of the lot. The largest house that can now be built on a 100-by-100-foot lot is 4,725 square feet, said Joseph C. Vohnought, the town engineer. Similar measures have been passed in Newton, Mass., a suburb of Boston, and Hinsdale, Ill., a suburb of Chicago.
Estate developments are being squeezed onto available land in expensive suburbs like Rye and Roslyn, N.Y., and Wayne, N.J., and spreading out in more modest towns like Yorktown, N.Y., Southbury, Conn., and Jackson Township, N.J.
The new luxury houses have features that were once found only on true estates, like columned entrances and two-story foyers with marble floors and dramatic curving staircases. They often include a "great room," an oversized eat-in kitchen that opens into a family room; and bathrooms with "his and her" dressing rooms, double-sized whirlpool tubs and steam showers. Three-car garages are standard.
What they don't have is a lot of land. The buyers want a lot of house instead. Often, they don't want the chores and the sense of isolation that go with a big piece of property.
Mammoth houses lined up on neat half-acre lots seem like a lost opportunity to Mr. Garvin, who criticizes the real estate industry for selling false French facades and heavy-handed Mediterranean styles in place of better design. "All that money could have been spent for a much better environment and much more beautiful buildings and still sell at the same price," he said.
Two factors have made the houses appealing and affordable, said Kira McCarron, vice president of marketing for Toll Brothers of Huntingdon, Pa., the country's largest developer of luxury homes.
One is the increasing wealth of the middle class. In 1996, 8.2 percent of households nationally had annual incomes of $100,000. In 1970, only 3.2 percent had equivalent incomes, based on 1996 dollars, Ms. McCarron said.
The other factor is that the cost of luxury has dropped with the mass manufacturing of items like Palladian windows, porticos and curved staircases. "We have perfected a method of customization that allows for incredible houses and economies of scale," Ms. McCarron said.
Toll Brothers built 2,488 luxury houses in 16 states last year. Its average home is 3,500 square feet and costs $400,000. Like most luxury developers, Toll Brothers offers hundreds of custom options.
Of the 40 million people born in the baby boom years from 1954 to 1964, many have outgrown their starter homes and have enough equity and income to afford trophy houses. In addition, a significant number of empty nesters are defying conventional real estate wisdom and trading up.
K. Hovnanian Enterprises, the largest residential developer in New Jersey, made its reputation building affordable housing. A decade ago, people camped out overnight and entered lotteries by the thousands for the chance to buy one of the company's modest homes in Jersey City, starting at $97,500.
But since 1990, Hovnanian has responded to the desire for more opulence, said Ara Hovnanian, president and chief executive. Now, 20 percent of Hovnanian's new homes are larger than 2,800 square feet and cost $280,000 to $600,000, he said.
"In the 80's there was a surge of first-time home buyers that led to tremendous growth," Mr. Hovnanian said. "What we're seeing today is the second- and third-time move-up buyers. We've made a shift in our focus and emphasis, and a lot of it has to do with demographics. It's definitely consumer driven."
Who are the consumers leading the charge?
"I think it is a super-middle class," said Emanuel Tobier, a professor of economics and planning at New York University. "In income terms, they are upper income. But in class terms, they are middle class. There may be too many of them to live in that characteristic estate manner of 20 years ago. They live differently. They don't want to be that isolated and they don't need to be. They are not celebrities."
Many new mansions have a home office and a nanny's suite, reflecting busy working couples, but rarely do they have a traditional maid's quarters off the kitchen, Mr. Garvin said.
"The rich don't have kitchens that open into family rooms," he said. "They have help prepare the meals."
Yet the new mansions do have celebrity-sized kitchens. "The kitchens and bathrooms have become the most important rooms," said Arlene C. Travis, an interior designer in Glen Cove, N.Y. Her company, Mansions and Millionaires, started out restoring old mansions on Long Island back in 1973, in the age of diminished expectations, when people looked at huge homes as energy-wasting anachronisms.
"The kitchens, not because you cook, but because it shows you appreciate good food," she said. "The bathrooms, they don't even call them bathrooms anymore. They have become more of a spa."
Nikki van der Vord, 29, has a whirlpool tub. She and her husband, Andrew, and two preschool daughters live in the Park Lane Reserve, a development of 306 luxury homes on 396 acres in Harrison in Westchester County. At 3,700 square feet and $659,000, the van der Vords' cream-colored colonial is among the development's more modest homes.
The couple, who are British, were transferred to the United States four years ago by Mr. van der Vord's employer, Schroder & Company, a British investment bank. They plan to stay, partly because of the housing opportunities.
"You couldn't get this in the U.K.," Ms. van der Vord said, gesturing to an expanse of window that brightened the great room, and beyond to the neighbors' mansions, visible from each room in the house. "They don't build estates like this so close to the city."
Developing luxury homes makes economic sense, Mr. Ahluwalia said. Profit on a subdivision house is typically 5 to 10 percent, regardless of style, he said. Therefore, costlier homes mean higher profits.
"They charge for every upgrade you get," Mr. Ratner said. "They'll say: 'A two-car garage is standard. Oh, you want a three-car garage? That's another $10,000.' But what are you going to do? Who wants a two-car garage?"

For Fanatics, Sports Webcasts

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
IT'S not quite like being there. It does not even approximate television. But if you are in Fresno, Calif., or Chippewa Falls, Wis., and your favorite team is in Chicago or Denver, it's the next best thing. And for some sports junkies, that is a great leap forward.
Meet the Internet simulcast, the newest medium for live sports, and its fan: the Web potato. 
 "It's obviously not TV, where you can get all excited, but for my options, it's as good as it gets," said Chris Grusz, a Seattle software salesman who uses the browser in his cubicle at work to tune into Chicago Bulls basketball games.
To some, the idea of "watching" games unfold in simple text is a likely sign of lunacy. But Mr. Grusz is among thousands of point-and-click fans who are happily tuning into ESPN Sportszone, CBS Sportsline and a handful of smaller operations that seek to simulate games as they happen, using animation or text updates fed from the sidelines.
ESPN is set to begin its first full season of Web-based baseball coverage, while CBS is embarking on a second full season. Each offered football games last season, and ESPN recently started Gamecast for the National Basketball Association. Last season, CBS Sportsline's Baseball Live was its most popular on-line offering, attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers each game, the company said.
Perhaps more impressive, the Total College Sports Network, a division of Total Sports, based in Raleigh, N.C., was viewed by at least several hundred thousand viewers during the first weekend of the NCAA tournament. The 10-month-old network has provided real-time play-by-play, charts and digital photos for hundreds of college basketball, football and baseball games in the last year.
Make no mistake, the experiences are not even a distant cousin of television. CBS provides animation based on Java, an Internet language for interactive and multimedia programs. For football, an image of a football helmet moves across the field as a team marches on a drive; for baseball, animated figures round the bases as a running box score keeps a tally.
The network promises an elaborate upgrade for this baseball season. CBS is using a program called Shockwave, a multimedia application for a browser, to make the action look like an arcade baseball game.
ESPN focuses more on statistics, providing running play-by-play text, rosters, box scores and shot charts.
These Webcasts may be a harbinger of what is called convergence, the melding of television hardware and content with home computer hardware and content. In the case of sports, that means fans will be able to use one screen to get access not only to broadcasts but also to mountains of statistics -- chocolate and peanut butter for fans.
The signs of convergence are already evident in radio, where technology that permits broadcasts to be carried over the Internet makes hundreds of games and events available to anyone with a connection, speakers and a copy of audio-streaming software like Microsoft's Netshow or Real Network's Real Player. In baseball, at least 13 major league baseball teams, two dozen college teams and a handful of minor league teams were set up for doing audio feeds as of February. And you thought you had to be at the park to follow the Winston-Salem Warthogs or Durham Bulls.
The Internet now provides audio access to many other sports: hockey, soccer, golf, auto racing, college basketball, horse racing and rodeo, among others. Audio Net, a Dallas-based Internet broadcaster, even offers play-by-play for contests broadcast exclusively for the Internet, like events at some small universities.
There is even access to sports talk radio, which is where sports fans can go after they have seen the game and the highlights (twice) and they need to find the deeper meaning.
Eventually, Web simulcasts should begin to incorporate not just audio but also video streaming and still shots to create a much richer experience, said Ross Levinsohn, vice president for programming and executive producer at CBS Sportsline.
"We've just built the Edsel," Mr. Levinsohn said. "This is the forebear to the Rolls-Royce, which is still three to six years away."
The early incarnation is apparently welcomed by displaced fans like Louis Crandall, an economist with R. H. Wrightson & Associates in New York, who cannot wait for the baseball season. During the summer, two of the computers on Mr. Crandall's desk are devoted to work and one to the Pittsburgh Pirates. A native of Pittsburgh, Mr. Crandall said he loved to keep the Webcast on in the background; he said it was less intrusive than radio. Last season, he used his browser to watch a no-hitter that Pittsburgh won in extra innings. "It was great when Mark Smith's home run came across" the Internet, said Mr. Crandall, his voice rising as if he had actually been there.
The Webcasts are also attractive to gamblers, their creators admit. "We have no idea how many, but a pretty significant number of people are looking at this because they have an interest in gambling," said Geoff Reiss, senior vice president for sports at ESPN Interactive.
Other competitors may soon get into the Cybercast game, too, said Rick Alessandri, vice president and general manager of Sports Ticker Enterprises, an ESPN-backed venture that provides real-time statistics to more than 100 on-line services. Mr. Alessandri said Yahoo, Fox and America Online were among the companies considering more elaborate real-time coverage.
CNN/SI, the Web site representing CNN and Sports Illustrated, already carries live video of sports-related press conferences. There is just one catch: it runs at 10 frames per second, pokey slow.
Indeed, Web-based live sports are primitive enough to be the domain of die-hard fans. Basketball may be the ultimate example. It is a game that is so fast-paced, it sometimes does not even lend itself to television commentary, let alone to text-based updates. To wit, from a recent ESPN Gamecast of a contest between the Houston Rockets and Minnesota Timberwolves:
"Hou: Charles Barkley defensive rebound
"Hou: Clyde Drexler 3-pointer (Hou 55, Min 43)
"Time remaining, 3:33
"Min: Kevin Garnett layup, assist Stephon Marbury (Hou 55, Min 45)
"Time remaining, 3:17
"Hou: Charles Barkley 3 second violation
"Hou: Mario Elie for Clyde Drexler
"Min: Stephon Marbury miss"
Even David Stern, the Commissioner of the N.B.A., would have trouble selling the experience as Fan-tastic. ESPN gurus do not dispute that.
"This medium cannot and does not replace visual satisfaction in terms of covering Kobe Bryant taking an alley-oop pass and dunking it," said Mr. Reiss, of ESPN Interactive. "What we can do is provide a far greater level of understanding of what is happening in that event. For the hardest-core fans, it's the greatest augmentation that they've ever seen."
Technology aside, the Webcasts will probably face some opposition from other media in the not too distant future, legal experts say. The courts may have to decide whether the Internet functions more like a newspaper or like a broadcast medium, which would put it into direct conflict with television licensing.
But the Webcasts are a godsend to a self-admitted sports junkie like Joseph Pilar, a retired courier in Baltimore. Rather than watch games from his couch, as he used to, Mr. Pilar sits at his desk. That way, he can still watch games on the 21-inch television, then swivel to the 17-inch monitor to get text-based play-by-play updates on the Internet for other games.
"This way, I don't have to wait for the CBS announcer to say, 'Let's go to New York for an update of other scores,' " Mr. Pilar said. "I know everything as it happens."

Household Savings Rate Declines in Japan

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 18

 BODY:
Japan's average household savings fell in 1997 for the first time in four years, signaling that the nation's slump has spread to one of the pillars of the economy.
Average savings per household fell to 16.35 million yen, or $125,769, in 1997, a decline of 1.3 percent from the year before, the Management and Coordination Agency said. The decline was a result of higher taxes and falling wages. 
 To be sure, the Japanese are still the world's biggest savers, with a national savings rate about 2.5 times that of the United States as of 1996, according to the Bank of Japan. Japanese have about 1,200 trillion yen ($9.2 trillion) in savings.
The average savings of a salaried worker's household fell 2.3 percent, to 12.50 million yen, the survey showed. That was the first decline in three years.
The Government raised taxes three times last year, including a two-percentage-point increase in the national sales tax, the elimination of three years of special income tax rebates and a jump in medical insurance premiums. That cost the average household 200,000 yen ($1,538) in lost income, according to the Japan Research Center.
The higher taxes, as well as concern over job security, led consumers to spend less. Declining sales of autos, homes and other big-ticket items prompted companies to cut wages and hiring, further dampening sentiment.

Treasury Issues Fall on Report Of Tightening Labor Markets

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities finished lower yesterday after a Federal Reserve account of business conditions around the nation said that labor markets were stretched to the limit.
The Fed's "beige book" report asserted the economy was growing so vigorously that demand for labor was generating substantial wage demands and hampering production. 
 Prices moved in very narrow ranges for most of the session and were barely changed just ahead of the beige book's release.
But prices went to the lowest levels of the day after the report came out. Within a half-hour of the release, the 30-year Treasury bond was down 8/32, yielding 5.91 percent. But by the end of the day it was down only 3/16, to 103 3/16, for a yield of 5.90 percent -- up one basis point, or hundredth of a percentage point, from Tuesday.
"With labor markets stretched to the limit in many areas, there have been reports of rather large wage increases," the anecdotal summary of regional economic activity said.
The market was also edgy ahead of today's reports on February consumer prices and January trade data.
Chris Rupkey, vice president and financial economist at Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi, said that the market's movements, while small, were not random.
"We rallied overnight on the dollar going above 130 yen, and they sold it at the opening," he said. "It came back, and then right after 11 o'clock, they priced the $1.6 billion Raytheon deal. That's when we saw the highs of the New York trading day."
Raytheon sold $1.6 billion in debt in a four-part offering that included 3-year, 7-year, 12-year and 20-year debt securities.
Bonds retreated a bit as oil rallied from nine-year lows after Venezuela called for an agreement among both the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers to cut oil output.
But bonds mostly meandered until the small selloff that ensued after the Federal Reserve released its beige book report.
The market trimmed its losses after the Treasury announced the size of its monthly two-year and five-year note auctions.
The Treasury said it would sell $14 billion of two-year notes on March 24, $1 billion less than it sold in February. The Treasury also said it would sell $11 billion of five-year notes on March 25.
"We're still in an uptrend from the rally we've had since March 6 when we hit 6.09 percent," Mr. Rupkey said, "but I don't sense a lot of people want to try and join the rally here -- not at this level."

Foreign Investors Start Return to Thailand

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, March 18

 BODY:
Fresh investment has begun flowing into Thai companies and banks for the first time since the financial system started to crumble eight months ago, raising hope that foreign investors are starting to acquire assets made cheap by severe currency and market losses.
Thai financial institutions have gotten a much-needed lift from a spate of deals in recent days, including one announced today under which the Dutch banking giant ABN AMRO will assume majority control of the medium-sized Bank of Asia. The investments do not amount to a rush, and some analysts remain skeptical that Thais are prepared to sell property and companies at prices foreigners are willing to pay. 
 "Strategic buyers are beginning to come into this market, and that is very good news," said Nikhil B. Srinivasan, a Morgan Stanley vice president based in Bangkok. "But anyone who flies in here thinking fire sale is going to be disappointed."
In fact, long-term foreign investment has remained elusive, not only for Thailand but for nearly all damaged Asian economies. Potential investors say that even some overly indebted local companies, determined to save face for their founding families, choose to default on loan payments rather than part with prized possessions at bargain prices.
Legal restrictions have also been an obstacle. Thailand recently adopted a Western-style bankruptcy law that will allow creditors to foreclose on debtors, but the law remains untested in court. The Government continues to ban outright foreign ownership of land, a restriction many see as a strong deterrent to investment here.
Still, officials concede that the country cannot recover on its own, and they have urged foreign investors to bail out banks and finance companies. Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai recently completed a visit to the United States, where he sought to stir the interest of business executives. "We have to admit frankly that we do not have the money in Thailand" to revitalize local companies, Mr. Chuan said in a recent interview. "We will depend on foreigners for some time to come."
A few Western companies are taking up the offer, as seen in ABN AMRO's deal to acquire a 75 percent interest in the Bank of Asia, Thailand's 11th-largest commercial bank. Under a letter of intent, the Dutch bank will make an initial purchase of shares and inject $184 million into the bank.
But in a concession that illustrates the difficulty of reaching investment agreements amid the current economic turmoil, ABN AMRO agreed to determine the final purchase price in 2000, when the Thai market will presumably have strengthened. The Dutch bank also used the word "alliance" to describe its purchase, though it will have a dominant position and control management.
Although many foreign banking companies, including Citicorp and the ING Group of the Netherlands, have scouted potential Thai and other Asian partners, ABN AMRO's deal marks the first significant investment by a Western bank since the Asian financial crisis began last summer. DBS Bank of Singapore took a controlling interest in Thai Danu Bank late last year, but that was seen as a government-to-government arrangement.
Foreigners have also begun to acquire some of Thailand's nonbank finance companies. The Taiwan-based China Development Corporation announced earlier this week that it would spend about $20 million to buy a 40.5 percent stake in Bangkok First Investment and Trust, a finance company now owned by Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest.
Societe Generale of France last week raised its holding in Asia Credit, a Thai finance company, from 25 percent to 51 percent, an increase valued at $156 million. ABN AMRO also recently bought a large stake in Asia Securities Trading.
Big industrial companies are also getting foreign help. The financier George Soros and a consortium of other foreign investors last week agreed to channel $650 million into the Nakornthai Strip Mill, by far the biggest investment in a Thai company during the crisis. The consortium plans to reorganize and expand the steel plant, a unit of the debt-ridden NTS Steel Group, and replace local managers with foreigners.
Although those deals are substantial, analysts doubt that they will lead to a slew of foreign takeovers. A key reason is that Thai company bosses still have a strong antipathy to selling their holdings.
Indeed, some companies wary of selling big stakes to foreign strategic partners and risking the loss of control are rushing to take advantage of improved market sentiment and to raise funds in a way that protects the existing management. For example, Thai Farmers Bank, the country's second largest, just began a worldwide share subscription drive to raise $1 billion.
"We think this will be enough to tide us over into the next century," said Banthoon Lamsam, the bank's president, in a recent interview. He said the offering was intended to limit foreign share ownership to 49 percent and to preserve family control over the bank. "We do not foresee the need to bring in a strategic partner," he added.
Moreover, potential investors are hesitating to take stakes in Thai companies willing to accept foreign control, largely because the economy is still weakening. The Government thinks that output will shrink 3.5 percent this year.
Even the largest Thai companies have suspended payments owed to banks, putting them in technical default and raising tricky legal questions for potential foreign suitors. Companies are already posting big losses, but most analysts expect that the worst is yet to come. For that reason, many foreign investors are likely to wait until late this year before committing themselves to big deals, analysts say.
"Thailand is still on its way down," says Russell Kopp, research chief at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson here. "Until Thais become more realistic about their prospects and set prices accordingly, I don't think we're going to see many bailouts."

HEADLINE: Accra Journal;
African Hospitality No Match for Clinton's Hordes

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ACCRA, Ghana

 BODY:
The last time this country received a visitor of such note, it was nearly four decades ago, and the guest was a young Queen Elizabeth. Newly independent and lacking the kinds of accommodations typically reserved for royalty, the Government hurriedly built an extension to a whitewashed old fort that still serves today as State House.
Ghana's Government is again frantically preparing for a special guest, President Clinton, who is to stop here on March 23 on the first leg of a six-nation African tour. Mr. Clinton's visit will be the first by an American President to sub-Saharan Africa in 20 years. 
 But in a sure sign of changing times, in the weeks since Mr. Clinton's visit was confirmed, no amount of rushing seems to have sufficed to meet his logistical needs.
Though Queen Elizabeth arrived here with an entourage of a couple of dozen royal handlers and aides, Mr. Clinton, the President of the world's only remaining superpower, is bringing a super-sized delegation of about 800 people, including the press. After much hand-wringing and planning sessions by advance teams and Ghanaian officials that even resulted in a trimming of the delegation size, it was decided that Mr. Clinton could simply not stay overnight in Ghana.
There were just not enough hotel rooms.
In its own way, the mismatch between an American Presidential delegation and the available hotel space in a West African capital like Accra sums up in miniature the gap between rich and powerful America and a largely poor Africa.
With the possible exception of South Africa, each stop on Mr. Clinton's itinerary, from Ghana to Uganda, and Botswana to Senegal and Rwanda, will serve up reminders of just how rarely the United States accords Africa this kind of attention. There will be reminders, too, of how unequal the discussion can be whenever the Americans do come.
Whether the subject is Washington's current emphasis on commerce in its policy toward the continent -- summed up in the phrase, "trade not aid" -- or something as simple as traffic and security arrangements during each of Mr. Clinton's various stops, African officials may soon discover that with a guest this important, having the last word is next to impossible.
Many Ghanaian officials broach the topic of Mr. Clinton's impending visit with distinct pride in the fact that the White House has chosen their country at all, not to mention that it will be the President's first stop.
"Anytime the first family of the United States comes to your country, 98.7 percent of the world's media will be looking at your country for at least some portion of the day," said Kwame Peprah, Ghana's Finance Minister. "We will be doing everything we can, of course, to put on our best face."
Others involved in the nitty-gritty of making sure the visit comes off successfully, however, are already well versed in scarcely imagined difficulties in the details.
First, of course, was the hotel issue. Ghana's bustling capital has over 500 top-flight hotel rooms, putting it within the ballpark of the Clinton delegation's needs, but it turns out that the largest and perhaps best hotel, the Golden Tulip, is owned by Libyan investors, thus placing it out of bounds for official American guests.
Even though Mr. Clinton will not be spending the night, his advance team, security people and assorted aides and guests will be scattered across 24 hotels, prompting one diplomat to remark, "You can imagine the logistical nightmare involved in keeping everything clicking."
With a mixture of amused wonderment and slight irritation, Ghanaian officials tell stories of White House inspection visits that resemble a cross between a bomb squad sweep of a public building after a scare and a health department inspection of a neighborhood diner.
"I'll never forget watching one of these people, a lady, walking through the Castle with a clipboard saying: 'This will have to go. That's fine right there. And, oh, is there any way you could move this furniture?' " said one assistant to Ghana's President, Jerry Rawlings. "When we reached the outside, they took one look at the huge generator we have and said that it wouldn't do.
"The woman actually asked if we could replace it," Mr. Rawlings's assistant said, referring to a large, multimillion-dollar piece of heavy equipment. The same official reportedly asked if the Government could set up an international press center with hundreds of direct dial international lines, to accommodate the estimated 250 journalists traveling with Mr. Clinton.
Ghana is in a financial squeeze, made worse by a severe energy shortage that has lately forced tight rationing of electricity. So when the Government politely declined to replace the generator at the State House, Mr. Clinton's assistants began planning to fly in one of their own for use during his planned eight-hour stopover here.
As for the press center, in a country where placing even a local call can require persistence, the Ghanaian official said the visiting press would have to make do.
Besides logistics, Ghanaian officials are finding out that wherever policy and communications intersect, Mr. Clinton's visit will be tightly scripted, with each country on the African trip assigned its own special themes. In Ghana, the accent will be on shared historic bonds between the United States and West Africa, democracy and what Mr. Clinton will call Africa's continuing economic renaissance.
One leading Ghanaian businessman said that he had approached senior Government officials here and urged them to appeal to Mr. Clinton for emergency help in finding a solution to the country's energy crisis, but was rebuffed.
Other Ghanaian officials say they have urged that Mr. Rawlings, a fiery populist leader, make the most of the occasion by promoting "a new global economic order," and denounce the perceived hypocrisy of telling Africans to open their economies while Western countries remain protectionist.
"We've been told that Clinton is coming to change the way Americans think about Africa, from a continent of despair to a place of opportunity and hope," said a senior Ghanaian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I guess if you want the President of the United States to come, you've got to let him give his message."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Market Continues Its Climb, With Indexes Hitting Highs

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market soared further into record territory yesterday, sending all the major indexes to all-time highs.
The Dow Jones industrial average, rising steadily for almost two months, gained 25.41 points, to 8,775.40, its third consecutive record.
In a year when few Wall Street analysts expected to Dow to gain double-digits, the blue-chip average is already up 11 percent, one of its best starts this decade.
After three spectacular years of share price gains, the market is once again strengthening against a backdrop of solid economic growth, heavy cash flows into mutual funds and speculation that more and more companies will merge, pushing share prices even higher.
The brokerage industry -- one of the prime benefactors of this bull market -- has been both a source of tremendous profit growth, driven by an increasingly investment-hungry populace, and heavy speculation about new banking combinations.
Yesterday, for instance, talk that the Chase Manhattan Corporation might merge with Merrill Lynch sent Merrill's shares up more than 9 percent, despite denials among industry insiders that a deal was pending. Chase and Merrill declined comment.
Shares of Chase also rose a day after the nation's biggest commercial bank said it would cut 4,500 jobs, by laying off 2,250 employees and not replacing the others, in the next 18 months.
In the last three years, brokerage stocks, as calculated in the American Stock Exchange's security and broker-dealer index, are up about 500 percent, partly because of new combinations such as Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter and the merger of Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney, which is part of the Travelers Group.
Shares of several regional telephone companies also rose yesterday after Edward Whitacre, Jr., the chairman of SBC Communications, said he might be interested in buying another local phone company.
It has been that kind of a market. Earnings growth may be eroding, but analysts say investors believe the economy will remain strong, and the eagerness to own stocks is greater than ever.
Since the Dow fell 554 points last Oct. 27 to hit 7,161.15 on fears of a deepening economic crisis in Southeast Asia, the average has risen 1,614 points, or 22.5 percent. Even ardent bulls are wondering whether the market has risen too fast.
"The momentum unleashed in the last few weeks means we're going to go to the extreme on the greed side," said Alfred Goldman, director of market analysis at A. G. Edwards Inc. "People have lots of money and they don't want to leave a winning game."
Shares of energy companies gained after oil prices rebounded from a series of declines. Exxon and Chevron were among the leading Dow component stocks. Investors also bought up technology shares despite recent profit warnings. The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.98 points to close at a record 1,788.28.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 5.07 points to close at a record 1,085.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks rose 1.07, to a record 427.18.
Richard Eakle, an analyst and president of Eakle Associates in Fair Haven, N.J., said the market has been buoyed by middle-aged investors who see stocks as the fountain of wealth.
"The primary catalyst is the baby- boomer generation liquidity situation," he said. "That generation is going to invest as much as they can."

HEADLINE: 3 Top Cabinet Members Lobby Congress for I.M.F. and U.N.

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
Three senior Cabinet members warned today that American economic and security interests would suffer badly if Congress failed to approve new financing for the International Monetary Fund and pay its back dues to the United Nations.
Speaking in near-apocalyptic terms, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin went to Capitol Hill to plead for $18 billion for the monetary fund, nearly $1 billion for the United Nations and $2.5 billion for military costs in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf and for disaster relief. 
 "Our national security, and war and peace, are at risk by not having appropriate payment of U.N. arrears," Mr. Rubin said at a news conference. "The financial stability of the world is at risk."
The House and Senate are considering the requests, but the emergency spending bills have become entangled in partisan Congressional bickering, anti-abortion riders and many Republicans' deep distrust of international organizations.
Without quick approval of the spending bills, Ms. Albright said, "we're in danger of shutting down U.S. national security policy."
Emphasizing that American economic and security goals are interlocking, especially in countries like Thailand and South Korea, Mr. Cohen said, "We need to move on the I.M.F. funds as quickly as possible."
The rare appearance of the three powerful members of the Cabinet reflects a growing unease at the White House that two of President Clinton's top foreign policy priorities -- financing for the monetary fund and payment of the United Nations dues -- face formidable obstacles.
The House Republican leadership today postponed for the second time in a week a vote on a House-Senate conference report that would authorize payment of the United Nations dues. The leadership was unable to win backing from conservative Republicans, many of whom oppose paying the dues. House leaders are expected to try again on Thursday.
Separately today, the House rejected, by a vote of 225 to 193, a resolution that would have required Mr. Clinton to withdraw American troops from Bosnia.
The Administration initially asked Congress to consider the emergency spending for the military operations, disaster aid, the monetary fund and the United Nations in one large bill.
But House Republicans split the requests into two bills, one for the military and disaster spending, which could be approved quickly, and another addressing the more contentious issues of I.M.F. financing and back United Nations dues. The Senate followed suit.
On Wednesday the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the $18 billion for the monetary fund -- $3.5 billion for a new emergency credit line and $14.5 billion for reserves -- but attached strict conditions that must be met before most of the money could be spent. It dropped the requested $921 million in United Nations dues.
Mr. Rubin today praised the Senate committee for approving the $18 billion but said the conditions "could create a situation that could require six months, a year, perhaps indefinite time" to reach agreement with each of the 182 nations in the monetary fund.
In response, three Republicans from agricultural states that could lose exports if the Asian crisis deepens broke ranks and introduced a bill to modify many of the conditions.
"Passage of workable I.M.F. funding is critical to stem the Asian financial crisis before it spreads and overwhelms the rest of the world," said Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, who sponsored the bill with Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota and Senator Charles Hagel of Nebraska.
The situation with the spending bills in the House is even murkier. The House Republican leadership has held up its I.M.F. financing bill until the White House agrees to a provision to prohibit the State Department from giving aid to international organizations that lobby foreign governments to change their policies against abortion. Mr. Clinton opposes that provision.
With the monetary fund's coffers depleted by bailouts for three Asian countries, Mr. Rubin said, "there is a very real risk that if there were another major crisis, the I.M.F. would not have sufficient funds to deal with that crisis."
"If that were true," he said, "that could significantly affect our workers, our farmers and our businesses."

HEADLINE: Lockheed Seeking a Way To Save Its Northrop Deal

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 18

 BODY:
The Lockheed Martin Corporation is scrambling to salvage its proposed acquisition of Northrop Grumman, now that the Government has rejected a new proposal the company made in an effort to allay antitrust concerns.
But the chances that the deal may collapse appear to be growing as the Government and the company seem far apart, and indeed the Justice Department may sue to block the transaction. 
 "It would appear that the Government has constructed a scenario that's impossible to satisfy without making the deal unattractive economically," said Howard A. Rubel, aerospace analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company. He estimated there was a 70 percent chance that the takeover would not be completed as currently configured.
Reflecting that, Northrop Grumman's shares fell $2.50, or nearly 2.3 percent, today to $107.50. Lockheed Martin lost 81.25 cents, to $115.5625.
The Justice Department might go to court to block the deal as early as Thursday, some industry and Government officials said. But others, including Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, suggested that negotiations would continue.
The Defense and Justice Departments said last week that they were worried that the deal would stifle competition, in part because Lockheed Martin, a major aircraft manufacturer, would own a leading supplier of radar and other electronic systems used in those planes.
Lockheed on Tuesday proposed to sell part of Northrop's electronics business with more than $1 billion a year in sales, industry officials said. This was twice as much as the company had been willing to sell before the Government expressed its concerns. The company also offered to enter into consent decrees to insure that it would not discriminate against outside suppliers.
But the Government is pushing Lockheed Martin to sell all of the Northrop electronics businesses, with about $4 billion in sales.
That accounts for nearly half of Northrop's roughly $9 billion in revenue and would be a deal-breaker, industry officials said, because the electronics business is the main reason Lockheed wants Northrop. But it is not yet clear how much Lockheed would be willing to sell to win Government approval.
A Lockheed spokesman said the company was continuing to talk to the Government. A spokesman for the Justice Department also said the matter remained open, while a Pentagon spokesman said it was in the Justice Department's hands. Northrop Grumman had no comment.
Under the agreement announced last July for the $8.3 billion stock acquisition, either company can walk away from the deal if it is not completed by March 31. But the companies have told the Justice Department they will not close the deal before April 24.
Mr. Rubel of Goldman, Sachs said he did not think Lockheed and Northrop would want to fight the Pentagon, the main customer, in court. "I think they gave it a good college try," he said. "And if their customer says, 'Sorry,' they are better served by moving ahead and working on their own respective businesses than by having lawyers fighting each other."

Trade Surplus Soars in Japan

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, March 19

 BODY:
Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus for February climbed 88.7 percent from a year earlier to 1.28 trillion yen, or $9.8 billion, the Finance Ministry said today.
The surplus with the United States, Japan's biggest trade partner, rose to 539.03 billion yen, or $4.14 billion, in February, up 32.9 percent from a year earlier, it said. The figures were not adjusted for seasonal factors. 
 The overall surplus was near economists' average forecast of around 1.202 trillion yen, or $9.2 billion. Economists said the trade surplus was likely to continue rising because of a declining trend in imports, caused by weak domestic demand, a weaker yen and falling oil prices.
The growth in the surplus may heighten Washington's repeated calls on Tokyo to take decisive steps to revive its ailing domestic economy in the face of Asia's economic crisis.
A White House economic adviser, Gene Sperling, said earlier this week that the Administration was hopeful Japan would adopt a fiscal stimulus worth up to 10 trillion yen, or $77.5 billion.

HEADLINE: Strong Economy, No Inflation in Fed Survey

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
Despite a decline in export sales, the economy in all regions of the United States remains strong -- yet inflation seems "eerily calm," the Federal Reserve said today.
"Industrial activity is on the rise in most parts of the country, with orders and production up," it said in its "beige book" survey of regional economic conditions. "Most districts, though, are experiencing a decline in exports to Asia." 
 American consumers continue to spend strongly on most items except cars, the report said. It was based on information collected through March 9.
"Retail sales are generally up in most districts, exceeding retailers' expectations in many of them," it said. "Auto sales, however, are generally down, although demand for pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles remains high."
Before the Asian crisis emerged in full force this fall, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and his colleagues had been warning that labor shortages in the United States could eventually lead to increased inflation.
Since then, they have been counting on the impact of the Asian turmoil to dampen growth and ease labor shortages in the United States. So far, though, that does not seem to be happening, the beige book said.
"The demand for labor remains strong, with nearly all districts reporting shortages of workers at the entry level and in certain skilled categories," it said. "Widespread labor market tightness appears to have increased the degree of wage pressures."
Despite that, "pressures on product prices remain eerily calm," it said, adding, "Domestic competition, productivity gains and the Asian situation help to constrain production costs."
The beige book, named after the color of its cover, was prepared for the March 31 meeting of the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. The panel sets short-term interest rates through changes in the overnight rate on loans between banks.
A year ago, it nudged the rate up by a quarter percentage point, to 5.5 percent, citing excess demand in the economy. Since then, it has left the rate untouched, watching nervously to see if strong growth and scarce labor would produce increased inflation.
In other developments, the beige book said that mild weather in many parts of the country, the product of the El Nino current in the Pacific Ocean, had created "unseasonably hardy" housing markets and healthy commercial real estate markets.
But conditions on the nation's farms are mixed, it said.
"An abundance of precipitation has harmed crop prospects and delayed field preparation activities," it said.

A roundup of regional economic conditions in recent months for the Federal Reserve's 12 districts, according to the beige book report issued by the Fed yesterday.
 
Minneapolis -- Growth continued at a steady pace led by the construction, manufacturing and retail industries.
 
Chicago -- Growth increased modestly, led by gains in consumer spending and housing. Manufacturing operated near capacity and new orders showed no signs of slowing.
 
Cleveland -- The economy continued to grow at a moderate pace. Labor markets were strong and price pressures light. Real estate flourished.
 
Boston -- Retail sales picked up while manufacturing had mixed results. Many companies reported hiring difficulties.
 
New York -- The economy grew briskly in the first two months of 1998 with better-than-expected retail sales. The housing market retained momentum.
 
Philadelphia Manufacturers saw continued strength in shipments and orders, while retail sales were rising. Car sales eased.
 
Richmond Retail sales rose above last year's level. Manufacturers said shipments and orders rebounded sharply and real estate picked up.
 
Atlanta -- The Southeastern economy continued to grow at a moderate pace. Retail sales met expectations; home sales rose as mortgage rates declined.
 
St. Louis -- The economy continued to generate business growth with few signs of rising prices. Retail sales met expectations while manufacturers experienced strong sales and orders.
 
Kansas City Labor markets remained tight, with intensifying wage increases. Retail prices held steady, sales dipped slightly and construction slowed.
 
Dallas -- Economic activity expanded at about the same pace or a little slower as before. Manufacturing prices were flat to down while the service and construction industries saw higher prices.
 
San Francisco -- The economy continued its vigorous growth although with signs of moderation in certain areas, including retail sales. The effects of Asian economic turmoil were evident in several sectors.

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs Deal to Halt Missile-Gear Sales by China

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18

 BODY:
The United States is weighing whether to allow American satellite manufacturers to buy launching services from China, a senior Government official said today. In exchange, China would have to create a system to stop sales of Chinese missile technology to nations like Iran.
The move would waive sanctions imposed after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. It would allow President Clinton to take an attractive proposal with him when he visits China this summer. But it is far from clear that China can or will curb its sales of missile technology. 
 In this foreign policy stratagem, human rights policies are being shaped by expanding markets as well as strategic concerns. The Clinton Administration has made it known that it believes China's human rights record has improved in recent years. Last week it said it would neither propose nor support a United Nations resolution censuring China for human rights abuses.
That stance allows the Administration to propose a policy that is intended simultaneously to remove some of the stain of the Tiananmen Square massacre, help control the spread of weapons of mass destruction and increase commercial ties between the United States and China.
Critics of the evolving policy toward China contend that Beijing has never kept its promise to play by the rules of the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international agreement that China never signed but has pledged to follow.
In January the Congressional Research Service reported that China "may be continuing to violate its commitment to abide by the M.T.C.R. guidelines."
United States intelligence services regularly report that China may be selling military technology to nations including Iran and Pakistan. The State Department says some of these reports are inconclusive.
The biggest potential stumbling block for the new proposed policy is that the United States does not know what system, if any, the Chinese Government has for controlling sales of missile technology. China has never established export controls that would meet the international standard established under the missile control regime.
The proposed policy resembles an offer that the United States made to Russia last week. During meetings in Washington between Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, United States officials offered to increase Russia's opportunities to launch American satellites. In exchange, Moscow would have to clamp down hard on the sale of missile technology to Iran.
The new proposed policy toward China is solely about expanding commercial and scientific space cooperation, said the senior Government official, who would not be quoted by name. It contains "no consideration about helping China's military," he said. He strongly disputed a report by The Washington Times today that said the policy would permit China access to United States missile technology.
"The emphasis is on peaceful space cooperation," he said; for example, efforts to use satellites to study the climate, topography, agriculture and development of nations. "This is an area where we can engage in additional scientific cooperation with the Chinese in ways that are purely peaceful," he said.
He also said United States satellite manufacturers are pushing to open up China, exerting "a lot of pressure to find new opportunities for launch services," he said. "They are in favor of ways to take advantage of foreign launch services."
The interplay of politics, commerce and strategy between Washington and Beijing was underlined again today by the opening of a huge potential nuclear power market in China for American companies like General Electric.
In December the Clinton Administration certified to Congress that China is reining in its sales of technology that can be used in nuclear weaponry. Congress let that certification stand today. That means it is now legal for United States companies to sell nuclear reactors to China.
The market is potentially worth billions of dollars for the American nuclear power industry, which has not built a new plant in the United States since the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. Until today the United States was the only country in the world that imposed restrictions on peaceful nuclear cooperation with China.

HEADLINE: French Jobless Find the World Is Harsher

SERIES: HELP UNWANTED: First of two articles.

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 18

 BODY:
Like the more than three million other French workers who cannot find a job, Yves Hell is angry. He lost his job as a clerk in Marseilles in December, and now, at age 35, he has had to give up his small apartment there and move in with his retired parents.
What he is angry about is not so much the difficult job market or being let go as the unexpected inability of the vaunted French welfare system to provide him with a decent standard of living. 
 "You can't live as well on unemployment today as you could 10 years ago," he complained. When unemployed workers took to the streets in Marseilles this winter to demand a year-end $300 bonus payment to help them start the new year, he joined them.
Thousands of unemployed workers on welfare have marched on welfare offices around the country demanding large increases in benefits and making a few gains. Last month, the Government increased welfare payments, but protesters still want 10 times as much and plan to continue demonstrating into the spring.
The pattern of worker entitlement, protest and Government capitulation is deep-rooted here, and has swollen the French welfare state into one of the most comprehensive and costly in Europe. But now, with French unemployment running at more than 12 percent since 1996, with a mandate to cut spending for the introduction of Europe's common currency and with growing international business competition, this pattern is near the breaking point.
This year, the French economy is expected to post a healthy 3 percent gain -- its best growth in nine years -- but it will not produce many new jobs. The job shortage in the face of a gradual recovery is a problem bedeviling not just France but all of Western Europe, where entrenched expectations that the state will look out for its workers are colliding with the pitiless challenges of global competition.
As economic growth picks up, the unemployed French feel as though they are being left behind, and that is putting the country at the epicenter of a collision between Europe's new order and the old. For generations the French have generally assumed that their rich farmland and their proud industrial base would provide either the jobs or the "decent means of existence" promised in the preamble to the Constitution.
Financed by some of the world's highest tax rates, the growing welfare system flourished. It elevated 300 million people in Europe to some of the world's highest living standards, provided affordable medical care, public swimming pools and a superb educational system.
But much of that is financed by payroll taxes on employers that are among the steepest in the world. Now, many business leaders argue that the price of social protection is too high in a world of intense competitors from Asia to the United States. Taxes and benefits are the main reasons employers say they are not creating jobs in Europe and especially in France.
Lionel Jospin, the Socialist Prime Minister who was elected last June on promises to make jobs his first priority, recently found a little extra money for social measures thanks to higher-than-expected economic growth last year. He raised welfare payments 8 percent, instead of the 2 percent plan that had brought demonstrators to the streets. But he took pains to say, "I am for a society that works, not a society of assistance."
But where Britain's Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has proposed cutting business taxes and giving people on welfare tax incentives to look for jobs, Mr. Jospin is placing his hopes for job creation on continued economic growth and a much-debated plan to reduce the work week from 39 hours to 35 hours, without cutting pay.
 
Will It Be New Jobs Or Even More Layoffs?
Shorter weeks will create hundreds of thousands of jobs, he maintains. But employers say that without strong growth, the change could drive up costs and create even more layoffs.
In the United States, corporate America cut tens of thousands of jobs in the last decade or so, but unemployment eventualy declined to record lows thanks mostly to a surge in new jobs in services. But like France, the United States Government repeatedly had extended jobless benefits and created programs for the long-term unemployed during its period of transition until the American economy began creating hundreds of millions of new jobs -- a trend that is barely beginning now in France.
Many of the long-term unemployed feel "excluded," a word that in French means being outside normal society and carries the connotation of alienation and poverty.
Most had assumed that they lived in a society that would never leave them to fend for themselves. Believing that even France's labor unions do not represent their interests, many of the "excluded" have formed militant groups like the ones that led the sit-ins at welfare offices.
One example is A.C.! -- an organization formed in 1994 whose initials in French (pronounced ah-SAY) signify "Act Together Against Unemployment," and are pronounced like the French word assez, or enough. It grew out of the traditional union movement and was one of the instigators of the demonstrations this year to occupy welfare offices around the country.
Jacqueline Maman helped open a self-help storefront office for the unemployed in the 20th arrondissement of Paris, a working-class neighborhood heavily populated by North African immigrants.
Her National Movement of Temporary and Unemployed Workers, a group similar to A.C.!, concentrates on the problems of working women like herself, many of them single or divorced mothers with children.
She opened the office after finding, much to her astonishment, that the temporary jobs she was lucky enough to land occasionally required her to contribute part of her pay to unemployment insurance. But even with those contributions, she could not get benefits after her job ended.
"The unions and the employers administer the unemployment insurance and pension system, but people who are permanently out of work have no voice in how the money is spent," said Ms. Maman, a 49-year-old former secretary.
"The unemployed should sit on those boards," she said. "But the union leaders don't even want to know about the likes of us."
Jean-Jacques Leclerc, an 47-year-old single father in Marseilles who is unemployed, volunteered to help in the A.C.! campaign to occupy welfare offices in December.
"I felt I had to do something," he said. "I couldn't just stay at home doing nothing."
Mr. Leclerc, who uses a cane because of abuse he said he suffered as a child, said his last job, as an accountant, ended five years ago when his employer went bankrupt.
 
'Look at Fortunes On Stock Market'
He is still looking for work, he said, and lives on a disability pension of about $400 a month. He also gets a rent allowance that pays for the apartment in the center of the city for him and his three sons and family allowances that average about $150 a month for each of the boys.
"That money belongs to them, not me," Mr. Leclerc said. "The boys like to have home-cooked Sunday lunch at home just like any other French family, and I try to make them a good Provencal meal."
His family health insurance is free, as it is for people on welfare, and it would pay, Mr. Leclerc said, for psychiatric counseling for the boys to help them get through the problems they experienced after their mother abandoned the family four years ago, for reasons he said were not connected with his losing his job.
"Look at the fortunes being made on the stock market," he said. "I can't even afford a basketball for my oldest."
Mr. Hell, the 35-year-old clerical worker who moved into his parent's apartment in Marseilles, nodded in understanding. He is attending classes at the tuition-free St. Charles University in Bordeaux to get his French secondary-school diploma, the baccalaureat. "I want to show that it is possible to escape this unemployment trap," he said.
In an office above a garden center, Philippe Parrot, runs a state employment branch office in the western Paris suburb of Velizy. It is a cheerful place with big windows and bulletin boards bearing fresh printouts of job offerings from local companies, a large number of which are in the computer and information-processing business. There are also telephones for arranging job interviews. "As a rule, people have the best chance of finding a job in the first three months after registering with us," Mr. Parrot said.
"About 20 to 40 people a day come in here, sometimes as many as 800 before we close," he said. "Not all of them are young people, of course. Some have held jobs already for 10 or 15 years, and come in here for the first time in their lives after their company has closed or let them go, and look absolutely shellshocked," he said.
"Others have been through this before," he said. "They know that nowadays it's easier to find short-term contracts than it is to find permanent jobs."
Gerard Decout, a counselor who interviews applicants when they first come in, said: "A few years ago, not everyone was willing to accept a short-term contract. They preferred to wait for a permanent job to turn up."
"Now," he said, "temporary and part-time jobs are more numerous than they used to be."
 
Fears From Employers And Even Some Unions
Employers have been almost universally hostile to Mr. Jospin's plan to cut the work week, mostly because they fear that it will cost more. Even some union groups have been opposed.
"Reducing the work week is not a remedy for a period of crisis," said Nicole Notat, leader of a centrist union, the French Democratic Labor Confederation. Greater growth should give employers and unions leeway for finding more flexible ways of organizing work that, she said.
One company that has added workers and reorganized the work schedule is a subsidiary of the Galeries Lafayette department store. It is in the business of marketing and credit card services from a sparely decorated headquarters in the Paris banking district and a processing center near Bordeaux that employs 1,600 people.
Thierry Berge, the long-haired, bespectacled chief executive of the company, said it opted for a 35-hour week a year ago after the Government began subsidizing half the cost of new hires made necessary by a shorter week.
"Our customers wanted service at night and on Saturdays, and we couldn't provide that with all our employees working between 8 and 5 and only five days a week," Mr. Berge said.
"So we went to our unions and said, 'We'll give you shorter working hours for equal pay if you'll give us more flexible schedules.' "
At first, the unions were skeptical but gradually both sides agree that workers could control some scheduling, and the company could eliminate overtime payments by averaging hours worked over an entire year.
"With this system, we created 140 new jobs," Mr. Berge said, and a Government subsidy cut the cost of the new workers by half.
"But we never would have done this if the unions hadn't agreed to give us flexibility on scheduling, and we couldn't have hired extra workers if our business hadn't been growing by 15 percent a year," he said. "Not all companies are so lucky."
Indeed, as much as Mr. Jospin wants employers and workers to figure out how best to use a 35-hour law, there are obstacles.
For one thing, the measure, which is still being debated in Parliament, would reduce incentives established by the previous conservative Government that helped Mr. Berge's company go ahead. Mr. Jospin's Government does not believe in paying such subsidies to business.
 
Profit Margins Already Stretched Thin
There is the problem of growth. Jean-Yves Bloquert, the peppery head of the family-owned Kindy textile company in Moliens, a tiny, windswept farm village in northern France, said profit margins in his business were already stretched thin.
The town's single main street is lined with brick houses and barns, but it has become a parking lot for the factory workers who come from miles around to run machines that knit 55,000 brightly colored pairs of socks every day, Monday through Saturday nonstop.
Mr. Bloquert did not lay off a single worker when France cut the workweek from 40 hours to 39 in 1988, he said. But he already pays workers $16.45 an hour after adding $6.83 in 18 separate payroll taxes.
So a Government requirement to cut the work week to 35 hours without a pay cut means, he says, that every employee will now cost him even more.
During the cold war, he said, there were few ways to cut labor costs. But now in Eastern Europe, the going wage in the textile industry is only $2.21 an hour in the Czech Republic, $2.39 in Poland and $3.18 in Hungary, including payroll taxes. And all of those factories are just a day away by truck.
Would he adopt a 35-hour week? "It will depend on what exactly is in the law when it finally passes," Mr. Bloquert said. "But if the law doesn't give companies some flexibility in implementing it, we will have to consider moving about 25 percent of our production to Eastern Europe."
"It would break my heart to do it," he said, "but we owe it to our shareholders to keep increasing profits, and we'll have to do something."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Once Behind the Pack, Adidas Vies for the Lead

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany

 BODY:
When Robert Louis-Dreyfus was tapped five years ago to run Adidas A. G., he was taking over the weakest franchise in the global sporting goods league.
For years, Adidas was synonymous in many parts of the world with sneakers and athletic apparel. But as one more example of a family-run company that stumbled when the founding family died out, Adidas had been badly beaten by agile new competitors like Nike and Reebok. When Mr. Louis-Dreyfus took over in early 1993, the company had just reported an $82 million loss for 1992, after eking out an $8 million profit the year earlier. Business in the huge American market, where Adidas had established its three-striped brand as a trendy item a decade earlier, had all but dried up. 
 But that was before Mr. Louis-Dreyfus, a skilled turnaround artist, began his make-over. Now Adidas is sprinting back into contention even as Nike, the industry Goliath, is stumbling.
Adidas closed out 1997 with record net income of $255 million, 48 percent more than the year before, on revenues of $3.6 billion. In the process, it overtook Fila U.S.A. as the No. 3 athletic shoe supplier in the United States and has set its sights on passing Reebok for the No. 2 slot. Mr. Louis-Dreyfus even plunked down $1.4 billion last September to acquire Salomon S. A., the French sporting goods giant best known in the United States for Taylor Made golf clubs and Salomon skis. Adidas-Salomon, as the merged company is called, is the world's second-largest sporting goods group, behind only Nike itself, which has been struggling with bloated inventory and faltering demand not only in the United States but also in Asia.
"We're going in the right direction now," Mr. Louis-Dreyfus said in an interview here, not far from Adidas's headquarters in the German town of Herzogenaurach.
 The reversal of fortunes was evident this week. On Wednesday, Nike announced disappointing third-quarter earnings, though its stock rose $1.625, to $46.50, because the results were not as bad as had been forecast. Adidas stock closed at a record high on Tuesday of 319 marks, or about $175; it finished Wednesday at 310 marks.
Mr. Louis-Dreyfus has turned things around in several ways. He poured large sums into creating a cooler image for Adidas with young people tired of Nike's in-your-face style. To challenge Nike's design flamboyance, Adidas took a contrary stance with its "feet you wear" concept, maintaining that built-up sneakers can be unstable. And while holding on to its strength in soccer, Adidas gained ground in more popular sports in the United States by signing up big-name athletes like Kobe Bryant of basketball's Los Angeles Lakers and Keyshawn Johnson of football's New York Jets in sponsorship deals.
Nike, which is planning a counterattack on Adidas's home turf, says it is not too worried. Stefano Caroti, who took over last year as Nike's general manager for Central Europe, accuses Adidas of building its recent success by using Nike's winning formulas.
"They're copying us, from our ads to our products," he said. "You put a swoosh at the end of their commercials, they're ours."
True, the 51-year-old Mr. Louis-Dreyfus still has a long way to go just to catch Nike's shadow. Nike may have its problems, but it continues to control 47 percent of American sneaker sales, compared with 15 percent for Reebok and just 6 percent for Adidas.
Yet what Mr. Louis-Dreyfus has already accomplished has won him high marks on both sides of the Atlantic. "It is a great company, and Robert is a fabulous manager," said Faye Landes, senior footwear analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New York. (The securities firm has no connection with Salomon S. A.)
Investors clearly agree. After Mr. Louis-Dreyfus took Adidas public in 1996, selling 40 percent of its equity on the Frankfurt exchange, the initial price was 68 marks, a fraction of what it trades for now. Once he assimilates the Salomon purchase, Mr. Louis-Dreyfus plans to sell Adidas shares directly on Wall Street or as American depository shares, perhaps as early as next year.
Mr. Louis-Dreyfus is a total break in style as well as substance for Adidas. A Frenchman in a company with deep German roots, he lives in Switzerland and has assembled an international team to run Adidas, including Christian Tourres, a French executive often described as his alter ego, and an Australian banker, Dean Hawkins, whom he made chief financial officer. "Diversity brings creativity," he said.
Fast talking and cigar smoking, he is an avid skier and soccer fan who once personally bought a French team, Olympique Marseille, to keep it from falling into Nike's hands; at work, he eschews collars and ties for sweatshirts and jeans. A graduate of the Harvard Business School, he is equally comfortable in English and his native French.
In 1993, a group of French banks and insurance companies was saddled with Adidas, which the maverick French financier and politician, Bernard Tapie, had acquired in 1990. Although Adidas, whose founder, Adolf Dassler, is generally considered the father of athletic footwear, had been making athletic shoes as early as the 1920's, it was on the ropes. Mr. Dassler's son and heir, Horst, died in 1989 at 51, and the family had sold out to Mr. Tapie. Management was disoriented, and Nike and Reebok were parlaying a lethal combination of glitzy sneakers made cheaply in low-wage countries and promotions with American sports superstars into dominance of a market Adidas once ruled uncontested.
Enter Mr. Louis-Dreyfus.
In 1988, he had just finished turning around IMS International, a leading United States pharmaceutical market research company, when he sold it to Dun & Bradstreet for $1.7 billion and decided to retire.
Not a bad idea for the scion of one of France's wealthiest families, the owners of giant S. A. Louis-Dreyfus & Compagnie, the traders and real estate magnates. (The family is large and far-flung; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, best known as Elaine in the comedy series "Seinfeld," is a distant relation.) Yet there was a hitch. Mr. Louis-Dreyfus was only 42, and when he sought a skiing or golfing partner, no one was around. "The problem with retirement," he said, "is that your friends are working."
So when Charles and Maurice Saatchi asked him to help right their foundering British advertising agency, Mr. Louis-Dreyfus bit. After three years, in which he cut costs, dismissed staff and bolstered profit margins, he achieved his second major turnaround.
Now he is five years into his third effort, one that he almost did not get.
In 1992, the British sporting goods group Pentland agreed to buy Adidas from Mr. Tapie, then backed out after due diligence disclosed what it called "fundamental problems."
But French banks behind Mr. Tapie had already installed Gilberte Beaux, a retired French banker, to begin the job of cleaning up Adidas for the next owner. In the United States, she lured hot-shot young executives from Nike to revive sales; she increased the advertising budget and hired the young British agency, Leagas Delaney, to design an aggressive TV and print campaign.
Some experts say that Mr. Louis-Dreyfus really only carried out a turnaround set in motion by Mrs. Beaux. "A lot of people think that Louis-Dreyfus changed things overnight," said Eugenio Di Maria, editor of Sporting Goods Intelligence Europe, an industry newsletter that is published in Paris. "But it was more a question of timing -- he came at the right time, and helped influence some strategic decisions."
Still, he executed masterfully, and the results have been substantial.
When Mr. Louis-Dreyfus replaced Mrs. Beaux in 1993, he looked over Pentland's study of Adidas, then decided that two crucial problems were easily fixable: Adidas's ad budget should be inflated substantially, and an overreliance on independent distributors should end.
"They had been losing since Horst Dassler's death," he said in Munich. "And when you're on the losing side, it's difficult to get off."
In the United States, he went on the offensive. To get toeholds in baseball and football, he signed deals with the New York Yankees and the National Football League. He raised global advertising outlays to 13 percent of Adidas sales, compared with 6 percent when he took over. He says the figure will go even higher.
And he has played off Adidas's rich history. Adolf Dassler made the running shoes Jesse Owens wore at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. So at the 1996 Olympics, Adidas plastered Atlanta with its slogan, "We Knew Then; We Know Now . . .," recalling greats like Owens and Emil Zatopek, the Czech long-distance runner and four-time Olympic gold medal winner, who also ran in Adidas shoes.
Mr. Louis-Dreyfus says his top priority now is to accelerate growth in the United States by continuing to whittle away at the market shares of Reebok and Fila. His second goal, growing out of the first, is to integrate Salomon to give Adidas economies of scale and a leg up in such trendy sports as in-line skating and snowboarding.
"I have a belief," he said, "that while my generation was into team sports, our sons with their in-line skates and snowboards are going to be into individual sports."
Many analysts say the key question now is how Nike will react. Mr. Caroti, the Nike general manager for Central Europe, says Nike plans to take on Adidas in Germany with a combination of blanket promotions and high-profile sponsorships. To go after sports that Germans favor, Nike is sponsoring Borussia Dortmund, the German soccer team that was the 1997 Champion's Cup winner, and Michael Schumacher, the race car driver.
Now it's Adidas's turn to appear unruffled. Mr. Louis-Dreyfus notes proudly, for example, that he's no Phil Knight.
"He's the Disney of sports, into the marketing of sports at the entertainment end," he said dismissively of the Nike chairman. Despite its deal with Kobe Bryant, Adidas, he added, is less centralized than Nike and, with its strong focus on soccer, the world's No. 1 growth sport, less dependent on American superstars. "We try," he said, "to be more cosmopolitan."

Economy Remains Strong, Fed Says in 'Beige Book'
The economy in all regions of the United States remains strong, despite a decline in export sales to Asia -- yet inflation seems "eerily calm," the Federal Reserve said in its "beige book" survey of regional economic conditions.
"Industrial activity is on the rise in most parts of the country," it said, and demand for labor is strong. Retail sales are strong, the Fed added, but auto sales are down. Page D4. 

Stock Market Topples Records
All major stock market indexes reached new highs, with the Dow industrials climbing 25.41 points, to 8,775.40. But Treasury securities prices fell after the "beige book" report, with the yield on the 30-year bond rising to 5.90 percent from 5.89. D7.
 
Crude Oil Rebounds 8.6 Percent
Crude oil prices rebounded 8.6 percent with the market encouraged by news that there might soon be a special meeting of big oil-producing countries to discuss cutting output. Tuesday's late price of $13.21 had been the lowest in nine years, reflecting oversupply in the world market. D7.
 
Utility Raises Bid
Western Resources, a major Midwest utility, announced that it had raised its $32-a-share bid for Kansas City Power and Light. The rise to about $34.50 could end a long drama. D4.
 
Lockheed Scrambles to Save Deal
Lockheed Martin is scrambling to salvage its proposed acquisition of Northrop Grumman, but analysts said the chances the deal might collapse appeared to be growing. D2.
 
Ian Schrager Hotels to Expand
Ian Schrager, creator of the Royalton and Paramount hotels, formed a partnership with Northstar Capital and plans to expand. B8.
 
Union Pacific Safety at Issue
Union Pacific's plans to avoid accidents like those that killed 11 people last year are being hampered by resistance from the railroad's middle managers and field supervisors, union leaders contended at a Federal safety hearing. Executives of the giant line, while stressing a commitment to safety, agreed that their programs were far from complete. D4.
 
A Move to Goldman From Lazard
Kendrick R. Wilson, one of Wall Street's best-regarded investment bankers, will be leaving Lazard Freres & Company, which was plagued by management turmoil last year, to join the financial institutions group at Goldman, Sachs as a managing director. D8.
 
Joblessness Strains French System
Although the French economy is expected to grow a healthy 3 percent this year, unemployment continues to strain the country's vaunted welfare system. A1.
 
Japanese Household Savings Fall
Japan's average household savings fell 1.3 percent, to an average of $125,769 in 1997. The drop, the first in four years, signaled that the nation's slump had spread to one of the pillars of the economy. D5.
 
Optimistic Signs in Thailand
Investment has begun flowing into Thai companies for the first time since the financial system started to crumble eight months ago, raising hopes that foreign investors are starting to acquire assets made cheap by severe currency and market losses. D5.

India's New Government May Add Nuclear Weapons
India's new Hindu nationalist Government, led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, said that it would review the country's nuclear weapons policy and might "induct nuclear weapons" into its military arsenal. The declaration seemed likely to set off a new round of anxiety about an arms race between India and Pakistan. It also provided a striking counterpart to the main thrust of the national agenda put forth by Mr. Vajpayee. The agenda omitted virtually everything in the nationalists' program that had caused anxiety among India's Muslims and lower-caste Hindus suspicious of the upper-caste origins of Hindu nationalism.

Senate Debates NATO Treaty 
The Senate held a second day of debate on admitting Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to NATO, but only after chaotic scheduling short-circuited a debate on education. A1
 
Space Deal With China Weighed
The United States is considering allowing American satellite manufacturers to buy space-launching services from China, a senior Government official said.

Pushing for I.M.F. Funding
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin warned that American economic and security interests would suffer if Congress did not approve new financing for the I.M.F. and pay its back dues to the United Nations. They urged Congress to approve $18 billion for the I.M.F., nearly $1 billion in arrears to the United Nations and $2.5 billion to cover military costs in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf, and disaster relief. A10
 
Failings in the War on Drugs
A report by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said that planes, helicopters and ships sent to Mexico by the United States have largely been inoperable, inadequate or ineffective in the fight against drug trafficking. Government inspectors suggested that poor planning and coordination, particularly by the Pentagon, was the source of the problem. A14

HEADLINE: PRESIDENT DERIDES G.O.P. BUDGET PLAN AS ILL-CONCEIVED

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., March 18

 BODY:
President Clinton today firmly rejected the current Republican budget proposal, declaring that it "shortchanges our nation's future" by eliminating nearly all of his planned Federal programs for education, job training and child care.
Employing sharply partisan language and speaking to a cheering crowd of union members of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Mr. Clinton set out on a collision course with the Republican-controlled Congress over taxing and spending at a time when the nation will have its first projected surplus in 30 years. 
 "If the Republican budget says no to new teachers and smaller classes, no to modernizing our schools, no to investing in higher education for our children, the American people should say no to that budget," Mr. Clinton declared to whoops and cheers from a largely blue-collar audience here.
He added: "I need your help. This ought not to be a partisan political issue."
Hours later, the Senate Budget Committee approved the Republican tax and spending plan on a party-line 12-to-10 vote, after turning aside efforts by Democrats to restore Mr. Clinton's initiatives. If the Republican plan is approved on the Senate floor, it will serve as the blueprint for the bills authorizing spending programs and tax cuts.
With the entire House and a third of the Senate up for election this year, and Democrats harboring hopes of regaining control of the House, both parties appear eager to turn their tax and spending plans into campaign issues. Democrats believe their spending plans will be popular with middle-class families, while Republicans are happy to run as guardians of the nation's new-found fiscal health.
In attacking the Republicans' proposal one day after it was introduced in the Senate, the President moved quickly to exploit what White House advisers in Washington described as a political misstep by Republicans.
"If the Republicans want to have a fight about education, we stand ready to defend our schools, our parents and our children," said Rahm Emanuel, one of the senior advisers.
It was clear this evening that this was a welcome fight, with the White House searching for distractions from the independent counsel's investigation into Mr. Clinton's relationship with a White House intern. Mr. Emanuel suggested, with evident enthusiasm, that the budget dispute might well last the entire year.
The President's remarks came today in the course of a relatively quick trip out of Washington, to attend a meeting of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. executive council. He seemed buoyed by the tumultuous reception he received from the moment he walked into the Carpenters Joint Apprenticeship Training Center at the outskirts of this city.
"Every now and then, you just got to get out here in the country," Mr. Clinton said, his voice husky, draping a hand over the front of the Presidential lectern. "It helps a President to remember why he ran, what he's trying to do, and for whom he is really working."
But even outside Washington in friendly territory, there were reminders of the events back home. An effort by an audience member to signal support for Mr. Clinton turned confusing when the President apparently assumed he was being badgered about Monica S. Lewinsky, the White House intern at the center of the current investigation.
"To hell with Monica!" the supporter yelled from the back of the audience.
"Shut up!" someone else shouted, and the President grinned broadly.
"Couldn't have said it better myself," Mr. Clinton said to laughter. "You ought to run for office!"
An aide later said Mr. Clinton was apparently not wearing his hearing aid, and thus misheard the shout.
For most of his 28 minutes on stage, the President gave an enthusiastic accounting of the state of the nation, taking credit for improvements in employment, inflation, crime and the economy. He then noted that the central budget dispute is how to spend a surplus that is now being projected.
"You don't have to be a carpenter to know that you don't fix the roof when it's raining," he said. "You fix the roof when the sun is shining. The sun is shining on America."
"I'm telling you: we've got the money, it's time to invest in the future of our country," he said.
Mr. Clinton scored the Republicans for opposing his call to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce class size to 18 students for kindergarten through second grade. He restated his initiatives, largely rejected by Republicans, to spend money on rebuilding dilapidated school buildings, provide grants and low-interest loans for college, and to keep schools open so students have a place to stay until their parents finish work.
Gene Sperling, head of the President's National Economic Council, said Mr. Clinton was proposing $7.5 billion in child care spending over five years, $7.3 billion over five years to reduce class size and $5 billion for school construction.
The Senate Republican plan calls for a total of $1.73 trillion in Federal spending next year, an increase of 3.6 percent over this year. It allows room for $30 billion in tax cuts over five years, far less than many Republicans want.
House Republicans will take up their budget proposal next month, and are considering bigger tax cuts and deeper reductions in domestic spending than envisioned by the Senate plan.
Over Democratic opposition in Congress today, the Senate Budget Committee left in place the proposal by its chairman, Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, that any proceeds from legislation imposing a settlement on the tobacco industry over the health damage from smoking be earmarked solely to shore up Medicare, the health insurance system for the elderly. Both parties are working on legislation that could yield tens of billions of dollars in coming years through taxes or fees on sales of cigarettes, but there is no assurance a bill can be passed this year.
"The President is way premature in his comments," Mr. Domenici said. "We can't give the President $124 billion and not get a nickel for Medicare. We're not going to just bow to him."
Democrats had argued throughout the day that any money from the tobacco deal should go to anti-smoking programs, health insurance plans for children and Mr. Clinton's other spending initiatives. And they said that by apportioning any tobacco money exclusively to Medicare, the Republican plan would end any chance of assembling broad bipartisan support for a tobacco bill.
Republicans said that if Mr. Clinton was going to attack them over his domestic initiatives, they would strike back by suggesting that Democrats were not doing enough to address the problems Medicare would encounter as the population ages. For years, Democrats used much the same strategy with great success against Republicans, accusing them of supporting cuts in one of the nation's most popular entitlement programs.
Mr. Domenici said the White House was "turning its back on Medicare and reneging on its commitment to America's seniors."
He said that without relying on any tobacco money his plan included an expansion of anti-smoking programs, increased funding for child care and a sharp rise in spending for the National Institutes of Health. And he said a tobacco deal should not become a new pool of money for Democrats to use to increase the size of the Federal Government.
"We shouldn't be running around trying to invent things to spend money on from this giant piggy bank," Mr. Domenici said.

HEADLINE: Slain Shop Owner's Generosity Is Remembered

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

 BODY:
During James Lee's eight years as the owner of a gift shop on St. Marks Place, his tireless work habits and outgoing demeanor made him a popular fixture in the East Village trinket market.
While running a business that catered largely to tourists, Mr. Lee went out of his way to help the neighborhood's less fortunate residents, frequently buying coffee and lunch for the homeless and giving his old clothing to the needy. 
 But Mr. Lee, 61, had little tolerance for shoplifters, his employees said, and on Monday when he tried to stop two teen-agers he apparently thought were stealing a wool baseball cap, he was felled by a punch from one of them and suffered fatal head injuries when he collapsed on the sidewalk.
"I heard the sound of the punch, a loud punch," said Salahuddin Ahammed, 37, who has worked at the shop for four years. "Right away he can't talk. I held his head. I tried to hold his head together. There was lots of blood."
Mr. Lee was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where he later died of head injuries, said Detective Robert Samuel, a police spokesman.
A police officer from the Ninth Precinct captured two suspects a block away.
One, Sean Lynch, 17, of the Bronx, was charged with murder and robbery. The second suspect was detained, then released for lack of evidence, Detective Samuel said.
A police investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Mr. Lynch had prior arrests on charges of defacing property with graffiti and possessing stolen property.
Mr. Lynch was dumbfounded to learn that Mr. Lee had died, the investigator said. "He thought we were kidding," the investigator said.
Police officials declined to discuss the contents of Mr. Lynch's videotaped statement.
The hat had the insignia of the Grays, a baseball team in the now-defunct Negro leagues of the 1940's, said Richard Torres, 34, who has worked at the store since 1992.
"It's very hot these days," Mr. Torres said. "Very popular."
Employees described Mr. Lee as the kind of boss who always asked how their wives and children were doing, and even occasionally lent money to workers in a financial crunch. Mr. Lee, a native of Korea who moved to New York more than 20 years ago, lived on 34th Street with his wife. He had four children, Mr. Torres said, including a son in dental school.
His employees said he was trying to earn enough money to pay for his children's education, and hoped to retire in five years.
So he spent most of his waking hours hawking hats, T-shirts, bags, jewelry and sunglasses at the First Rich Gift Shop on St. Marks near Third Avenue.
"If they had eight days in a week, he'd work eight days," Mr. Torres said.
"He kept it open every day, even on Christmas, to make money to take care of his family. A hard-working man, never took a day off."

Our Celebrity President

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Do President Clinton's high approval ratings primarily reflect American economic satisfaction, policy savvy or emotional maturity? Perhaps none of the above.
As Richard Norton Smith (Op-Ed, March 12) suggests, there is a less flattering reason.
Until they tire of a celebrity's act, Americans hold him to extremely low moral standards. So far, Mr. Clinton has traded successfully on his celebrity status. 
Respect for the office of the Presidency has eroded even as celebrity Presidents have become more adept at weathering scandals. Whether this lost authority can be recaptured in a true national crisis is a question no one should be too eager to test.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Sue Halpern's fantasy about sending her daughter to a "well-financed, energetic, successful local public school" like those in Scarsdale (Op-Ed, March 13) got me thinking.
As a teacher in the Bronx public schools for 19 years, I have seen many attempts to democratize education, including the current notion that equal opportunity for students can be gained by raising the standards in our public schools. It seems to me that if Ms. Halpern is correct about the superlative education offered by the Scarsdale schools, then nothing short of having the state finance educational settings across the state equal to those of Scarsdale will do. 
 To accept the differences in schooling as the inevitable consequence of economic inequality would be giving up on the promise of equal opportunity.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW;
Capturing the City At a Vanishing Point

BYLINE: By VICKI GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
It is the nature of cities to change and the nature of city dwellers to regret the sacrifices made along the way, even in the name of progress. Our cities are extensions of ourselves, and their streets open up to memory like family albums of all the lives lived in them. The past of city and self tends to seem ever more important and precious as time and memory threaten to bury it.
In the 19th century, as cities swelled and were reconfigured, photography was called on to record the present before it became the past, and then to point out where things were going so the future would be able to contemplate its past as well. When Baron Haussmann rebuilt Paris in the 1850's and 1860's, he hired Charles Marville to document what was being destroyed as well as what was being built so that both the city's history and his own achievement would be clear. 
 Late in the century, the Society for Photographing Relics of Old London commissioned several photographers to depict buildings that expansion would soon overrun. At the beginning of this century, Eugene Atget, making documents for artists, photographed a Paris he thought would disappear under the impact of modern life. In the 1930's, Berenice Abbott, who had saved Atget's archive after his death in 1927, photographed old New York, which she suspected was very fragile, as well as the strong new city. Her book "Changing New York," published in 1939, almost instantly became a famous document.
The Museum of the City of New York, which helped sponsor Abbott's project and owns a set of her exhibition prints, her negatives and her research files, currently has on view 126 vintage photographs, plus reproductions of some variants and a few of her discards, in a show called "Berenice Abbott's Changing New York, 1935-1939."
Some of these photographs are little known; the 1939 book had fewer images. A book by the show's curator, Bonnie Yochelson, "Berenice Abbott: Changing New York, the Complete W.P.A. Project" (The New Press/Museum of the City of New York), reproduces all 305 images from Abbott's original undertaking.
New York transforms itself too fast for people to keep their bearings or hold on to their history in it -- I once told a child to meet me at a restaurant and temporarily lost him because he had left when all he found there was an excavation. Abbott did a real service by catching the place in transition.
A strong photographer, she was especially adept in the narrow confines of Wall Street and among the ethnic stores and antique details of Greenwich Village, where she lived. Her images will fascinate anyone who remembers the El, or knew some avenue before it became a thoroughfare, or could not imagine horse-drawn milk trucks on these streets. One of the show's real virtues is that the labels note what has become of this building and that one. Also on view is a charming nine-minute video by Douglas Levere of Abbott's images and Levere's contemporary rephotographs of the exact same scenes from the exact same positions she once stood in.
Abbott's photographs add up to a cool record of a hot city. She is measured, dispassionate, "objective." She avoids the Depression and its effects. The dynamic of her city lies not in human relations to one another or to the surroundings but in the architecture and in occasional contrasts between tenements and commercial giants, quirky old buildings and muscular new ones, ethnic neighborhoods and imperial realms of business. She often looked at the city from a distance above it, though not at too steep an angle, as she was afraid of heights. What with New York's ambitious skyline, some worm's-eye, bird's-eye and tilted-building views, and the naked evidence of engineering, the city's energy and jazz come through almost despite her deliberate pace and attraction to emptiness.
I rather miss a sense of electricity at street level. There are few reminders that people live, work and hurry in and between the stone behemoths that jostle the sky. Abbott worked with a large, heavy 8 by 10 camera and a large, heavy tripod, which she sometimes had to set up in the middle of the street. The equipment was too slow to catch movement readily. She wanted a fast, hand-held camera but received one only in 1938, shortly before the money for her project ran out.
She had gone to Paris as a sculptor in 1921, worked as Man Ray's darkroom assistant when he wanted someone who knew nothing about photography, and become a superb portrait photographer on her own. She met Atget and after his death arranged for the publication of a book of his work and reprinted some of his negatives. (Ultimately she sold her Atget Collection to the Museum of Modern Art in New York.) When she returned to New York in 1929 and was seized with a passion to photograph the city, Atget was clearly in her eye and mind. His Paris was entering one modern world and her New York another, but their different personalities and goals were as crucial to their styles as the times they lived in.
Atget had even fewer people in his pictures (except for the peddlers he had pose for him), having accosted Paris at dawn before it moved too fast for his poky camera. Yet the poetic melancholy of his scenes implies an absence, implies that someone has just left or may soon appear. Abbott's city is largely self-sufficient, a great machine that runs on commercial energy and nourishes itself on the more old-fashioned, invisible mechanics of its neighborhoods. Atget wrote poetry in his images; Abbott wrote impersonal, reportorial prose, sometimes vigorously, sometimes not. Her photographs do not imply so much as declare.
She borrowed from Atget an occasional lone, lorn figure or two posing in a doorway, looking out a window at the photographer, tiredly buying a movie ticket. They tend to be as unsettled as the times, like the barber and his assistant waiting for customers outside his shop. Now and then, mostly when she got the small camera, she took the pulse of the city via the movement of pedestrians, and would have taken more had she had the camera sooner.
Interested as she was in shops -- food shops, cheese stores, bakeries, hardware stores, pawn shops, antiques shops -- she took not one picture of a clothing store, not even a surrogate human being like the mannequins Atget portrayed so tellingly and often. She photographed shop fronts as often as Atget did but never with his interest in complex reflections, though the reflections in glass windows play an enormous role in the shifting nature of modern city experience.
A document at the level of Abbott's work seeks a precarious balance of art and information. She knew a great deal about contemporary art and liked a long lens that flattened the field and compressed distances or a wide angle lens that distorted perspective. But she did not aim for the stark Cubism and Expressionist versions of Mondrian that gripped the urban art photographers of the time. Mostly she kept her modernism in check, seeking clarity above all. In fact, she was singularly self-effacing, never insisting on a distinctive signature style.
These photographs might never have existed if Abbott's work had not been financed through a Government agency. Sponsored by the museum, she was employed by the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, a relatively small organization that helped unemployed artists during the Depression and attempted to prove that art could benefit the community. Conservatives, fearful or contemptuous of left-wing artists, shrilly criticized the Federal Art Project; by 1939, a hostile Congress had gutted the agency, and Abbott was laid off. (The organization was disbanded in 1943.) Cities change, but certain political issues outlast brick and stone.
"Berenice Abbott's Changing New York, 1935-1939" is at the Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103d Street, through June 21. It will travel to the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington.

G.M. Speeds Up Car Development

BYLINE: By NOELLE KNOX 

 BODY:
IN a feat of competitive catch-up, the General Motors Corporation says it has cut the the time it takes to design and build new cars and trucks by six months. Further, it promises another six-month improvement by the end of this year, matching its domestic competitors.
G.M. executives have confirmed that the company moved a new vehicle concept from the design studio to the factory floor in just 30 months, beating its previous record of 36 months. And G.M. says it will soon match its smaller American rivals, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, with a 24-month development cycle.
 
 Every auto company is trying to speed up the development process to respond faster to changes in consumer tastes and demand. For G.M., which has long been the laggard in product development, as well as the most inefficient auto producer, the quicker cycle demonstrates that the company's global restructuring and investments in new technology are starting to pay off. The company would not disclose the development times for any specific vehicles.
"We are not stopping at 24 months," said William G. Poulos, a director of G.M.'s vehicle development process center in Detroit. "We will continue to look for ways to take time out" of product development.
The first G.M. cars built for the United States market on the 30-month cycle will be introduced next year, Mr. Poulos said. Although he would not identify the models, the company is expected to bring out in late 1999 an all-new Pontiac Bonneville and Buick LeSabre, as well as a new Chevrolet Impala (which replaces the Lumina) and Monte Carlo, according to J. D. Power & Associates, an automotive consulting firm.
While G.M. is making progress, the company remains far behind Japanese competitors. The Toyota Motor Corporation, for example, designed and started building the new Lexus RX 300 sport utility vehicle, which went on sale two weeks ago, in just 18 months. And Toyota's chairman has set a new-product goal of just 14 months.
Some analysts are also skeptical that G.M. can deliver on its promises.
"It doesn't matter if your product cycle is that fast, if you can't make a decision about what to build," said Michael L. Schmall, managing director of Planning Edge, a consulting firm in Troy, Mich. "They are just so late to the market. The company keeps telling us how wonderful everything is, and their market share keeps going down."
 Nearly everyone in the industry agrees that faster development times provide a critical advantage. The speedup is good news for consumers, who won't have to wait the traditional four or five years for a new car or truck design. For the companies, the results are mixed. Shaving time off the development cycle saves money, but big profits from a hot-selling model can soon be siphoned away by a quick competitor that rushes out a similar product. As a result, auto makers are trying harder to shield future products from rivals' spying eyes.
The chairman of G.M., John F. Smith Jr., told Wall Street analysts this month that the company may have blundered by showing a prototype of a European-market mini-van, the Opel Zefira, at the Frankfurt Auto Show in September, a year before the van was to go into production.
In a recent meeting with Wall Street analysts, Mr. Smith said his "concern was that they've given the competition, including Ford and others, a lot of lead time," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto stock analyst for Lehman Brothers. Mr. Smith conceded that if G.M.'s competitors scrambled, "We will only have six to nine months on the market before they answer our product."
For G.M. and most other auto makers, the key to saving time has been a switch to computer-aided design and holographic models from paper-and-ink drawings and clay models. Now, companies can make more design changes, and they can make them faster. Computer designs are also more precise than hand-crafted models. A more accurate and complete design means fewer costly, last-minute changes to equipment in production plants.
"You can actually deliver a higher-quality, lower-cost product with a more effective development process," Mr. Poulos said. He estimated that reducing the cycle to 30 months shaved about 12 percent off the cost of developing a new vehicle, which translates into tens of millions of dollars.
G.M. has also tried to speed the process by harmonizing designs among subsidiaries in different countries. For example, it plans to introduce small cars based on a single platform around the world starting in 2000, analysts say.
"Shortening the development cycle is important because there is a lot more input from other organizations in other regions," said Michael Robinet, managing director of CSM Forecasting, an auto-industry consulting firm in Southfield, Mich.
G.M. has also eliminated layers of management that delay decisions by consolidating divisions and putting one person, known as a vehicle line executive, in charge of taking a new design to the factory floor. "It's getting better," said Mr. Phillippi of Lehman Brothers. But there is "still too much of a bureaucratic labyrinth products have to wind their way through."

Hungarian Fingerprints All Over the 20th Century

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
He was a man of brilliant and diverse intellectual energy who discovered the nuclear chain reaction, went on to help develop the atom bomb and then tirelessly campaigned against it.
He soaked in the bath three hours a day, thinking up incredible inventions, needled his scientific colleagues with puckish humor and refused to flush the toilet in his room at the University of Chicago in the 1940's, insisting that it was "maid's work." 
 So it was with ambivalent pride and a sense of lost glory that Hungary celebrated the centenary of Leo Szilard, who died in 1964. Szilard (pronounced SIH-lahrd) was perhaps the most quixotic of the renowned physicists and mathematicians who were born and educated here but who fled, often, like Szilard, under the shadow of anti-Semitism, to the United States.
Hungarian scientists have had a deep impact on the 20th century. John von Neumann made fundamental contributions to quantum theory as well as the development of the atomic bomb and the high-speed electronic computer. Albert von Szent-Gyorgyi was credited with first isolating vitamin C. For a country of its population (10 million), Hungary has produced an immoderate number of Nobel Prize winners. Hungarians who became American citizens, including Szilard, Eugene Wigner and Edward Teller, played a major part in the Manhattan Project in World War II.
But few in this pantheon of Martians -- a nickname spun from the scientists' superhuman intelligence and their unearthly Hungarian language -- so keenly felt that the pursuit of science also carried political and personal responsibilities.
"The Hungarians have plenty of first-rate scientists and Nobel Laureates to celebrate," said Szilard's American biographer, William Lanouette, who was among those at the ceremonies in February. "Yet Szilard alone personifies the moral and ethical responsibilities of science. He had the drive to foresee the social and political consequences of discovery."
Mr. Lanouette records in his book "Genius in the Shadows" how Szilard, at the start of the war, drafted the letter signed by Albert Einstein that urged President Roosevelt to speed up work on the nuclear bomb before the Germans developed it; after the war he spent much of his time trying to ease the arms race that he helped create.
With a combination of banter and logic, Szilard persuaded Nikita S. Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, that a hot line between the Kremlin and the White House was a good idea. During the Eisenhower and Kennedy years, he flooded the State Department with nuclear disarmament programs that were mostly rebuffed.
A tubby figure who loved to eat fatty Hungarian delicacies, Szilard was often thought of as maddeningly eccentric. Sometimes this eccentricity produced breathtaking flights of fancy: He came up with the idea of electrifying barbers' chairs so that a man's hair would stand on end, allowing the barber to do a fast mowing job.
For Hungarian intellectuals who remained in Hungary, Szilard and his emigre colleagues represent a bittersweet phenomenon. On the one hand, there is pride that Hungary has produced so many important minds. Yet there is also sadness that so many fled -- and that the new generation of best brains continues to leave.
Now, instead of being enticed by the ferment in German and American universities as their elders were between the two world wars, young Hungarian scientists are wooed abroad by Western companies.
"Today the most gifted Hungarians leave the country while they are graduate students," said Gabor Pallo, the deputy director of the philosophy institute at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
After more than 40 years of Communism and a rough transition to a market economy, Hungary lacked the financial resources to keep them.
In the popular mythology, this crew of geniuses are shadowy figures in Hungary. For most of the cold war, they were considered soldiers in the enemy camp and banned in the media and school texts. Then in the early 1980's, when the Hungarian leader Janos Kadar was eager to improve his nation's profile in the West and wanted to pump up sagging intellectual morale at home, the emigre scientists were dusted off.
Mr. Pallo said that by 1983, he was allowed to publish some of his research on the scientists and in 1985 he was asked to give a lecture at the prestigious Academy of Sciences on Hungarian-born Nobel Prize winners. Some of the scientists came back in their old age for short visits before the collapse of Communism; the fiercely anti-Communist Mr. Teller waited until after 1989.
But like Andrew Grove, who as a young science student fled Hungary after the failed 1956 uprising and is now chairman and chief executive of the computer giant Intel, Szilard showed little interest in Hungary, Mr. Pallo said.
Even so, Szilard is now buried here. At least, part of him.
Szilard's ashes, kept in a California crematory after his death, were reburied in a cemetery during the centenary ceremonies. According to his family's wishes, half of his ashes were sent to Budapest. The other half were dispatched to upstate New York, where his wife is buried.
This is not quite what Szilard had in mind. Before he died in La Jolla, Calif., he said he wanted his ashes tied to a helium balloon and sent into the sky. People, he said, should look up rather than down.

HEADLINE: Indonesia-I.M.F. Talks Show Flexibility on Ending Impasse

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, March 19

 BODY:
Indonesian officials began meetings today with officials of the International Monetary Fund, with both sides offering signals of flexibility on the deadlock that has caused a halt in disbursements of international aid.
The officials sat down in five working groups to tackle separate aspects of the economic crisis, including Indonesia's huge burden of corporate debt, a problem the I.M.F. had not previously addressed. 
 "We talked about the debt, but we have no concrete proposals yet," Hubert Neiss, the chief I.M.F. delegate, said today.
Indonesia is seeking an easing of requirements that it remove subsidies for fuel and basic food items, and I.M.F. officials have said they might agree to this, given the hardship and social unrest that could result from further price increases.
The increases have spurred a series of anti-Government protests on university campuses in recent weeks. Today the police used tear gas, clubs and high-pressure water hoses to subdue thousands of stone-throwing student protesters at Lampung University in Bandarlampung on Sumatra. At least 60 people were detained.
Students also confronted the police at Airlangga University in Surabaya, 370 miles east of Jakarta. And several thousand students staged peaceful anti-Government rallies today on at least three campuses in Jakarta and at a university in the city of Bandung, 75 miles east of the capital.
In addition to their opposition over the removal of subsidies, Indonesian officials have also complained about requirements that they disband cartels and monopolies, an issue on which the fund has voiced less flexibility.
For its part, Indonesia is seeking a quick way to strengthen the value of its currency, the rupiah. It is so weak now that corporations are unable to pay off more than $65 billion in foreign debt, in effect stalling the economy.
Mr. Neiss, who is the Asia-Pacific director of the I.M.F., indicated that a decision might not come before mid-April on whether the fund would release a second $3 billion disbursement from its $40 billion economic assistance package.
That disbursement was withheld last week because Indonesia has been slow to carry out economic reforms and also because its leadership was preoccupied with the re-election of President Suharto a week ago.
Mr. Suharto, 76, announced a new Cabinet on Saturday, and officials of the I.M.F. began arriving immediately for talks, along with envoys from the United States, Germany and Japan.
On his arrival Wednesday, Mr. Neiss said the fund's executive board in Washington would discuss the pending disbursement two weeks after he had completed his visit here. He said he would stay in Indonesia "as long as necessary" to reach an agreement.
Indonesian officials repeated their commitment to the reforms agreed to by Mr. Suharto in January, although outside analysts say they have yet to demonstrate that commitment in action.
The officials also repeated the priority they set on strengthening the value of the rupiah, but in recent days they have avoided mention of the creation of a currency board, which the I.M.F. strongly opposes.
"We are in the process of formulating a policy which will stabilize the rupiah exchange rate," said Fuad Bawazier, the new Finance Minister. "We cannot wait until the price of basic commodities rises again." He spoke after a meeting Wednesday with David Lipton, an official of the Treasury Department who is the latest in a series of American envoys to visit Jakarta.
Indonesian officials said today's working group discussed various possible measures to strengthen the rupiah or at a minimum to subsidize a stronger exchange rate for the import of medicine and staple foods.
On a visit to Tokyo today, Vice President B. J. Habibie was quoted as saying that Indonesia hoped to put into effect all 50 points of the January agreement but that the greatest difficulty would be in removing the price supports that subsidize basic commodities.
The first two working groups that began meeting today will focus on monetary policy and banking reform, Mr. Neiss said. The third will analyze the state budget and seek to find ways to pay for continued price supports. Fourth, he said, is the sensitive issue of structural reforms. The fifth group will seek to find ways to deal with Indonesia's private debt burden.

HEADLINE: A Wildcatter On the Tame Side;
Replacing Roughnecks With Computers

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
Designed for the world's hungriest, damn-the-expense devourers of data, the Auspex NS7000 computer server, costing more than $1 million, can store the equivalent of a million 400-page novels for instant access. The first one in this area went to NASA in 1995 for guiding space shuttles into the heavens. The next year, another was installed, at the Zilkha Energy Company, for exploring under the Gulf of Mexico, miles into the earth's crust.
For Zilkha, such bets have paid off, proving that technology is taking the wildness out of wildcatting. Its success in finding oil and natural gas on the gulf's already intensively drilled continental shelf was certified beyond a doubt in January. Zilkha, just 12 years old, was sold to Sonat Energy for $1 billion. 
 Not bad for a company with just 65 employees, most of them on a single floor of a downtown building here. The casual, college-dorm camaraderie, the open setting with no private offices and the huge monitors on most desks are more typical of a software start-up. Geologists, concentrating so intently that they seem about to step inside those monitors, talk of entering the zone.
It's a petroleum company, all right, but without roughnecks, rigs or corporate bureaucrats. It is, in other words, a virtual energy company.
Zilkha Energy's virtual invisibility suited the family that ran it. The company has never issued a press release, and its owners, father and son, have said nothing about it publicly until now. "People didn't know how real we were," Michael Zilkha, the son, said in an interview.
He persuaded his father, Selim, to let the company make a flickering appearance in cyberspace by starting one of the industry's first Web sites. But nowhere at that site are the owners' names mentioned.
For the Zilkhas, the company's triumph is proof of the returns possible from bringing a new approach to what seems like a mature business. Buying huge volumes of digitized data covering most of the gulf's shelf, they hired the best geologists they could find and gave them the latest computerized tools for turning all that data into drilling strikes.
While many competitors, large and small, have taken similar steps, Zilkha's success stands out in speed and scale. "It's dawning on people that the high value added is information technology, to locate hydrocarbons 10,000 feet below the surface of the earth," said Bill White, a former Deputy Secretary of Energy. Because Zilkha recognized this, he said, "They're making more money than anyone else in the business."
Drilling success rates are stable or rising even as companies explore in places they would not have risked a few years ago. They are finding new oil and gas reservoirs in areas they thought were uneconomical or tapped out, like the North Sea, East Texas and the Gulf of Mexico.
This technological progress has created a new balance of economic power. After years of decline, oil production by non-OPEC nations began rising in 1995. Instead of cringing at OPEC threats, the rest of the world can now impose its own embargo, on Iraqi oil. Oil prices, even before adjusting for inflation, have fallen to the lowest levels in almost a decade, while natural gas prices have been stronger.
To others in the industry, the Zilkhas' success is all the more surprising because they are outsiders, Iraqis whose fortune has its origins in banking, retailing and even rock music. Khedoury Zilkha, Selim's father, opened a one-room bank in Baghdad in 1899, in the days when reaching Istanbul to do business first required a monthlong caravan to Aleppo, Syria.
In 1927, a month after Selim was born, the Zilkhas, with the business expanding, went first to Lebanon, then Egypt, then, in 1941, to New York.
"Baghdad Banker Reaches Wall Street," read the headline in The New York Times on April 17, 1955. To manage his operations, Khedoury Zilkha, by then known as the Rothschild of the Middle East, deployed his four sons around the world, with Selim drawing Paris, then London.
After his father died in 1956, Selim decided banking was not for him. He founded the Mothercare retailing chain, offering everything for mother and child. Catching on to the value of technology, he bought an I.B.M. 440 mainframe to manage his inventory.
In 1983, after selling that chain, he paid $28 million for 44 percent of a company called Towner Petroleum.
"What attracted me was, I was very ignorant," Selim Zilkha said. At age 70, he can afford to joke about himself, with an accent and a measured delivery that suggest his urbane origins. "I didn't know what a depleting asset was, for one thing," he said. "Because I've been in retailing, and in retailing you don't have a depleting asset. You have a good store, and if you do your job right it becomes a more valuable store."
In 1984, after the company had taken a detour into bankruptcy, Selim Zilkha paid $11 million more to own it all.
He renamed the company and turned it from an investor to an explorer and producer in its own right, hiring executives who, given the collapse of oil prices, were often readily available. He sent in Michael, now 43, first as a trainee, eventually as second-in-command. Selim Zilkha owned 62 percent of the company, his son the rest.
Michael, with his father's slight build and heavy, eloquent eyebrows, bobs his head with such animation as he talks that he seems about to get up and dance. Raised in London, he took his Oxford degree to the American rock business.
His ZE Records and its zesty roster of bands like Kid Creole and the Coconuts caught the industry's attention. Thomas D. Mottola, president of Sony Music Entertainment, calls him "a talented visionary," adding, "It comes as no surprise to me that he's been a success in other fields."
But Michael Zilkha did not see the record business as a lifetime occupation. "I didn't want to be twice as old as my groups," he said.
In the energy business, the Zilkhas' challenge was finding a niche, even as that business was heading into a depression. The opportunities they discovered began just an hour's drive south of Houston, in the Gulf of Mexico -- by then known as the Dead Sea. Major oil companies concentrated on drilling in foreign countries, with a few exploring the deep water of the gulf. They had all but abandoned a continental shelf extending an average of about 150 miles from shore.
Federal leases and geological data had become exceptionally cheap. By the early 1990's, said John B. Holmes Jr., an Exxon veteran hired as Zilkha's president, "The economics for exploration were the best I had seen in my career."
Zilkha concentrated on buying up enough 3-D seismic data to cover almost the entire shelf, from the barrier islands of South Texas past Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama to the Florida panhandle. To generate the data, ships bounce sound signals off underground formations. Computers translate the responses.
Other companies first decided roughly where to drill, then bought patches of data for pinpointing. Zilkha offered companies that collect the data a deal: sell us your every bit, byte and number, but at wholesale. Zilkha could then scan for the best prospects, and either gain leases on the cheap or strike exploration agreements with other leaseholders.
The result, from 1992 through September of last year, was a 66 percent success rate on 79 wells, more than double the industry's average. Through the end of 1996, production grew at a 68 percent annual rate.
It remained a risky business, however. Zilkha's drilling program had a 90 percent success rate in the first nine months of 1996, but only 50 percent in the corresponding period last year. But it's a strong enough record overall for Selim Zilkha to boast of making a venture that often seems as unpredictable as movie making into something far more stable. "We developed a factory for generating prospects," he said.
In recent years, as others caught on to the gulf's potential, Zilkha has stayed ahead with technology investments that reached $5 million last year, or about $75,000 per employee -- plus more than $35 million for data. Upgrading its Auspex server and adding a second unit, Zilkha can now store nearly three times as much data as two years ago.
When new seismic results become available, usually to several buyers at once, Zilkha can often analyze them quickly enough to capture the choicest opportunities. And while petroleum companies tend to seek partners to share exploration risks, Selim Zilkha, confident in his company's prowess, never tires of saying, "If it's worth drilling, drill it all."
The financial rewards, besides the billion-dollar sale price, have been more typical of technology ventures, too. With pay tied to performance, even for receptionists, about 10 of the 65 employees each made more than $500,000 last year. In the merger, a long-term executive compensation plan rewarded the top four officers with a total of $73.7 million.
Among them was Joseph J. Romano, the chief financial officer. Whenever anyone asked how to pay the huge technology and exploration expenses, Selim Zilkha's stock answer was, "That's Joe's problem." One solution was a pioneering agreement with Enron to sell natural gas still in the ground at fixed prices.
What about going public? Not a chance. "I didn't want pimply-faced analysts to come and tell me what to do," Selim Zilkha said.
But beginning last July the Zilkhas had investment bankers shop their company around. Selim Zilkha's explanation for selling Mothercare -- "I love the journey; I don't like the arrival" -- apparently went for his energy company as well. Ronald L. Kuehn Jr., Sonat's chief executive, adds that developing Zilkha's prospects was taking more capital than Zilkha by itself could command.
Though the Zilkhas wanted cash, Mr. Kuehn flew from his Birmingham, Ala., headquarters to argue that they were better off with his stock. He cited Sonat's plans to rise from ninth to third among the nation's independent petroleum companies, and its willingness to retain or promote Zilkha Energy's managers. "They liked the story," Mr. Kuehn said later. "They liked the price, too."
Judging only by Zilkha's petroleum reserves, Mr. Kuehn says, his $1 billion expense, not counting the assumption of $280 million in debt, was more than double the fair price. But those reserves are only a third of the value, he said recently at what is now the Sonat GOM (for Gulf of Mexico) office. The vast, though unproven, prospects on Zilkha's leases are worth another third, he says, with Zilkha's management and technical abilities making up the rest.
In practice, it's not so clear who's taking over whom. Brad Juneau, Zilkha's exploration chief, is taking command of Sonat's exploration. The Zilkhas, Sonat's largest shareholders at 21 percent, each have a seat on the board.
How to finance Sonat GOM's further ambitions? "That's Ron's problem," they said in laughing unison.

Zilkha Energy, by using powerful computers to analyze seismic readings from the ground under the Gulf of Mexico, has improved the success rate of new oil and gas wells. It, along with others, has helped revive exploration in areas of the gulf that major energy companies had largely abandoned. That success attracted the attention of another energy company, Sonat, which bought Zilkha for $1 billion in January.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Mixed as Economic Signals Remain Unclear

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, after several economic reports provided no clear signals for investors.
The price of the 30-year bond was up 6/32, to 103 9/32. And the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.89 percent, from 5.90 percent the previous day. 
 Among the economic reports yesterday, the Government said that the United States trade deficit in January rose more than expected, amid hints that the difficulties in Asia are beginning to play a role in widening the United States trade imbalance.
But Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said seasonal adjustment problems also seemed to contribute to the increase, and he said it was still not possible to definitively separate out the Asian impact from other forces.
Also yesterday, the Government said that the Consumer Price Index rose by one-tenth of 1 percent in February, in line with expectations. The year-over-year increase was only 1.4 percent, the lowest level in more than a decade. That might have been expected to encourage bond investors, but some were apparently alarmed by a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent in the so-called core index, which eliminates the volatile food and energy prices.
In another report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its regional business survey showed that the demand for manufactured goods remained strong in the mid-Atlantic region while inflation had not accelerated. The index rose to 16.1 points in March from a 12.8 reading in February.
Mr. Fine said yesterday's reports suggested that interest rates would remain steady for some time. "Taken as a whole, there is nothing in today's data, or for that matter the entire recent gamut of economic statistics, that would suggest any change in Fed policy anytime soon," he said.
"Indeed, the Federal Open Market Committee is very likely to keep monetary policy unchanged and maintain its neutral stance at its meeting on March 31. Futhermore, this could well be the case for quite some time."
After the recent gains in bond prices, some investors apparently saw yesterday as an opportunity to take profits. Others apparently sold securities short, or sold borrowed shares, expecting to profit from a drop in prices.
Next week the Treasury will be adding supply pressures by auctioning $25 billion of new two-year and five-year notes Tuesday and Wednesday, so it is likely dealers will be trying to make yields as attractive as they can -- by lowering prices -- to insure decent demand.
In when-issued trading ahead of next week's Treasury note auctions, the new two-year issue was offered at a price to yield 5.47 percent, just slightly higher than the previous day, while the five-year note, also up slightly, was offered at a price to yield 5.53 percent.
In corporate debt, despite a surge in new issues because of low interest rates, the market remains solid.

HEADLINE: New York Taxes Poor Whom U.S. and State Exempt

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In a discrepancy affecting almost 100,000 poor New York families, the city is assessing income tax on people whose incomes are low enough to exempt them from Federal and state taxes, according to a study by the city's Independent Budget Office.
The study, conducted by the city-financed independent watchdog group at the request of the Public Advocate, Mark Green, concluded that the city's tax system was contributing to the broad gap in incomes between rich and poor New Yorkers. 
 Typically, it said, the poor families affected make less than $20,000 a year, and pay slightly more than $100 in city income tax.
The report recommended a system of income tax credits, particularly for families with children, to raise the threshold for city income taxes to roughly that of the state and Federal governments.
"Because we have failed to keep pace with state and Federal reforms, New York City is taxing families that live just above the poverty line," said Mr. Green, a Democrat who has announced his intention to seek the Democratic nomination to run for the Senate seat held by Alfonse M. D'Amato. The poverty line for a family of four, as defined by Federal guidelines, is $16,276.
The study found that of 99,500 households affected by the discrepancy, 71 percent were headed by single parents. It said 153,000 children were affected.
At City Hall, officials said the findings released yesterday provided a detailed appraisal of a problem that has been evident for years, and has not escaped the attention of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani or the City Council.
A proposal for a system of low-income tax credits that would have lifted the city's income tax threshold was made jointly last year by the Mayor and Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, but it was rejected by legislators in Albany.
Any adjustment in the city's income tax system must first be approved by the State Legislature, and then by the City Council.
Yesterday's report attributed the disparity between city, state and Federal income tax assessments to varying types of tax credits that have been introduced over the last decade to protect the poor. The main culprit, it said, was a system of credits that the city began offering in 1989 that paralleled those offered by Washington and Albany but, unlike the others, were not indexed for inflation.
As a result, as the inflation-adjusted thresholds at which low-income people begin paying state and Federal income taxes have risen since 1989, the city threshold has remained constant, the report said.
An expert on state and city fiscal policies, Donald J. Boyd, of the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany, said yesterday that similar discrepancies may exist elsewhere but would probably not be considered as severe a problem for taxpayers outside New York City because their tax rates -- and their tax bills -- were lower.

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Brings Drug Searches and Traffic Jams

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: LAREDO, Tex.

 BODY:
It was a trip of four and a half miles, to haul a trailer of Mexican-made air-conditioner parts from a warehouse in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, to a freight forwarder just across the border in Texas. For Salvador Romero, the driver, the journey took 29 hours, door to door.
First came a four-hour backup on the Mexican side. Then, once Mr. Romero made it across the Lincoln-Juarez Bridge over the Rio Grande, his truck got flagged for a random, intensive search by United States Customs agents and their drug-sniffing dogs. A paperwork mistake meant the trailer had to stay parked at Customs overnight. More inspection backups meant the search was not finished until the next afternoon. 
 "It's a constant traffic jam out here," said Mr. Romero, who earns 80 pesos -- about $9.30 -- for every round trip he makes between the two nations. "On average, I can make one trip a day, maybe two or possibly even three if I'm lucky. And then there are days like this."
More than four years after the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect, many crossings along the 2,000-mile border between the United States and Mexico are increasingly jammed with trucks, as the roads and bridges simply cannot keep pace with the booming growth of trade. While the congestion affects entry points from Southern California to the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, it is at its worst in Laredo, the busiest cargo crossing on the border, with lines sometimes stretching for five or six miles in either direction from the Rio Grande here.
A decade ago, 185,000 trucks a year crossed the two bridges at Laredo, while now nearly one million trucks cross three bridges each year, with at least a doubling of that figure projected by 2010. The heavy traffic causes tie-ups that have added to the cost of shipping goods all along the border and that periodically set off tensions between the two nations.
In recent months, the tie-ups have been compounded by lengthy searches ordered by the Customs Service, an agency caught between conflicting mandates to help speed the flow of commercial goods between the two countries and to stem the flow of illegal drugs.
"We've got a big drug problem at the border, and we're not going to turn our eye away from that," said Leonard C. Lindheim, special agent in charge of investigations at the Customs Service's South Texas division. "If it causes long lines, that's a price we'll have to pay."
Here in Laredo, the trade agreement has brought some economic activity, evident in the warehouses that have sprouted all over town. But there is also a nagging sense that the pact's benefits to Laredo were overstated while its drawbacks -- pollution, traffic and other problems -- are overwhelming this city of 150,000 people. The unemployment rate here remains above 10 percent, more than twice the national average.
Despite their obvious frustrations at the system, most Mexican drivers seemed resigned to the process as they gathered at a waiting area in the Customs lot here. Although it was only March, temperatures hit the 90's by midday, and many drivers said they were already dreading the nightmarish heat of summer.
"You have to stay near the truck at all times, so what can you do?" said Jorge Campos, 42, a driver based in Nuevo Laredo who was waiting as crates of elevator parts he was taking to Laredo were removed from his truck by forklifts, searched by Customs officials and sniffed by the dogs. "Of course we are mad, but you can't blame them," he said, gesturing toward the agents and their dogs. "They're just doing their jobs. They didn't make the law."
The searches are part of Operation Brass Ring, a six-month program started by Customs in February that includes roving teams of inspectors and intensive random inspections, like the one Mr. Romero's truck underwent, that are all aimed at sharply increasing the amount of drugs seized at the border.
Customs already seizes more drugs than all other Federal agencies combined, including more than 607,000 pounds of marijuana and 46,000 pounds of cocaine in its border regions alone last year. But with some law-enforcement officials estimating that 90 percent or more of all drugs that cross the border go undetected, the agency is under constant pressure to step up the pace and scope of its searches.
Some drugs still enter the country in backpacks carried by smugglers across remote stretches of desert. But with border crossings overwhelmed by commercial traffic, many dealers have become increasingly brazen about trying to hide the drugs inside shipments aboard 18-wheelers and other big trucks. Recent searches by Customs agents have turned up cocaine and heroin in the doors, walls, axles, fuel tanks and tires of the big trucks, and inside cargo pallets and even the hollowed-out cores of a load of vegetables.
Sgt. 1st Class Richard Rodriguez of the Texas National Guard's anti-drug task force, who was assisting Customs agents with truck searches here recently, said it could take up to six hours to complete a thorough inspection. Many trucks are given a cursory inspection and waved on at the bridges.
Local transportation planners say they are trying to ease the tie-ups, which tend to be at their worst in the late afternoons. Trucks are increasingly using the six-year-old Colombia-Solidarity Bridge, about 20 miles northwest of here, which had initially been considered something of a Government white elephant because drivers balked at making the detour from major highways. That diversion can take two hours or more on either side; but the eight-lane bridge has dozens of inspection docks and the crossing procedure is much quicker. The sister cities are also embarking on construction of another bridge later this year.
Customs officials also have long-range plans for easing the congestion. The agency already uses three huge X-ray machines along the border, two in California and one in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas, that look a bit like mammoth car washes and that can inspect a truck's contents in minutes. But prospects for their widespread use are uncertain, since the machines cost $3.5 million each. Customs officials are also considering use of high-tech devices that can "sniff" cocaine vapors and are pressing plans to streamline paperwork by putting truck manifests on computers that would be linked to Customs agencies in Mexico, Canada and the United States.
"There is no question that the infrastructure limits what you can do," said Noel Sanchez Jr., the Customs Service's director of passenger operations and vehicular traffic here. "But we can still do a good job at both things, helping to move goods across the border and stopping drugs. Just give us the resources, and we can do the job."

A Family Circle Breaks: Murdoch Owns Dodgers

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., March 19

 BODY:
The father yanked them out of Brooklyn 40 years ago to capture the wealth of the West. Now the son has severed them from the family for the wealth $311 million will bring.
The Los Angeles, formerly Brooklyn, Dodgers left the O'Malley family today after nearly half a century of ownership when Major League Baseball club owners approved their sale to the Fox Group of Rupert Murdoch. It marks the end of family ownerships in baseball. 
 The sale, which needed 12 of the 16 votes from National League owners and 8 of 14 from American League owners to pass, was approved by a vote of 27 to 2 with one abstention.
Ted Turner of the Time Warner Atlanta Braves and Jerry Reinsdorf of the Chicago White Sox voted no. The Mets abstained because their co-owners were split in their positions. Fred Wilpon favored the transaction; Nelson Doubleday opposed it.
Peter O'Malley said he could not compare his feeling of selling the Dodgers with the feeling his father, Walter, had in moving them before the 1958 season. But he said at a news conference following the meeting at the Renaissance Vinoy Resort:
"I remember my dad talking about the move. It was a tough move for the family. Before he concluded it was best thing to move that franchise, he strongly tried to build a stadium in Brooklyn at the corner of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues. Only when that became impossible did he move."
Old-time Dodgers fanatics would most likely dispute that motive for moving, believing that Walter O'Malley engineered the trip west because of the promise of riches the untapped West Coast held. The two Fox executives who will be in charge of the club for Murdoch followed a similar route.
Peter Chernin, 46, and Chase Carey, 44, are the co-chief operating officers of News Corporation, parent company of the Fox Group. Like the Dodgers, they grew up in New York. Chernin has been in Los Angeles for 19 years, Carey for 16.
"I'm a lifelong Dodger fan," Chernin said. "I saw my first baseball game at Ebbets Field."
Turner is not a Murdoch fan, and he made that clear in comments he made at sessions Wednesday and today. But others who attended the meeting credited Turner with acting with class and avoiding personal vitriol.
"I thought Ted Turner showed an extraordinary amount of class," Bud Selig, a relieved acting commissioner, said. "Just the way he handled himself. The way he spoke. What he said. When he said it."
Another person who was at the meeting said that after the vote, Turner made some conciliatory remarks, saying the majority had spoken and they all would work together to make baseball a better game. He also congratulated the Fox executives.
Murdoch, whose television entities hold national rights to major league games and local rights to games of 22 of the 30 teams, was not present for the occasion. Chernin and Carey were, and they were summoned into the meeting at one point to answer questions from some concerned owners.
Two of those owners, Peter Magowan of San Francisco and John Moores of San Diego, were so satisfied with their answers that they changed what might have been "no" votes to yes.
"They did a good job of answering the questions," Magowan said. "The biggest question was whether it was a conflict of interest having a financial investment in local media rights of 22 clubs. Would owning the Dodgers hurt the financial interests of those clubs? They made very strong statements that they would operate each of these businesses separately."
Another concern that had been expressed was the prospect of Murdoch's spending money madly for players and escalating the salary scale.
"We've had enough salaries escalating without him coming into the game," Magowan said, "so it would be hard to blame him for that."
Reinsdorf declined to say why he voted no, but officials said his vote stemmed from a dispute he had with Murdoch years ago.
Selig said Fox's presence as an owner was good for baseball economically.
"They are our national TV partner and they have been an excellent partner," he said. "They have cooperated and worked with us in a number of things. They have an economic arrangement with 22 clubs. I believe the synergism all the way around is very useful."
Is he satisfied that there is no conflict of interest?
"We are satisfied," he said. "We spent a lot of time going over a myriad of details and we are satisfied."
For Fox's part, Chernin said the purchase was important because the Dodgers are "one of the crown jewels of American sports and life." In addition, he said, "The Dodgers are one of the great unifying features of the city of Los Angeles."
The $311 million purchase price is the largest paid for a baseball team, but it includes other properties as well, including Dodger Stadium, real estate surrounding it, the spring training complex in Vero Beach, Fla., and the club's complex in the Dominican Republic.

HEADLINE: Prices Paid By Consumers Up Just 0.1%

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
Inflation remained subdued last month, thanks in large part to falling energy prices.
The Labor Department said today that consumer prices rose only one-tenth of 1 percent in February. Excluding the cost of food and energy, which can move sharply from month to month, February's prices increased at a faster three-tenths of 1 percent, led by the largest increase in tobacco prices in nine years. 
 Separately, the Labor Department said the number of new jobless claims rose by 9,000 last week, to 308,000, exceeding analysts' expectations. The level of new claims suggested that job creation was strong.
Economists expect inflation to stay tame because competition among American companies will force them to hold the line on prices, while the Asian crisis will help keep import prices down.
Energy prices, which account for about one-tenth of the Consumer Price Index, fell 2.2 percent in February on the heels of a 2.4 percent decline in January.
Earlier this week, crude oil prices fell to a nine-year low because of expectations that the major producing nations would leave the world awash with oil. Still, oil company executives expect the downturn in oil prices to be temporary. "What has happened in the last several months is really just a hiccup and is not sustainable," Archie Dunham, chief executive of Conoco Inc., said in an interview.
Food prices, which make up about one-fifth of the price index, were unchanged in February even though the price of fresh fruits rose 5.8 percent, the biggest gain since July 1988. Fresh vegetable prices fell 7.2 percent, the largest decline since June 1993.
Food prices may climb as a result of El Nino, the global weather phenomenon driven by unseasonably warm water off the coast of Peru. Record rainfall in the southern United States and California has flooded fields and ruined some crops.
The price of tobacco and other smoking products rose 2.9 percent in February, the largest monthly gain since January 1989. That suggested "retailers have taken the opportunity to widen their margins while blaming the manufacturers," said Ian Shepherdson, economist with HSBC Securities Inc. in New York. "Tobacco companies are clearly squeezing their price-insensitive consumers in order to fund impending legal deals."

HEADLINE: U.S. TO EASE CURBS ON RELIEF TO CUBA AND MONEY TO KIN

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
At the urging of Pope John Paul II, President Clinton will ease American restrictions on aid to Cuba, direct flights to the country and money sent to relatives by Cuban-Americans, senior American officials said today.
The President is expected to announce the changes on Friday, said the officials, who stressed that he would keep the economic embargo on Cuba. 
 The officials said Mr. Clinton wanted to respond to a plea from the Pope for help in carrying out religious and relief activities that do not benefit the Communist Government of Fidel Castro. Restrictions on tourism will not be relaxed.
The moves do not convey any approval of Mr. Castro's Government or policies, a senior official said, but are based on the conclusion that the Pope's visit to Cuba in January "created space for people to act in opposition to Castro."
For the first time since 1994, Mr. Clinton will allow Cuban-Americans to send money directly, and legally, to relatives in Cuba through licensed agencies. Cuban-Americans will be able to send up to $300 every quarter to each household.
Mr. Clinton will also allow certain organizations, like the Roman Catholic Church and the Catholic agency Caritas, to charter flights directly to Cuba from the United States. These flights might carry goods for relief purposes or passengers in emergencies, like funerals.
The President will also announce a streamlining of the licensing procedure that allows nonprofit organizations to export and sell pharmaceuticals to Cuba, while letting the organizations themselves insure that the drugs go to the proper recipients, and not the state.
And Mr. Clinton will say he is willing to work with Congress on legislation to ease the export of needed food to Cuba.
Some Congressional criticism was immediate. Representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both Florida Republicans, issued a joint statement accusing Mr. Clinton of seeking "to unilaterally relax sanctions on the Castro tyranny." They said the Pope's visit "should not be used as a pretext to soften sanctions."
Ms. Ros-Lehtinen said permitting flights and the payment of money to relatives reduced the price Mr. Castro is paying for shooting down two unarmed civilian aircraft, flown by Cuban exiles testing the Cuban Government, in international waters on Feb. 24, 1996.
But others in Miami cheered the decision and said it was another sign of needed change. "It was overdue," said Armando Garcia, vice president of Marazul Charters, the biggest Miami retailer of flights to Cuba. "Miami's not the same as it was two or three years ago. People are losing their fear of speaking up."
Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a research group based here, said he thought the Administration's decision would find general approval.
"There will be some gnashing of teeth in Congress, but with the Pope sanctioning such assistance and excoriating those who don't help, it seems to me the Administration will emerge relatively unscathed by its actions," Mr. Birns said. "It will also win points with the European Union and the rest of Latin America, which has been caustic in its criticism of U.S. policy to Cuba."
At Mr. Clinton's request, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, developed the recommendations. Ms. Albright went to Miami in late February to talk to church leaders and Cuban-Americans, including the families of the pilots killed in 1996.
On March 7, in a conversation with the Pope at the Vatican, Ms. Albright discussed Cuba and the importance of the Pope's 1979 visit to Poland to ending Communist rule there. His visit to Cuba could be a similar "point of departure," she told him.
After the meeting, Ms. Albright wrote Mr. Clinton a memo. In it she drew an analogy to what happened in Poland after the Pope's visit and said Cuban-Americans had given her the impression that the Pope's visit to Cuba had provided encouragement to opponents of the Government. She said the Catholic Church -- with its four million adherents, its uncensored sermons and its access to the people -- represented an important opening for Washington.
But what Mr. Clinton will do, officials say, is mostly revert to practices that existed when he took office. In August 1994, he responded to an organized outflow of Cuban boat people by banning Cuban-Americans from sending money to relatives.
Even so, Mr. Birns said, some $700 million a year in illegal payments get through to Cuba.
Mr. Clinton suspended direct flights to Cuba on Feb. 26, 1996, two days after the downing of the planes. Both the economic embargo and the ban on direct flights were included in the Helms-Burton bill, which Mr. Clinton signed in March 1996.
One Congressional staffer said today that it was not clear whether Mr. Clinton had the authority himself to allow direct flights, since the ban is covered under the legislation, which does allow special waivers. But officials said that while the details were still being worked out, the intention is to cut the costs to the church and charities of flights they were sending anyway, through third countries.
After the Pope's visit, Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican from North Carolina who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, announced that he would introduce legislation designed to increase aid to Cuba and allow direct flights to deliver it. Today, his spokesman said he had been offended by Mr. Clinton's unilateral actions.
"This is a major mistake," said Mr. Helms's spokesman, Marc Thiessen. "It seriously complicates our ability to get through legislation to provide increased humanitarian assistance to the Cuban people."
The move to ease the Cuban sanctions had been gathering strength, even before the Pope's visit. The end of the Soviet Union made the idea of a Cuban threat to America seem implausible, and the recent death of Jorge Mas Canosa, whom Mr. Birns called "the most forceful and politically influential Cuban-American figure, with the key to back door of White House," took some political sting from the Cuban-American lobby.
John Howard, director of international policy for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said an end to the embargo would bring quicker benefits of freedom, the same argument the Europeans make.
In January, the chamber joined groups like the National Association of Manufacturers in advocating an immediate lifting of restrictions on the sale of food, medicine and medical equipment. "But that's only a first step," Mr. Howard said. "When you end these embargoes, free markets and free societies follow."

HEADLINE: January Trade Deficit Soared, as the Asia Crisis Hit Home

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit surged in January to its highest level in a decade as the financial crises in Asia depressed demand for American goods in that part of the world, the Commerce Department reported today.
It said the deficit in the trade of goods and services expanded to $12 billion in January from $10.9 billion in December. This was the widest gap since the department began using its current monthly measurement system in 1992 and was last exceeded late in 1987 under a system that measured trade on a quarterly basis. 
 The deficit in goods alone rose to $18.8 billion, the highest level on record, from $17.7 billion in December.
Economists have predicted for months that Asia's woes would begin slowing the robust American economy, and today's figures provided the first clear evidence that the process was under way.
"This is the beginning of Asia kicking in, and it is the harbinger of wider deficits to come," said Joel L. Naroff, an economist at the First Union Bank in Philadelphia.
With American exporters feeling the bite, the Clinton Administration stepped up efforts today to press Japan into reviving its moribund economy to help pull Asia out of its crisis. For the first time, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers specified how much the United States wanted Japan to increase public spending and cut taxes: 2 percent of the country's gross domestic product. That is roughly equivalent to $77 billion.
Mr. Summers acknowledged that Japanese officials were becoming increasingly angry at American criticism of how their economy was being managed. But, he said, "Just as our Japanese and European friends appropriately criticized U.S. budget deficits, we think it is appropriate" to specify how Japan should stimulate its economy for the good of its trading partners.
Analysts said they expected widening trade deficits in coming months to exert more of a drag on growth in the United States.
But they said it remained unclear whether the otherwise strong economy would slow sufficiently to avoid inflation pressures that would lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates -- or whether the economy might slow so much that an interest-rate cut would be justified.
Inflation statistics released today provided few clues to which way the economy might tip. The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index for February rose one-tenth of 1 percent, held down by falling oil prices, leaving the inflation rate for the last year at 1.4 percent. Excluding food and energy, the Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of 1 percent, its biggest jump since last April. Most of the rise, though, came from one-time increases in items like cigarette prices and rent, rather than broad-based price increases.
Falling oil prices also made the trade deficit look smaller, since the value of energy imports would otherwise have been much higher. As it was, the trade figures showed how the difficulties among some of the nation's fastest-growing export markets were being felt at home.
The most compelling evidence was in the figures for trade with the four original "Asian tiger" economies. The combined deficit in those markets -- South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan -- jumped to $2.2 billion for the month, up from $841 million in December and $783 million a year earlier.
The deficit just with South Korea, one of the nations hit hardest by financial crisis, rose to $856 million from $341 million. In January 1997, the United States had a trade surplus with South Korea of $181 million.
The deficit with Japan, one of the most politically sensitive indicators of American trade performance, narrowed to $4.4 billion, from $5.1 billion in December, when the gap was particularly high.
The deficit with China, which now rivals that of Japan in economic and political significance, rose in January to $3.7 billion from $2.7 billion.
While considerable attention has been focused on how Asian financial problems are hurting trade, economists said the overall impact on the United States was mixed. The currency devaluations across Asia have made imports from there into the United States less expensive, dampening inflation and forcing domestic competitors to hold down prices.
Low inflation and a flood of investment from Asia into United States Treasury bonds have pushed down interest rates, reducing borrowing costs for American businesses and consumers and setting off mortgage refinancing that has left more money in the pockets of many people.
While the slowing of exports to Asia could significantly cut growth in this country, the slowdown will be partly offset by the reduction in interest rates and by low oil prices, analysts said. While many economists still expect growth to slow from its 3.9 percent pace in the fourth quarter, few predict that it will slow in the current quarter to what has been considered a sustainable pace of 2.5 percent or less.
"The domestic part of the economy is really on fire," said Stuart G. Hoffman of the PNC Corporation. "If the trade deficit held at its current level through February and March, it could knock one and a quarter percentage points off the growth rate, but that would leave real G.D.P. growth at 3 or 3.5 percent."

HEADLINE: Smoking Budgets in Washington

 BODY:
After two months of soap-opera diversions, Congress has returned to the familiar task of squabbling over how to spend money that does not exist. President Clinton and the Democrats want to apply funds from a tobacco settlement to hire teachers, build classrooms and expand health coverage. Republicans reject that approach but are divided over the alternatives. Whichever side prevails, the budget makers are courting trouble by counting on a tobacco settlement, and that may cripple their ability to craft one that does not give too much away to the industry.
Even so, such familiar budget tangles can be a comfort for those weary of scandal. Also, thanks to a booming economy and surpluses projected over many years, these disputes center on how to deal with abundance. In January Mr. Clinton proposed to set aside the surplus for the financially ailing Social Security system. So far he appears to have won the day from Capitol Hill on that point. But to generate resources for his additional spending programs and tax cuts, Mr. Clinton wanted to reduce spending in other areas, close tax loopholes and, most important, tap $65 billion in tobacco-related revenues over the next five years. 
 The most helpful Republican response would have been to wait until there is a tobacco deal before spending the money from it. But the Republicans, too, are eyeing all that tobacco money for their own purposes, especially tax cuts. The climate in Congress thus favors some kind of settlement that would include payments from the industry to the government, a sharp cigarette tax hike, or both.
Any tobacco deal should not immunize the industry from lawsuits or bar the Government from regulating tobacco. Tobacco proceeds would also best be used for victims of diseases relating to smoking, as the Administration wants.
This week the Senate Budget Committee called for the rest of the tobacco money to be set aside to prevent future cuts in Medicare. That proposal would be preferable to the push by House Republicans to use it for tax-cut schemes and highways. But the Medicare trust fund is not in any immediate danger of insolvency, and the White House's idea of spending the money on education, job training and child care deserves consideration.
Whatever happens will probably be decided in conference later this year. The President, looking relieved to be talking about tax and spending policy, took to the road this week and got a predictably supportive response from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. What he left out is that it all deserves to disappear in a puff if the right tobacco deal is not reached.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Tory With Juice

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
The journalistic sense of mission to visit London that seizes American columnists each springtime can be fulfilled only with commitment to specific duties. Walks in parks alive with daffodils must be undertaken; also seeing a couple of plays, dinner at an excellent club, and breakfast at the Ritz.
 My breakfast was with a man I had met far from here but wanted to see in this city, on the record.
 
 The two times I had talked with Christopher Patten were in Hong Kong, when he was the British Governor there. With the island tense approaching the Chinese takeover, what he said was not for publication. But what this politician-diplomat learned from experience with the Chinese struck me as increasingly important to be read in Europe and America.
So, on the record, this sums up what he said in both cities:
-- China needs Western business hugely more than the West needs Chinese. Britain's exports to China are 0.4 percent of the British total. Britain sells 15 times more to the Benelux countries than to China.
 -- China's economic power against the West is no more than the power of blackmail against the fearful, which vanishes when confronted.
-- But Western business and governments act as if it were the other way around. Through fear of loss of Chinese trade they make business and political concessions that are against their interests, economically and morally.
-- The Chinese not only know this fear-driven Western weakness but incorporate it in their international business and political policies. When China wanted to show its economic muscle, it canceled some contracts with a suitably small country. It chose Denmark in punishment for the Danish stand against Chinese human rights abuse. For all the talk of Continental unity, Europe did nothing and neither did the U.S.
-- Vastly stronger economically and technologically than China, the West must divorce its political, strategic and moral needs and principles from business deals with China. Only then will the Communists treat the West with any respect, not the contempt it has earned.
As Mr. Patten talked, I thought of what had happened in the past few days that showed how hypnotized Washington had become by the fake watch of profit that the Chinese keep swinging before its eyes.
President Clinton pushes forward a visit to China. He cancels Washington's yearly attempt to get the U.N. Human Rights Commission to criticize China's human rights brutalities. America's diplomatic spin doctors sell the story that China is improving its human rights behavior -- as Beijing again rounds up suspected dissidents. The Clinton Administration considers canceling missile-technology sanctions against China imposed after the massacre at Tiananmen.
And I have just received a copy of a report on religious rights in China by three U.S. clergymen, Catholic, Protestant and Jewish.
They were dispatched by the President of the United States and received by the President of China, and did not permit U.S. journalists to accompany them. The report has all the passion and compassion of a telephone directory. In tone and language it treats the Chinese Government, warden of the Chinese gulag and persecutor of Chinese Christians who disobey Beijing's "patriotic" religious regulation, as if the clergymen were bowing themselves in and out of an emperor's presence.
Mr. Patten is a Conservative, a Tory with juice -- phrase stolen from conversation with Warren Hoge, who enriches The New York Times with his reporting from Britain.
Mr. Patten squirts some juice on Rupert Murdoch. HarperCollins, a Murdoch publishing house, canceled Mr. Patten's book, "East and West," for fear the Chinese would take their anger out on Murdoch holdings in China. Bottom line: Mr. Patten got a settlement from HarperCollins, contracts from Macmillan in London and Times Books in New York, and mountains of free publicity.
The press in Britain and America jumped all over Mr. Murdoch. That was fine, except when the attacks came from journalists and academics who have been silent about Mr. Clinton's sellout of Chinese and Tibetan human rights.
They fit the Patten definition of the publisher who would not publish: "China's useful idiot."

HEADLINE: Auction Ends 5-Year Dream in 5 Minutes

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
It was over in just five minutes. Yolanda Garcia, who had fought for five years to restore the old Bronx County Courthouse, a hulking monument to the city's abandonment of her neighborhood, was simply outbid.
The building, a 1914 Beaux-Arts landmark at 161st Street and Third Avenue that was shuttered in 1978, was sold for $300,000 at a city auction yesterday to two men from Brooklyn who plan to renovate it as medical offices or stores. 
 With that, a community's dream seemed to have fizzled.
Since 1993, Ms. Garcia and other members of Nos Quedamos (We Stay), a grass-roots group that is slowly beginning to revive the ravaged Melrose section of the Bronx, had worked with a succession of city and nonprofit agencies and philanthropies to turn the courthouse into a town center of sorts.
Nos Quedamos, which became an international model for community-led planning when it took control of the Melrose Commons urban renewal project in 1992, envisioned a school, museum, library and other groups sharing the courthouse's cavernous lobby, marble staircases and terrazzo floors.
This would be no easy task. A 1992 estimate put the cost of restoring the courthouse at $43 million. But Nos Quedamos developed a plan to fix it up piecemeal as funds materialized. It raised $900,000 to begin the job and began talks with the city about a lease.
But in 1996, the city abruptly ended those negotiations and put the courthouse up for sale. It was sold at auction in 1996 to an electrical contractor from Queens, who defaulted on his payments last year.
At the previous auction, Ms. Garcia watched, helpless, as the courthouse sold for $130,000. She resolved not to let it be sold a second time without putting up a fight.
"Give up?" she said yesterday morning, amid the hubbub of the auction, attended by several hundred people at One Police Plaza. "That's where we live. What do we do, continue to let it decay? Continue to live in a ghetto?"
This time, Ms. Garcia had financial support: Robert Garcia (no relation), an electrical contractor who grew up a block from the courthouse and played in its entrances as a child, and Shelly Fox, a general contractor who is building three-family homes in the Bronx.
Over lunch, the men worried how high the bidding might go, how high they would be willing to go.
Parcel No. 146, the courthouse, went up for sale at 3:40. Across the auditorium, half a dozen people quickly bid the building up to $100,000. Ms. Garcia was still in it, her friends nodding along in agreement. A red-haired woman joined the fray, and the price was at $250,000. Ms. Garcia's friends nodded, and she went to $260,000. Then two men in the front row offered $270,000. Ms. Garcia went to $280,000. Someone else bid $290,000. Ms. Garcia raised her hand, but the men in front were recognized first, at $300,000.
The next bid, the auctioneer said, would have to be $325,000. Ms. Garcia's friends slumped in their seats. So did she.
"Sold," the auctioneer shouted at 3:45.
The winning bidders, Henry Weinstein and Benjamin Klein, said they fell in love with the courthouse when they drove past it one night three weeks ago, after seeing it in the auction catalogue.
Mr. Weinstein, who owns a furniture store and has built condominiums in Brooklyn, and Mr. Klein, a mechanical engineer, said they expect to spend about $12 million to fix up the courthouse as a department store or mall, or perhaps medical offices. They said they knew nothing of Nos Quedamos or its plans. They scoffed at the $43 million estimate for restoring the building, saying they could do it for far less.
Ms. Garcia tried to contain her bitterness, and failed. "At least you can tell us, 'Thank you for the new roof that's keeping the rain out,' " she said, referring to $300,000 in repairs the city made in response to her group's efforts.
Taken aback, the men told Ms. Garcia and her friends that they are willing to meet with her. "If there's some way we can help you people, we'd like to," Mr. Weinstein said.
He and Mr. Klein said goodbye, and Ms. Garcia took the measure of the day. "I'm crying inside," she said. "But we were close. It tells you the kind of people that live in Melrose. The kind of a commitment that's there. I just wish we could get a break."

HEADLINE: Black Youths' Rate of Suicide Rising Sharply, Studies Find

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 19

 BODY:
Suicide among black teen-agers, once quite rare, has increased dramatically over the last two decades, a troubling rise that might reflect the strain some black families feel in making the transition to middle-class life, according to a study released today by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The study found that the rate of black suicide for youths ages 15 to 19 had more than doubled, to 8.1 per 100,000 in 1995, from 3.6 per 100,000 in 1980. It found a similar pattern, with far smaller numbers for ages 10 to 14. 
 Researchers also found that the gap between black and white teen-age suicides was narrowing -- in 1980 the white rate for ages 10 to 19 was more than twice the black rate, but in 1995 the white rate was 42 percent higher.
And a 1995 study of high school students across the country found that black students were as likely as whites to try suicide.
Suicide is now the third leading cause of death for black 15- to 24-year-olds, matching the rate in the general population.
The leading cause of death for black youths is homicide, followed by accidents.
Dr. Tonji Durant, the author of the centers' study, said the researchers hypothesized that one factor in the increase might be the growth in the black middle class.
"One theory," Dr. Durant said, "is that upwardly mobile families may experience some stress with their social environments and for some reason they may, in the process of adapting to a new class, adopt some of the behaviors of the larger society, including the ways of dealing with hopelessness and depression."
Several experts on black youth suicide said today that the move to middle-class life might be accompanied by a splintering of community and family support networks, a weakening of bonds to religion, and the pressure of trying to compete in historically white-dominated professions and social circles.
The centers' study did not look at the economic status of the suicide victims, and Dr. Durant said more research was needed to better understand the patterns. But a 1995 study at Columbia University of teen-age suicides in the New York metropolitan region found that unlike white and Hispanic teen-agers, black teen-agers who committed suicide tended to come from higher socio-economic backgrounds than blacks in the general population.
"What we figured is that the greater economic and educational advances that blacks were able to make, the less protection they were able to give their children from the stresses that lead to suicide," said Dr. David Shaffer, a professor of child psychiatry and pediatrics at Columbia who conducted that study, which looked in detail at each of 140 teen-age suicides in New York City and its suburbs from 1984 to 1986. "One theory is that when you live in poorer circumstances, there is a kind of stress inoculation. If you're exposed to a lot of stress then you're able to deal with many problems. It's a bit like being immunized."
Les Franklin, who formed a foundation to help black teen-agers after his 16-year-old son shot himself in the head in 1990 in their affluent Denver neighborhood, said his own experience and others he knew of supported that analysis.
"You don't find a lot of gang members committing suicide," Mr. Franklin said. His son Shaka grew up in a large house with a swimming pool out back and a Porsche in the four-car garage, a life style Mr. Franklin, then working for I.B.M., said was a huge step up from his own upbringing in an apartment crowded with aunts and grandparents.
"His mother and I were divorced -- he never forgave us for that," Mr. Franklin said. "I know that he had low self-esteem. He was a kid living in pain." But, Mr. Franklin added, "he didn't have the hard life. He didn't have the preparation that I got to learn how to survive."
At a time when young black males are murdered at an alarming rate -- 111 per 100,000, according to 1995 figures -- the suicide numbers are especially troubling, people who work with black youths say.
The centers' study of the 3,030 suicides of blacks ages 10 to 19 between 1980 and 1995 found a stark increase in the suicide rate among black males between the ages of 15 and 19, which jumped 146 percent from 1980 to 1995. Suicide among white males in that age group increased 22 percent during that time. Suicides among black teen-age girls increased also, but, like whites, those rates were much lower than for boys.
Nearly three quarters of black male teen-agers who killed themselves used guns, the most common weapon for white males as well.
David C. Clark, a professor of psychiatry at Rush Medical College in Chicago, who is working on a study of all Chicago suicides for ages 15 to 19 from 1991 to 1996, said preliminary findings had suggested that "black adolescents are more likely to kill themselves in the presence of somebody else, in the presence of a girlfriend or in the presence of someone who they hang out with."
That means, Professor Clark said, that "for every black adolescent suicide we have a greater likelihood that there are other teens that are exposed to the shock."
Some experts said that in urban neighborhoods with a lot of guns, some young men, feeling hopeless or depressed, might indirectly commit suicide by putting themselves in situations where they are likely to be shot. The centers' study did not include these kinds of deaths.
Professor Clark said the increase in black teen-age suicide might also reflect the paucity of mental health services in many black communities and a cultural distrust of mental health professionals.
"It certainly has been a taboo in the African-American community to talk about suicide," said Kenya Napper Bello, president of Free Mind Generation, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta dedicated to preventing suicide and depression among blacks. "It is often viewed as a sin."
Ms. Bello's husband, Razak, killed himself at the age of 27 by jumping out the 32d-floor window of a downtown Atlanta hotel. Mr. Bello, a rising young executive at Coca-Cola, had been told by doctors that he had manic-depressive illness, but was so uncomfortable with the idea that he needed help that, two months before his death, he stopped taking medication and seeing a counselor.
"It was unfortunate that he suffered from a condition that he felt he had to hide, including from me," said Ms. Bello, who also started a newsletter called "Black Men Don't Commit Suicide," after a myth that she said some people still subscribe to.
"We have prided ourselves as a community in being resilient and being able to deal with adversity," Ms. Bello said. "The white community seems to be far more advanced in talking about it, getting psychological support and coming up with answers. We're just not there."

HEADLINE: In Deal to Sell Bus Depot, The Post Would Get a Plant

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
A committee of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted yesterday to make a bus depot in the South Bronx available to The New York Post for a new color printing plant, in a move that critics say could cause service disruptions and force scores of buses to be quartered in residential neighborhoods.
State officials say the deal was necessary to keep The Post's printing operation -- and the 500 jobs that go with it -- in New York City. But critics in Manhattan and the Bronx and even some transit officials assailed the deal, saying it put the needs of The New York Post, and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, ahead of those of city neighborhoods. 
 The measure, which will be considered by the full M.T.A. board on Thursday, would authorize the sale of an eight-acre parcel, which includes the Walnut Depot, to the Empire State Development Corporation for $11.5 million. The corporation would then lease or rent the property to the Galesi Group, which would develop the site, and an adjacent parcel it already controls, and rent it to The Post for a new $150 million printing plant.
Home to 220 buses, the Walnut Depot on 132d Street was scheduled to close down in two years, when another depot in the Bronx is to open. Critics inside and outside the transit agency said that shutting down the depot now, at a time when ridership is booming and when the agency plans to buy hundreds more buses, would tax the M.T.A.'s other depots.
"To be closing down a bus depot now, when they are scrounging every month to find space to park buses, doesn't make sense," said Beverly Dolinsky, a non-voting member of the authority's board who is also the Executive Director of its Transit Riders Council. Lawrence G. Reuter, the president of New York City Transit, the transportation authority's bus and subway subsidiary, said that the early shutdown of Walnut would cause only minimal inconvenience. And Caroline Quartararo, spokeswoman for the state development corporation, praised the authority for stepping aside to help bring jobs to a blighted industrial area of the Bronx.
"This project will help us create jobs and economic opportunity in a community that desperately needs them," she said.
To accommodate the early shutdown of the Walnut Depot, a former warehouse that the authority bought for $1.2 million in 1979, the M.T.A. is relocating its 220 buses to five depots in the Bronx and Upper Manhattan that are at full capacity. Yesterday's real estate committee agenda contained four requests from New York City Transit for extra parking spaces for buses in Upper Manhattan.
Ms. Dolinsky of the Transit Riders Council also criticized the way the vote was taken. The question was not on the real estate committee's regular agenda and was approved on a 1-0 vote. Daniel Scannell, one of only two members of the five-member committee to attend the meeting, voted in favor, while Alan Friedberg, the other member, abstained because the item was added at the last minute and he still had questions about it.
"Keeping business here, taking a blighted spot and making something of it, that's all good," he said. "But we're entitled to be memoed appropriately with the appropriate memorandum about all the costs related to this item."
Christopher P. Boylan, an Executive Deputy Director at the M.T.A., said that measures that come before the agency's committees need not be approved by a majority before they are passed on to the full board.
Mr. Reuter said it was costing the agency between $1.6 million and $2 million to speed the completion of a new depot along the West Side Highway that will open the day Walnut closes -- scheduled for March 29.
Mr. Reuter also acknowledged that running Bronx buses out of Manhattan depots would increase the time that it takes drivers to bring empty buses back to the start of their routes and back to the depot at the end of the day, which would increase fuel and labor costs. But he declined to say what those costs would be.
The union representing bus drivers said the extra distance that buses would have to travel to reach their runs increased the likelihood of delays for passengers.
"We're going backwards," said Jimmy DeLong, vice president for buses of Transport Workers Union Local 100. "On the Bx5," -- now slated to move its base from Walnut to the Gun Hill Depot, an extra 12 minutes from the start of the route -- "we went from 8-, 10- and 12-minute headways to 2-, 3- and 4-minute headways by putting extra service out there. We virtually wiped out competition from the private vans on that line. If we don't get these buses out on schedule people are going back to the vans."
Peggy Shepard, the executive director of West Harlem Environmental Action, assailed the proposal. "Rupert Murdoch's need for the Walnut Depot should not outweigh the health of half a million residents of northern Manhattan," she said, "but that looks like what's happening."
Howard Rubenstein, speaking for The Post and Mr. Murdoch, said:
"From every public policy perspective, it was a good decision and the right place for the printing plant. The Governor, Mayor, Bronx Borough President, and the N.R.D.C. all support it."
While Ms. Shepard and other critics wondered why The Post could not move to one of the many industrial sites in the South Bronx, Martin Singerman, the paper's president and publisher, said the Walnut site, which will be next door to a paper recycling plant, was the only suitable one it had found. "This location is a hub for all of New York City," he said. "You're right on the Major Deegan, you've got the Triborough Bridge, you've got all those highways to Westchester or Long Island nearby."
Mr. Boylan said he did not understand why the deal had attracted so much criticism.
"People complain about government not being able to get out of its own way," he said, "and here we're speeding things up for the sake of the state and the city and the M.T.A. and people complain about that, too."

HEADLINE: New Democrat Enters Race For Governor

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 19

 BODY:
Completing a transformation that began when she quit the Republican Party last year, Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross announced today that she would seek to unseat Gov. George E. Pataki, her one-time running mate. She repeatedly urged voters to make her the state's first female governor.
Taking the stage to the brassy thump of prerecorded military marches, Ms. McCaughey Ross assailed Mr. Pataki and her former political benefactor, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, presenting her candidacy as a break from politics as usual. Now a Democrat, Ms. McCaughey Ross said she would campaign against abuses by health maintenance organizations and address deep economic difficulties that she said were turning New York into a "Charles Dickens tale of two economies." 
 "I entered this race not to run against one man, but to put forward new ideas and fresh approaches to solve the problems facing working families in New York," Ms. McCaughey Ross declared. "Too many good ideas have been ignored because of politics and games. Too many fresh approaches have been left untried because of the same old thinking."
With her announcement swing through Buffalo, New York City and Albany, Ms. McCaughey Ross apparently completed the field of Democrats seeking to run against Mr. Pataki this fall, a contest that many Democrats view as daunting, at best.
But as a political phenomenon, Ms. McCaughey Ross's candidacy is highly unusual, and has attracted extraordinary attention to someone who has been in elective office for less than four years.
For one thing, many Democratic leaders have already expressed a deep distrust of her, questioning how someone who campaigned comfortably as Mr. Pataki's running mate in 1994 could now present herself as an advocate of Democratic values. At the same time, many Democrats say they believe Ms. McCaughey Ross may well win the primary, if only because she is a woman in a field of unknown men.
Accordingly, the latest gubernatorial candidate was met by something less than a cheerful welcome by her opponents.
When she appeared this evening at the Federal Hall Rotunda in lower Manhattan, an aide to one of her opponents, Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker, gave reporters a detailed critique suggesting contradictions between her announcement speech and her past record.
And Richard A. Kahan, a developer and former chairman of the State Urban Development Corporation, released a television advertisement that portrayed her as a conservative Republican, taking note, for example, of her initial defense of the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. In a standard political gambit, Mr. Kahan did not buy any significant time on the air, but by releasing the advertisement to reporters he produced newspaper stories that helped set the backdrop for today's announcement.
Ms. McCaughey Ross was repeatedly asked today to account for her shifting political loyalties. Asked to describe what kind of Democrat she was, Ms. McCaughey Ross responded: "I believe I'm the most socially progressive Democrat in the race. I'm unequivocally pro-choice. I've stood up for the rights of gays and lesbians. I've stood with tenants for rent protections."
But when she was then asked what kind of Republican she had been, Ms. McCaughey Ross appeared momentarily flustered. "You're dealing with labels, and I'm dealing with issues that are important to working families," she said.
At a news conference in Albany, Ms. McCaughey Ross disputed the suggestion by some Democratic leaders, including the state party chairwoman, Judith Hope, that she should perhaps pay some dues before seeking such a high office.
"I respect their concerns about paying dues and working my way through the Democratic Party," she said. "But you know, to most New Yorkers, if you ask them what it means to pay your dues, they think it means putting food on the table for your children, going to your children's P.T.A. meetings, making a contribution to the community. They don't think about it as running for one elective office after another."
Ms. McCaughey Ross for the most part avoided attacks on her opponents. But in a hint of what may lie ahead, she repeatedly linked the names of Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Pataki, as she asserted that it was the state's two most powerful Republicans who betrayed her.
"I've stayed true to the issues from the beginning," she said. "I was very impressed with the promises that the D'Amato-Pataki organization made four years ago. Unfortunately, there's a big difference between what they said and what they actually did."
Mr. Pataki's communications director, Zenia Mucha, said the Governor would not comment on any of his Democratic opponents until after the primary in September. As for Ms. McCaughey Ross's specific criticisms of Mr. Pataki's record, Ms. Mucha responded: "Look, irrational statements by irrational people warrant no comment."
Ms. McCaughey Ross went to some lengths today to distance herself from affiliation with any party. She talked in detail about health maintenance organizations that deny benefits to patients. She said her top priority would be passing legislation that would require insurance companies to pay for experimental treatments for diseases, a measure Mr. Pataki has opposed. She said that she would push for wider state funding of prekindergarten programs.
More than anything, though, she sought to frame her candidacy in historical terms, taking advantage of the fact that she would be the only woman in the race. Besides Mr. Vallone and Mr. Kahan, the other candidates are James L. Larocca, the former state Transportation Commissioner, and Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney.
Ms. McCaughey Ross filled her speeches with references to herself as a "working mom." She was introduced in New York City by Lois Shapiro-Canter, head of the New York branch of the National Organization for Women. The campaign leaflets listing her announcement in Albany -- which, like the one in New York, was sparsely attended -- declared: "Be a part of history!"
At the conclusion of her speech, she said, "I believe New Yorkers are ready to elect the first woman governor in New York State history."

HEADLINE: Better Pay vs. Job Stability in Wage Debate

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19

 BODY:
The Democrats today formally introduced President Clinton's plan to increase the minimum wage, drawing praise from unions but raising concerns even among supporters that the proposed new level, $6.15 an hour, might cost jobs.
With a ceremonial flourish, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the principal Congressional proponent of a higher minimum wage, introduced a bill to raise the minimum by 20 percent. That could be high enough, economists say, so that employers might decide to automate or to hire fewer but more skilled and more expensive workers. 
 Such an acknowledgment of a potential job loss is central to the debate over whether Congress should raise the minimum wage again, so soon after the last increase, in 1996. In 1996, most labor economists insisted that the higher minimum wage would not cost any jobs. It was an argument that carried the day, and it turned out to be true.
Now several of those same economists say $6.15 an hour may be close to some "tipping point" at which two or three minimum wage workers in a group of 100 may have trouble keeping a job or finding one. But such potential difficulties, the same economists say, are far outweighed by the financial gains for the 97 or 98 who get the raise and keep their jobs.
The Labor Secretary, Alexis M. Herman, acknowledged the new concern today, saying in an interview, "I want to put the emphasis on the gainers and not the few potential losers, if there were to be any."
The bill would raise the minimum to $5.65 an hour on Jan. 1, 1999, from the current level, $5.15, and to $6.15 on Jan. 1, 2000.
At a hearing on Capitol Hill, Mr. Kennedy avoided mentioning job loss. Instead, he and Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House Democratic whip, spoke of the need to pay a survival wage to the workers who care for "our aging parents and our children." Five such workers described their hardships.
Mr. Kennedy acknowledged the shift in the debate, saying in an interview: "I am not ready to grant the job loss argument. But it is an argument that needs serious evaluation."
In an election year, raising the minimum wage is a bread-and-butter issue. A majority of Americans favor increasing the minimum, according to polls, and that was a reason many Republicans voted for the increase in 1996. It raised the minimum to $4.75 on Oct. 1, 1996, from $4.25, then to $5.15 on Sept. 1, 1997. About 12 million people, or nearly 10 percent of the work force, are paid $6.15 an hour or less.
But the pros and cons of the debate are more complicated than in 1996. The $6.15 hourly wage, adjusted for inflation, would still be well below the inflation-adjusted minimum in the 1960's, but it would bring minimum wage workers closer to the wage level of more skilled workers than at any time since 1979.
The comparison point used by most economists is workers earning 10 percent below the median hourly wage, a group that in skills is clearly a step or two above those earning the minimum. By the year 2000, that group is likely to be making just over $10 an hour, and the $6.15 would be roughly 60 percent of this amount, about the same ratio as in 1979, says Jared Bernstein of the Economic Policy Institute.
Mr. Bernstein argues that closing the gap is all to the good, because it would help reduce the issue of wage inequality and help "insure that low-wage workers get a fairer share of the economic growth."
But other economists wonder whether the higher minimum would squeeze some unskilled Americans out of jobs, or make their search for jobs harder and longer. That question came up in the 1970's but has never been resolved. Two labor economists in particular have drawn attention to this concern: Alan Krueger of Princeton University and David Card of the University of California at Berkeley.
They were big advocates of raising the minimum in 1996, and they favor the bill introduced today on the ground that the pluses would faroutweigh the minuses. In a study several years ago centered on Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Mr. Krueger and Mr. Card had found that lifting the minimum, far from causing job loss, actually increased the employment of minimum wage-workers. That study played a featured role in passage of the 1996 bill.
Other economists argue that passing the tipping point can help the economy by forcing employers into efficiencies they can ignore when labor is relatively inexpensive. Even opponents of another increase in the minimum wage agree that employment would rise, with the minimum at $6.15 an hour, as long as the economy remains as strong as it is today.

Unemployment Rate Rises in New York

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The unemployment rates in New York City and the state continued to rise in February, state labor officials reported yesterday.
The statewide unemployment rate last month was 6.8 percent, up from 6.6 percent in January. It was lower than the 7.1 percent recorded in February 1997. 
 In the city, the unemployment rate of 9.2 percent in February was up from 8.9 percent in January, but down from 10.2 percent in February 1997. Outside New York City, the state's jobless rate held constant at 5.2 percent, the same as in January and in February 1997.
Officials noted that private-sector jobs throughout the state grew by 126,800, or 2 percent, between February 1997 and last month. That increase marks the third-highest year-to-year growth in more than a decade, officials of the State Labor Department said.
Stephen Kagann, the state's chief economist, said the latest data demonstrate "more of the same, solid, reliable job growth that has been occurring in recent months, only better."
Mr. Kagann said that upstate New York is showing a continued strength in durable goods manufacturing. Downstate, job growth has been fueled by retailing and business services along with finance and tourism, he said.
But New York's jobless rate was still well above the national unemployment level of 5.0 percent, down by 0.2 percentage points since January.

HEADLINE: Rowland Asks $350 Million In Aid to Rebuild Hartford

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, March 19

 BODY:
In a step toward delivering on the urban agenda he promised two years ago, Gov. John G. Rowland today proposed a $350 million package to revive downtown Hartford.
The proposal calls for the largest package of state money to any Connecticut city in a series of urban development projects that Mr. Rowland has announced over the last year. It comes as leaders of this beleaguered capital, which was the nation's fastest shrinking city in the early 1990's, contend that it is about to turn the corner on its economic problems and begin a renaissance. 
 Although downtown Hartford still lacks amenities like supermarkets, commercial movie theaters and department stores, the Governor and top business executives today painted a picture of hundreds of middle-class professionals and college students flocking there, ending the area's reputation as a business district that is often empty after 5 P.M.
Mr. Rowland, a Republican, released a report that pinpointed six projects that would serve as a blueprint for downtown's growth. The projects would use state money to attract Federal, city and private money for a total of $1.3 billion in development money.
"It is now Hartford's time," Mr. Rowland said. "The city has been stagnant too long. Companies are hiring again. We're going to take this opportunity and run with it."
The proposal, which depends on the State Legislature for approval, was developed by an eight-person advisory committee of Mr. Rowland's aides, top business executives and civic leaders. It calls for the following projects:
*$50 million for a higher education center that would move two community college campuses to downtown and would provide space to a consortium of local universities for graduate programs;
*$155 million for a convention center and sports megaplex, which might include a domed stadium for college football and other events;
*$105 million to improve parking and to develop 1,000 housing units in the downtown area, which currently has little residential space;
*$25 million to encourage improvements in the downtown area bordering the Connecticut River;
*$15 million to spruce up the Hartford Civic Center, a complex that includes a 15,000-seat arena and a food and shopping complex.
Mr. Rowland first highlighted the importance of revitalizing the state's cities in his 1996 budget address, but he did not immediately take action. At the time, the mayors of several Connecticut cities wondered whether his talk of an urban agenda was more political posturing than a serious commitment.
In the last year, as the state's economy has rebounded and its coffers have grown, Mr. Rowland has established redevelopment projects in Bridgeport, New Haven, Waterbury and New London.
The proposal for Hartford is not entirely new. There has been talk of a convention center for months. The effort to improve the riverfront has been going on for a few years.
What sets apart today's announcement is that for the first time all of the projects have been rolled together into one blueprint.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
Simply Living His Life, Trying to Be Honest And Solve Some Crimes

BYLINE: By WILL JOYNER 

 BODY:
One of the many strengths of Walter Mosley's mystery novels is that his hero, Easy Rawlins, is an anti-detective, negotiating the blind alleys and smoky back rooms of Los Angeles not so much as a solver of cases but as an illuminator of the moral ambiguities of the post-World War II era. Socrates Fortlow, the primary character in a collection of Mosley short stories, follows a similar path across the burned-out, paved-over landscape of contemporary South-Central Los Angeles, but in the film "Always Outnumbered," he's portrayed in such compelling fashion by Laurence Fishburne that he becomes something other than just an Easy Rawlins for a less romantic time.
The movie, which will have its premiere on HBO tonight at 9, was directed by Michael Apted ("Coal Miner's Daughter," "Gorillas in the Mist") from a mostly eloquent screenplay by Mr. Mosley. Its cast also includes notables like Bill Cobbs, Natalie Cole, Laurie Metcalf, Bill Nunn and Cicely Tyson. It has the assured feel of a project on which everyone was working from the same page, with a common degree of commitment, and that's some accomplishment given that the narrative is driven by a series of ethically charged situations rather than one clear-cut plot. 
 Socrates is an intensely focused, physically imposing ex-convict who awakes each morning, carefully tends to the maintenance of the hovel in which he lives alone, then sets out after that almost impossible dream known as an honest living. This means he collects bottles and soda cans to redeem for a few dollars while fruitlessly applying for supermarket jobs. Along the way, he nurses his identity by confronting petty managers with an angry articulateness and by standing up for, and advising, an assortment of characters less able than he -- most prominently, Right Burke (Mr. Cobbs), an ailing pensioner; Lula (Ms. Cole), who serves food out of the shell of a school bus; Darryl (Daniel Williams), a wayward boy who has witnessed a murder, and Howard and Corina (Mr. Nunn and Brigid Coulter), an ambitious couple whose marriage is being ruined by unemployment.
In less skillful hands, the situations presented by these secondary characters would be dominated by liberal bromides or predictable acts of vigilantism. While there are small examples of each of these pitfalls, "Always Outnumbered" for the most part is surprising in the ways that it resolves its moral predicaments or allows them to remain unresolved.
As the viewer is regularly reminded through grisly flashbacks, Socrates is a man who was convicted of manslaughter and must, above all, try to decipher his own flawed nature, not only society's. (Much is made of the name he has been saddled with, in a wry, self-debunking manner.) Mr. Fishburne is uncanny in his ability to come across both as a real, all-too-troubled person and as a larger-than-life presence whose observations, however homespun, are stabs at truth. After Socrates catches Darryl in the act of stealing and killing a chicken, for example, he rather brutally forces the boy to pluck and dismember the body, but then also gives a lesson in how to cook a nourishing meal. "A boy should be hungry," Socrates says. "It means something's missing. And hungry tells you what it is."
Although "Always Outnumbered" wanders across a range of contemporary social concerns by intention, it is fortunate that the film is integrated not only by Mr. Fishburne's fine performance but also by a voice-over, in Mr. Cobbs's deep, jazzy bass, that reflects on Socrates's odd place in the world. "Rich men would never have that power," the older man says of Socrates's attempt to lead a loving, dignified life. "And precious few lovers would be that satisfied."

The Cultural Revolution

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: BEIJING

 BODY:
China may soon let out a few dissidents to appease the U.S. before President Clinton's June visit. This should be taken with a grain of salt, because more dissidents can just be arrested. Fortunately, though, the dissidents are not the only agents of change here. In fact, they aren't even the most important ones. The most important ones are those whom the Government doesn't know, and can't arrest, but who represent powerful trends that, over time, will force the Chinese Government to either loosen its grip or risk instability.
Xu Guilan is a 56-year-old schoolteacher from Heng Dao. In her village, like others, you find many successful peasant farmers' families living in three attached houses: The first is a small mud-brick hovel where the family lived under Mao, the second is a larger red-brick structure, built under Deng Xiaoping, and the third is a white-brick home with painted tiles around the front door, built in the Jiang Zemin era. 
 "Because of Deng Xiaoping we are getting richer," Mrs. Xu explained. "Both my sons work in the town now, one in a bank, one as a teacher. The big change for my family is that we have a color TV. My mother died 10 years ago. She liked to watch TV. If only she had lived 10 more years, she would have seen the color TV."
There are millions of Xu Guilans in China today. As long as the economy soars, the Government can get away with just liberalizing the economics and not politics. But sooner or later this economy will slow. There will be pain. That's when China will need a government that is legitimate and can say to its people, "We're all in this together," and will allow people to let off steam. Democratization is critical for managing the down cycles. God help Beijing if Mrs. Xu's sons lose their jobs in the town and have to return to the village. They'll be as dangerous as dissidents.
Zhu Zhuohong is the village chief of Zhen Zi, a fishing village. He won re-election with pure pork-barrel politics. Using income from the town's factory, which processes seaweed and scallops, he was able to pave the road into the village, build a new village center, set up a kindergarten, remodel the school, get tap water into everyone's home and provide a stipend for everyone over age 60. "Almost 95 percent of the money for these projects comes from the sea," he said, referring to the town's profitable fishery.
Well, the longer Mr. Zhu gets 95 percent of his income from the sea and 5 percent from Beijing the more independent he becomes from Beijing. That is the beginning of decentralization, and it's going on in villages all over China.
Wang Hongzhe is a 49-year-old farmer in the village of Hou Shi. His house is small, but he has a stereo and television. I asked him if he wouldn't like a telephone. "You only need a phone if you're going to be a leader," he said. "But I hope I will have one in five years, after my son gets married." Every Chinese villager we met had a television -- which is one-way communication from the Government to the people. But many, like Mr. Wang, would like phones and are getting them. Phones are two-way communications -- from people to people. When China's 900 million villagers get phones, and start calling each other, this will inevitably become a more open country.
Lastly, there is my friend's cook. His salary is $200 a month. And every morning before work he goes down to the Beijing stock exchange to buy and sell stocks. Some 25 million Chinese now own stock. The Chinese stock markets are poorly regulated and casino-like. Unless the Government installs some real regulatory systems, one day they are going to crash. The biggest urban riots in China in the past few years have been led by disgruntled stockholders.
These four people, and the trends they embody, are dots on the Chinese landscape -- dots that will create pressure for a more open, law-based society. They raise two questions: When will a Chinese leader decide that to maintain the stability of China he has to connect these dots with lines that constitute a framework for democratic transition? And even if someone connects the dots, and makes a framework for a more democratic China, who will fill in the contents?
Ultimately, you can't have democracy without democrats. But where will they come from? One of the most striking things about China today is the ideological vacuum left by the death of Communism. Some Chinese are trying to turn to religion or superstition; others opt for the most crass, unrestrained materialism. Talk of making money is everywhere (partly because that's all people are allowed to talk about). China also never had a British colonial administration, a la India or Hong Kong, or American neocolonialism, a la Japan and South Korea, that could leave behind an elite and a bureaucracy steeped in liberal constitutionalism.
China has gone from Mao to Milken, without ever stopping at Madison. That's going to be a problem.

Lazard Is Overtaken At Open Pairs

BYLINE: By Alan Truscott 

DATELINE: RENO, March 20

 BODY:
For 3,000 players, today is the start of the American Contract Bridge League's Spring National Championships, which will last for 10 days. But for 56 players, it is the end of the North American Open Pair Championship, which began at the local level in the fall. The winners, in a close finish Thursday night, were Ron Sukoneck of Annandale, Va., and Bill Cole of Beltsville, Md.
The standings were: Sukoneck and Cole, 407.37 match points; Marshall Tuly and James Cunningham, 397.32; Roger McNay and Troy Horton, 394.84; Steve Cohen and Beverly Rosenberg, 390.05. 
Leading into the final two sessions were Sidney Lazard Sr. and Iype Koshy, both of New Orleans, but they suffered a setback on the diagramed deal against Henry Lortz and Wyen Ohlrich of Seattle. Four spades was bid and made at many tables. But in third seat, Lazard opened four diamonds, which was a transfer to hearts. Now Koshy had to suffer in four hearts and received a spade lead. He is sure to lose one diamond trick, and the contract hinges on the number of trump losers.
He won in dummy with the ace and led a low trump. This was inferior to the lead of the king or queen, but the result should have been the same. It would have been all over if East had played low, allowing his partner to score the ten, but he put up the jack, fearing that South held the ten.
But the defense still had a winning path, and they found it. East played a second spade, won in dummy. He ducked when the heart king was led, but captured the queen on the next round. Then he underled his diamonds, and West was able to win and give his partner the crucial spade ruff. That proved to be the only plus score for East-West.
Peter Mallela, a retired professor of economics at Northern Illinois University, was kibitzing and noted an elegant communications-cutting play maneuver that the players had overlooked. If South plays a diamond at the second trick, removing West's diamond entry before he can make good use of it, he cannot be defeated, provided he plays the king and queen of hearts to kill the ten. The defense will be limited to one diamond and two trump tricks. This was one of the rare occasions in which "the onlooker sees most of the game."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
The Dow Tops 8,900 to End Solid Week

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Investors paid some attention to bad news yesterday, but not much.
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index each rose to their fifth consecutive records. Technology shares, however, faltered amid new alerts about quarterly earnings. 
 The Dow average rose 103.38 points, or 1.17 percent, to 8,906.43, its first close above 8,900. The S.& P. 500 gained 9.42 points, to 1,099.16.
Volume was extremely heavy, partly because of increased trading from the expiration of options and futures. More than 717.3 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the fourth-highest level this year and the seventh highest ever.
Investors "just don't want to quit," said Alan Ackerman, a senior vice president and market strategist at Fahnestock & Company. "Many stock buyers believe that 1998 may be the third consecutive year for 20 percent-plus gains despite a slowing corporate earnings outlook."
The Dow average finished the week with a gain of 303.91 points, or almost 4 percent. The S.& P. 500 ended the week with a gain of 30.57 points, up almost 3 percent.
The Dow set five consecutive daily records in several weeks during the last few years, said David Stevens, an analyst at Birinyi Associates, an equity research firm in Greenwich, Conn. The last time was the week that began June 9, 1997. Other such gains came in November and February 1996, May 1995 and in two consecutive weeks that ended Jan. 16, 1987, Mr. Stevens said.
But after those record-breaking runs, the Dow settled into a less sanguine mode. On average, in the weeks after such gains, the Dow was "generally neutral with a positive bias," Mr. Stevens said.
Ending two consecutive days of setting records, the Nasdaq composite index fell 10.82 points, to 1,789.16. Although it finished lower yesterday, the Nasdaq composite index was up 17.5 points, or 1 percent, for the week.
Contributing to the malaise in technology, Dallas Semiconductor fell more than 10 percent. Investors were reacting to disclosures by the company, a chip manufacturer, that first-quarter earnings and revenue would fall short of expectations because of weak demand in Asia.
The warning, announced after the market closed on Thursday, helped drag down other semiconductor shares yesterday, including Intel and Micron Technology. The announcement was the latest in a round of warnings from technology companies and others about unexpectedly weak earnings this quarter.
Jabil Circuit and Arrow Electronics both warned investors this week that profits would be disappointing. Also, Sunbeam and Rockwell International said that profits could fall short of forecasts.
"The semiconductor group keeps blowing up," said Steven Milunovich, a computer analyst at Merrill Lynch. "I think there's been surprise among investors that the stocks have held up as well as they have."
The worst may not be over for technology investors, Mr. Milunovich said. "I believe there are more" companies that will warn of disappointments before the quarterly earnings reporting period begins in late April, he said.
Despite the declines in technology issues, investor optimism buoyed oil, financial and telecommunications stocks, which provided the lift for the Dow and the S.& P.
While oil prices ended little changed yesterday, investors were encouraged by the price rebound this week from nine-year lows as expectations grew that further declines were unlikely.
"The stocks are telling you the price is not going to stay low," said Andrew M. Brooks, vice president in charge of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates.
Mobil led oil stocks higher. Others that gained included Chevron, British Petroleum, Exxon, Royal Dutch/ Shell and Amoco.
Investor optimism was also reflected in the broader market's gains.
"Cash flow, the economy, Asia is covered," Mr. Brooks said. "Put whatever spin you want on it. People are believers."

Treasury Prices Up a Bit
 (Bloomberg News) -- The prices of Treasury securities rose slightly yesterday amid optimism that inflation would not accelerate soon, even as the economy grows at a brisk pace.
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 4/32, or $1.25 for a $1,000 bond, to 103 13/32, yielding 5.88 percent, down from 5.89 on Thursday.
Bonds also got a lift as the dollar rose against the German mark amid expectations that German interest rates will not rise, traders said. Higher German rates would tend to draw international investment to mark-denominated securities.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, at 5.56 percent, is 69 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, higher than the 4.87 percent yield on the benchmark German 10-year bond.
This week's favorable news about inflation also helped Treasury securities. The Government said on Thursday that consumer prices rose just one-tenth of a percent last month, and only three-tenths of a percent, excluding food and energy. For the 12 months through February, prices rose 1.4 percent -- the slowest pace since 1986.

Defying Pressure, Tokyo Scrimps on Budget

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 20

 BODY:
Japan's lower house of Parliament passed the nation's budget today, approving a $600 billion plan that could squeeze money out of the economy just as it is careening toward recession.
But the approval today also creates a basis for politicians to discuss more openly their long-awaited plans to spend more money to strengthen the economy, which forecasters say is likely to record its worst annual performance in nearly a quarter-century when the fiscal year ends this month. Despite criticism from the United States and other countries, Japan has insisted on tightening its fiscal belt. 
 Now that the budget has passed, officials will be more free to push for a supplementary budget that presumably will include stimulants. There is still uncertainty, however, whether the stimulants can revive Japan's economy, bolster the rest of Asia and deflect complaints from the United States.
The budget passed today symbolizes the austerity that has so antagonized the United States. Recent data show that prices, wages and corporate profits are declining, that business confidence is at a record low and that the economy is expected to register near-zero growth, or possibly shrink, this fiscal year.
Many economists say Japan must spend more on the economy or offer tax cuts to encourage consumers or corporations to spend more. But Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and other senior leaders have at least created the impression that they are dithering and say that drastic measures are inappropriate.
"It may look like we are taking a long time, but the economy is a living creature, and it is complex," Taku Yamasaki, the top policy maker in the governing Liberal Democratic Party, said in an interview today. "We have to be cautious."
"Even if you remove the cancer cells in an operation, it would be no use if the patient dies," Mr. Yamasaki said. "If people judge that this doctor cannot cure the illness, then they can change the doctor, which is currently the Hashimoto administration."
Mr. Yamasaki, however, also said any change in the administration could damage the economy by creating a "political vacuum."
The budget is slightly larger than the budget for the previous year, but in fact, the budget will be a force for contraction, withdrawing as much as $30 billion from the economy, according to several economists.
The tightening, for instance, might be felt immediately by construction companies, which may see their orders for new projects drop, as the Government's spending on public works declines by 7.8 percent from the previous year. Such a decline siphons funds from the economy.
That makes the supplementary budget more important, but it could not be openly debated until now. A draft of stimulus measures, anticipated next week, is expected to include spending of perhaps $78 billion, or about 2 percent of the nation's economic output. Even this may not be enough, however.
Economists are concerned that the package will include loans and other items that represent about half of the $78 billion total but do not actually inject money into the economy. That would mean the supplementary budget might add only $30 billion to $40 billion.
"First they pass the initial budget, which takes money out of the economy, and then they pass a supplementary budget that puts it in," said Jeffrey D. Young, head economist in Japan at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. "It all adds up to a neutral stance."
The bulk of the spending is expected to go into infrastructure projects in telecommunications, like fiber optic cables. But other projects could include a national sewage system, homes for the aged, and programs for industrial waste, education and the multimedia industry.

HEADLINE: Geography Redux: Where You Live Is What You Are

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN 

 BODY:
Pick up a geography textbook from the first half of this century and you can discover a simple rule-of-thumb explanation for the varying fates of the human race: the weather.
"As a rule, people do their best thinking and planning, their minds are most alert and inventive, and they have the best judgment when the thermometer out of doors falls toward freezing at night and rises toward 50 degrees or 55 degrees by day," declares Ellsworth Huntington in "Principles of Human Geography." "In an invigorating climate" -- like that of Europe and the northern United States -- "it may also be easier to be honest and sober and self-controlled than in a more enervating one." 
 Such pronouncements ultimately made geographers seem like phrenologists who pondered the size of bumps on a person's skull. Most serious scholars shunted geography aside and forgot it.
Yet after decades of neglect, geography is being rediscovered. The study of how location affects the way people live is not only drawing in new students, it is also attracting the attention of scholars in other fields. Historians, economists and political scientists are using it to explain everything from why some nations are rich and others poor, to why Brazil and Nigeria are rising as regional powers, to why Africa produces so many superior distance runners. It's as if New York City real estate agents were suddenly given the job of explaining some of the globe's most elusive questions and chorused: Location, location, location.
The geographic renaissance, propelled in part by new advances in science and computers, is significant, scholars say, because it is generating a new intellectual dialogue. "It is a wonderful bridge among disciplines," David Landes, professor emeritus of history and economics at Harvard University, said in an interview. "It compels people to put together ideas they might not otherwise."
Most unexpected, however, is that the very field that had a racialist taint is now being used to knock down theories that define achievement in racial terms. Geography, once employed to justify colonialism and the innate superiority of whites, is brought in to undermine works like "The Bell Curve," which argues that racial differences in intelligence are inherited and linked to differences in performance and economic success.
The gradual eclipse of geography began 50 years ago when Harvard University eliminated its geography department. The decision had less to do with discomfort over screwball theories (which weren't necessarily seen at the time as screwball) than with academic infighting and weak teaching. "Geography is not a university subject," declared James B. Conant, who was then the president of Harvard.
In the next decades, other universities followed Harvard's lead: Stanford, Yale, the University of Michigan, Columbia, the University of Chicago. According to a report in the Chronicle of Higher Education on the 1987 meeting of the Association of American Geographers, department chairmen organized a seminar "to find out what they could do to avoid finding their departments on a university hit list."
Saul Cohen, a political geographer and former president of the geographers' association, says: "Very few people were exposed to geography who went to college after the 1960's. What they knew about it goes back a half century."
 
Quietly Wiped Out As a Discipline
French historians like Fernand Braudel and other members of the Annales school did look at geography, climate and land use. But in the United States, said Mr. Landes, geography was "a kind of outcast among intellectual disciplines." He continued: "More than any other field I can think of, geography was wiped out kind of quietly. I can't think of another discipline that suffered this sort of erasure."
Geography was fine if you worked at Rand McNally or played Jeopardy (Moroni. What is the capital of Comoros?). But when American scholars tackled persistent questions like why industrialization first took root in Europe instead of China or India, geography was played down. "If you look at most works on global development," Mr. Landes says, "there is very little on geography."
That has been changing. Jared Diamond, a physiologist at the University of California at Los Angeles, combines epidemiology, sociology, zoology, anthropology and botany to conclude that geography is the key to the pace and timing of economic development.
In his book "Guns, Germs and Steel" (W.W. Norton, 1997) he goes back 13,000 years to explain how food production is the starting point for success. Because farming communities produce more food and domesticate animals, they can feed non-food producers like professional soldiers, bureaucrats, writers and craftsmen.
Mr. Diamond argues that the east-west axis of Eurasia's land mass meant a shared latitude and similar growing conditions, which enabled one of the first domesticated crops, einkorn wheat, to spread relatively quickly from the Fertile Crescent to Europe; more than twice as fast, for example, as corn and beans spread from Mexico northward to what would become the eastern United States.
Fewer ecological barriers like mountains also made it much easier for livestock and, eventually, writing, the wheel and other inventions to spread than in the Americas or Africa, which both have a north-south axis. For example, cattle, sheep and goats, first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent, stopped short for 2,000 years at the northern edge of the Serengeti Plains, with their deadly, disease-carrying tsetse flies. And of the 14 large mammals domesticated before the 20th century, Eurasia had 13 of them, including sheep, goats, cows and horses, which provided meat, fertilizer, wool, leather, transport, plowing power and military assault vehicles.
Domesticated animals also served as the petri dish for nasty epidemics like smallpox and measles to which Europeans over time developed immunity. So when the Europeans arrived in the New World, up to 99 percent of the unexposed native populations were killed -- instead of the reverse. It wasn't virtuosity but viruses that helped paved the way for conquest.
 
Setting the Stage For Growth
Building on Max Weber's "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism," Mr. Landes believes that Western culture based on Judeo-Christian and Enlightenment values is the single most important reason for the West's economic success. Still, maintaining that geography is "terribly important," he has titled the first chapter of his new book, "The Wealth and Poverty of Nations" (W. W. Norton, 1998) "Nature's Inequalities," and describes how a nation's geography -- its rainfall, its suitability for food production, its indigenous animals and the deadliness of its pathogens -- helps set the stage for economic success.
Europe was lucky. He, too, argues that the temperate climate and relatively even rainfall, a gift from the Gulf Stream, allowed Europeans to grow crops all year round. In addition to the other advantages, larger and stronger animals like the European battle steed instead of the Mongolian pony provided richer fertilizer than, say, the human night soil used in East Asia.
 
A Great Windfall Of Gold and Silver
James Blaut, who wrote "The Colonizer's Model of the World: Geographic Diffusionism and Eurocentric History" (Guilford Press, 1993), also takes a geographical tack, but comes to a completely different conclusion. He declares Europeans got rich because they were closest to the Americas and able to plunder it first.
In the 16th century, says Mr. Blaut, who teaches at the University of Illinois at Chicago, other maritime societies like those of "the Chinese, the Indians, and the East Africans were at the same level of development, but the Europeans were much, much closer to the New World."
Through a combination of looting and mining, the amount of gold and silver in circulation probably doubled between the years 1500 and 1600, says Mr. Blaut, and Europe got it all free. That tremendous windfall meant that the emerging middle class could buy off the ruling land-owning powers, enabling capitalism to take root and allowing the Europeans to outcompete Asia and East Africa. A shorter commute made all the difference.
Geography's sudden comeback is due in part to technological advances. Sophisticated mapping computers known as geographical information systems have generated new research areas for freshly minted geographers and raised the discipline's profile. A report last year by the National Research Council estimated that the number of undergraduate geography majors increased by 47 percent between 1986 and 1994. At the same time, advances in molecular biology, radiocarbon dating and archeology are providing new information about where cultivated crops, domesticated animals and diseases originated and where they spread. And economists are exploring statistical correlations between such things as poverty and distance from the equator.
Geography also complements the turn to interdisciplinary studies that is catching on at universities across the country. "Geography is the integrating field par excellence." Mr. Blaut observed.
Another trend has coincided with geography's comeback: using genetics to explain behavior. Geography provides a new wrinkle to the nature vs. nurture, or biology vs.culture debate. Some scholars are using geography to help provide a counterweight to what they see as a crude biological determinism implying, for example, that Europeans won out because of some inbred superiority.
In his introduction, Mr. Diamond offers this one-sentence summary of his 480-page book: "History followed different courses for different people because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among people themselves." At its publication, "Guns, Germs and Steel" was praised for rebutting "racist theories" of history.
 
The Making Of Marathoners
Historical questions aren't the only ones that have enlisted geography to balance genetic explanations. The Swedish physiologist Bengt Saltin, for example, has studied Kenyan distance runners to find why so many excel at the sport. He found they have a muscle composition similar to that of Nordic athletes who train in similar conditions, at high altitudes and in hilly regions, according to a recent article in the New Yorker. Geography may be the critical variable, not genes.
With all the new attention on geography, some scholars warn against crediting it with too much. "I think there are societies in which geography is very formative and times when it's not," says the economic historian Robert Heilbroner. "I wouldn't make it a very high priority."
So geography is not destiny any more than genetics or culture is. But after years of neglect, it offers a useful reminder: Location matters.

HEADLINE: Boeing to Cut 8,200 Jobs By Year 2000

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company said yesterday that it would eliminate 8,200 jobs by the turn of the century as it consolidates its North American operations in the wake of two recent multibillion-dollar acquisitions that have transformed it into the world's largest military and civilian aerospace company.
More than two-thirds of the cuts, or 6,200 jobs, will be in Southern California at the operations of the former McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which Boeing bought for $16.3 billion last year. An additional 1,700 jobs will be eliminated at Boeing operations in Philadelphia and Toronto, with additional, smaller cuts around the United States. But Illinois and Texas will see the creation of 550 new jobs as a result of the reorganization. 
 The cuts are in addition to 12,000 jobs Boeing previously said it would begin eliminating this year at its civilian airplane division in the Seattle area.
Investors and Wall Street analysts were pleasantly surprised by yesterday's announcement because Boeing said that it would not take a charge against earnings to cover the cost of the cuts, something many analysts had assumed. Boeing shares rose $2 yesterday, closing at $53.4375 on the New York Stock Exchange.
But yesterday's news also came at a time when a number of analysts are predicting that Boeing will fall short of its plan to deliver 115 commercial jets in the quarter ending this month, a sign that the company may not be as close as it says it is to overcoming production problems that have plagued it since last fall. Those difficulties resulted in the announcement of $2.6 billion in charges and the company's first annual loss in 50 years.
Since it acquired McDonnell Douglas and the aerospace and military operations of Rockwell International, Boeing now makes not only the 747 jumbo jet and other commercial airliners, but also the space shuttle, the F/A-18 fighter plane, Delta rockets and more. The new job cuts will result from an attempt to streamline these disparate operations and deliver the $1 billion in savings that the company said would result from the acquisitions. By consolidating various operations, Boeing hopes to shed 18 million square feet of real estate by 2000.
The company said it was difficult to tell how many of the jobs would be eliminated by layoffs rather than attrition.
Most of the jobs that will be eliminated do not involve production lines of airplanes for which Boeing has had bottlenecks. The bulk of the cuts in California will result from Boeing's previously announced decision to stop producing the MD-80 and MD-90 jets, which it inherited from McDonnell Douglas, next year.
News of the cuts comes on the heels of the loss of thousands of other jobs in California as a result of cutbacks by the Raytheon Corporation and of the acquisition of H. F. Ahmanson & Company by Washington Mutual Inc., two of the largest savings and loans in the region. But California's economy has recovered strongly from a deep recession in the early 90's and is now producing new jobs at a rate of 105,000 a month, according to Jack Kyser, the chief economist at the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles County.
"Announcements like these are never good news," he said. "But the irony is that our high-tech sector has been growing recently."
Boeing will continue to assemble the new 100-seat 717 jet, formerly the MD-95, in Long Beach and has said it will also continue to produce the wide-body MD-11 there as well, if it can drum up enough orders. A Boeing statement said the company would have "a clearer picture" of the plane's future later this year.
"Right now we are only building one a month," said Larry McCracken, a Boeing spokesman. "We are going to need to do better than that."
Stopping production of the MD-11 would probably result in the loss of another 3,000 jobs in California and 1,900 in Toronto, where the plane's wings are made.
Meanwhile, Boeing is still struggling to overcome its production problems. A spokeswoman for Southwest Airlines said Boeing notified it about two weeks ago that delivery of one of the three new 737's it promised to provide in March would slip into April. Production of the planes, which Boeing calls the 737 Next Generation, has been backed up by parts shortages and design changes requested by American and European regulators. Several planes are sitting outside a plant near Seattle waiting to be completed.
Boeing delivered only 61 planes in January and February. That means 54 planes must be delivered in March for the company to meet its estimate.
"It is going to be a real push," said Byron K. Callan, an aerospace analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. Missing the target would send yet another negative signal to Wall Street, he added. "You have investors who would like to see them overshoot what they have been promising rather than undershoot it."
A Boeing spokesman said the company often rushed to meet production at the end of the quarter. The company plans to discuss the status of its production problems during a monthly conference call on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Taking the Pope's Cue on Cuba

 BODY:
The Helms-Burton law limits President Clinton's power to modify the American economic embargo on Cuba. But yesterday Mr. Clinton made good use of his executive authority to help religious and charitable groups, as well as Cuban-Americans, deliver more humanitarian aid to Cuba's people. Any easing of the outdated and increasingly counterproductive embargo is welcome, especially in humanitarian areas. Relief from abroad helps the independent sectors emerging in Cuban society distance themselves from the Castro Government.
The President's actions restore charter relief flights, simplify licensing for donations of medicine and medical devices and permit Cubans here to send up to $1,200 a year to relatives on the island. They come in direct response to Pope John Paul II's January visit to Cuba. The Pontiff, while deploring Communist tyranny and Cuban restrictions on Catholicism, condemned the American embargo for reinforcing the harmful isolation of the Cuban people. Yesterday's moves are designed to help the Catholic Church ease that isolation by making it easier and cheaper for Catholic relief agencies and other organizations to dispense humanitarian assistance to Cuba. 
 The steps the Administration has taken are modest. They simply restore humanitarian provisions that were in effect when Mr. Clinton took office but were later suspended in response to Cuban actions. Yet partisans of the embargo condemned the restoration of these provisions as an unwarranted favor to Fidel Castro. But a bipartisan group of lawmakers would take the further, useful step of allowing American companies to sell food and medicine to Cuba.
There is at last positive movement in America's Cuba policy, spurred by the Pope's pilgrimage. Barring fresh provocations by Havana, the Administration and Congress should look for further ways to ease the embargo. That would help people in need and encourage forces trying to promote political change within Cuba.

HEADLINE: G.M. Pulls Out the Stops in Fight for Market Share

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 20

 BODY:
Surf through prime time television and you can count on many shows having one thing in common: they'll be interrupted by a lot of advertisements for General Motors' cars and trucks.
The company is trying to reverse a sharp decline in its market share this year and is hoping the onslaught of ads, some offering fresh rebates and heavily discounted financing, will lure buyers. 
 But as G.M. tries to improve sales, Wall Street is beginning to question whether the company's goal of expanding is merely wishful thinking. G.M. could have trouble even holding its current slice of the market if it suffers strikes this year, an increasing possibility with tensions now rising at several G.M. factories.
"It is going to get harder and harder and harder to rationalize this decline in market share," said Maryann N. Keller, an auto analyst at Furman Selz L.L.C., a New York investment banking and brokerage firm. G.M. ended the year with 31.3 percent of the car and truck market in the United States, down from 31.5 percent in 1996. In February, its share slid to 28.7 percent, a near-record low for a company that in its heyday in 1962 sold 51 percent of all new cars and trucks on American roads.
After February's dismal sales results, G.M. seems to be at a crossroads of sorts, having watched its market share slip below the psychological barrier of 30 percent. At issue is a simple question: Is the nation's largest company destined to shrink permanently? And if G.M. cannot manage to turn itself around and grow in today's strong economy, are its workers -- and its profits -- in jeopardy in the long run? The company's factories have the capacity to build about 33 percent of the nation's cars and trucks, considerably more than G.M. is now selling.
Executives insist the company will reverse course. "We fully expect our share to get better," said Ronald L. Zarrella, a vice president in charge of G.M.'s sales, service and marketing group. "We think we can still make money and still improve our share." G.M.'s lost sales have been picked up by a number of other auto makers: the Chrysler Corporation, foreign auto makers selling popular sport utility vehicles and Korean auto makers offering heavy discounts on their small cars have all benefited.
G.M.'s sales have been pulled down in part by the maker's many entries in the weak small-car market, so G.M. has increased discounts. "We can't lose any more share in small cars," Mr. Zarrella vowed.
Several G.M. divisions have recently scrambled to increase their sagging sales. Chevrolet executives rushed to market last week with heavily discounted financing rates and on Monday began heavy advertisements, instead of waiting until April for both as planned. "We thought it was time to get more aggressive," said John G. Middlebrook, general manager of the Chevrolet division. "We've got to tell people we've got the deals."
G.M.'s Pontiac/GMC division did the same. Oldsmobile this month is promoting interest rates as low as 1.9 percent. Buick added rebates for two models in March. Saturn began in mid-February to offer leases as low as $129 a month.
G.M. said it increased its overall ad spending in March compared with February, heavily advertising during the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament and highlighting G.M. vehicles during nearly every commercial break in the USA network's hit movie this week, "Moby Dick." Nielsen Media Research said network television advertisements from G.M. and all of its divisions reached 910.6 million households during the first week of March, the most recent period available, up 25.6 percent from the corresponding period a year ago.
Even if the advertising and discounting onslaught help the company's sales this month, workers are worried about whether G.M. can keep it up. Even at Saturn, which can normally be counted on for labor peace, there was turmoil early this month.
G.M. is facing labor strife elsewhere. Workers at three parts factories in Michigan have authorized strikes unless negotiators can resolve their concerns. A strike at one of the factories, a metal fabricating plant in Grand Blanc, Mich., would halt production of most Cadillacs. A strike at a metal factory in Flint, Mich., would halt production of G.M.'s mini-vans and five large cars. G.M. refused to disclose what production would be halted by the potential strike at its Delphi subsidiary in Flint, Mich.
Last week, the head of G.M.'s North American operations, G. Richard Wagoner Jr., told Wall Street the company could face strikes soon because of the labor tensions, according to some auto analysts. G.M. disputed that account.
A G.M. spokesman said G.M. was facing labor troubles when the union was at peace with other auto companies because many of G.M.'s factories remained less efficient than the competition's. "We clearly have the greatest competitive gap to close and therefore we have some issues," said William J. O'Neill, executive director for G.M.'s North American communications.
So far, investors have not penalized G.M., despite its poor sales this year. In fact, G.M.'s stock has risen more than 20 percent this year, hitting a high two weeks ago of $74.25 and since trading down slightly to close yesterday at $70.8125, up 75 cents.
G.M. insists that it will soon grow again. Michael C. DiGiovanni, G.M.'s director of market research and forecasting, points to the 20 new cars and trucks the company plans to introduce in the next 18 months as reasons for optimism.
But G.M. has used that argument before. Two years ago, G.M. promised that it would halt its decades-long decline by replacing its least popular cars with new models -- 16 in the last 18 months. It pleaded with shareholders to be patient, and said G.M.'s market share would increase as soon as the new models had a chance to catch on.
Investors have been waiting, and waiting. But last year, after the new models finally reached the market, G.M.'s share edged down anyway.

HEADLINE: Head of Financial Control Board for District of Columbia Resigns Under Fire

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
After months of public criticism about his management style, Andrew F. Brimmer said today that he would step down in June as chairman of the control board that has restored the financial stability of the District of Columbia over the last three years.
Mr. Brimmer, 71, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board, notified President Clinton of his decision in a letter, saying that, despite improvements throughout the city government, "the end of my term in June is the appropriate time" to leave. 
 "I indicated exactly the areas I was asked to concentrate on, finances and budget," Mr. Brimmer said of his one-page letter at an afternoon news conference. "I worked hard at it, and I'm very pleased. If you assess the city, it not only has turned the corner, but it has made genuine progress."
Congress created the control board in 1995 in response to the city's growing deficit and mounting problems with delivering services. President Clinton appointed its five members and named Mr. Brimmer chairman for his long and distinguished career as an economist.
But the timing of Mr. Brimmer's announcement today reflected the bumpiness of progress in Washington under the control board's direction. Mr. Brimmer told reporters that he had first broached the subject of his departure several months ago with Franklin D. Raines, the Federal budget director who, among Cabinet members, is most involved in District matters. Mr. Brimmer said he notified his board colleagues about a month ago.
But public disclosure came only after an article appeared today in The Washington Post, which said three other board members -- Vice Chairman Steven D. Harlan, Constance B. Newman and Joyce Ladner -- had decided to resign if Mr. Brimmer was appointed to another three-year term as chairman. The fifth member, Edward A. Singletary, has said he will step down under any circumstances.
Mr. Brimmer would not acknowledge the article at his news conference, and declined to discuss any friction with his colleagues, who stood silently behind him. They refused to take any questions.
But for more than a year, board members have periodically clashed with Mr. Brimmer, sometimes in public, saying that his decision-making was often too autocratic. He also drew fire from Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. and other elected officials, who gradually lost their power over most city agencies to the control board.
Since the control board began operating, Washington has had a chief financial officer who answers to the control board, rather than to the mayor. The public school system is run by an appointed board, rather than the elected school board. And a chief management officer accountable to the control board runs nine major city agencies that had been run by the mayor.
To many local officials, and residents who objected to the secretive nature of the board's decision-making, Mr. Brimmer came to personify the loss of home rule, which Congress granted the city in 1974.
In a statement thanking Mr. Brimmer for serving, Mr. Clinton made a veiled reference to the friction, saying that his service "at times, has been a difficult undertaking."
Despite any contentious relationships, the nation's capital has dramatically improved since the control board took over. Crime rates, while still higher than national averages, are falling. City agencies have been overhauled to improve service. And last year, for the first time in a decade, the city posted a budget surplus, $185 million. A $300 million surplus is projected for the current fiscal year.
By law, the control board goes out of operation after the city has balanced its budget four consecutive years.
"They should give him the key to the city," said Anthony Williams, the city's chief financial officer.
Acknowledging that Mr. Brimmer has taken "brickbats, spears and arrows," Mr. Williams described him as "the central architect of the District's financial recovery."
In his letter, Mr. Brimmer urged the President to persuade Ms. Newman, Ms. Ladner and Mr. Harlan to serve another term.
Mr. Clinton is not expected to nominate board members for the next three years until April or May.

HEADLINE: From Highflier to Downer;
Transformation Plans at Hoechst Are Losing Thrust

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 20

 BODY:
Until recently at least, Jurgen Dormann came as close as any German business executive to being a Wall Street darling.
Since taking charge of Hoechst A.G. in 1994, Mr. Dormann has won rave reviews for putting Hoechst, the huge chemicals conglomerate, through a breathtaking alchemy. He has been selling off the chemical businesses as fast as he can. He has spent billions to buy his way into the more profitable fields of pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. And he has slashed thousands of jobs and overhauled the bureaucracy. 
 Analysts repeatedly praised the strategy as bold, brilliant and fundamentally "Anglo-Saxon" in its hard-headed focus on profits. "Hoechst probably provides the prime example of changing corporate attitudes in Germany," wrote Peter Blair of Salomon Smith Barney last fall, praising the "Dormann revolution."
But now the revolution is sputtering. Investors hammered Hoechst shares last week after Mr. Dormann reported a big slide in profits and warned that this year will also be difficult. Meanwhile, managers in many divisions are demoralized and workers are draping flags with black crosses out their windows.
More embarrassing, Hoechst is being upstaged by unrevolutionary rivals like Bayer and BASF. Both have held onto their chemical businesses, and both reported big jumps in sales and profits this week. As the European bull market rages on, the shares of Hoechst lag woefully behind.
Most experts still contend that Mr. Dormann's strategy is sound. The question, though, is whether he can pull it off.
At the moment, Hoechst is caught, like a caterpillar trying to turn itself into a butterfly, between two worlds. It is well on his way out of the chemical business. But its future as a pharmaceuticals giant rests on a company cobbled together from three also-rans that desperately need a few blockbuster drugs.
The tribulations mark a uniquely cross-cultural business experience. Perhaps more than any other German executive, Mr. Dormann epitomizes the "new" European manager who has not only embraced American ideas about shareholder value and restructuring, but actually tried to carry them out. If he falters, it is only likely to add to the European backlash against the more ruthless, market-driven approach favored in business circles in the United States.
Indeed, Mr. Dormann's biggest fans have been Wall Street firms. Salomon Smith Barney; Goldman, Sachs, and Morgan Stanley have been among the most bullish enthusiasts on Hoechst in recent months, and all have scrambled to lower their estimates. Yet Hoechst has been far less popular with many German analysts.
At the heart of the storm is Mr. Dormann himself. An economist by training who was previously Hoechst's chief financial officer, he is a quiet and, some say, shy man. His office is nearly empty: a glass top desk, a glass conference table, chairs, a bookshelf in the far wall. "It's a cold office, a very cold office," one senior executive remarked.
Lately, Mr. Dormann has gone out of his way to emphasize bad news and deflate expectations. But when it comes to his strategy, he doesn't budge a smidgen.
"We said to ourselves, what is the most important business we have," Mr. Dormann said in a recent interview. "The value driver for Hoechst was and is the pharma business, and we had to decide whether to give these businesses priority."
Mr. Dormann is not alone in that strategy. Monsanto sold most of its chemical businesses to focus on life sciences. DuPont has been resisting pressure to do the same.
Yet the sheer scale of Mr. Dormann's attempted revolution dwarfs them all. In the last three years, he has sold or spun off companies worth billions of dollars, several of which have proved very successful in their new lives. SGL Carbon, once the loss-plagued subsidiary that made graphite chemical products, was floated as an initial public offering in 1995 and has seen its stock quadruple since then. Hoechst sold its remaining shares in a 1996 public offering that fetched about $1 billion.
Last year, Mr. Dormann orchestrated the sale of the specialty chemicals business to the Swiss company Clariant, which assumed more than 4 billion marks in liabilities and gave Hoechst a 45 percent stake in itself. Clariant's stock has also soared, and the Hoechst stake is worth about 3 billion marks, or about $1.6 billion. In the next year or two, he plans to sell or spin off most of the other chemical companies, including Celanese, the American supplier of basic chemicals.
Mr. Dormann's most significant move was to buy Marion Merrell Dow, a large but mediocre pharmaceutical company based in Kansas City, Mo., for $7.1 billion in 1995. He combined that with Hoechst's own drug business and the French manufacturer Roussel Uclaf, in which Hoechst had owned a majority stake since the 1970's.
But the newly merged company, Hoechst Marion Roussel, is a hodgepodge of old products and declining volumes. No one has said this more bluntly than the company's chief executive, Richard J. Markham.
"In 1997, we were the only company in the top 10 whose sales declined in real terms," he said as he presented results on March 11. "Our product line is older and more of our sales are of off-patent products than our competitors'."
Hoechst Marion Roussel's biggest product is Cardizem, a drug to relieve heart disorders, which had sales of $780 million last year. But Cardizem's patents are expiring and generic rivals will be on the market no later than mid-1999. Its other big product, a new allergy drug called Allegra, is booming but is largely replacing a similar drug called Seldane, which the company took off the market because of its side effects.
Those problems are not new. Mr. Markham, in hopes of emulating other successful pharmaceutical companies, has been rushing to refocus the company's research on developing a handful of drugs with blockbuster potential. But only two of those drugs are expected to receive approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1998, and the company has been conservative about predicting their sales potential.
Meanwhile, the drug unit is fighting high costs and $6.1 billion of debt. Despite slashing 8,000 jobs worldwide last year, the company said in January that it would cut more than 1,000 research jobs this year. That move outraged workers and managers, who staged loud demonstrations at Hoechst and later began hanging black crosses out their windows.
But what rattled investors was Mr. Markham's warning about the year ahead. Acknowledging that the drug company's costs were still too high, he announced plans to set aside about $400 million next year to pay for another round of restructuring costs. After grilling Mr. Markham and other executives, moreover, many analysts concluded that the drug company would not meet its long-stated goal of generating a 20 percent profit margin in 1999.
In hindsight, it is now clear why Hoechst abruptly canceled its plans a year ago to spin off Hoechst Marion Roussel. Analysts say that it was simply in no shape to go public.
"I have had some of the most negative predictions of anybody, but even my estimates have been high," grumbled Jurgen Trojan, chemicals analyst at Deutsche Girozentrale, which supplies investment research to Germany's publicly owned banks.
Mr. Dormann acknowledged that Marion Merrell Dow had lackluster research, but he defended the acquisition. "Marion was never famous for research," he said. "We didn't buy Marion Merrill Dow because it had great products. This was an investment in infrastructure."
More specifically, Marion Merrell Dow had a huge United States marketing organization, as well as expertise in shepherding new drugs through the complex F.D.A. approval process.
Mr. Markham, an American who shuttles between New Jersey and Frankfurt, says the company's tough moves to focus on a handful of key drug projects will turn the company around.
"We are not doing as well as we should be," he said. "But I do know we have the building blocks to build a competitive firm."
Aside from pharmaceuticals, the other pillar of Hoechst's strategy is agricultural products developed through biotechnology. Four years ago, Mr. Dormann merged its various agrichemical operations into a 60-40 joint venture with Schering that is now called Agrevo. Agrevo, based on the Hoechst industrial complex, fortified its own research by buying a Dutch biotechnology company called Plant Genetic Systems, for about $600 million.
Revenues have climbed steadily from 3.6 billion marks in 1996 to 4 billion marks last year and profits are up to 194 million marks. But the real excitement is in genetically engineered crops, where Agrevo still lags. Its first big line of biotechnology products, a line of herbicide-resistent crops called Liberty Link, will face stiff competition from Monsanto's Round-up Ready products line.
Mr. Dormann argues that his company would be worse off if it had stayed the same. Unlike BASF , which has resolutely committed itself to chemicals, Hoechst has always had to buy the chemicals used to make plastics and resins.
"Believe me, if I were running BASF, I would do exactly what they are doing right now," he said.
To stay competitive, Mr. Dormann has argued, Hoechst would have had to spend billions of dollars on huge chemical crackers at a time when petrochemical companies have entered the industry from the other end of the production chain. So, while Mr. Dormann was a prime mover behind buying Celanese a decade ago, he is now engineering its sale.
"Yes, I admit it," he said with a smile. "I was the one behind buying Celanese. But what was right 10 years ago is not necessarily right today."

Since taking over Hoechst in 1994, Jurgen Dormann has been trying to change the company from a chemicals giant to a leader in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.

Austere Japan Budget Stirs Recession Fear
Japan's lower house of Parliament approved a budget that could squeeze money out of the economy just as the nation is careening toward a recession. Despite pleas from the United States and other trading partners of Japan, the budget provides no additional spending or tax cuts. 
 Economists have called such stimulants necessary for Japan's economy to escape prolonged stagnation. But Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and other members of the dominant Liberal Democratic Party have said drastic action is inappropriate. There is also concern that a supplementary budget now under discussion may not help. Page D2.
 
Japanese workers will be getting raises but not as much as last year, based on negotiations that took place this week, revealing another sign of Japan's economic distress. D2.
 
Schlumberger Makes Russian Deal
Schlumberger, one of the world's leading oil service companies, will form a five-year alliance with Yuksi Oil, Russia's largest oil producer. The partnership, expected to be announced next Tuesday, will give Schlumberger management control over some Russian oilfields and could signal an end to Russia's historical resistance to outside management of its petroleum industry.

HEADLINE: CLINTON HESITATES TO PUNISH NATIONS FOR IRAN OIL DEALS

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration is backing away from imposing sanctions on foreign energy companies that are investing in Iran, despite a law signed with great fanfare by President Clinton in 1996, senior American officials say.
The Administration hopes that the Asian financial crisis and the recent drop in oil prices will cause the two major deals at issue to collapse, and that the sensitive foreign policy problem will simply go away. 
 Even if that does not happen, the Administration is negotiating with the European Union to find enough cause under the law to waive the sanctions if they are imposed.
So Mr. Clinton has decided that he will make no decisions at least until he and the European Union conclude their summit meeting in mid-May, the officials say. Even if Mr. Clinton then imposes sanctions, he is expected to waive them, officials said.
The countries involved in the two deals at issue are France, Russia, Canada, Malaysia and Indonesia.
The United States wants to avoid an open confrontation with its European allies and with Russia, all of whom oppose Washington's efforts to punish their companies for doing business with Iran.
For the past six months, some of Washington's closest European allies have been pressing the Administration to drop or waive the sanctions, which they regard as illegal. They have threatened to challenge the legislation in the World Trade Organization.
Mr. Clinton is also courting European and Russian assistance to counter Iraq and to contain the crisis that has erupted in Kosovo, in Serbia, officials say. The Administration also wants Russia to ratify the second strategic arms reduction treaty.
Mr. Clinton, in seeking to improve relations with a changing Iran, wants to avoid any action that might undermine its new President, Mohammad Khatami. Mr. Khatami offers the prospect of a less confrontational Iran, and has said his country will stop supporting radical Islamic groups opposed to the Middle East peace talks.
Mr. Clinton is said to have been very impressed with a letter President Khatami sent, via the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, promising that Iran would respect any Middle East solution that the Palestinians accepted.
While American officials say they want proof that Iran has changed its policies on terrorism, on developing major weapons systems and on opposition to Mideast talks, they are also trying to bring Teheran into a Government-to-Government dialogue.
The law at issue is the 1996 Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, which was sponsored by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, and signed live on CNN by President Clinton. It was intended to reduce Iran's income, thus hindering Iran's support of terrorism and its weapons program. The law imposes sanctions on foreign companies that invest more than $20 million in Iran's energy sector, and is being challenged by two accords announced last year.
The larger and more provocative is a $2 billion contract to pump natural gas, signed by the French company Total and two partners, Gazprom of Russia and Petronas of Malaysia. Petronas has been hit hard by the Asian crisis, and an American official is currently investigating whether it may have to pull out of the deal, senior officials said. Total, for its part, vows to go ahead and seek further contracts in Iran.
The other deal, worth $180 million, was signed by a Canadian company, Bow Valley Energy Ltd., and its Indonesian partner, Bakrie Minarak. There have been reports that Bakrie Minarak wants to pull out and that Bow Valley is seeking new partners.
It has been six months since the State Department began an investigation into whether the companies are liable for sanctions under the law. But senior Administration officials say the investigation is not complete, which means that legally Mr. Clinton has not had to make a decision.
Even Congressional staff members who monitor the law are not pressing very hard for a decision.
"It would not be an unhappy outcome if all this were to fall of its own weight," one key congressional staff member said, echoing the fervent hope of the Administration.
At the same time, Washington wants to discourage large new investments into Iran. It is pressing for a Turkish route for a pipeline for Caspian Sea oil and gas, which would bypass Iran. And it wants to reduce Western dependence on Persian Gulf pipelines and to reduce the reliance of the newly independent Central Asian states on Russian pipelines.
It is President Khatami himself who holds out the prospect of better Iranian behavior on the very issues the sanctions law is meant to highlight: Iran's development of major weapons and its support for radical groups that oppose Middle East peace.
"This is still a very tough one," a senior Administration official said. "There are a lot of competing interests, and the coherence of our Iran policy is at stake."
While senior officials say they will carry out the law, they note that it has two kinds of waivers built in.
The first, known as a 9c waiver, which many senior American officials favor, invokes national security to waive sanctions against particular projects or companies. Using a 9c waiver, the officials say, will allow the law to retain a lot of its deterrent power because big foreign companies who want to invest in Iran -- like British Petroleum and Shell -- have too many assets in America to risk sanctions. Total, Gazprom and Petronas, by contrast, have few assets here.
Applying this waiver, the narrower of the two, would also help prevent complaints of unfair competition by American companies, which are barred from investing in Iran by a separate American law.
The European allies favor a second waiver, known as a 4c, which provides a blanket waiver for a country and its companies if that country takes "substantial measures, including economic sanctions, that inhibit Iran's abilities" to develop weapons or undermine the peace effort.
While senior European diplomats argue that Iran gets no help from Europe for its weapons programs, they are negotiating with the Americans about how to tighten up their controls over the export of dual-use products, which can be used for benign projects or for nuclear or missile programs.
Senator D'Amato has written to Mr. Clinton opposing any 4c waiver because European countries have not imposed any economic sanctions. But a senior American official said some steps by the Europeans to deny dual-use products to Iran could have "a substantial economic impact."

HEADLINE: Among Young Of Immigrants, Outlook Rises

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

 BODY:
A multiyear survey that is the largest ever of the children of immigrants -- who now account for almost 1 in 5 American children -- found that they overwhelmingly prefer English to their parents' native tongues and have higher grades and steeply lower school dropout rates than other American children.
While a majority of those surveyed, adolescents who were of predominantly Hispanic, Asian and black descent, said they had personally experienced discrimination, an even larger majority of them said they still believed that the United States was the best country in the world to live in. 
 The lead researchers on the study describe these findings as reassuring indications that the children of immigrants are unlikely to form a new multi-ethnic underclass, as some experts fear, cut off from the mainstream by academic failure and an inability to speak English.
But the researchers also say it is still an open question how well these young people will do in college and the job market, a caution shared by other experts. The researchers said the survey brought into sharp relief the extraordinary diversity of the children of immigrants, not only by national origin, but also by social class. It reaches from the young of Chinese and Indian couples from highly educated, upper-middle-class backgrounds to Mexicans and Dominicans from the humblest origins.
"What can certainly be predicted now is that the destinies of these youth will diverge," said Prof. Ruben G. Rumbaut, a sociologist at Michigan State University. "Some will go up, and some will go down."
The survey, which shows that the children of immigrants outperform their American peers and that those from more advantaged backgrounds do better than poorer children, will inevitably become fodder for the larger debate about the nation's immigration policy.
Supporters of the current high levels of immigration will cite the achievements of these young people, while critics may find reinforcement for their view that national policy should be tilted to favor more highly skilled and educated immigrants.
The research team, led by Professor Rumbaut and Prof. Alejandro Portes, a sociologist at Princeton University, first interviewed 5,200 youngsters in Southern California and South Florida in 1992 when the youths were in the eighth or ninth grades and tracked down 82 percent of them for a second interview in 1995 and 1996 when most were high school seniors.
This fall, another team of sociologists will begin a large-scale survey of the grown children of immigrants in New York City and its suburbs, focusing on adults 18 to 32 years old, rather than adolescents.
The number of children who are either immigrants or the American-born offspring of immigrants grew to 13.7 million last year, from 8 million in 1990, making them the fastest-growing segment of Americans under the age of 18, according to a new analysis of census data by Professor Rumbaut.
The $1 million survey of the children of immigrants was financed by the Russell Sage, Andrew W. Mellon, Spencer and National Science Foundations. The researchers provided their findings to The New York Times.
Among the most striking findings of the bicoastal survey of children from San Diego and Miami-Dade and Broward Counties in South Florida have to do with the contentious issue of language. While 9 out of 10 of the youths surveyed spoke a language other than English at home, almost the same proportion, 88 percent, preferred English by the end of high school.
Professor Rumbaut wrote, "The findings suggest that the linguistic outcomes for the third generation -- the grandchildren of the current wave of immigrants -- will be no different than what has been the age-old pattern in American history: the grandchildren may learn a few foreign words and phrases as a quaint vestige of their ancestry, but they will most likely grow up speaking English only."
And the professor also pointed to the ascendancy of English as evidence of the irrelevance of a California ballot initiative that could end bilingual education, which has been depicted as an impediment to the acquisition of English.
"English is triumphing with breathtaking rapidity," he said.
The study presents a generally upbeat portrayal of the children of immigrants as ambitious, hopeful and resilient in the face of discrimination. In San Diego, the children of immigrants had better grades than their American peers in every grade. The gap narrowed over time, largely because the poorly performing children of immigrants were more likely to stay in school than their peers who were not the children of immigrants, the researchers say. In South Florida, the school districts were unable to provide the researchers with grade point averages for the district as a whole.
But when the researchers analyzed how the children of immigrants were faring by national origin, they found that levels of scholastic success diverged sharply. Generally, the children whose immigrant parents had better educations and jobs and who came from stable, two-parent families were predictably more successful, with a few startling exceptions.
The children of Chinese, Indian, Japanese and Korean parents had the highest grade point averages, A's and B's. English-speaking West Indians had lower grades, C's and C+'s. Latin American and Haitian youths performed poorest, with averages that were slightly higher or lower than a C.
But a few groups defied what would have been expected, based on their socioeconomic status. The children of Southeast Asian refugees, who came from the most impoverished backgrounds and whose parents were among the least educated, were also among the least likely to drop out of school and had above-average grades. They did it by studying for longer hours and watching less television than many of the other children of immigrants, the study found.
And the children of Cuban immigrants, who were from average to above-average socioeconomic backgrounds, had the highest dropout rates and among the lowest grades (an average of C or C+), the survey reported. The Cuban children, who belonged to the dominant group in metropolitan Miami, faced less discrimination than any other group in the survey, the researchers said.
The children of Cubans did worse academically than the children of Mexicans, who are one of the poorest immigrant groups in the United States and by far the largest immigrant group.
The findings about Cubans were among the survey's most startling to Professors Rumbaut and Portes and their colleague, Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuban Research Center at Florida International University. All three are Cuban immigrants themselves.
Professor Portes had hypothesized that Cuban youths would use their economically powerful ethnic enclave as a springboard to higher education and the middle class, much as Eastern European Jews did in an earlier wave of immigration.
He said that the new survey data showed that while some Cuban youths, especially those in private schools, were continuing on an upwardly mobile path, the ones in public schools were facing more difficulties.
And Professor Perez said that for some, "the enclave may not be a springboard, but a cushy net that means you don't have to depend exclusively on education for a job."
"It may be that Cubans are right, and will do better going to work at an uncle's factory in Hialeah," he said. "We're not certain how it will translate economically."
The survey also found some intriguing changes in the way the children of immigrants identified themselves, possibly reflecting their altered relationship to the rest of American society or perhaps just adolescent rebelliousness.
When the youths were first interviewed, more than half labeled themselves as hyphenated Americans or as plain Americans. That sounded like old-fashioned assimilation, and it might have been expected that, three years later, even more of the youths would have chosen an American identity.
But the results of the second interview, conducted in the months after California's passage of Proposition 187, the initiative that called for restricting social and educational benefits to illegal immigrants, turned those expectations on their head.
Only a third of the youths in Southern California picked an American identity the second time around, while almost half identified themselves by their national identity, especially youths of Mexican and Filipino descent, who belong to the two largest immigrant groups in the United States.
The researchers interpreted the change as part of a backlash among these youth against what they perceived as immigrant bashing that surfaced in the campaign for Proposition 187.
In South Florida the pattern was different, but equally striking. The proportion identifying themselves by some kind of American label dropped to about a third, while the share who chose ethnic identities like Hispanic or black doubled to 38 percent, mainly among Latin Americans and Jamaicans.
The more militant, nationalistic identities assumed by Mexicans and Filipinos in California, and the minority identities chosen in Florida, Professor Rumbaut wrote, reflected the youths' rising awareness "of the ethnic and racial categories in which they were persistently classified by mainstream society."
In one of the more troubling findings of the study, the researchers said, the young people who identified themselves by ethnic categories like Chicano or Latino in junior high had lower grades and somewhat higher dropout rates than the other children studied.
This finding, they said, lends support to analysts who have suggested that children of immigrants who come to identify with American minorities may take on "oppositional" identities and see doing well in school as "acting white."

The Liars' Club

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
So many women who may be lying on TV, so little time. How else to explain the scant attention paid this week to the unmasking of the Beardstown Ladies, a gang of Middle American grandmas caught in the biggest media hoax since Joe Klein denied writing "Primary Colors"?
The Beardstown Ladies, you may recall, are 14 photogenic small-town Illinois women, median age 70, who became a cottage industry once they extolled the virtues of their investment club on CBS's morning show. Their high annual return of 23.4 percent -- which "puts many professionals to shame," as People magazine marveled -- spawned best-selling books (800,000 copies of their first investment guide alone), daytime talk-show stardom, lecture tours and a video titled "Cookin' Up Profits." ABC's "20/20" attributed their Wall Street prowess to their "heartland" virtues of hard work and churchgoing; the equally credulous Times ran their recipe for Stock Market Muffins ("guaranteed to rise"). 
 But in three years of cookin' up profits and hype, no journalist bothered to check if the ladies might be cooking their books until a reporter named Shane Tritsch challenged their numbers in this month's Chicago magazine. After much buck-passing, stonewalling and disparagement of the press, the Beardstown Ladies apologized this week. A Price Waterhouse audit uncovered a yearly return of 9.1 percent that not only underperformed the extravagant claim on their book jackets but underperformed the market.
The story that buried the Beards town Ladies' apology in much of the same media that had made them superstars was, of course, Kathleen Willey. Then again, the stories are the same. Both show how image, often created or enhanced by show-biz packaging, counts for everything on the public stage. The Beardstown Ladies were, literally, a G-rated Disney package -- archetypes from Main Street, U.S.A., published by Disney's Hyperion -- so the public and reporters alike threw skepticism aside. Ms. Willey offered another set of appealing cliches -- lovingly air-brushed by a "60 Minutes" that didn't want to let tough-minded journalism cast any ambiguous shadows on a heroine whose credibility promised big ratings.
As Katie Roiphe writes in the Web magazine Salon, Ms. Willey's attributes included her "sensible hair and high cheekbones," her upper-middle-class background and her general aura of "Not Likely to Steal Your Husband." And as Ms. Roiphe points out, the whole political spectrum, "from Newt Gingrich to Anita Hill," rushed to judge her credible as a result. "She looks more like Betty Crocker than she does like Betty Boop," said the conservative commentator Tony Blankley. The liberal pundit Bill Press echoed: "Kathleen Willey has 100 times more credibility than the lounge singer Gennifer Flowers." Or as The Economist summed up the received wisdom in a headline: "You can't call this one a bimbo."
But as the week went on, we learned that Ms. Willey's account was at odds with both a friend's affidavit and some of her own sworn statements. Though she may yet prove to have been truthful in describing a Presidential assault, her veracity is hardly a slam-dunk. Whoever she is, she's certainly far more complicated than the two-dimensional image merchandised and stage-managed by "60 Minutes."
If Ms. Willey did lie on "60 Minutes" -- and fool the audience as she did so -- she is hardly alone. We now know that the Clintons also got away with exceedingly disingenuous image-mongering in their famous '92 appearance on the show, during which the soon-to-be President responded to a question about a 12-year affair with Gennifer Flowers by saying "That allegation is false." This year, in a sworn deposition, Mr. Clinton conceded having an affair with her, disputing only its duration.
This means that in this entire saga the only female Presidential accuser we now know for certain to be telling the truth is one of the Betty Boops who was being trashed even as Ms. Willey's now-disputed account was being universally accepted as gospel. This tells us something about our class prejudices, certainly, and about our insistence on judging women by their hair. But it's also another example of how the priorities of show business override reality in the pageant we call "news." Crowd-pleasing star performers, however contrived, get the free ride that vulgar lounge acts, however genuine, do not.

HEADLINE: Germans Cut Labor Costs With a Harsh Export: Jobs

SERIES: HELP UNWANTED: Second of two articles on Europe's job drought.

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 20

 BODY:
It would be hard to find a more vivid example of the revival of German industry than the renowned sports car manufacturer Porsche AG. Six years after the company came perilously close to bankruptcy, sales and profits are booming and its snappy new two-seater, the Boxster, is a hit.
But that is cold comfort for its workers. Having stretched its plants to their limit, Porsche has vowed not to build any more assembly plants and to farm out work to contractors. 
 Last September, in an unprecedented move for Porsche, it hired a Finnish company to start building some Boxsters. Though the move does not save Porsche much in costs, it frees the company from the expense of building a factory, hiring workers and laying them off if Boxster falters.
Porsche is one small example of the most striking economic feature in Germany: growth without jobs.
Europe is enjoying its best economic growth in years. But employers are not hiring many people. After years of layoffs and cost cutting, unemployment remains at record rates -- 11.6 percent in Germany and more than 10 percent across the European Union. Though there are signs that the problem has peaked, nobody expects the rate to drop to single digits before late 1999, if then.
More and more, economists say, Europe's economies are growing without creating many jobs. Reasons vary from country to country but high labor costs -- fringe benefits, plentiful vacations and holidays, rigid work rules -- and high payroll taxes discourage companies from adding workers. The main exceptions are Britain, Ireland and the Netherlands, which have more liberal work rules and lower taxes.
The labor costs are pushing companies to invest elsewhere. Last year German companies invested $25 billion abroad -- 10 times as much as foreign companies invested here, the biggest investment gap ever.
The political implications are potentially explosive. Unemployed workers have staged loud protests across France and Germany. Anger about joblessness in France was central to last summer's election victory by the Socialist Party, and it is a major threat to Chancellor Helmut Kohl in an election this September.
The upheaval is almost a mirror image of the American experience. In the United States, Rust Belt manufacturers shed hundreds of thousands of jobs in the 1980's. But in the 90's the unemployment rate has declined, partly because millions of jobs have been generated in the service economy. One price for those jobs has been workers' income, which declined in real terms through throughout the 1980's and up to 1996.
In Europe, by contrast, wages and fringe benefits have remained high. The pain has come from a steady increase in unemployment.
The trends are particularly stark in Germany, Europe's biggest economy and most powerful exporter. Though exports are soaring, the domestic economy remains anemic. Retail sales actually declined a bit last year. After an acquisition binge, German banks are cutting jobs to improve profits. The dominant telephone company, forced into competition for the first time, is shedding 60,000 jobs.
 
A Case Study: Hugo Boss Apparel
The divided world of renewed dynamism and fewer jobs is on display in Metzingen, a southern German city that is home to Hugo Boss AG. Originally known for its avant garde casual clothing, the company is branching into more conservative upscale apparel, including its first women's line. Boss brands and its stores are now familiar worldwide, and the company recently opened a high-profile store in Beverly Hills.
Sales climbed 14 percent last year, and the company surprised investors last month by announcing a 27 percent jump in profits.
Part of Boss's success stems from shifting production outside Germany, mostly to Poland, Romania and Slovenia. Only about 20 percent of the clothing is produced in Germany now, down from about 40 percent five years ago.
"It used to be that if you wanted workers who cost $2.50 an hour, you had to travel 10,000 miles to Asia," remarked Joachim Vogt, the chief executive. "Now you just have to go 15 miles across the Oder River," to Poland.
Indeed, the main reason that Hugo Boss produces any clothing at all in Germany is to retain the technical expertise to supervise suppliers and insure quality. Company officials in Metzingen select the production equipment, develop procedures and even train many managers and workers from other countries.
The result is impressive. "A few years ago, our quality-control experts could look at the color of a jacket and tell what factory it came from," Mr. Vogt said. "Today, not even the quality-control people can tell."
Thus the size of Boss's German work force has remained the same for several years and it has cut back on German suppliers.
 
Where the Jobs Are: On the Managerial Level
The one silver lining is that within Hugo Boss, the decline in textile workers has been offset by an increase in better-paid managers.
"Our core competence is to bring products to market and create brands on an international level," Mr. Vogt said. "Our industry doesn't need to produce in Europe. Europe's core competence comes from its highly educated and highly skilled people, and over the last 20 years there has been migration to jobs that are more brain-oriented."
Across Europe, corporate restructurings have put thousands of people out of work, but they have helped revitalize laggard companies.
For example Moulinex, a French company that makes coffee makers and other kitchen ware, lost hundreds of millions of dollars between 1993 and 1996. Under new management, the company closed two factories, announced plans to eliminate 2,600 jobs over three years and refocused on new products.
Today Moulinex has fewer workers but a slew of new appliances. Its annual sales stabilized at $1.3 billion last year, and the company earned its first profit in four years.
Porsche, on the other hand, got into trouble when recession hit the United States, then its largest market, and a plunge in the dollar pushed up sticker prices there. That would have been bad enough, but Porsche's production had slipped woefully behind the times. Cars took too long to design and build.
After a revolving door of executives, Wendelin Wiedeking was hired as chief executive in 1993 and quickly shocked workers by hiring Japanese to re-engineer the production system. The number of hours it took to assemble a Porsche was cut in half and many workers were laid off.
Today Porsche's German workforce has actually increased to 7,100 people, from its low of 6,350 in the mid-1990's. But when Porsche began running out of assembling capacity in late 1996, thanks largely a surge in demand for the Boxster, Mr. Wiedeking had to make a choice between building a new plant and hiring more workers, or farming out the work.
It was not an easy decision. Though other German car companies had long since started building vehicles overseas, Porsche had always been a small, independent manufacturer with an rock-solid German identity.
Valmet of Finland, which has long run assembly lines for Saab and the Opel division of General Motors, offered to start assembling Porsches within nine months, using the same assembly lines used to make Saabs. It did not even need to hire new workers, because it was just reaching the end of a contract with Opel.
And if demand for Boxsters fell, Porsche could simply shut down production in Finland and let Valmet worry about layoffs. In the end, Mr. Wiedeking decided the advantages were overwhelming, and 300 Finnish workers are now assembling about 5,000 Boxsters a year.
"This was not a decision taken against Germany," Mr. Wiedeking insisted. "This was a decision because we couldn't increase the production any faster."
But the decision did have to do with flexibility, and Porsche executives say they have made a firm decision not to build new plants for any future needs.
"It is our clear policy not to build any additional capacity," said Manfred Ayasse, a Porsche spokesman. "Porsche's view is that there is enough capacity around the world. We have almost no investment to make and we have almost no risk. If Boxster sales declined, we can stop production at Valmet within a year."
Economists here and abroad say the combination of high wages, high taxes and tight regulations have created a major barrier to hiring and investment.
The Institute for the German Economy, a business-backed research organization in Cologne, estimates that labor costs in most European countries remain far higher than in the United States. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has calculated that the return on business investment in Europe has consistently been much lower than in the United States.
German business executives blame much of this on high labor costs and taxes. German workers pay about half their gross income in taxes and mandatory social security contributions, and employers have to match many of those payments.
The burden infuriates Arend Oetker, a fourth-generation business executive in Cologne who controls Schwartau, a producer of jams, snacks and other sweets. Mr. Oetker recently bought a controlling stake in a similar Swiss company called Hero and folded his non-German businesses into it because Swiss tax laws offer him savings compared with German laws.
"I am a German, and I want to keep employment here as much as possible," Mr. Oetker said. "But the more the labor costs rise, and the more that taxes rise, the more difficult it is to remain in Germany. No one can be astonished that unemployment is going up."
In a report to the Government, Germany's top economic research institutes echoed that view. "Stronger growth alone will certainly not be sufficient to improve the labor market situation," the institutes said. The American example, the report continued, shows that greater flexibility in wage costs and regulation can help boost employment.
 
A Bit of Change May Be Too Late
Some change is coming, slowly.
Last year at the huge Opel facility in Russelsheim, local union negotiators agreed to wage concessions in exchange for a commitment by Opel to cut jobs only through attrition and voluntary retirement incentives for the next five years.
But many German experts say the pace of change is far too slow.
A major tax-reform plan championed by Chancellor Kohl was blocked by opposition parties in Parliament. Labor unions, after grudgingly accepting negligible wage hikes in the past two years, are now demanding bigger increases.
The Government is trying to funnel more money toward job-creation programs and seed capital for new companies.
Gerhard Schroder, who will lead the opposition party in the fall, remains vague on what he would do if his party wins the elections. But he has talked about pumping more money into the economy to stimulate consumer demand.
Many union leaders continue to press for a shorter work-week, an idea the French Parliament is weighing, on the theory of dividing the current jobs among more people.
But economists say that such measures will not do the trick, and that both major political parties are too divided to force deeper changes.
"We all know what is to be done," said Klaus Friedrich, chief economist at Dresdner Bank. "But they can't get it done. Why? Because we don't have a Government in a position to do very much."

Clinton's Lawyer Asks Judge to Dismiss Lawsuit
President Clinton's lawyer asked a Federal judge in Little Rock, Ark., to dismiss Paula Corbin Jones's sexual misconduct suit against Mr. Clinton on the grounds that the case amounted to "little more than a web of deceit and distortions" and that the Jones team had proved neither damages to Ms. Jones nor her basic accusation of workplace sexual intimidation by Mr. Clinton when he was Arkansas Governor and she was a state worker. But the lawyer retreated from a strategy to seek a thorough airing of Ms. Jones's own sex life. A1
 
President Clinton took the extraordinary step of formally invoking both executive privilege and attorney-client privilege to block grand jury testimony of senior White House aides in the Monica S. Lewinsky inquiry, lawyers involved in the case said. A1

HEADLINE: You Want to Be a Star? Then Get in Line

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL 

 BODY:
"And now you want to be an actor," said Michael Kahan. It could have been a question or a statement.
The young man across the table took it as a question. He nodded eagerly at Mr. Kahan and two other drama judges in a rehearsal room of the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center. He said his name was Richard; he was 21, and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate in economics. He said he would perform a scene from "Julius Caesar" and something by August Wilson. 
 "You're on," said Mr. Kahan, arching an eyebrow almost audibly. "Whenever."
Scenes like this have been playing around the country for weeks now as drama schools go through their annual admissions ritual for the fall. This year, however, the intensity is unusual. Acting is hot, And not just because of the "Titanic" idol Leonardo DiCaprio. For years now, increasing numbers of young people have been taking to the boards, assuring the acting mecca of New York an inexhaustible supply of waiters and waitresses.
"There's a definite glamour attached to the profession," said a bubbly Victoria Ross, 17, of Dayton, Ohio ("Call me Tory, because I'm British"), who came to audition last month at Juilliard.
Michael Ellis, 17, of Chatham, N.J., who also auditioned there, cited "the coolness aspect" as well as issues of personal growth. "I used to be modest, shy and reticent," he said. "It made me flower." His friends were impressed, he said. "They kind of think it's noble." Besides, he said, "drama and athletics are the only two professions that allow you to be paid for playing."
This is crunch time for the would-be thespians, particularly in New York, who usually learn their fate in April. A flood of applicants have been showing up, despite the formidable odds against being admitted and the almost inevitable prospect of low pay once they graduate: one 17-year-old hopeful, Laura Silva, recently traveled to the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University from Bogota, Colombia.
Juilliard, perhaps the most selective performing arts school in the nation, is sorting through 1,100 acting applications for its 20 positions, up 10 percent from last year, officials said. At the Tisch School, with the largest undergraduate drama department in the world, close to 2,200 applicants are competing for the 350 freshmen openings in 1998-99, up from 1,518 last year and 1,262 in 1996, and just 880 in 1993.
Mary Schmidt Campbell, dean of the Tisch School, said the boom seemed "a youthful defiance" of electronic media. "They're saying, 'My voice, my body, live and in person, in living flesh.' "
Some drama professionals tie the growing interest in acting to the youth entertainment culture of home video and cable and network television, as well films and theater. Some wonder, too, whether in a strong economy more parents are willing to see their children pursue the uncertain prospects of a career in the arts.
"It looks like a perfectly good profession," said Mr. Kahan, a stage director who has been on the Juilliard faculty for 25 years, the last 6 as director of the drama program. "They see a lot of actors in their living rooms. And TV looks so easy."
They come in actors' garb -- sweats, jeans and T-shirts -- and in various stages of maturity and professional development. One 17-year-old from Frankfort, Ky., who was auditioning at New York University had not seen much theater, but he had directed two plays. A young woman arrived with her stuffed bunny and propped it up as a talisman to ease her through her audition.
"Where I come from, a lot of people are pursuing this career who shouldn't be," said Ms. Ross of Dayton. "That's funny coming from me because maybe I shouldn't be either." But she quickly dismissed the heretical thought. "It's truly the only thing that makes me happy," she said.
Her mother, Kate, who accompanied her to Juilliard along with her music teacher, said they were doing everything to encourage her, including sending her to the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan in the summer. "We are true believers in 'follow your dream,' " she said. "If you don't, you'll never know. The arts and entertainment world is exploding. It can always be parlayed into something else."
At New York University's auditions in a simple black box rehearsal space, Arthur Bartow, artistic director of the drama department, opened with a pep talk: "We try to find out who you are. We try to look at you holistically. The best actors are good scholars. Acting is just a skill, a technique. It's not why people come to watch you. They come to watch you as a person." He told one nervous young woman who asked to take her shoes off and then left sweaty footprints on the floor: "Calm down. It's only the rest of your life. Breathe."
He interrupted a young man in the middle of his monologue. "Pull it closer to yourself," he said.
The boy pulled over a chair.
Mr. Bartow stifled a smile. "I don't mean the chair," he said. "I mean yourself. More exposing yourself. I don't care if you screw up the scene. You're not bringing it close to yourself. You're acting." He said the word as if it were an epithet.
Uptown, at Juilliard, a daunting triumvirate presided: Mr. Kahan and other drama faculty members, Elizabeth Smith and Daryl Quinton.
Richard, the M.I.T. graduate, was declaiming as Marc Antony when Mr. Kahan stopped him. "Is there a sport you play?" he asked.
The young man looked puzzled. "Wrestling," he finally said.
"That won't work," Mr. Kahan said. "I'd like you to play a game with somebody you know. You decide."
"I'm playing kickball?" Richard asked, not quite getting it.
"Yes, and you do your monologue," Mr. Kahan said, watching to see how he could improvise and blend the words and actions.
One who did rate a call back was a girl who stirringly rendered Tennessee Williams's pitiable Bertha. "Could you sing something for us?" Mr. Kahan asked.
"Sure," she said unhesitatingly, breaking into a song from "The Secret Garden."
After she left, Mr. Kahan said, "Best actor we've seen." But he and the others detected a speech imperfection that might need work.
The number of working actors and directors -- perhaps not the oxymoron the inevitable jokes suggest -- grew by 173 percent from 1970 to 1990, from 40,000 to 109,500, according to census figures cited in a 1996 National Endowment for the Arts report called "Artists in the Work Force." The definition of employed, however, is hedged with qualifications involving other jobs and part-time work. In the same period, employment in all the arts rose 127 percent and in the labor force as a whole, 55 percent.
(Actors' Equity Association, the union representing stage actors with some professional credits, strenuously disputes the acting figures, saying they lump in many marginal hobbyists.)
From 1991 to 1997, Federal labor figures show, the number of working actors and directors grew by 56 percent, to 136,000, while the labor force overall grew by 11 percent. The figures combine actors and directors, although actors account for the bulk of the category.
Alan Eisenberg, national director of Actors' Equity, called the figures misleading, citing the steady union rolls of about 33,000 members as a more accurate indicator. "Anyone can put down 'actor,' " he said.
Despite the numbers of young people flocking to acting as a career, the economic realities remain harsh, Mr. Eisenberg said. Equity reports its members earned median wages of only $5,705 last year, meaning half earned more and half less. Average annual wages were $13,967. And members worked an average of only 17.4 weeks last year.
Still, other leading drama schools apart from Juilliard and New York University, report a similar upward trend. At the North Carolina School for the Arts in Winston-Salem, the 500 applicants for this year's 30 openings were twice as many as applied six years ago.
"It's been going up steadily," said the dean, Gerald Friedman, who injected a realistic note: "At orientation I tell them a lot won't be working."
At the University of Delaware's graduate theater program, the 500 applications for a recent class of 38 represented a 20 percent jump. But more striking, said Sandy Robbins, the program director, is the clamor to enter a program geared to the classics. "I wouldn't have been surprised if it was for movies or television," he said.
Yet the surge is not uniform. Other schools, like Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and the University of California at Los Angeles reported only modest rises in applications. And the Yale School of Drama, which accepts only 17 applicants a year, says it receives about 800 applications annually, a figure that has held "pretty steady" in recent years.
In the end, will they find work, other than in restaurants?
"There's a misconception the industry is just for famous people," said Betsy Immergut of State University College at Purchase, N.Y. "That they're not Harvey Keitel doesn't mean they're not employed in the field. There's theater companies and stage opportunities all over the world. Think in terms of skills developed. They can be teachers. They can be producers. The option is not between waiter or Academy Award winner. There's lots of jobs in between."
Gene Turisso, who has seen applications rise at both the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he is now the director, and the theater arts department at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, which he led previously, said the profession had a growing cachet. "We're past the time parents feared sending Johnny to a stage career," he said. "He can become a literary agent. And law schools love theater graduates."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 24, 1998, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Saturday about the popularity of acting careers for young people misspelled the surname of the director of the drama division at the Juilliard School. He is Michael Kahn, not Kahan.
The article also misspelled the surname of the head of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and misstated his title. He is Gene Terruso, not Turisso, and he is president, not director.

 BODY:
Shortly after 9 o'clock on the morning of Dec. 3, 1997, the 14 members of the Governor's Task Force on Driving While Intoxicated and Vehicular Homicide took their seats in a hearing room in the Louisiana State Capitol Building in Baton Rouge. The issue before them: whether the state should add a provision to Louisiana's drinking law that would prohibit 18- to 20-year-olds from entering bars. The law currently allows them into bars, even while it prohibits them from buying or drinking alcohol. The law is widely flouted, however, and most of the task-force members -- highway officials, state legislators, local sheriffs, a representative from Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) -- were united on the need to change what they saw as a loophole. The loophole, they believed, was encouraging college students to spend their nights carousing rather than studying. They also felt it was contributing to the carnage on the state's highways. In 1995, Louisiana had 883 traffic fatalities, of which slightly more than half were alcohol-related -- the third highest rate in the country.
In seeking to close the loophole, however, the task force faced a formidable obstacle: Charles Tapp, one of its members. A lobbyist for the state alcohol industry, the silver-haired, tart-tongued Tapp was on the attack from the moment the first witness was seated. "You're the executive director of what organization?" he snarled at Sharron Ayers, who represented the Louisiana Alliance to Prevent Under-Age Drinking, a coalition of grass-roots groups, state agencies and private organizations. Closing the loophole, she said, would make it harder for young people to drink. 
 "Why do you call it a loophole?" Tapp asked gruffly.
"It makes it very hard for law enforcement to enforce the law," Ayers replied, uncertainty creeping into her voice. "It's had a lot of effects on young people. They're out drinking, not studying. You know what happened recently at L.S.U."
Ayers was referring to the fateful night in August when several fraternity members at Louisiana State University dropped by Murphy's, a local bar. There they downed pitchers of a potent concoction called Three Wise Men -- 151-proof rum, Crown Royal whisky and Jagermeister, a sweet liqueur. By midnight the students were so drunk that they had to be wheeled out in shopping carts to waiting cars. After they returned to their frat house, the campus police were alerted, and, rushing over, they found nearly two dozen people passed out. Four of them had to be hospitalized, and one, a 20-year-old named Benjamin Wynne, died. An autopsy found that his blood-alcohol content was six times over Louisiana's legal intoxication limit. Generating headlines nationwide, the event had strengthened the task force's conviction that it was time to act.
"What would you do about an 18-year-old student who works in a bar?" Tapp snapped.
"We don't have that defined yet," Ayers admitted.
"What about a 19-year-old who owns a bar?" he pressed on.
"What we are concerned with is the average student going into bars," she replied.
"What do you mean by average student?"
"The average 18-, 19- and 20-year-old who goes into a lounge. We don't know whether their purpose in going in is to drink, but we do know they are drinking."
"Do you know that?" Tapp challenged her. "Oh, we know about what happened at L.S.U., but were they going in to play pool, maybe, and not drinking?"
By the end of her testimony, Ayers was literally shaking. And so it went for the rest of the three-hour hearing. After Dr. Deborah Cohen, a professor at the L.S.U. Medical Center, expressed her support for closing the loophole, Tapp accused her of engaging in "social" legislation. "We've seen a tremendous movement in that direction in the last three to four years," he said. At several points, Tapp asserted that because the state's legal age of majority is 18, any effort to close the loophole would constitute age discrimination.
Watching Tapp's performance, his fellow panel members struggled to keep their cool, waiting for the final vote to express their own views. It went 13 to 1 in favor of recommending that the Governor, M.J. (Mike) Foster, a Republican, introduce a bill to close the loophole and make it illegal for 18- to 20-year-olds to enter bars. For the state's alcohol-control forces, it was a sweet victory, if a small one.
In recent months, citizens' groups across the nation have been organizing against the alcohol industry. Spurred by growing concerns over drunk driving, under-age drinking and alcohol-related crime, these groups -- made up of parents and educators, churchgoers and community activists -- have been pressing for higher taxes, restrictions on advertising and crackdowns on problem outlets. Not since Prohibition has the alcohol industry been so under siege. But Big Alcohol is not about to go the way of Big Tobacco. Aggressive, flush with cash and fortified with lessons from the war on cigarettes, the alcohol lobby is fighting back with the many weapons at its command.
In Louisiana, its chief weapon is George Brown. The executive director of Louisiana's Beer Industry League (and Tapp's boss), Brown is considered by many to be the state's most powerful lobbyist. He has known virtually every Governor in the last 30 years and is on a first-name basis with many state legislators. At the league's office, a red-brick bungalow a few blocks from the Capitol building, Brown and his staff frequently play host at fund-raisers for candidates, with the beer flowing free of charge.
The influence of Brown and the Beer Industry League generally is apparent in Louisiana's lax alcohol laws. "Laissez les bon temps rouler" is the state's informal motto, and with a total of nearly 13,000 places where you can buy alcohol, it's easy to see why the good times keep rolling. Many gas stations sell beer, wine and spirits, allowing you to stock up while filling your tank; some cities and parishes have drive-in daiquiri stands. There is no last call in New Orleans, and for those wanting to carry their drinks onto the street -- it is legal to drink in public in the city -- bars keep plastic "go cups" on hand.
The day after the task-force meeting, I went to see George Brown. A crusty, balding 74-year-old, he motioned me into a chair across from him. Looking around his office, I saw that its walls were covered with photos of Brown with various state luminaries. When I mentioned the 13-to-1 task-force vote in favor of closing the loophole, he seemed unconcerned. For this was only a recommendation; both the Governor and the Legislature had to act on it for it to become law. "I promise you, there's going to be a good fight on this," Brown said with a twinkle.
To reinforce the point, he handed me a list of upcoming fund-raisers for state legislators, pointing out those the Beer Industry League was supporting. He also alluded to the backing he could expect from restaurateurs, bar owners, casino operators and other members of the state's powerful "hospitality industry." On top of it all, Brown noted, he could count on the help of Anheuser-Busch, the beer giant, which had its own lobbyist in Baton Rouge. "He may know somebody I don't," he observed genially. "That might be good for a vote or two." All in all, Brown did not seem to be a man about to panic.
The growing outcry over tobacco as a public-health menace has raised the inevitable question, Is Booze Next? Smoking is far more lethal than drinking, claiming an estimated 400,000 lives a year to alcohol's 110,000. But most of tobacco's victims are well along in years, while alcohol cuts down many in their primes. About 28,000 die from cirrhosis of the liver; more than 17,000 perish in traffic accidents. Alcohol is a factor in about half of all robberies, homicides and rapes, as it is in many cases of child abuse and wife battering. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading preventable cause of birth defects in the Western world. "Binge" drinking, meanwhile, is widely regarded as the single-most-serious problem on college campuses. Overall, some 14 million Americans suffer from alcohol abuse or alcoholism. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, alcohol causes "more economic and social damage than any other public-health problem."
It is not simply these glum statistics that spark concern. It is also the practices the industry uses to market its products -- practices that in many ways seem indistinguishable from those of tobacco. Where R.J. Reynolds had Joe Camel to tout its products, Anheuser-Busch has had a whole menagerie of lovable animals, including dogs, alligators, frogs and lizards. Like Joe, these characters have high recognition ratings among adolescents. Unlike Joe, they are regularly paraded on prime-time television. Anheuser-Busch was the single-largest advertiser during the last Super Bowl, buying four minutes to show Louie the Lizard's efforts to electrocute the popular frogs. Miller Brewing, meanwhile, ran its own Super Bowl promotion -- a contest to select "cheerleaders" to send to the event. Not many cheerleaders are over 21.
A few politicians have tried to make an issue of this. William Kennard, the recently appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has called for a study of liquor advertising on television. Representative Joseph Kennedy Jr. (Democrat of Massachusetts), a longtime industry adversary, has introduced a bill to discourage drinking that, among other things, would restrict the types of ads that could appear on prime-time television. Last summer, Senator Robert Byrd (Democrat of West Virginia) introduced a bill to eliminate the tax deductibility of money spent on alcohol advertising: alcohol, Byrd declared, was tobacco's "evil twin." And earlier this month, President Clinton publicly urged Congress to tighten the nation's laws against drunk driving.
For the most part, though, the alcohol lobby has managed to fend off these attacks. Byrd's proposal was defeated 86 to 12, and Kennedy's bill has attracted few co-sponsors. Unlike tobacco, moreover, alcohol has not been hit with many personal-liability suits. And no state has sued the industry to recoup the medical costs incurred by alcohol abuse.
As a drug, of course, alcohol differs from tobacco in several key respects. Unlike cigarettes, which are toxic in any quantity, alcohol can be consumed responsibly -- and it is by tens of millions of Americans. There is growing evidence, in fact, that moderate drinking can be beneficial, protecting against coronary disease and other killers. Then, too, alcohol executives have long acknowledged that their products can cause harm, and for years they have sponsored messages encouraging people to "know when to say when" -- a far cry from the self-immolating denials of health consequences by tobacco executives.
Such differences alone, however, cannot explain alcohol's invulnerability. An even more important factor is the industry's political power. Simply put, Big Alcohol is richer, savvier and more influential than Big Tobacco. For all its storied clout, tobacco has always been a regional product, cultivated in a handful of Southern states. By contrast, alcohol has a presence in nearly every state and city.
Consider wine. In 1997, the American wine industry racked up sales in the billions, with more than 90 percent of the wine produced by California's vintners; not surprisingly, the state's Congressional delegation is almost uniformly supportive of them. To further push their interests, the nation's vintners underwrite the Wine Institute, a $6.5 million operation with a staff of 26 in San Francisco, satellite offices in seven other cities and lobbyists in more than 40 states. The institute's Washington office is commanded by Robert Koch, a onetime staff director for Representative Richard Gephardt (Democrat of Missouri); Koch also happens to be George Bush's son-in-law.
John DeLuca, the Wine Institute's president, has long studied the travails of the tobacco companies, and he has built a whole strategy around differentiating his product from theirs. Every time a new study comes out showing alcohol's health benefits, he makes hundreds of copies and distributes them to journalists, congressmen and government officials, then follows up with phone calls and invitations to lunch. "We've worked very hard on the dietary, nutritional and life-style front," said DeLuca, a cultivated, serious man whose conversation is laced with references to vineyards, Italy and the Mediterranean diet. "People don't look on us as 'booze merchants."' It was largely because of DeLuca's prodding that for the first time, the most recent U.S. Dietary Guidelines, issued in 1995, mentioned alcohol's benefits to health, a fact the institute never fails to note in its promotional literature.
The distillers, meanwhile, are represented in Washington by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, which employs 45 and has a budget of $7.5 million. One of its largest members, Seagram, was the top "soft money" donor to the Democratic Party in 1996, giving a total of $1.2 million; its chairman, Edgar Bronfman Sr., personally donated $160,000 to the party, and his son, Edgar junior, gave $435,000. Seagram was also one of the top 10 soft-money donors to the Republican Party.
For sheer political might, however, neither wine nor spirits can compare with beer. Beer accounts for nearly 90 percent of all alcohol consumed in the United States, and it runs a political machine to match. The Beer Institute, a lobbying and public relations outfit in Washington, has an annual budget of roughly $2 million; its president, Ray McGrath, is a former congressman from Long Island. Miller Brewing has its own lobbyist in the capital and, when needed, can draw on the formidable resources of its parent, Philip Morris. Coors, meanwhile, has won political influence by financing conservative groups in Washington, including the Heritage Foundation.
Then there's Anheuser-Busch. The world's largest brewer, it controls 45 percent of the American beer market; its flagship, Budweiser, sells nearly as many cases as all Miller brands combined. The company has a payroll of nearly 25,000, annual revenues of $11 billion and brewing plants in 11 states. To defend this far-flung empire, Anheuser-Busch has a lobbyist in every state capital. In Sacramento, it has Dane Starling, a retired Army general who served as Norman Schwarzkopf's right-hand man in the gulf war. In Washington, the company has two full-time lobbyists plus 13 outside agencies ready to help with everything from antitrust matters to public relations. By a happy coincidence of geography, Anheuser-Busch is situated in the Congressional district of Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, and over the years it has contributed generously to his campaigns.
Anheuser-Busch has also backed the Democratic Party. During the 1992 Presidential campaign, Anheuser-Busch gave $105,000 to the Democratic National Committee. And during Clinton's first term, August Busch 3d, the company's chairman, was an occasional visitor to the White House; among other things, he attended the President's first state dinner, for the Emperor of Japan. In the 1996 election cycle, Anheuser-Busch donated more than $400,000 to the Democratic Party. No wonder the company's trademark Clydesdales were invited to march in the inaugural parade. More important, the Clinton Administration has not proposed a single new tax or advertising restriction on beer or alcohol generally.
No group better exemplifies big alcohol's aggressiveness than the National Beer Wholesalers Association (N.B.W.A.), which has recently emerged as one of the Republican Party's biggest backers. The beer wholesalers are the people who deliver beer from the brewery to the retailer. The typical wholesaler owns a warehouse and a fleet of trucks, has three dozen employees and takes in $9.3 million a year. Most are prominent citizens accustomed to speaking their minds. And they are found in every Congressional district, providing a powerful network that can be mobilized at a moment's notice.
The N.B.W.A. is housed in a squat, modern office building in Alexandria, Va. Its 24-person staff is directed by Ron Sarasin, a genial, polished, tanned-in-winter ex-congressman from Connecticut and former chief lobbyist for the National Restaurant Association. When Sarasin became president of the wholesalers, in 1990, it was a sleepy organization with little political influence. Just how little became clear a few months after Sarasin took over, when Congress, seeking to reduce the Federal deficit, voted to double the excise tax on beer, to $18 a barrel. It was the first such increase in 40 years, and while it did not begin to make up for inflation over that period, the industry felt it was taking a hit. Intent on boosting the beer wholesalers' presence on Capitol Hill, Sarasin enlisted the services of David Rehr.
In conservative circles, Rehr (pronounced RARE) was already something of a legend. The son of a Chicago postman, Rehr had been involved in politics since 1980, when as a student at St. John's University in central Minnesota he went to work for the Congressional campaign of a young Republican named Vin Weber. When Weber won, Rehr accompanied him to Washington, and over the next six years he got to know the new insurgent breed of House Republican (Newt Gingrich included). In 1986, Rehr joined the National Federation of Independent Business, where he honed his lobbying skills and antigovernment creed. In one memorable battle, over new health-care regulations for small businesses, Rehr defeated Dan Rostenkowski and the rest of the Democratic leadership. Impressed, Sarasin convinced him to come work for the N.B.W.A. as its vice president for government affairs.
He certainly had his work cut out for him. "On a scale of 1 to 10, the N.B.W.A. was at a 3," Rehr recalled. "My job was to take it to 7.5 and eventually to 10." We were talking in a conference room at the association's headquarters, a building whose interior is so spotless that it feels like a museum. With his smooth face, thick brown hair, crisp white shirt and tasseled loafers buffed to a military shine, the 38-year-old Rehr seemed spotless, too. Unlike many lobbyists who shun the limelight, he is expansive about his efforts to promote beer -- efforts that, he quickly noted, differed sharply from tobacco's.
"The tobacco industry had the attitude of an elephant hiding behind a telephone pole," he said. As an example, he cited Duke University: it was founded with tobacco money, but industry executives, fearing negative publicity, don't mention this. In contrast, Rehr said: "Our view as beer wholesalers is that we're proud of our product -- we're going to put the elephant on the street. We have to make sure we remind people that beer is an integral part of our culture."
That philosophy guided Rehr as he set about remaking the N.B.W.A. His first task was to devise a catchy slogan that summed up the work of beer wholesalers. From his time on the Hill, he knew that when meeting members, "you don't have 15 minutes to explain who you are." Batting around ideas with a friend, he eventually hit on "Family Businesses Distributing America's Beverage." The phrase evoked beer's association with baseball, picnics and the Fourth of July, and everything subsequently sent to the Hill would bear it.
Step 2 was increasing the N.B.W.A.'s visibility. An early opportunity came in January 1993. With President Clinton preparing his health-care-reform package, there was talk of financing it in part by another tax hike on alcohol, beer included. Rehr immediately sent out faxes to the association's members, urging them to call the White House and express their opposition. The phone lines were soon jammed, and the proposed increase was quickly dropped. Encouraged, Rehr set up a "blast fax" capacity at his office, enabling him to send out action alerts to N.B.W.A. members, as well as to members of Congress, when urgent issues arise.
To lend weight to those appeals, Rehr moved to expand the N.B.W.A.'s political action committee. Prior to his arrival, Six PAC, as it is informally called, was spending about $430,000 per two-year election cycle. Under Rehr's prodding, that figure quickly jumped to $1.5 million -- more than even the A.F.L.-C.I.O. could muster through its PAC. Convinced that the best way to promote the wholesalers' interests was to elect a pro-business Congress, Rehr bestowed most of that money on Republicans. He also made a point of giving to candidates in close races, thus increasing their sense of indebtedness. The N.B.W.A.'s money helped engineer the Republican takeover of the House in 1994, an event that gave the association many powerful friends in Congress.
Those friends have been eager to show their gratitude. Every spring, for instance, the association holds a legislative conference in Washington, bringing in wholesalers and brewers from around the country to lobby on key issues. For the 1997 meeting, more than 800 showed up. They were addressed by a number of congressmen, including Republican leaders as well as Dick Gephardt, who praised Anheuser-Busch and expressed support for H.R. 158, an N.B.W.A.-inspired bill to roll back the 1991 beer-tax increase.
When it was first introduced, H.R. 158 was given little chance. But the N.B.W.A. made it a top legislative priority, and at the spring conference, Rehr roused the troops with a stirring description of all the jobs and sales that the earlier hike had cost the industry. Soon after, the wholesalers descended like an angry pack on Congress, seeking out their individual representatives and urging them to support H.R. 158. It now has more than 80 co-sponsors.
In some cases, Rehr has worked hard to make sure Congress does not act. A good example occurred two years ago, after Seagram, breaking a 48-year-old voluntary ban on hard-liquor television ads, decided to begin running commercials for Crown Royal whisky and other products. With public protest flaring, subcommittees in both the House and Senate scheduled hearings on the issue. Rehr -- worried that beer's own right to advertise would be called into question -- met with several Senate staff members to express his concern. "I made the case that we have been responsible in our advertising," he said. "We didn't want the hearing to become a circus. They'd bring in all the 'neo-prohibitionists' and let them go crazy. And they'd bring in the spirits people, who would dump all over us."
With Anheuser-Busch and the Beer Institute also weighing in, the hearings were postponed several times, then dropped altogether. Owing to beer industry pressure, then, Congress passed up a major opportunity to investigate the issue of alcohol ads on television.
Rehr has made some missteps. In 1996, for instance, he suggested that the N.B.W.A. invite William Bennett to speak at its annual fall convention. "When I was working on Capitol Hill in the 80's and Bill Bennett was drug czar," Rehr recalled, "I heard him give one of the most amazing talks on the physiological addiction of crack cocaine. I thought it would be really neat to have him come talk to the beer wholesalers about how bad drugs are, and how good beer is, and how we've been responsible in fighting under-age drinking." Bennett was interested but had a scheduling conflict. In early 1997, the N.B.W.A. approached him again about speaking at that year's convention, and this time Bennett agreed to do so (for $40,000 for a 35-minute speech).
In the interim, however, Bennett had published a book, called "Body Count," on the fight against drugs and crime. While mostly about illegal drugs, the book included a 13-page section on "Liquor, Disorder, and Crime." "Make no mistake," the book asserts, "liquor is as much a part of the problem as drugs, perhaps a bigger part." The problem, "Body Count" asserts, is particularly acute in poor inner-city neighborhoods, "where liquor outlets cast their shadows everywhere." As a remedy, the book calls for measures aimed at reducing alcohol consumption, including stricter zoning codes and limits on advertising.
Bennett did not actually write the section on alcohol; one of his co-authors, John DiIulio Jr., a leading commentator on crime, did. But Bennett fully endorsed it, and when the book was brought to the wholesalers' attention, they decided to disinvite him. Bennett vented his displeasure on The New York Times Op-Ed page. "I have a reputation for being a conservative," he wrote. "And I am. But conservatives need to go where the facts, not ideology, lead. And the facts tell us that there is a very strong link between alcohol availability, consumption and crime." He added: "If the liquor industry does not start acting in a more socially responsible way, it may soon find itself held in the same kind of esteem in which the tobacco companies are now held."
Discussing the matter, Rehr did not try to conceal his own pique. "I think Bill Bennett got ticked off that he couldn't make $40,000 for a 35-minute speech, so he decided to lash out at the beer people," he said. "I don't want to pick a fight with the drug czar, because he does have a lot of followers and a lot of influence. But I think it's very shortsighted of him to attack an industry that helps elect and re-elect people who work with him on a lot of issues." Overall, the incident highlighted the tensions between the generally conservative beer industry and Republicans concerned with alcohol's corrosive effects on the commonweal.
Rehr has done his best to make sure those tensions remain dormant. From time to time, for instance, he attends the regular Wednesday meetings of conservative activists held at the offices of Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and a well-known Republican networker. Represented are some 60 groups, including the National Rifle Association, the National Right to Life Committee, the Gun Owners of America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Christian Coalition and the Family Research Council (run by the former Reagan aide Gary Bauer). Despite their varied agendas, these groups share an interest in keeping Congress antigovernment, pro-business and staunchly Republican, and the meetings provide an opportunity to coordinate strategies.
For Rehr, they also provide a chance to work with groups that might otherwise cause him trouble. The Christian Coalition, for example, might be expected to support such measures as sin taxes on alcohol. In 1996, however, Rehr shrewdly enlisted it in lobbying for a bill that would keep nonprofit organizations from using Federal funds to lobby Congress, a cherished goal of the coalition. "When beer wholesalers think of working with the Christian Coalition, they get a little nervous," Rehr said with a smile. "'Hey, they're the bad guys,' people say." As a result of his work, though, the beer wholesalers have effectively neutralized the coalition on alcohol issues.
More generally, the wholesalers, through the deft deployment of money and contacts, have helped head off any moves in Congress to address the public-health consequences of their product -- something Big Tobacco failed to do.
For most of the last 15 years, George Hacker has run the alcohol-policies project of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and perhaps more than anyone in Washington, he understands how good Big Alcohol is at what it does. Courteous and soft-spoken, with gray-flecked dark hair, small-frame glasses and a slight build, Hacker in person seems unassuming, but he is the undisputed general of the nation's alcohol-control forces. As Hacker hastens to assert, he is no Carrie Nation; last year, he ordered a case of Champagne to celebrate his 50th birthday. He does, however, believe that alcohol is too readily available at too low a price, and at his office near Dupont Circle he is forever working to change that.
"Like tobacco, alcohol imposes enormous costs on society," Hacker said. "The question is, Is the industry doing enough to reduce these costs or to compensate society for them?" Big Alcohol, he added, "likes to look just at the individual. That's the point of its messages to 'drink responsibly' and 'know when to say when.' But it's not simply a matter of individual responsibility. Because this is an addictive substance. And because it can be purchased 24 hours a day and is sold in colorfully packaged containers that appeal to kids. These are the kinds of things that we're trying to target, much as in the tobacco debate."
Yet as Hacker is the first to admit, alcohol is a far more formidable adversary than tobacco. "Alcohol has been a lot smarter than tobacco," he grudgingly noted. "It's been forced to because of the experience of Prohibition. The industry knows what can happen if it's not careful."
Hacker's struggles are compounded by his lack of resources. He has a staff of just seven and a budget of $500,000. He cannot afford to take anyone to lunch. And his organization has no political action committee to make contributions to members of Congress. As a result, he is constantly being outmaneuvered by the industry. "Everything takes place behind closed doors," he lamented. "Nobody wants to get up there and defend the alcohol industry, or its advertising." Hacker is particularly disappointed in the Clinton Administration, which he believes has an even worse record on the issue than the Bush Administration. Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, has met with both the Distilled Spirits Council and the Wine Institute but has turned down requests to meet with public-health advocates on alcohol.
Even religious organizations have shunned Hacker. "We've tried to recruit the Christian Coalition -- for instance, on the liquor-advertising matter," he complained. "It would seem a natural for them. I've talked to their lobbyist. But they've been playing worse than hard to get."
MADD has been no less frustrated. Founded in 1980, Mothers Against Drunk Driving is today among the most respected grass-roots organizations in the country. It is also among the largest, with tens of thousands of volunteers working through 600 chapters and community action teams to combat drunk driving and other forms of alcohol abuse. Based in Irving, Tex., MADD has no office in Washington, making do there with a single part-time lobbyist. "We're not a bunch of politicians or high-priced lawyers," said Katherine Prescott, who recently ended a two-year term as president. "We don't have the money to invest in lobbyists and PAC's."
As president, Prescott, who joined MADD after her 16-year-old son was killed by a drunken driver, set as her top goal lowering the nation's legal definition of intoxication to a blood-alcohol-content level of 0.08. The National Highway Safety Administration has determined that a typical 170-pound man has to consume more than four drinks on an empty stomach in one hour to exceed 0.08. At that level, its studies have found, most drivers are significantly impaired. Yet 33 states have set their blood-alcohol limit at 0.1.
In early 1997, bills were introduced in the House and Senate to cut Federal highway funds to states that failed to adopt the 0.08 standard. To help line up co-sponsors, Prescott began making trips to Washington from her home in Greenville, N.C. At every turn, however, she encountered Rick Berman, the general counsel of the American Beverage Institute. The institute represents some of the nation's largest restaurant chains, including Thank God It's Friday, Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and Hooters, and it works closely with the alcohol industry. Fearing the effect 0.08 might have on their businesses, the institute directed Berman to fight the legislation. A tall, balding, energetic lawyer, Berman began writing op-ed pieces, meeting with journalists and appearing at hearings. If 0.08 were adopted, he warned, in what became a kind of rallying cry, a 120-pound woman having two six-ounce glasses of wine over a two-hour period would be subject to arrest and imprisonment.
Prescott bridles at such talk. The American Beverage Institute "has made this issue its life's work, saying we're trying to keep people from social drinking," she said. "Frankly, I don't care how many drinks a guy has -- two, three, four or whatever -- if 0.08 is the level most people are impaired at, that should be the legal limit."
MADD received a big boost earlier this month when President Clinton announced his support for 0.08, the adoption of which would save more than 500 lives a year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. A few days after the President's announcement, the Senate voted to adopt 0.08, but a tough fight is expected in the House, where Berman is concentrating his energies, and where David Rehr and the beer wholesalers are mobilizing their many friends against the bill.
Out in the field, away from the capital, things don't look all that different. It is true that at the grass roots, the nation's alcohol-control forces have been most aggressive, and have finally fought their way into the corridors of power. But progress has been slow and difficult.
Louisiana's experience is in many ways the most telling. Just a few years ago, members of the MADD chapter in Baton Rouge could barely get a hearing in the Legislature. Linda Hull, a volunteer, still gets worked up when she recalls what it was like. A Louisiana native with short blond hair, large eyes and a friendly manner, Hull joined MADD in 1991. Four years earlier, her eldest daughter, a student at the University of Texas, was killed when a drunken 18-year-old plowed head-on into her car. Five months later, Hull's 17-year-old stepdaughter was being driven home by her date; drunk, he ran a stop sign, and the car was hit broadside, killing the girl. Then, in 1991, Hull's youngest daughter, a junior-college student, was walking out of a Louisiana dance hall when a drunk driver lost control and hit her; she, too, was killed.
Seeking an outlet for her grief, Hull joined MADD. In 1993, she made her first appearance before a legislative committee. The issue was Louisiana's drinking-age law. At the time, the law prohibited those under 21 from buying alcohol but allowed bars to serve them -- a surreal concession to the industry that effectively gutted the law. Intent on dramatizing the toll this had taken, Hull expected an attentive audience. Instead, while she testified, the legislators chatted with one another and walked in and out of the room. Later, in the lobby, a state senator approached her and asked her to go to a party with him. "I couldn't believe this guy was coming on to me," she recalled.
By contrast, when it was George Brown's turn to testify, the senators listened raptly and called him by his first name. Back then, any measure seeking to toughen the state's drinking laws could never even make it out of committee. In a reflection, perhaps, of the nature of Louisiana politics, the commissioner of the alcohol control board was a good friend of Brown's.
Then, in 1992, Richard Ieyoub was elected the state's attorney general. An activist Democrat, Ieyoub wanted to tackle the problem of substance abuse in Louisiana. To get a sense of its scope, he began holding hearings around the state. "When the students were asked what the biggest problem was in their schools in terms of substance abuse, I expected them to say marijuana, or crack cocaine, but in every area in the state, metropolitan as well as rural, the answer was alcohol," recalled Ieyoub, a stocky, forceful man whose office in the Capitol building is crammed with mementos of Napoleon, Churchill and other heroes.
Ieyoub's first priority was getting rid of the provision that allowed bars to serve those under 21. To push for change, Ieyoub formed a coalition of police officials, treatment providers, community activists and religious groups. "Legislators began to get calls from their constituents," he recalled. "They began to sense a shift in people's attitudes toward alcohol."
Finally, in 1995, the Legislature voted to make it illegal for bar owners to serve those under 21. The industry challenged the new law in court, but it was eventually upheld. At long last, Louisiana had joined the rest of the nation in adopting the 21-year-old standard. A problem remained, however. While the new law made it illegal for 18- to 20-year-olds to drink in bars, it did not prohibit them from entering bars -- a loophole that made the law unenforceable in most cases.
Once more, the alcohol-control forces went to work. This time, they would have an important new ally. Dr. Richard Scribner was a preventive-medicine specialist at the University of Southern California School of Medicine. In the early 1990's, Scribner became interested in the link between alcohol availability and crime, and a study he did in Los Angeles County revealed that the rates of violent crime were measurably higher in areas that had more liquor outlets, even when such factors as unemployment, income level and racial composition were taken into account.
Scribner's work came to the attention of Dr. Deborah Cohen of the Louisiana State University Medical School in New Orleans. Contacting him, Cohen argued that if he really wanted to study outlet density, he should come to New Orleans. Scribner, who was living on a farm north of Los Angeles with his wife, four sons and five goats, was reluctant, but Cohen eventually made him an offer he could not refuse, and so in late 1994 he became an assistant professor at the L.S.U. Medical School.
He was not quite prepared for the Big Easy. "I thought, 'Wow, this place is different,"' said the 43-year-old Scribner, a tall, balding, ebullient man. "It was a shock to see people getting out of cars drinking. There were people walking through malls drinking. Even the doughnut shops served alcohol."
As in Los Angeles, Scribner went about mapping the city. In the end, he found that census tracts with two liquor outlets had an average of two homicides every four years, compared with one homicide in tracts with just one outlet.
Once his findings were in, Scribner began sharing them with police officials and inner-city church ministers. City council members were so impressed with his maps that they prepared new ordinances aimed at making it easier to crack down on problem outlets. Scribner also met with representatives of MADD and other grass-roots groups, providing scholarly evidence for the positions they had instinctively taken.
Meanwhile, a series of financial scandals was weeding out some of George Brown's friends in the State Legislature. And Edwin Edwards, the freewheeling Governor, was replaced by Mike Foster. A Republican businessman with close ties to the state's oil and gas industries, Foster would seem an unlikely ally for the alcohol-control movement. But as a state senator he had shown reformist tendencies, and soon after becoming Governor he appointed a new, more independent head of the alcohol-control board. He also attended a MADD news conference. "From that moment on, people talked with us," said Cathy Morgan Childers, the director of victim services at MADD's Baton Rouge office. "It gave us a lot of validation." At MADD's suggestion, the Governor set up a task force to explore ways of getting the state's drunk drivers off the roads.
Then, in late August, Benjamin Wynne of L.S.U. died from alcohol intoxication. Amid the ensuing outcry, Scribner took his mapping techniques to Baton Rouge. Within a half-mile of the L.S.U. campus, he found, there were 50 alcohol outlets -- 16 on one block. "This is a density equivalent to what you would find in the heart of the French Quarter," Scribner wrote in a blistering column in The New Orleans Times-Picayune. The alcohol industry was not pleased. With his maps, Scribner was stirring up the populace. "He's definitely had an effect on the political process," observed Chris Young, executive director of the Louisiana Association of Alcoholic Beverage Licensees, a group of alcohol retailers.
A tall, burly 35-year-old lawyer given to speaking his mind, Young is being groomed to take George Brown's place as head of the Beer Industry League when he retires. Speaking in the Rivershack Tavern, a charmingly ramshackle bar on the banks of the Mississippi River, Young described his efforts to make bars more responsible through server-training programs, in which bartenders are taught to recognize minors and those drinking too much. In the end, though, he said, the best way to prevent abuse among the young would be to lower the drinking age to 19. That way, he said, teen-agers would do their drinking in bars and other controlled environments, rather than in private apartments and frat houses, where, he said, abuse was more likely.
Young became most animated when Scribner's name came up. "He's so far out there," he said with a scowl. Questioning Scribner's reasons for coming to New Orleans, he said: "All of a sudden he appeared here, talking about raising taxes and the like. I believe he was imported to the state of Louisiana to attack the alcohol beverage industry." Scribner's research, he added, "needs to be discredited."
Young made an effort to do that at the Dec. 3 meeting of the Governor's task force on drunk driving. Scribner, he said, had "spent thousands of dollars on three studies, funded by who knows who, and he drew certain conclusions, and uses them against certain entities, but we're saying there's strong evidence that he doesn't know what he's talking about." Ending with a flourish, he said, "I am addressing the credibility and competence of Dr. Scribner." In the end, however, the task force sided with Scribner, voting overwhelmingly to recommend that the Governor introduce legislation in 1998 to close the loophole.
This week, the Louisiana legislature is to begin a special session devoted to fiscal matters. The Governor, though, can introduce a few nonfiscal bills of pressing importance. With the memory of Benjamin Wynne still fresh, and his own task force taking such a strong stand, alcohol-control advocates regarded it as foregone that Governor Foster would include the loophole-closing bill in his package. Yet more than two months after the task force's vote, he had yet to make a decision. "We, like any other state -- and probably more so, because of the culture here -- have problems with alcohol," Foster explained in an interview. "But I've got some major things I need to get done, and since it's a short session, we want to keep controversial things out."
On March 12, Foster did finally decide to go ahead and introduce the bill. Its prospects in the Legislature remain uncertain, however, and even if the measure does carry, the alcohol-control movement has no other item on its agenda, like tax hikes or advertising restrictions, that would further challenge the industry. For all the new activism in Louisiana, the liquor lobby there remains firmly in command.
The same is generally true elsewhere. The new push by community groups has been met by an equally vigorous counterpush by the industry. And in terms of money, influence and connections, the public-health forces simply can't compete. From Baton Rouge to Washington, Big Alcohol seems unassailable.
Of course, that's what was once said of Big Tobacco. As recently as five years ago, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds and the rest of that industry seemed politically invincible. Then came a series of unforeseen developments -- the leak of sensitive documents, the emergence of a whistle-blower, the public relations debacle of tobacco executives testifying under oath in Congress and, finally, the election of a President ready to take on the industry -- and the walls that Big Tobacco had so carefully erected came tumbling down. Big Alcohol, having so intently studied tobacco's fortunes, knows that it could suffer the same fate. Industry executives, in fact, live in constant dread that some event -- a celebrity killed by a drunken driver, say -- will ignite a blaze of public indignation that they will not be able to put out.
But David Rehr, George Brown and all the rest are working hard to make sure that their business does not go up in smoke.

HEADLINE: The Nuke Of the 90's

 BODY:
Although Roger Altman's apocalyptic metaphor strikes me as a bit too vivid, his arguments are fundamentally correct ("The Nuke of the 90's," March 1). The viability of the Asian economy and the long-term stability of the international marketplace are tied tightly to the International Monetary Fund. In Asia, continued hemorrhaging would harm U.S. interests, not the least of which is maintaining export markets for American goods and agricultural products.
The funds the President has requested for the I.M.F. would provide loans to governments in the Pacific Basin region struggling to get back on their feet. And remember these are loans, repaid with interest: they don't cost the American taxpayer a dime. Financing the I.M.F. now would foster reform because it could send a signal to the I.M.F. that we are closely watching its disbursement of the money we provide. 
 Ultimately, the I.M.F. debate is about whether or not the United States wants to continue to exercise global economic leadership. Should Congress fail to authorize the money requested by the Administration, we will send an unmistakable message to the international financial community: America is undependable in times of economic crisis. Clearly, this is the wrong message, one we must never send if we are serious about a prosperous future for ourselves and for future generations.

HEADLINE: What's Doing In;
Norfolk

BYLINE: By SOL HURWITZ; SOL HURWITZ, a freelance writer, visits Norfolk frequently.

 BODY:
Spring has come early to Norfolk. Thanks to a mild winter and the wettest February on record, the camellias, tulip magnolias and Bradford pears have all blossomed ahead of schedule. Even the azaleas are poised for an early debut.
Spring has summoned an unprecedented flowering of the arts, as well. From April 23 to May 10, Norfolk will be host to the Virginia Waterfront International Arts Festival, with 100 artists and companies from around the world performing classical music, opera, ballet, theater and jazz. 
 The festival, now in its second year, also provides a showcase for Norfolk's resident arts organizations: the Virginia Symphony, Virginia Opera, Virginia Stage Company and Chrysler Museum of Art.
Although Norfolk is the hub of Hampton Roads -- a metropolitan area that also includes Portsmouth, Hampton, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake and Newport News -- festival events are held throughout the area and in Williamsburg, an hour's drive away.
Norfolk's maritime history dates from Colonial times, when explorers and merchants were enticed to its shores by its gentle climate and natural deep-water harbor. Today Norfolk is the site of the world's largest naval base and home port for 124 ships of the Atlantic Fleet.
The Chesapeake Bay and the Elizabeth River virtually surround Norfolk, while lesser waterways meander through its neighborhoods. The sights and sounds of seagoing vessels -- from battleships to tugs -- form a delightful backdrop for touring the city's sparkling waterfront.
Downtown, however, visitors are hearing sounds of a different sort: the thud of pile drivers and the roar of trucks and cranes. The MacArthur Center, a 21-acre shopping mall scheduled for completion in March 1999, will accommodate 150 shops, movies and restaurants, as well as 4,500 cars, overshadowing some of the historic buildings on its perimeter.
Accordingly, the Federal-period Moses Myers House nearby is transforming its garden from one that thrives on sun to one that enjoys the shade.
 
Sightseeing
The Chrysler Museum of Art, 245 West Olney Road, (757) 664-6200, a Florentine Renaissance building that opened in 1933, has masterpieces from the 14th to 20th centuries, mostly from the collection of Walter P. Chrysler Jr., son of the Chrysler Corporation's founder and husband of a Norfolk woman. The newly remodeled East Wing houses 19th-century American sculpture and modern art by Pollock, Rothko, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Diebenkorn and Rosenquist. The museum's glass collection contains 8,000 objects, including a comprehensive collection of Tiffany blown glass. Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Sunday, 1 to 5 P.M. Admission: $4.
The Norfolk Botanical Garden, 6700 Azalea Garden Road, near the airport, (757) 441-5830, has one of the largest collections of azaleas, camellias, roses and rhododendrons on the East Coast. Hours: 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. through April 14, to 7 P.M. April 15 to Oct. 15. Admission: $3.50.
Nauticus is a child-friendly, interactive maritime center at 1 Waterside Drive; (800) 664-1080. "Antarctica," which explores life on the coldest continent, runs through Sept. 7. Open Tuesday to Saturday 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Sunday noon to 5 P.M. through May 24, and from Memorial Day to Labor Day, daily 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Admission: $7.50, children $5, seniors $6.50. The real highlight of Nauticus is free: the Hampton Roads Naval Museum, which depicts American naval history with paintings, ship models and shipwreck artifacts.
The Moses Myers House, 331 Bank Street, (757) 664-6283, was built in 1792 by Norfolk's first permanent Jewish settler. The house -- in a late Georgian, early Federal style -- contains much of the original furniture, silver and porcelain,and Gilbert Stuart portraits of Moses Myers, a shipowner and merchant, and his wife, Eliza. Open Tuesday to Saturday noon to 5 P.M. through March 31, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. April 1 to Dec. 31, Sunday 1 to 5 P.M. Admission $3.
St. Paul's Church, 201 St. Paul's Boulevard, built in 1739, is the city's oldest building and the only one to survive the burning of Norfolk in 1776. A British cannonball remains lodged in the southeastern wall. Open to visitors Tuesday to Friday 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Tours: (757) 627-4353.
A good walking tour of the city's historic Ghent and Freemason neighborhoods might start in Ghent at the Chrysler Museum and continue along The Hague, an inlet of the Elizabeth River, on Mowbray Arch with its charming Romanesque and Colonial Revival houses. A right onto Fairfax Avenue, with its Romanesque and Georgian Revival houses, and another right onto Botetourt Street leads to a footbridge over The Hague. From there, York Street, one of Freemason's main thoroughfares, is just across busy Brambleton Avenue. Brick sidewalks and cobblestone streets take you past Freemason's art galleries and Greek and Colonial Revival houses, especially along Bute, Botetourt and West Freemason Streets. At the end of Yarmouth Street, the pagodalike Taiwanese Marine Observation Tower, the harbor and waterfront combine for a striking vista.

After Attack, Guatemala Steps Up Security Efforts

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

 BODY:
ALARMED that the widely publicized rape and robbery of a group of American college students in January is scaring away foreign tourists and hampering efforts to rebuild the economy, the Guatemalan Government has begun a wide-ranging campaign to improve security for foreign visitors.
The effort includes free escort service by police officers or soldiers for any tourist group that requests protection, as well as an increased deployment of police and military forces in areas frequented by tourists, which include some of the most magnificent archeological sites, mountains and jungles in Central America. Nevertheless, the State Department advises visiting Americans that Guatemala "is still struggling in its battle against common crime." 
 Since Guatemala's 36-year civil war ended in December 1996, both the armed forces and the police have been purged in an effort to eliminate human rights abuses. As a result, Government security forces are stretched thin and patrol various areas on a rotating schedule. In addition, authorities say, some former soldiers and policemen have formed gangs specializing in robbery and kidnapping.
Because tourism has become Guatemala's second largest source of foreign currency, exceeded only by coffee, officials are under pressure to prevent any incidents that would further damage the tourism industry. A new national, civilian police force is being trained, but it is not expected to reach its full strength of 20,000 officers for two years.
In the January attack, 16 students and professors from St. Mary's College in Maryland, were aboard a bus on the busy Pacific Highway near the town of Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa about 50 miles southwest of the capital, Guatemala City, when their vehicle was halted by seven armed men and forced into a sugar cane field. The passengers were robbed, and five women were raped.
Pedro Lamport, the Guatemalan Ambassador to the United States, described the assailants as a gang of professional criminals; Guatemalan authorities do not believe the students were singled out as Americans. Indeed, a Mexican couple was robbed and the woman raped in the same area just a few days earlier.
The Interior Minister, Rodolfo Mendoza, described the ambush as an isolated incident, but State Department officials noted that it was the fifth rape of American women in Guatemala since July 1997.
The Guatemalan authorities have arrested five suspects in the January attack, one of whom is reported to have told detectives that the gang specifically targeted tour buses. No date has been set for their trials.
Gen. Jorge Perussina, director of security for the Guatemalan Institute of Tourism, or Inguat, a Government agency, said that as a result of the Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa attack, highway surveillance has been beefed up in all areas frequented by tourists, helicopter patrols have begun and an additional 8,600 soldiers and police officers are being assigned to highway patrols.
As part of this effort, Inguat is offering the escort service. Requests must be made at least 72 hours in advance, and should include the itinerary and size of the group. Inguat can be contacted by telephone at (502) 331-2369 or by fax at (502) 331-8843. The Tourist Protection Office on the third floor of its headquarters at 7a Avenida 1-17, Zona 4 in Guatemala City.
Tourists who want security information before heading for Guatemala or who find themselves in an emergency and require assistance once there can also call Inguat at two new toll-free telephone numbers. In the United States, call (888) 464-8281; in Guatemala, (801) 464-8281.
"We also have a new pamphlet out, which is being distributed at airports and the main bus terminals," General Perussina said, "that gives people advice on preventive measures, such as only taking licensed taxis and leaving valuables in safety deposit boxes."
Other recommendations include parking cars only in lots, never stopping to pick up hitchhikers and never exploring mountains and trails alone.
For its part, the State Department last issued a consular information sheet in September 1997, warning that "no area in Guatemala can be definitively characterized as 'always safe.' " American officials said that the group attacked in January had seen that report; they added, however, that there were no plans to revise the information sheet, saying that all of the danger zones and recommended precautions in the report remain in effect.
"While violent crime has been a serious and growing problem in Guatemala for years, 1997 has seen a marked increase in incidents involving American citizens," the advisory warned. It listed the Pacaya volcano, south of the capital; the resort of Panajachel at Lake Atitlan; the main border crossing with Mexico at Tecun Uman, and parts of the capital and Antigua as places requiring special vigilance.

HEADLINE: Q&A/Guy R. Mazza;
Counsel for Keeping Utility Bills Down

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
THE Office of Consumer Counsel represents customers of the state's five regulated utilities -- gas, electric, cable, water and telephone. The name doesn't ring bells with most people, but it probably should. The Consumer Counsel's primary task is to keep those monthly bills reasonable.
When a utility makes its case for a rate increase before the Department of Public Utility Control, the Office of Consumer Counsel is there to argue the customers' case. "Generally we determine that what the company asks should be reduced," said Guy R. Mazza, who has been Consumer Counsel since June. 
 The Counsel also gets involved when utility companies, say, decide to sell land; it does some consumer advocacy in complaint matters and monitors the quality of service. When legislation is proposed in the utility area, the Counsel provides testimony.
"This work is particularly satisfying to me," Mr. Mazza says. "What we do in this office can have a beneficial effect on millions of people."
"Regulation is a substitute for competition. Until competition comes we must make sure utility companies do not charge unfair prices," said Mr. Mazza. "Rates and services effect every one of our residents, businesses, industries and the economy of our state as a whole."
Mr. Mazza, a self-described "vigorous consumer advocate," is head of an office that includes six lawyers and four financial experts. Last year this small group handled 364 proceedings.
Sometimes the Office of Consumer Counsel is confused with the Department of Consumer Affairs, which deals with non-utility matters. But both consumer agencies have been involved in slamming -- an increasingly contentious issue concerning telephone company transfers of customers without customer permission. In 1997 the entire state building that houses the Office of Consumer Counsel and the Department of Utility Control was slammed.
Some of the Counsel's work is high profile indeed. For several years it have been battling Northeast Utilities over charges connected to the shutdown of Connecticut's four nuclear plants, three on orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This year they are particularly active in electric rate restructuring.
"I think competition is coming in all the utilities with the possible exception of water," Mr. Mazza said.
Recently Mr. Mazza met to discuss his work. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. What is the cost issue associated with the shutdown of Connecticut's nuclear power plants?
A. The N.R.C. shut down the three Millstone units; they were placed on the N.R.C.'s watch list and require approval to reactivate. Because these plants are not providing power and haven't for some time, the Office of Consumer Counsel has taken the position that they should be removed from rate base. They are not considered used and useful assets right now.
Millstone I has been taken out of rate base effective March 1. It is the oldest of the three plants and the most likely not to restart. The elimination of Millstone I from rates will result in a savings of approximately $30 million for consumers. Customers should see a reduction in their electric bills of approximately 1.4 percent.
Connecticut Yankee was taken out of service by the owners, Connecticut Light and Power. The O.C.C. wants to protect consumers from any excessive decommissioning costs. This matter is being adjudicated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington. We are very concerned that rate payers not foot the bill for any expenses which are a result of the imprudence of C.L.&P. In a recent proceeding we got a disallowance of $960 million attributed to replacement power and repair costs. If there is any chance that rate payers be asked to pay for these costs we will continue to fight that.
Q. What do stranded costs, spending by utilities that could not be recouped in a competitive market, play in electric restructuring?
A. We do not feel that rate payers should be saddled with the full payment of these costs. This could amount to billions of dollars.
We feel properly enacted restructuring legislation will provide benefits to rate payers. Right now electric rates are very high. Beginning in 1999 35 percent of the State's population living within distressed municipalities will receive this reduction. By July 1, 2000. everybody will have the choice of choosing another company or staying with their current company and receiving a 10 percent discount from their current company.
C.L.&P. and United Illuminating will continue to be the transmission and distribution companies and will continue to be a regulated monopoly, but competition is definitely coming in the generation of electricity
Q. Is there competition in the gas industry?
A. Competition is not available to residential customers. Ideally it should be. It is a big industry and getting bigger with the restructuring of the electric industry. Gas cycle turbines would generate electricity much more economically than currently. They would supplement or replace nuclear, coal and oil as sources of generation. The gas cycle turbines can be built on a very small piece of land, they are cleaner and can look like office buildings.
Q. Were there major cases involving water companies last year?
A. There are about 45 water companies with more than 50 customers and about 500 small ones with fewer than than 50 customers. Two of the major ones, Eastern Connecticut Regional Water Company and Bridgeport Hydraulic, wanted rate increases last year.
We participated in both proceedings and were effective. Eastern was awarded less than half its requested rate increase and Bridgeport Hydraulic will be allowed to increase its rates 12.7 percent rather than the 13.4 percent it requested.
Q. In 1996 Connecticut added the 860 area code. Will it need new telephone area codes soon?
A. The North American Numbering Plan Administration told Connecticut it would need new area codes because of the proliferation of cellular phones, fax machines and modems. The advent of competition has also used up large quantities of telephone numbers. The existing codes, 203 and 860, were expected to be exhausted by 1999. This will not happen.
When we do need two new area codes there will be two main methods for assigning them.
One is to do it demographically and, for example, divide the state roughly into quarters and assign a different number to each quarter. One of the problems with that is any business in the new area code would have to change stationery, etc. They are not happy.
The alternative, called distributive overlay, would provide new numbers to people who move into the state and wouldn't require any existing phone customers to change their number. With this system you would have to dial 10 numbers for local calls and 11 for long distance. People object to that.
The D.P.U.C. just ruled that choosing one of these methods is not necessary now. Instead they instituted two new measures. One is number portability which means the customer keeps the number even if he decides to switch phone companies. The other is called number pooling and it reduces waste in number assignments. The need for new area codes can be delayed indefinitely.
Q. What is the status of telephone competition and what about the proposed sale of Southern New England Telephone to SBC Communications?
A. Connecticut was one of the forerunner states in the development of telephone competition. Full competition is not here yet. There is competition in intrastate and long distance, but not in local telephone service.
O.C.C. wants to promote effective competition. A subcommittee is in charge of implementation. The OCC will chair this group which includes SNET and 35 potential competitors. Customer selection through a ballot of local phone companies begins January 1999.
The sale of SNET will also come before the Department of Public Utility Control. Our main concern is that the sale benefits consumers. We also want to be sure services do not deteriorate in any way.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY VIEW;
Images of an Economy Devouring the Poor

BYLINE: By Vicki Goldberg 

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
THE video welcoming visitors to Houston on the hotel channel confides that the man who built the Astrodome had a copy of it at home and one bedroom dedicated to P. T. Barnum, another with a bed resting on a calliope. The city's attractions are sometimes unique. Fotofest is one. It's the only international biennial gathering of photographers, curators, critics and exhibitions -- 70 shows this year -- in this country.
The festival has a few Texas quirks, like a mobile art show in a bus with a perilously tilted floor, and a show in a bar where the decor includes a large plastic cube heaped with worn-out shoes and a mannequin wearing nothing but a pink see-through bed jacket, items that quite outshine the art. 
 But Fotofest, which runs through March, also has some major distinctions. Its organizers, Fred Baldwin and Wendy Watriss, together with Houston galleries, museums and nonprofit spaces, have brought to America contemporary photography seldom or never seen here, including work from Brazil, Italy and Japan and fine shows of recent Finnish, Slovakian and Mexican work. There are better-known photographers, too, like Harry Gruyaert plus plenty of American photography, like a show called "Spirits and Construction." Unexpected treasures turn up amid the standard quota of dross.
This orgy of images, spread out over some unusual reaches of the city, requires a car, a map, adrenalin and patience, but even seeing merely a large part of it provides an uncommonly capacious overview. A show called "Stories About Us: Photographs from Juarez," at the Diverseworks Artspace gallery, presents especially strong subject matter: the horrors of the Mexican border city and the coruscating effects of global free trade on the poor.
William Tuman, the curator, has put together an exhibition powerful enough to be hard to take despite all the imagery of poverty and violence that has rained down on the world, dampening its sympathies. The 50 photographs in the show -- by 15 Mexican press photographers, all but one of them working in color -- address the city's miseries from different angles. Captions add illuminating data without becoming unwieldy; the effect is cumulative, gathering intensity as it goes.
The photographs and the deadly problems they depict were first set forth in a harrowing article by Charles Bowden in Harper's magazine in 1996 and since then in a book by the same author called "Juarez: The Laboratory of Our Future," published by Aperture. Mr. Bowden believes that these photographers have already captured the look of the future. "This future," he writes, "is based on the rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer and industrial growth producing poverty faster than it distributes wealth."
The photographers limn the terrors in Juarez: gangs kill at least 200 people a year, torturing many of them first. The drug traffic is rampant and violent. At least 150 girls disappear each year, most of them raped and then murdered. People live in cardboard shacks -- without electricity, heat or water -- that often go up in flames. Some live in dumps and compete with animals for food. Toxic emissions and untreated sewage pollute the air and water. Attempts to cross the border frequently end in death.
The photographers, all men save one, are young, broke, in constant danger and certain that they have a mission. One has been shot at and knows of a contract on his life; one wears a bullet-proof vest. One was photographing the bloated corpse of a raped and murdered girl when the body burst. It ruined his camera.
They are utterly explicit about violence: one records the blackened and shrunken face of a murdered girl mummified by the desert sun; another, a body tortured and burned beyond recognition. Very few of these photographs have been published in Mexican papers not only because they are violent, but surely also because they are politically damning.
Overt violence is only a small part of this exhibition. There are children playing near a smelter that belches fumes, others fishing for food in the polluted Rio Grande, a man trying to put out a fire in his house with a garden hose that emits a tiny stream, a mural of the enslavement of Mexicans painted on the Mexican side of the gates that close off the train tracks at the border. A chilling picture of the desert where many bodies have been found shows only sand, barbed wire and a post topped by a clown head with a big smile, bigger eyelashes and a charming little hat.
Mr. Bowden attributes the problems in Juarez to the economy's dependence on factories owned by foreigners, most of them American. (Convincing as Mr. Bowden is, it should be noted that Juarez has played host to poverty and violence for a very long time.) Parts shipped from America and elsewhere are assembled here and shipped back under an agreement that exempts them from high tariffs. The factories pay only slightly more than other Mexican factories and not enough to live on in an inflated economy. They have a six-day work week and no economic safety net other than severance pay, although the (mostly) women who work in them can seldom afford child care and get burned out, used up and disposed of fast.
Yet these factories have attracted millions of poor peasants ill prepared to do the work and unable to find housing or leave the county. Mr. Bowden writes that "Juarez is an exhibit of the fabled New World Order in which capital moves easily and labor is trapped by borders."
JUAREZ being our border, our neighbor and the site of our passionate disputes, it is hard to duck some sense of American responsibility for its ills. This makes the tale these pictures tell just a shade less simple to dismiss than such far-off dilemmas as Bosnia or Indonesia. The images are relatively artless, with the straightforward "tell it as it is" look of traditional press photography. Which makes them all the more gripping.
There was a time when news photographs and street snaps were thought to be unimpeachable truths -- I think that often they still are, except in special circumstances and classroom discussions -- and generally they looked like this. There is not much artistry here of the splendid post-modern variety that has complicated and beautified some contemporary reporting. The photographs are good enough, full of information, a professional step up from snapshots but not a whole lot better. They concentrate on subject at the expense of bravura composition and color. I suspect they might have been even stronger in black and white, the old-fashioned documentary mode that neither distracts nor lulls the eye with a fine note of blue or a harsh splash of red.
The Juarez photographers hope to change things. How much change photographs can inspire depends a lot on who sees them and perhaps where. An alliance of street photographers in Juarez has been organized with an archive of photographs, an office where 100 prints hang and plans for shows in Mexico City, Cuba and Europe. The organizer of the alliance has been quoted as saying that the Mexican Government keeps track of pictures published in foreign papers and will clean up a problem if a picture appears in The New York Times. Maybe. Eight of these photographs were printed last July in the Times's Week in Review section.
I found the exhibition wrenching -- although there's always the question of whether I am merely indulging my liberal guilt and will neglect to do anything about it. Still, the impact made it hard for me to view the next exhibitions tranquilly. For a moment, even good art photography began to look inconsequential in comparison to people's lives.
Art is always, perhaps unfairly, facing this kind of competition. Indeed, one of art's functions is restoring our easily threatened confidence in the ability of humankind to create order and beauty, a confidence the news media frequently undermine. Perhaps one should not go to a museum immediately after watching the local news.
After a bit, another part of Fotofest, the show "Five South African Artists," at the Vine Street Studios, pierced the clouds of my conscience. Here, two remarkable animated films by William Kentridge, whose drawings morph and redraw themselves in dreamlike tales that ricochet off various levels of the mind, deal indirectly with his homeland's hateful history. A strong piece by Sue Williamson mixes photographs and abbreviated quotes -- "covering up," "ordered to lie" -- to highlight the difficult mission and ambiguous results of the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings.
Both Mr. Kentridge and Ms. Williamson make art that confronts ugly realities. Which is not to say that this is the way to make good art; the great majority of political art fails as both art and politics. (This is somewhat less true of documentary photography.) But a major subject instantly pushes a work of art, literature included, to another level of ambition, from which it may vault higher or fall farther, and to another level of response. The subject alone can, if successfully translated into form, reach a range of emotions that pure beauty or stylistic sophistication have little access to. And in photography, especially documentary or news photography, subject counts heavily, because what is represented actually occurred -- barring fakery or manipulation.
People look at such photographs through their fears, their hopes and their consciences as well as their eyes, which is one reason reactions to images can differ so from person to person. The omnipresent image seldom evokes an omnipresent response, but one would have to be fearless, hopeless and blind not to respond at all when eyes and conscience both insist you do.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Three Big Musicals, Three Fates

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY 

 BODY:
I believe in the power of St. Lazarus.
And he holds me in his sight.
I know that these jitterbug days I'm livin,'
Well, they won't last for all of us,
But they'll last for a long summer night.

 From the score of "The Capeman," music by Paul Simon, book and lyrics by Mr. Simon and Derek Walcott 
 The long summer night of "The Capeman" abruptly ends this Saturday when the $11 million musical closes at the Marquis Theater just two months after its official opening, which followed nearly nine weeks of paid previews.
Some Broadway professionals have been uncharacteristically caustic about the flop of the ambitious if unfocused, utterly flaccid show with which Mr. Simon made his debut as a Broadway contender. They don't talk about his haunting, widely praised score or, if they do, they say it isn't for the theater.
Instead, they prefer to equate the huge amount of money lost by the production with the size of the composer's ego: How could a man with no Broadway experience, someone who possesses only skepticism about the form itself, dare to come into town and, surrounded by other theater neophytes, attempt to teach the pros how to put on a show? Mickey and Judy could do it, but that was in the movies.
Yet the failure of "The Capeman" should not be a cause for derision but for lamentation, even beyond Mr. Simon's public of loyal admirers.
That would include everyone who, at the beginning of this season, read the schedule of forthcoming shows as an indication that, at long last, the Broadway musical might stand a chance of finding some important new identities. And none too soon. The people responsible for the current crop of long-running Broadway behemoths have not been heard from recently.
Andrew Lloyd Webber has abandoned -- for the time being, anyway -- the ornately melodramatic romances epitomized by his long-running blockbuster "The Phantom of the Opera." He has not presented a new show in New York since "Sunset Boulevard," though he hasn't been idle. He was hoping to come into town last season with "Whistle Down the Wind," but withdrew it for more work after the chilly reception for its tryout run in Washington.
The flow of epic operettas by Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg, the French team that gave us "Les Miserables" and "Miss Saigon," appears to have also been temporarily staunched. Their latest endeavor, "Martin Guerre," which opened to dim reviews in London in July 1996, has closed for a second time to allow for still more tinkering. The show was clearly dead when I saw it on its second night, but Cameron Mackintosh, the producer, will not let it lie down.
Yet the number of musicals planned for Broadway this season, the variety of the auspices that were presenting them and the artists involved combined to create expectations of an unusually high order. In addition to "The Capeman," the prospects included "The Lion King," "Ragtime," "Side Show" and "Triumph of Love."
To the consternation of the traditional theater community, it's the Disney Company, the corporate giant whose name is synonymous with faceless clout, that has turned out to be the most eccentric and successful of the new producing entities. Forget "Beauty and the Beast," the company's first, very characteristic production still running at the Palace Theater.
This season's Disney appreciates both Broadway tradition and the care and feeding of great, idiosyncratic talent. Of the new musicals, only Julie Taymor's innovative production of "The Lion King," a singing and dancing show not quite like any other, has become a hit on a scale to influence musicals that come after. That it is being presented in the gorgeously renovated old New Amsterdam Theater, another Disney property, is simply a dividend.
Not to be outdone by Disney is Garth Drabinsky, the Canadian producer who hopes to assemble a new theatrical empire south of his border. He built what is virtually a brand-new theater, the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, and his first production in it is "Ragtime," the musical adaptation of E. L. Doctorow's satiric novel. Like the theater, which is second in size only to the Gershwin, "Ragtime" is big.
It is also well populated, handsome, literate and stately, being an epic operetta in the mode of a home-grown "Les Miz," though easier to follow. The show, which received very good notices from most critics and mixed ones in The New York Times, seems to have settled in for what is hoped to be a long run. It doesn't surprise, but then it doesn't offend.
Already gone: "Side Show," the adventurous, darkly romantic tale of the real-life Siamese twins Daisy and Violet Hilton, a musical whose freakish metaphor seemed to alienate audiences in spite of the witty, unhackneyed score by Henry Krieger and Bill Russell; and "Triumph of Love," a nervy but disastrous attempt to jazz up the elegant subtleties of Marivaux's 18th-century French comedy. The worst mistake made by the collaborators was to assume that Broadway audiences might share the tastes of third-year French Lit majors attending a jokey, one-night-only class show.
Which leaves us where?
Stephen Sondheim, the dean of Broadway composer-lyricists, has recently been writing what are in effect operas, no matter what he calls them. (His latest project, "Wise Guys," about the flamboyant Mizner brothers early in this century, is expected to open next year at the Kennedy Center in Washington.) Yet he can't neutralize his own influence. The rueful melodies and convoluted, blissfully surprising lyrics, the mark of all his work, continue to spawn more terrible imitations than those of anyone since, say, Stephen Foster.
Jonathan Larson's "Rent," the only show whose score and concerns speak without condescension to ticket buyers in their 20's and 30's, is a holdover from two seasons ago. Having come out of New York Theater Workshop in the East Village, "Rent" is also a reminder of the role that the nonprofits have played in keeping the Broadway musical as cutting-edge (and profitable) as it ever gets.
"Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk," the hit revue labeled "a tap/ rap discourse on the staying power of the beat," came out of the Joseph Papp Public Theater two years ago. Ms. Taymor, too, was nurtured by nonprofit theaters. But with Federal and state support being reduced, these theaters' future efforts are more problematic than ever.
IT is probably not a coincidence that both Larson and Ms. Taymor display something of the same buccaneering spirit of Gerome Ragni and James Rado, whose seminal rock musical, "Hair," with Galt MacDermot, started out at the Public Theater. It was also the Public that originated "A Chorus Line," Michael Bennett's landmark Broadway show.
The success of "The Lion King" notwithstanding, the Broadway musical is no further along now than it was last September, or 10 years ago when "The Phantom of the Opera" opened.
Frank Wildhorn is doing his best to fill the schmaltz niche with "Jekyll and Hyde" and "The Scarlet Pimpernel." Whether or not you respond to Mr. Wildhorn's rather simple melodies and the fustian narratives that are their contexts, you have to give him and his producers credit for the way they sold "Jekyll and Hyde." The show toured for months before coming to Broadway. By the time it opened in New York the music had been recorded and had reached the charts. "Jekyll and Hyde" was a known quantity, a hit, before any critic could reach for a quill pen.
"Ragtime" was seen in both Toronto and Los Angeles before arriving in New York. "The Lion King" also played out of town, in Minneapolis. In the years before productions became so big and cumbersome that they couldn't travel economically, pre-Broadway shakedowns were standard. They allowed time to gauge, fix, adjust, throw out, put in or, perhaps, to close. Opening cold in New York, like "The Capeman," is cruel and inhuman punishment for everyone concerned, especially in the city that invented kibitzing.
Don't think all is well because the Broadway box office seems to be thriving, the economy is good and inflation is under control. The value of the dollar has nothing to do with the escalating budgets for musical shows, which are beginning to resemble those for movies. It has to do with the old adage about having to spend money to make money, especially on Broadway.
Ms. Taymor's production of "The Lion King" looks as if it cost at least $15 million and, supposedly, it did. Should budgets continue to rise, the temptation must be to play it safe in the way that movie producers do, either by replicating last season's hits as brazenly as possible without plagiarizing them, or by producing sure-fire revivals. When in doubt, ransack the Rodgers and Hammerstein catalogue.
EVEN a producing company with pockets as deep as Disney's can't afford to throw money away on risky adventures, unless the investment can be written off as public relations. Both Disney and Mr. Drabinsky's Livent company, today's biggest new Broadway players, are publicly held. A flop or two of the magnitude of "The Capeman," and stockholders could get restless in a way to shake a corporation's foundations.
Broadway's continuing dilemma: How to present the new and the tried-and-true, the offbeat and the expected in ways that will attract the middle-aged, middle-class audience as well as younger patrons. It is possible to do that, though not necessarily in a single show.
"The Capeman" could have been such a show. The healthy preview business done by the production demonstrated that there was a large audience waiting to adore Mr. Simon's Broadway debut. But, fans or not, they couldn't easily adore a show designed so that neither the actors, who seemed clueless, nor the incoherent narrative were allowed to distract attention from the music. The curious result was that the excellent score was embalmed instead of being brought to life.
The show did not set precedents -- it was inept. It turned its back on those who most wanted to soar with it.
Broadway is adaptable. If it can accommodate Stephen Sondheim and the Who, along with Elton John and Tim Rice, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, and Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, it can certainly find a place for Paul Simon. Yet audiences should not be confronted, as Mr. Simon's are, by a kind of implacably stony-faced presence. They want to be addressed, persuaded, moved and implicated.
That is how musicals operate. In this connection it's instructive to pay attention to the Encores series at City Center. These concert revivals of shows of the past effectively remind us of the often lamentable state of the current Broadway musical.
Most Encores productions wouldn't last five minutes on Broadway. They are gloriously dated, but they force us to recognize what the American musical lost as it grew up and became more sober-sided. Among other things that seem to have faded: the irreverent, satirical, joyous spirit of an earlier age, especially as expressed in dance. Dancing seems to have all but disappeared from our theater. Well, not quite.
There is "Noise/Funk" and Garth Fagan's exuberant choreography for "The Lion King." Some of the most satisfying moments in "Ragtime" are provided by Graciela Daniele's dances, but the show could use more. The revival of the 1975 "Chicago" seems so fresh and so new largely because of Ann Reinking's dazzling re-creation of Bob Fosse's choreography. It gives the musical a dimension of spontaneous feeling and explosive life that can be generated in no other way.
It is therefore an astonishment that "The Capeman," whose director of record is Mark Morris, one of the most celebrated choreographers in the dance world today, has virtually no dancing at all. The suspicion is that Mr. Morris's collaborators ganged up on him and told him to sit in the corner. Yet "The Capeman" is a show that demands choreography.
You would think that Mr. Simon, Mr. Morris and Derek Walcott, a Nobel laureate for literature in 1992, all newcomers to Broadway, would have made some effort to understand how the musical connects with its audience. They appear not to have cared less. Great shows don't describe emotion but provoke it. They surprise. They may even disturb the peace a bit, as the nudity in "Hair" tried to do.
At the same time, producers must learn to recognize and utilize talented artists like Ms. Taymor without attempting to co-opt them.
If the Broadway musical is to survive, it can't afford to squander its resources: not only its money but also those collaborative artists who never let us forget that Americans, on stage anyway, are singing and dancing fools.

HEADLINE: Classical Music;
A Composer Who Actually Earns a Living Composing

BYLINE: By K. ROBERT SCHWARZ 

 BODY:
FORGET the Beethovenian model of the composer: wild-eyed, hair askew, struggling with recalcitrant material, shaking a fist at the gods. And the Romantic myth of the composer as bohemian, starving in a lonely garret, knowing that recognition will come only after death.
Ellen Taaffe Zwilich's reality is different. Like any good craftsman, Ms. Zwilich works at her desk every day. No agonized struggle stands between her and the music. Since her works are in great demand, she is that rarest of creatures, a composer who makes a living at her profession. 
 With American composers now marginalized to the point of invisibility, the sheer "normalcy" of her career is extraordinary. Well adjusted and disciplined in life as in music, the 58-year-old Ms. Zwilich has developed a relationship with performers and audiences that might have seemed impossible today.
When the violinist Pamela Frank and the Orchestra of St. Luke's, conducted by Hugh Wolff, offer the premiere of Ms. Zwilich's Violin Concerto on Thursday evening at Carnegie Hall, the extent of her achievement will be apparent. Introduced not by new-music specialists but by big-name performers, the concerto is yet another large-scale product of her clear-eyed work ethic. And the audience will not squirm at the thought of a premiere, for listeners have learned that Ms. Zwilich's music is not calculated to offend.
The appeal of her music to performers stems in part from the fact that she was a performer before she was a composer. She first played the trumpet, then, more seriously, the violin. By knowing what players find gratifying and writing parts that are idiomatic and flattering, she has earned their trust.
And her unbridled, almost childlike enthusiasm inspires musicians and listeners alike. "I shouldn't say this, but I really am having a wonderful time working on all this music," she said recently. "I feel like I've died and gone to heaven to be able to write instrumental music for the best orchestras and performers of our time."
Then, of course, there is the music itself. As Ms. Zwilich's style shifted from the dissonant modernism of 25 years ago to the attractive, tonal post-modernism of today, her list of commissions grew exponentially.
Ms. Zwilich, who was born in Miami, moved to New York to study violin with Ivan Galamian and immediately plunged into the freelance performance circuit. As a violinist in the American Symphony Orchestra when Leopold Stokowski conducted it, she mastered orchestral color from the inside out.
She eventually enrolled at the Juilliard School, studied composition with Elliott Carter and Roger Sessions, and in 1975 became the first woman to receive a doctorate in composition from the school. At first she embraced an atonal, systematic approach to composition. But when her husband, Joseph Zwilich, died in 1979, all the complexities of modernism suddenly seemed irrelevant, she said. Now she wanted license to express personal feeling.
She became a national celebrity overnight in 1983, when her Symphony No. 1 won the Pulitzer Prize for composition: again, the first awarded to a woman. Commissions poured in, reporters jostled for interviews, and Ms. Zwilich could suddenly devote herself fully to composition.
The gradual change in her musical style is more audible with every passing year. Ms. Zwilich claims to be barely aware of it. "I think I've gotten more expansive and unafraid," she said. "I think my music is more generous, more open emotionally. More than that I don't know."
But a colleague like John Harbison sees the change. "Now she works with very basic motifs that tend to be displayed clearly at the beginning of the piece, and the result is a clarity of design that is appreciated by performers," he said. "You feel the building materials expand and connect, and the process of development is very possible to follow."
Already in the First Symphony, high modernism had been jettisoned. The textures were stripped bare, the language was more emotive, and the germinal motifs were audibly transformed. Since then, the motifs have become simpler, even triadic, as the music has become increasingly tonal and consonant. Today it is neo-Classic in concision but neo-Romantic in intensity. It is dark-hued and muscular, its brooding, even menacing tone seeming the very antithesis of her own disposition.
Ms. Zwilich's detractors suggest that this journey from modernism to populism smacks of careerism. Those who champion her music disagree.
"She starts with something seminal, consisting of as few strokes as possible, and makes everything come out of that," said the pianist Joseph Kalichstein, who played in the premieres of her Piano Trio and Triple Concerto. "People criticize that and say it's too simple, but it's not really simple. It's only that she wants you to hear everything, not sit and analyze."
All these traits are evident in the Violin Concerto, which was written for Ms. Frank. "During our first coffee, Ellen said, 'So what's your wish list?,' " Ms. Frank recalled. "I told her I would love a giant chamber-music piece with everybody equally involved. I told her that virtuoso passage work doesn't interest me that much."
It happened that Ms. Zwilich shared Ms. Frank's preference for lyricism. "I didn't want to write a loud violin concerto, with the fiddle batting out a lot of forte passages," Ms. Zwilich said. "I didn't want to write something that called attention to the athleticism of the instrument." Indeed, Ms. Zwilich downplayed virtuosity so much that she discarded the notion of a long, formal cadenza.
In its lean orchestration, economical proportions and obsessive motivic development, the 26-minute work pays homage to a Classical tradition Ms. Zwilich is eager to continue. Over a decade and a half, she has written 3 symphonies (a 4th is on the way) and 12 concertos. Some of her smaller orchestral works have been performed more than 150 times. A prolific composer whose works appeal to the public and are played often: this is the kind of normalcy Haydn would have understood.
But real normalcy would require the re-integration of the composer into the community, and here, too, Ms. Zwilich qualifies. For the last three years, she has been the first occupant of Carnegie Hall's Composer's Chair, a position to which has brought considerable flair. She has produced or is producing three works on commission: "Peanuts Gallery," for a family concert, the Violin Concerto and a forthcoming string quartet. In addition, she was asked to design a new format for a new-music series. Her response was Making Music, now in its third season at Weill Recital Hall. Each program focuses on a single composer, whom Ms. Zwilich also engages in a cheerful onstage chat.
CHARACTERISTICALLY, Ms. Zwilich exudes an irrepressible optimism about the future of the American composer, and she wants the world to share it. However bland normalcy may be, Ms. Zwilich believes that it is the wave of the future. So she ignores the gloomy predictions about classical music in America and looks ahead with confidence.
"I look at a concert hall full of people, and some are there because they've been dragged by their partner, some because they think it's the thing they should do, and some because they want to give themselves to the music. And among all these people there's one person sitting there whose life is going to be changed by this concert. That's whom you write music for."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Newark's Slow Office Revival;
Investors Buying Big, Mostly Vacant Buildings

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
BETTING that Newark's slow commercial revival is about to turn a corner, investors are buying some of the big, old and mostly vacant downtown office buildings.
Investors have long been put off by a tangle of urban problems in Newark, where office vacancy rates in much of the downtown area have been well into double digits. But a small group of buyers, including some from Manhattan, now see a potential for profit. They also consider the city one of few places left to buy office space at bargain prices in the 11-county northern New Jersey market, where costs are rising as available space dwindles. The same is true in Manhattan. 
 In one of the larger recent transactions, the Cogswell Realty Group of Manhattan and partners purchased two buildings totaling about a million square feet, most of it empty. The plan is to turn 744 Broad Street into modern offices and 1180 Raymond Boulevard into student housing.
In another transaction, the Townsend Company of Towson, Md., bought a 380,000-square-foot building at 33 Washington Street that it will renovate and return to the market. The company is also selling Gateway II, a 783,000-square-foot Class A occupied building that it bought 15 months ago, to the Manhattan-based Witkoff Group and partners. Still other investors are said to be scouting the city as well.
Newark is beginning to attract more welcome attention, aided in part by new projects intended to stoke its revival. The most notable is the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, whose first phase -- including a 2,700-seat auditorium -- opened last October on 12 acres between Park Place and the Passaic River.
And Prudential Insurance Company of America, a city stalwart, has moved back some 3,800 employees from the suburbs to more than 300,000 more square feet of offices in the city as part of a plan announced two years ago to centralize its operations. The insurer has 7,000 workers occupying about 2 million square feet in the city.
Plans also are advancing for a minor-league baseball stadium and a light rail line linking the downtown to Newark International Airport.
A special improvement district, in which property owners tax themselves to help fight crime and grime, which is to be established downtown by this summer, has also sparked interest, as has the growing influence of public-private partnerships willing to promote development.
"A different investment atmosphere exists today," said Alfred L. Faiella, executive director of the Newark Economic Development Corporation, "and people appreciate that a critical mass is building in the downtown."
They also know that the city offers tax abatements and the downtown is in a state urban enterprise zone, where corporate tenants pay no sales taxes.
But lingering memories of the 1967 rioting that made Newark a symbol of inner-city frustration mean that New Jersey's largest city and its downtown office market still face an uphill climb.
With the ripple effect from Manhattan and "Jersey City all filled up, Newark is the next logical location," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, adding that the potential is there "for a rebirth of the city's office sector into a viable economic node." But so are the risks, he said, noting that "by no means is it a slam-dunk."
Newark's downtown has suffered since the 50's when the middle class fled to the suburbs, followed by retailers. But by the 80's a wave of renewal gave way to the four-building, 2.5 million-square-foot Gateway office and hotel complex near Pennsylvania Station. The last downtown office building was completed in 1991 before the recession hit and demand for space fizzled.
Now Newark is benefiting from the improvement in the overall office market in the state and the region. Evidence of that is the 3 percent vacancy rate for the downtown's 6.8 million square feet of prime space -- much of it in the Gateway complex, where safety concerns are eased by aerial bridges that connect it to Penn Station.
WHILE in other office markets the lack of Class A space has caused activity to filter to secondary buildings, the same has not happened in downtown Newark. The vacancy rate for its 6.1 million square feet of secondary space is 39 percent, according to Sitar Company/ Oncor International, a real estate services firm based in Iselin, N.J.
There is a better chance now for such a spillover to occur "because the downtown has never reached this point before," said Jonathan S. Meisel, an associate director at the East Rutherford, N.J., office of Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage. He cited the lack of construction as an ingredient that did not exist a decade ago.
"Suburban sprawl has resulted in suburban crawl in terms of traffic congestion," said Dean Hughes, "so Newark's central location and access to highways and mass transit links is more significant today."
Still, selling downtown Newark will not be easy.
David S. Sherman, senior managing director at the Saddle Brook, N.J., office of Insignia/ESG, the national brokerage, said that it was "all about confidence," adding that beyond Gateway there was still the perception of crime. He and other brokers said that while demand continued to come from companies already in the city and from government agencies, growth from outside concerns was limited.
Investors, like those that bought 744 Broad Street and 1180 Raymond Boulevard, think that will change. "We saw an opportunity in a market that, slighted for many years, is on the rebound, except for a perception, which is five years behind the reality," said Arthur R. Stern, one of the investors.
Mr. Stern is a partner in Cogswell Realty Group based in Manhattan, which, with Lehman Brothers and other New York investors, bought the two buildings late last year from Newark Building Associates, whose general partner is Peter L. Malkin. Mr. Malkin, chairman of the Wein Malkin & Bettex law firm in Manhattan, has extensive holdings that include investments in the Empire State Building.
Other factors in the decision to buy, said Peter J. Marsh, another Cogswell partner, include the location of the buildings -- near the Gateway complex and the performing-arts center, which over the last five months drew 275,000 visitors. "On top of that," he said, "Manhattan is full and the demand for space continues."
The investment partnership bought the 641,000-square-foot wedding-cake style building at 744 Broad Street for $7.5 million and by this summer they will have invested $45 million to renovate it. Rents, now averaging $10 a square foot, will double, but they will still be 25 percent lower than Class A space in Newark and the suburbs, said Mr. Stern.
Given the scarcity of large blocks of space the partners will relocate existing tenants in the 35-story building to create up to 220,000 square feet of contiguous space. Leases are now under negotiation with six tenants for 44,000 square feet, said Mr. Stern, half of which is expected to be taken by a telecommunications firm from Atlanta. And to create more street life, he added, 48,000 square feet on the building's ground and mezzanine floors will be marketed for retail use.
AT the 440,000-square-foot structure at 1180 Raymond Boulevard, which the partners bought for just under $3 million, the plan is to convert it, at a cost of up to $40 million, to 1,400 dormitory rooms. Converting the Newark building into student housing, Mr. Stern said, will create additional street activity and fill a need from the city's five institutions of higher education. The partners are in the process of buying the ground lease under the building from the city.
Last November, the Townsend Company closed on its $12 million purchase of 33 Washington Street, the half-vacant 380,000-square-foot former headquarters of Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Jersey. Townsend will invest about $4 million more to improve the building, said Geoffrey Schubert, senior vice president at the Teaneck office of CB Commercial, the national brokerage, which is working with Townsend.
"The bottom line is economics," Mr. Schubert said, noting that tenants looking to save money will be drawn to the building where rents will be lower than those in the prime buildings in the city.
The company is also under contract to sell Gateway II for a reported $84 million. The buyer is the Witkoff Group, along with partners, which expect to close the deal next month, said Kenneth E. Cohen, managing director at the Witkoff Group. "Newark is a definite growth area," he said.
Mr. Schubert said Townsend's purchase of 33 Washington Street was a bigger risk than its Gateway deal. But, he added, the company believes lightning can strike twice with its strategy of adding value and achieving an appropriate return in a city on the rebound.

HEADLINE: Government Called A Shoreham Victim

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
NINE years after the demise of Shoreham, a new analysis of America's largest dead-end industrial project has identified a victim beyond the obvious ones, the customers and shareholders of the Long Island Lighting Company and taxpayers around the United States, who will share a waste of more than $5 billion on the reactor.
The other victim, according to a newly retired policy planner at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Joan Aron, is government. Suffolk County, New York State, the N.R.C. and the rest of the Federal Government suffered a huge loss, she argues, not of money but of trust. They lost not only the trust of the public but the trust of each other, according to Ms. Aron. 
 In a new book, "Licensed to Kill? The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Shoreham Power Plant" (University of Pittsburgh Press, $18.95 paper, $45 cloth), Ms. Aron also argues that the true impact of the Shoreham debacle has not been felt yet, because one of its key products has not been tried yet, a "reformed" system for licensing future nuclear plants, designed by the commission to prevent future Shorehams. The new system calls for a single license to be granted before constructon begins, and not, as in Shoreham's case, a construction permit and then an operating license when construction is done. The new system will backfire and make nuclear power even less acceptable to the public, she argues, because it reduces the opportunity for public input.
Ms. Aron has taken on a difficult subject -- the writing of contemporary history -- because so many of the people involved in the story have their own passionate perspectives. But in a review of the Shoreham saga, Ms. Aron, who joined the staff of the N.R.C. in 1976 and worked there on and off until early this year, makes a case that governments acted in ways that no one should be proud of and that will have future effects.
"There's a large stake in making a decision that is perceived as 'correct' from all standpoints, including technical, economic, environmental, and policy considerations," she writes. "None of the contending parties -- Lilco, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, New York State or Suffolk County -- had confidence that the other participants were making an honest effort to achieve good public policy. Moreover, no party had confidence that the outcome would be 'right' or that the process would lead to the correct decision. Consequently, each party felt vindicated in departing from the customary rules governing the process and engaging and engaging in questionable practices to achieve its ends."
The Nuclear Regulatory Commisison refused to consider a 20-mile emergency planning zone in place of a 10-mile zone because the larger area might have doomed the plant, she said; Suffolk refused to seriously consider emergency planning because it might have been possible. Lilco plowed forward because it assumed, wrongly, that if it got a license to run the plant, the plant would run. The N.R.C. granted the plant a test license that resulted in radioative contamination and thus raised the eventual price of decmmissioning, because it could not cope with any other outcome, and nobody put the whole situation in context and cut a deal earlier that would have saved everyone time and money, she argues.
Government, of course, is also the cause of the debacle, with one level launching the utility and its ratepayers on a vast industrial project, while another created obstacles that would insure it was all a waste. In a telephone interview, Ms. Aron said that in the end, another problem was that no one in government would take responsiblity for solving the problem, of a reactor inspired by the "too cheap to meter" thinking of the 1950's, reaching completion in the post-Three Mile Island, post-Chernobyl 1980's, when the dominant question was what would happen if an emergency required an evacuation.
"Had anyone been willing to take responsiblity, you probably could have put an extra road on top of the L.I.E., or planned for some Dunkirk-like, imaginative way of getting away," said Ms. Aron, in a telephone interview. Building another roadway on top of the Long Island Expresway and then operating the reactor, she said, would have been cheaper than abandoning it. But the failure to take responsibility, she said, was "partially what's wrong with the decision-making process."
Ms. Aron knows about governmental cooperation and the lack thereof. An associate professor of political science at New York University from 1969 to 1976, she is also the author of "The Quest for Regional Cooperation: A Study of the New York Metropolitan Regional Council."
Shoreham is still very much a factor in Long Island's energy situation, giving the area the highest electric rates in the mainland United States and driving an effort that dates from the days of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to re-structure Lilco. But events beyond the control of anyone on Long Island have rendered it less important than it might have seemed in April 1989, when shareholders of the company voted to accept a deal to kill the plant.
Since that time, the technology for finding natural gas and the infrastructure for bringing it to market has improved markedly, and the price of oil has continued to decline. If Shoreham had run well, its uranium fuel might have replaced about 10 million barrels of oil a year, but over time, the importance of that oil has changed. In 1979, when opposition was strong but construction was well under way, that was worth about $400 million annually; today it is worth only about $150 million, and with the dollar worth less because of intervening inflation, the savings is much smaller than anyone had dared to predict.
Now Gov. George E. Pataki's plan for a partial state takeover of Lilco is advancing, and rebates to customers in Nassau and Suffolk are expected to be sent before Election Day. Rate cuts of 20 percent are also expected.
And with looser rules about who can make and sell electricity, the region continues to have plenty of power, even with the long-term shutdown of the three Millstone reactors across Long Island Sound in Waterford, Conn.
Meanwhile, with more than 100 nuclear plants operating around the country for the last nine years, not one of them has had an incident that resulted in orders to shelter or evacuate.
None of the people who were members of the commission while Shoreham was an issue are still there, although some staff members endure. The book is not kind to the N.R.C., but Ms. Aron, who retired in January and lives in Washington, said that she had not received any reaction from anyone at the agency. She was assisted with the book by Leo Slaggie, who is still the deputy solicitor at the agency.
Ms. Aron's conclusions about nuclear power may not matter, in the sense that it is not clear when any level of government will face a decision on opening a new reactor. She believes, though, that given certain turns in the energy market and concern about global warming and other forms of pollution, the question of how to regulate new reactors could indeed be important. But her conclusion about trust and government might apply to some other technical fields.
If a second nuclear era begins, she writes, with better-designed plants about which there are fewer technical questions, "there will remain a need for the N.R.C. to act -- and to be perceived by the public -- as a bold, vigorous regulatory body, with an aggressive approach to regulatory standards, safety analyses, quality assurance, and investigations of allegations of whistle-blowers (that is, those with safety concerns within and outside the agency), with ends of public health and safety paramount to all other considerations. In short, re-regulation instead of de-regulation."

HEADLINE: Goodwill Games Call World's Athletes to Nassau

BYLINE: By DAVID WINZELBERG 

 BODY:
WITH the completion of a $30 million swimming and diving center in Eisenhower Park this month, Long Island takes a big plunge into international aquatics competition.
When the Goodwill Games start here on July 19, 1,500 athletes from 60 countries will be competing in events at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, the renovated Mitchel Athletic Complex and the new Goodwill Games Swimming and Diving Center, which Nassau County officials say is the second largest indoor swimming center in the world. 
 The pool has a movable floor to adjust to different depths, a 10-meter diving tower, permanent and portable seating for more than 3,000 people and will soon be open for use by county residents.
"This facility is going to be used for a major event, but it is going to be used for years after," the County Parks and Recreation Commissioner, John Kiernan, said. "It wasn't built just for the games."
Several Long Island swim clubs will be among the first to test the waters, in the Speedo Junior Championships, beginning on Tuesday. One thousand young swimmers from the Northeast will compete. Swimmers can qualify for a trip to the Senior Championships next week in Minneapolis, an event that will be held on Long Island next year.
"It's a wonderful opportunity for our kids and our staff to showcase Long Island and swim in a big championship in our own backyard," said Dave Ferris, head coach of the Long Island Aquatic Club.
In addition to the aquatic facilities, a $22 million renovation of Mitchel Park, financed mostly by the county, is under way for the track and field events of the Goodwill Games. On 67 acres adjacent to Hofstra and the coliseum, the park opened in the early 1980's. The upgrading will result in a nine-lane synthetic track, a regulation-size soccer field, a rifle and pistol range, a baseball field, two added lighted soccer fields and seating for 10,000 people. A two-story field house is being built, with locker rooms, conference rooms and press facilities.
After a recent inspection of the Mitchel complex, organizers of the Goodwill Games are planning additional changes, including two-story VIP boxes, an additional 6,000 seats and Jumbotron screens. Mitchel Park is to be the home for 44 track and field events, 22 men's and 22 women's, and women's soccer.
Some Goodwill events will be held in Manhattan, including basketball at Madison Square Garden, boxing and wrestling aboard the Intrepid Air, Sea and Space Museum, cycling in Wien Stadium at the northern tip of Manhattan, beach volleyball in Central Park and the triathlon.
But most of the competition will be on the Island, including all track and field events, figure skating and gymnastics at the Coliseum and 42 swimming and diving events at the aquatic center.
Created by Ted Turner in 1985, the games were founded to promote politically free athletic competition after the Olympics boycotts by the United States and the former Soviet Union in 1980 and 1984. After the inaugural event in Moscow in 1986, the games were held in Seattle in 1990 and St. Petersburg in 1994. With the lessening of international tensions, the games have switched focus, to benefiting children, particularly the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and Unicef.
The games are by invitation. Athletes, based on world rankings, are invited to participate. Past games have seen Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Carl Lewis and Edwin Moses in track and field; Michelle Kwan, Victor Petrenko and Kristi Yamaguchi in figure skating and Janet Evans and Matt Biondi in swimming.
Michael Plant, a former Olympian who is president of the games, said it would not be difficult to get the top athletes to appear. "They're not staying in dormitories, three to a room," he said. "They're put up in nice hotels. They're on worldwide TV and they come away with money."
Appearance fees will no longer be offered to lure top-name athletes to the games, although some money will be paid for promotions. Instead, competitors will vie for prize money based on performance. The $5 million purse is the largest ever for an international multisport event, according to games officials.
Backed by Time-Warner Inc., the games have a full-time staff of 150. Extensive media coverage is expected, including more than 100 hours of television to be shown worldwide. The cable superstation TBS is planning 45 hours of prime-time broadcasts, along with coverage on CBS-TV and HBO. There will be 600,000 tickets available for the events, priced at $10 to $60.
Organizers estimate that the games will bring in more than $50 million to the Long Island economy. "We alone will spend over $25 million in the New York-Long Island area," said one Goodwill Games official. However, the games have yet to turn a profit.
"If you look at the Super Bowl or the Final Four, they didn't make any money in the early days," Mr. Plant said from his office in Atlanta. "It's a long-term investment."
Mr. Plant has announced that the games will be "somewhere in the Asia-Oceania area" in 2002, but he says he is pleased with this year's site. "Over three million people live in the Long Island area," he noted. "It's a family oriented area, and sports is conducive to their quality of life.
He will also look for residents' cooperation. Mr. Plant said the games would need 10,000 volunteers to insure smooth operations.
The 80,000-square-foot natatorium was an integral part of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's bid for the games in 1991. "We knew the one major problem in the bid was the lack of a swimming and diving facility," said Mr. Kiernan, who is also a co-chairman of the Long Island Sports Commission. "Governor Cuomo went to Ted Turner and promised him if we get the bid, New York State would build a world-class aquatic center."
The Empire State Development Corporation, which is responsible for tourism and increasing jobs, was instrumental in building the sports complex. The state gave $24 million for the aquatic center.
"It's terrific that the Goodwill Games will be coming to Long Island," Gov. George E. Pataki said. "Not only will New Yorkers have a chance to watch competition between some of the best athletes in the world, but Long Island will reap the benefits of international attention and the tourism dollars it will bring."

HEADLINE: On Iona Campus, Students' Euphoria Turns Into Heartbreak

BYLINE: By DAN MARKOWITZ 

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE

 BODY:
THE "whoop" nine days ago that thundered out of Rice Hall, a residential dormitory on Iona College's campus here, sounded as if the movie "Animal House" was being remade. But inside, at midday, no toga party raged. Instead, more than 200 Iona students, faculty members and workers cheered, stomped and groaned to the big-screen image of their team playing Syracuse University in the first round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament in Lexington, Ky.
Two days before The Ionian, the campus paper, ran the headline "We're In." One of only 64 teams in the country to make the tournament, Iona's team, the Gaels, had qualified a week earlier by winning the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament in Albany. The Gaels had not been tournament bound since 1985, which explained why Rice Hall and the bars on North Avenue here were crowded with Iona fans glued to television sets. 
 In the Gael Club in Rice Hall, every Iona basket or close-up of an Iona player was greeted with roars and clapping. Even as their team fell behind midway in the first half by 10 points, no one admitted doubting their classmates' chances of stealing a victory over the bigger and higher-ranked Orangemen of Syracuse.
Chris Gomes, 19, a sophomore from Mahopac majoring in economics and political science, like many of his fellow students, was already looking past Syracuse to a prospective, Sweet-16 matchup with Duke University.
"How many chances does a small school like this have of making a name for itself?" he said. "It'd be great for the school to play Duke."
Dave Graham, a security guard, liked Iona's chances even as they trailed 30-20. "We've got a good bunch of kids," he said. "They don't panic. They all walk around the campus together. They're a family. Syracuse will falter."
A few dynamic minutes later, Iona forged into the lead, and the Rice Hall crowd rose to its feet, stomping and chanting and seemingly making more noise than the Iona fans being televised from Lexington, Ky.
The Iona surge added more gusto to the students' bold predictions for their team. Pierina Biundo, 19, a sophomore majoring in economics, said: "This is extremely exciting. I can't wait to see them make it all the way to the Final Four."
Pete Montanez, 21, a senior sociology major, waved a March 3 issue of The Daily News and pointed to his picture on the back page where he was shown as one of the many Gael fans swarming the Iona players after they won the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament. "If I can get on the back page of The Daily News," he said, "we can win the championship."
Vinny DiNota, 20, a sophomore and an international decision technology major, said: "This team has a lot more heart than any team I know. I think it's fate that they make it to the Final Four."
Louis Barbier, 21, a senior also majoring in international decision technology, said, "We've got nothing to lose."
Nearby in the Mulcahy Center, the college athletics building, a group of staff members sat somewhat more calmly in the offices of the basketball coach, Tim Welsh, watching the game on television. It was Welsh, 36, who took over for his father, Jerry, three and a half years ago and turned Iona into a winner again. Primarily a commuter school of 3,500 undergraduate students, Iona was first put on the national basketball map by the legendary coach Jim Valvano in 1978 when he snatched the Gaels' current assistant coach, Jeff Ruland, away from the University of Kentucky.
Iona amassed a 53-13 record over the next two seasons and its first and only victory in an National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament game in three attempts. So as the Gaels edged in front of Syracuse by 3 points in the second half of their fourth tournament game in the school's 46th basketball season, Dr. J. Morrow, a psychology professor and the psychologist for the athletics department, said with a sigh, "I don't think I can survive 13 more minutes."
Kevin Van Meter, the school's public address announcer at Mulcahy for the last 29 years, paced the office, announcing the names of the Iona players who scored as if it were a home game and he was behind the microphone. With Iona leading 61-60 and 24 seconds remaining, Dr. Morrow said, "I think this is the most nervous I've been in some time."
Welsh had said a few days before the game that the N.C.A.A. tournament had grown into a national sporting frenzy because of the impact of television and "the excitement of the upsets." Now his team was on the verge of pulling off one of the tournament's biggest upsets. March Madness, one of the tournament's many nicknames, had gripped Iona and out on the main quadrangle only a handful of students could be seen milling about.
But at the finish, Marius Janeulis of Syracuse nailed a 3-point shot with a second remaining to squash Iona's Cinderella dreams. Tim Brando, announcing the game on CBS-TV, said of the contest's 15 lead changes, "It's been Heartbreak Hotel to euphoria."
Iona clearly dwelled in Heartbreak Hotel. The pain sketched on the faces of Iona players on television was mirrored by staff members in the office. Dr. Morrow said quietly, "I feel sick."
Outside, Tarance Rose, 25, a senior who played for the Iona team last year, called out to a friend across campus: "Did you see the game? That was a heartbreaker." His friend, walking with his head down like so many other students on the suddenly silent campus, did not even look up to answer.

HEADLINE: Meals for the Elderly: A Growing Need

BYLINE: By JULIE MILLER 

 BODY:
THE setting was the Pawcatuck Neighborhood Center, and the stuffed cabbage, mashed potatoes and carrots were served in plastic-covered containers. But for the 57 elderly from the Stonington area, gathered for lunch and bingo, the event was reminiscent of a family get-together.
Bill and Hilda Harrison, who are in their 70's, mingled with old friends and met new people, too. Bingo keeps their minds agile, the Harrisons said. "It's good therapy," Ms. Harrison said. "We're doing things while we're still able to get out." 
 The Harrisons also like the meal plan. "When we're home, we're apt to eat more than we need," said Ms. Harrison. "This way, we have a balanced meal, which is good at our age."
For Edith Garretson of Stonington, who recently celebrated her 98th birthday, the attraction at the Pawcatuck center isn't the food or bingo. "I come because of the people," said Ms. Garretson, who moves around with the aid of a walker or a cane. "I don't get out very much. This is the one time I can socialize."
The Pawcatuck Neighborhood Center, like other community groups nationwide, participates in the government-funded Elderly Nutrition Program for people 60 and older. The meals, offered at senior centers and delivered to people who are homebound, serve as not only a social device but also as a way to introduce the elderly in need to health services like blood pressure screening.
But financial support for the meal program has failed to keep pace with need. State spending has been flat for the past five years. A modest increase in Federal funds for the current year -- the first since 1994 -- was not enough to offset the growing number of older people and the increase in costs due to inflation. And budget proposals for the 1999 fiscal year do not increase funding for nutrition, said Christine Lewis, manager of the elderly services division of the state's Department of Social Services.
In Connecticut, 13 regional meal programs serve more than 12,500 meals daily at 200 locations. The number of participants has remained the same for several years. "There is a larger population that could make use of these meals. But directors of some programs hesitate to reach out and find more people, because they know they can't expand and stay within their budgets," Ms. Lewis said.
Federal funds, including some money from the Department of Agriculture, pay only about one-third of the cost of home-delivered meals, Ms. Lewis said. The larger share is covered with state, local and private contributions. Elderly participants are encouraged to make a donation at each meal.
The changing health care system is another factor affecting the meal programs. As elderly patients are discharged from hospitals and nursing homes more quickly, community agencies are expected to assume the job of caring for them. As a result, meal programs are relied on to provide food to a larger number of sicker and functionally impaired older people.
A decade ago, 60 percent of the elderly participants in the Thames Valley Elderly Nutrition Project, which serves 39 towns in the Norwich area, had their meals at senior centers. Forty percent received meals at home. But the picture is reversed now, said the director of the project, Mary Lou Underwood.
The trend is nationwide. Since 1980 the number of meals served annually has risen to 240 million from 168 million. Home-delivered meals now account for 49 percent of the total, according to the Federal Administration on Aging. By contrast, the Federal budget for the meal program, frozen at $470 million for four years, went up to just $486 million for the 1998 fiscal year.
"Programs across the nation are searching for answers. I'm not sure they understand how common their situation is," said Jean Lloyd, a nutritionist with the Administration on Aging. "I don't think we've come to grips as a society that we've grown older."
The Federal Older Americans Act, the source of support for the meal program, has not been reauthorized since 1995. Social service workers say the law should be updated so that it reflects changing demographics and health care trends. A Congressional committee has begun work on reauthorization legislation, and a bipartisan bill is expected this year, said a spokesperson for Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, a Democrat of New Haven.
"Congress needs to set policy for the next century," said Ms. Lewis of the state's Department of Social Services. "Reauthorization establishes policy for the program. If the act is reauthorized, you'll see stronger commitment, which usually means more money."
Meal programs rely heavily on fund-raising events and donations to defray expenses. Stephanie Belding, director of the meal program operated by the Community Renewal Team of Greater Hartford Inc., said she and other meal providers have also used automation to reduce labor costs and that they work hand in hand with volunteers -- many of whom are themselves elderly -- in order to save money.
"I think we're meeting the needs of the people we have in the program now," said Ms. Belding. "Are there others out there with needs to be met? Yes. Are there communities in which we don't provide the service? Yes."
The meal programs were intended to be grass-roots operations, dependent on staffing and money from local communities. Government funding was never expected to cover all expenses, noted Ms. Lloyd.
The Thames Valley Elderly Nutrition Project raises $500,000 annually from meal donations, contributions from municipalities and fund-raising events. Without that money, Ms. Underwood said, she would serve 500 fewer meals daily.
Still, Ms. Underwood had to cut her staff last year when support was reduced by approximately $70,000. She and the remaining staff worked in the kitchen and drove delivery trucks in addition to their regular duties, she said.
"We ended up burning the staff out," she said. On the other hand, "It's hard to tell people wanting home-delivered meals that there's a waiting list."
Home-delivered meals involve much more than food. They are a vital part of an elderly person's plan of care, said Mary Ellen Girard, a planner with the Eastern Connecticut Area Agency on Aging.
Delivery drivers are instructed to check on the person receiving the meal and notify the meal project immediately if no one answers the door. Drivers also watch for signs that the person is confused, hasn't been eating or is ill and alone.
Ms. Girard said that "the only daily visit for thousands of elderly people occurs through the person who delivers the meal. Many times it's the driver who finds the person on the floor or so ill they call an ambulance."
Greater challenges lie ahead. The number the elderly, especially those 85 and older, is expected to double by 2030. Many meal programs, locally and nationally, have waiting lists. There are 25 people on a waiting list in New London, Ms. Underwood said. A study published in 1996 found that 41 percent of home-delivered meal programs nationwide had waiting lists.
Ms. Belding perceives the problem as part of a larger issue.
"How are we going to care for these people, who want to stay in their own homes? To do that, we need to bring in the home health aide to clean and prepare meals. I see that need growing within the whole area of long-term care."
Ms. Belding said she and other meal providers are looking forward to a time when managed care will cover meal costs.
"We all have to realize the Federal Government can't pay for everything," she said. But, citing the benefits of home care, she added "it's a lot less expensive than nursing homes."

HEADLINE: Winter? Or How It Used to Be Known

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
THOSE who might have thought that the winter a year ago was the winter that wasn't can now readjust their thinking. The season that just drew to a more or less blase close was the real thing, the bona fide winter that wasn't, according to meteorological records.
It barely snowed. It froze occasionally. Golfers basked in a spring-like glow almost straight through from November to March, the period that used to be known as winter. Municipal road-clearing budgets went practically unused for the second season in a row. 
 A year ago in the Westchester section, the 1996-97 winter was described as wimpy. In retrospect and compared with the winter that failed to occur a year later, that was an exaggeration.
This year, February passed without a snowflake falling in Central Park for the first time since Federal officials began keeping weather records in 1869, and so far, the ground during March has been similarly nearly nonwhite. "The 1997-98 winter had the least amount of snow and was the warmest winter on record in a very long time," reported Michael Wooldridge, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service on Long Island.
As a point of comparison, New York recorded 75 inches of snow in 1996, including 21.2 in February.
In all, only 0.5 inch of snow fell on Central Park -- although rainfall was heavier than usual -- with temperatures averaging 7 degrees warmer than normal. The 1997-98 nonwinter was typical of an El Nino year when usually cold waters off the coast of Peru turn warm and spawn milder and wetter weather elsewhere, Mr. Wooldridge said.
There may be more atypical weather in store this year. El Nino's little sister, La Nina, could generate cooler than normal water temperatures off Peru during the summer, presaging a vicious hurricane season.
"We'll have to wait and see," Mr. Wooldridge said. "There are still a lot of what-if's in the equation."
Meanwhile, department of public works chiefs and finance commissioners throughout the county were cheering as they surveyed both their budgets and the condition of municipal roads after two mild winters.
In New Rochelle, Highway Superintendent Thomas G. McKnight said that in 39 years of serving the city: "I've never seen weather like this. We bought 3,000 tons of salt, and I doubt if we used 100."
Observing that the sandboxes along 75 miles of city roads were still full, he added: "Some winters are bad, some good. After a while, you learn to go with the flow."
Finance Commissioner Howard Rattner of New Rochelle was pleased as well, reporting that the surplus from the city's snow-removal budget was headed for the general fund. "Two years ago, we ran over our snow-removal allotment," he said.
In Greenburgh, Albert C. Regula, Commissioner of Public Works, said he too was happy. So far in the town's snow-removal budget for 1998, only $45,000 out of an available $325,000 has been spent. And the roads are going into spring with few potholes, allowing Greenburgh to move ahead with other projects. "We haven't had a lot of the freeze-thaw cycles that do so much damage," Mr. Regula said.
While many enumerated the pluses of the two-year respite from snow and ice, other businesses, like American A&C Towing in New Rochelle, sat idle far more than normal, Jeffrey Findel, the owner, said.
Some mild grumbling was also heard at Brewer's Hardware and Marine Center in Mamaroneck, where Anthony Lividini, the general manager, reported that snow blowers and salt were far from hot commodities.
At House Center True Value Hardware in White Plains, the owner, Alfred Urban, said the good weather set off a negative chain reaction.
"During harsh winters, things break down and people head for the hardware store," he said. "They have to reinsulate windows, make repairs. It affects us all the way down the line."
Local ski shops, however, reported booming sales. There may have been no snow in Westchester, but New England had more than enough. Christopher Foster, a store manager at Princeton Ski Shops in Elmsford, said of the winter: "Terrific season! Awesome. Better than we expected."
Overall, businesses prospered as a result of the warmer-than-normal temperatures, with Telecheck, a leading payment systems company in Houston, reporting that sales in New York rose 5 percent in February because shoppers were undeterred by weather as they were elsewhere as the storms of El Nino played havoc with the economy.
From a naturalist's perspective, Christopher Carrol Letts, a staff educator for the nonprofit Hudson River Foundation, expressed downright disappointment about the season that wasn't in the New York City region.
"I missed winter," Mr. Letts said, mournfully. "I like shoveling snow and cutting wood."
Another frustration: the birds had adequate plant life to feed on because there was no snow cover this year, making them only occasional visitors to Mr. Letts's feeding stations. "They didn't show up for dinner as I had hoped," he said.
And because the sap has been running since October, Mr. Letts did not insert maple syrup taps this spring, deciding to save the trees from further stress.
With temperatures remaining mild except for a few days in late December and early January, ice fishing, too, has been mostly out of the question.
The warm temperatures late in February and early March prompted bulbs to emerge prematurely, leaving most of them, except for the snowdrops, vulnerable to the cold snap that followed. "Along comes this crush of cold, and the dwarf iris and crocus are -- forget it," Mr. Letts said. "They're spaghetti."
The shad appearance up the Hudson River -- which starts about the time the forsythia blooms -- is due early next month and will continue through mid-May. But fishermen are watching closely to see if the fish, like the flowers, make an early run this spring.
Many of the spring birds, including the robin and the red-winged blackbird, arrived weeks ago, and some were unprepared for the cold, said Anne Swaim, a staff naturalist with the Saw Mill River Audubon Society, one of five Audubon chapters in Westchester. Most, though, are thriving and beginning their spring song making.
The skunk cabbage has been out since February; the gentle pussy willows are in bloom; the peepers are conducting their annual spring chorus, and woodpeckers are drumming happily on tree trunks.
At Muscoot Farm in Somers, four baby lambs made their debut recently, and a dozen more are expected shortly.
Goat kids are due, along with kittens, ducklings and Easter chicks, the County Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation said.
The shift to spring, along with the lengthening days, has generally contributed to humanity's improving mood, reported Dr. Maureen D. Empfield, director of psychiatry at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco. Those who suffer from episodes of seasonal affective disorder, depression that coincides with fewer hours of daylight, are finally experiencing some relief. And those who feel just plain down when the weather is dreary, are brightening, she said.
"Many people are affected by the weather," Dr. Empfield said. "When there's a lot of snow, they tend to be more anxious. When spring comes, they feel like getting outside and starting projects. Rarely does anyone come into my office and complain about the sunshine."
Looking ahead to spring, the county's golf courses -- Saxon Woods in Scarsdale, Maple Moor in White Plains, Mohansic in Yorktown Heights and Dunwoodie and Sprain Lake in Yonkers -- will officially reopen on Saturday. The county's automated tee-time reservation system at 242-4653 began accepting reservations yesterday.
The Parks Department will sponsor a countywide volunteer cleanup of its parks, pathways and nature preserves on April 5 from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. to remove graffiti, clear trails, prepare flower beds and clear away debris. All participants will receive discount coupons redeemable at county parks. For more information or to sign up for a project, call 285-4481.

HEADLINE: For Metropolitan Phoenix, 6 Golf Courses a Year

BYLINE: By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF 

DATELINE: PHOENIX

 BODY:
IF all of the fairways and greens in this hot, cactus-studded metropolis -- 165 golf courses, in all -- were placed in a straight line, the swath of grass and sand traps would stretch hundreds of miles across the Sonoran Desert.
Daunting? Perhaps. Overkill? Not at all, at least in the minds of many golf-course developers. 
 Since 1992, crews have bulldozed an average of six new golf courses a year through the sprawl of retirement communities and housing tracts here in central Arizona, according to the Arizona Golf Association. Studies by the National Golf Foundation in Jupiter, Fla., show that metropolitan Phoenix is among the country's leaders in the number of golf courses that have opened since 1992 as well as in the number planned or under construction.
"Golf wasn't always cool," said Lawrence Hirsh, president of Golf Property Analysts, a golf course appraisal and marketing company in Harrisburg, Pa. "But it is now. The growth has been going on for a while and I don't see it slowing down at least for the next few years."
The construction of golf courses in Phoenix, typically at a cost of $5 million to $15 million each, coincides with a renewed interest in golf development in many parts of the country, especially around Washington, Detroit and Boston and in the Sun Belt. In all, 2,432 courses opened or expanded between 1992 and 1997, according to the National Golf Foundation.
Experts have several explanations for this phenomenon. Tom Patrick, president of the Golf Industry Association of Arizona, says that demographics is one of the driving forces behind the construction.
"Baby boomers will be reaching the perfect age category when they have a lot of time on their hands," said Mr. Patrick, who is also vice president in charge of golf for SunCor Resort and Golf Management, which operates several courses in the Phoenix area. "They will be looking for entertainment and recreation like cruise ships and golf. People tend to play more golf as they grow older."
Development of golf courses, Mr. Patrick said, has been spurred by the improving economy, expanding tourism, the availability of Wall Street money to finance construction and improved access to bank loans. People are less skittish about investing in golf courses these days, he said, because of the sport's high profile and the emergence of large corporations that own several courses, rather than "mom and pop" entrepreneurs who operate just one or two.
Phoenix is particularly attractive for golf development, experts say, because it is among the fastest growing metropolitan areas in the country. The population, currently 2.7 million, grew 22.7 percent between 1990 and 1996.
The sport has a major economic impact on the state's economy. A study by the National Golf Foundation shows that golf generated $905 million in greens fees and related sales in 1996, placing it among the top 10 industries in the state, according to the Arizona Department of Commerce.
Golf is hardly a new arrival to Phoenix. For years, snowbirds by the thousands have migrated here to spend part of their winters with their drivers and putters.
PARTLY because of this legacy and partly to be competitive, developers of upper-middle-class and luxury subdivisions often dress up their properties with at least one golf course to entice buyers and increase the price that they can charge for a plot of land. Mr. Patrick said a lot in a golf community can cost a minimum of 10 percent more than one in a regular residential complex. If the lot is on the fairway, he added, it can cost as much as 200 percent more.
Such is the case at Superstition Mountain, a planned community that opened recently near Apache Junction, a suburb 50 miles east of downtown Phoenix. Earlier this month, workers at the development were putting the finishing touches on one of two 18-hole golf courses that sprout where there was once only palo verde, cholla and thorns.
The two rolling courses, set against a backdrop of scrubland and granite escarpments, were designed by Jack Nicklaus. Thomas J. Popa, vice president of the Superstition Mountain Company, said building the courses would probably have not been worth it if memberships, which cost $35,000 and are limited to 780 families, were the only source of income.
The Superstition Mountain Company, which is owned by Lyle Anderson Company, a major golf community developer, plans to sell 250 lots, from a half acre to an acre, at an average cost of $250,000. Negotiations are under way to sell an additional 750 lots to a builder, who will package the lots with a choice of several homes at an inclusive price of $250,000 and $650,000.
But the reliance on golf in developments like Superstition Mountain presents a potential problem, given that the number of enthusiasts is limited. Will nongolfers be reluctant to pay a premium for living near a golf course that they will never use?
Not at all, Mr. Popa said. "In developments like this one, at least 25 percent of the buyers don't play golf," he said. "But they want to live on the course.
"They like the parklike atmosphere and the guard-gate security," Mr. Popa added. "They just want to be in a planned community where home design is controlled so that they have the resale price security."
People from out of state who choose to live at Superstition Mountain may notice that the golf courses are somewhat different from what they are accustomed to. Regulations in Arizona limit every 18-hole course to the equivalent of 90 acres of grass to conserve water.
The result is sometimes a "target course," which requires players to hopscotch balls over saguaro cactus and dry washes to greens that are the size of a helicopter landing pad. At Superstition Mountain, designers complied with the law by creating roughs with less unmowed grass than usual and more patches of granite pebbles.
Some people question whether all of the multitude of golf courses in metropolitan Phoenix can survive. Gene Krekorian, a golf real estate specialist at Economics Research Associates in Los Angeles, said that some courses in Phoenix -- those that are not tied to a residential development or resort and must survive solely on golf-generated profits -- may eventually feel the strain of overbuilding.
"The long-term prospects are reasonably good," he said. "In the short- to mid-term, you can very easily have a situation where there is a softness in the market."
For the time being, people involved with the golf industry in the area report that tee times are so hard to get that players must often reserve a few weeks in advance. Greens fees on private courses, which can vary between $35 and $175 during the winter high season, are escalating.
"There is plenty of demand as long as the economy remains relatively strong," said Ed Gowan, executive director of the Arizona Golf Association.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
A Troubling Legacy of Conversions

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
HARDLY anyone would argue with the suggestion that now is a good time to be a co-op shareholder selling an apartment. Hardly anyone, that is, but someone whose apartment is in a building in which a majority of the units are still owned by the original sponsor.
"This is New York's dirty little secret," said James G. Samson, a Manhattan lawyer who represents co-ops and condominiums. "I would say that there are several hundred co-ops in New York right now where sponsors own more than 50 percent of the units." 
 The reason the issue is so important, Mr. Samson and other co-op lawyers say, is because apartments in such co-ops are virtually impossible to sell because lenders are exceedingly hesitant to provide financing in buildings in which fewer than half the units are owned by residents.
The problem, of course, is not new. Co-op lawyers, boards and shareholders in some buildings have struggled for years to convince, cajole or compel sponsors to sell units they still own. In other buildings, boards and shareholders have taken a less aggressive approach by deciding to wait patiently for the day when the co-op market itself would be robust enough to provide sponsors with the necessary incentive to sell apartments.
In recent months, however, co-op watchers have become increasingly concerned that sponsors in some buildings -- perhaps many buildings -- may never have that incentive. For while the sales market is as robust as it has been for many years, the rental market is equally strong -- and many sponsors seem content to hold onto their unsold apartments, collect the monthly rent checks and let the co-op board take care of the business of being a landlord.
"If a sponsor doesn't sell in this market, he has no intention of selling," Mr. Samson said. "And the scariest part is that if we don't hurry up and start forcing them to sell, we're going to destroy the credibility of the co-op market for good."
Mr. Samson is not the only co-op expert who is concerned.
Carol Ott, publisher of Habitat, a New York-based magazine that covers co-op and condominium issues, said she had been told by several co-op lawyers that some sponsors do not seem to be trying to sell their unsold units to new tenant-shareholders.
"This is particularly true for buildings in the outer boroughs," Ms. Ott said.
Errol Brett, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that there was an obvious reason why sponsors had stopped selling apartments after the initial conversion has taken place -- lack of an economic incentive to do so.
"The breakdown in the system is that when buildings were being converted, everybody believed that as sponsors obtained vacancies they would just continue selling until they were eventually out of the picture," he said. "But the sponsors realize now that if they sell an apartment that becomes vacant and they put the money in the bank, the interest they earn is nothing compared to what they can make in rent on a deregulated apartment."
Mr. Brett explained that when a building is converted, tenants generally can either buy their unit or remain as a rental tenant. If a nonpurchasing rent-regulated tenant moves out after the conversion, the apartment is then deregulated. That means that the sponsor -- or an investor who has stepped into the sponsor's shoes as a "holder of unsold shares" -- can now rent the apartment at market rent.
"You can be sure they get a better rate of return by renting," Mr. Brett said, adding that the rent being received typically far exceeds the maintenance charges the sponsor must pay to the co-op.
Steven M. Goldman, a Manhattan lawyer who represents both sponsors and co-op boards, acknowledged that sponsors do not appear to be in any rush to sell unsold apartments. The question, however, is whether there is any obligation on their part to do so.
"When I'm representing a co-op board, I'd like to say that a sponsor is obligated to effectuate the plan that he originally intended, which is the total conversion of the building to tenant-ownership," Mr. Goldman said. At the same time, however, Mr. Goldman said, it is generally presumed in the law that individuals cannot be forced to sell property they own simply because it would be in someone else's best interest for them to do so.
Jonathan Beyer, chief of the New York State Attorney General's Real Estate Financing Bureau, agreed.
"Right now, there is no law that requires a sponsor to sell his unsold units," Mr. Beyer said. Once a sponsor sells the minimum number of units required to declare the co-op conversion effective -- usually 15 percent of the units -- the sponsor may then sell additional units whenever he chooses to do so.
Moreover, Mr. Beyer said, since sponsors are required to file reports with the Attorney General's office after the conversion only when they are selling apartments, there is no easy way to determine how many sponsors now hold unsold apartments if they are not actively marketing them.
Generally speaking, he said, the only way the Attorney General's office can force a sponsor to sell units would be to prove that he or she never really intended to sell all the apartments in the building in the first place and thereby perpetrated a fraud against the shareholders. But since the proof required is one of original intent -- as opposed to a situation in which a sponsor who originally intended to complete a conversion subsequently changed his mind -- it is extraordinarily difficult to win such a case.
"There is no question that this can have a very practical and very real impact on consumers," Mr. Beyer said. "But we can only enforce the laws we have."
He added that shareholders who believe they are being harmed by continued sponsor involvement can call the Attorney General's office at (212) 416-8122 for a survey that will be used to develop future suggestions for legislation.
And though only the Attorney General can bring a fraud action against a sponsor under the Martin Act -- the law that authorized and now regulates the co-op form of ownership -- shareholders and boards are not entirely helpless.
"If you're a shareholder, and the sponsor is not selling his unsold apartments," argues Mr. Samson, "the sponsor is damaging the co-op and can be sued for common law fraud," something he has done on several occasions. "The problem is that it's often impractical to sue because you can end up with some expensive litigation."
Addressing that problem just became easier as a result of a court ruling obtained by Peter Livingston, another Manhattan co-op lawyer. Last month he convinced a New York appeals court to rule that a co-op board had the authority to impose an assessment against all shareholders -- including a sponsor -- to support litigation against the sponsor.
"That means shareholders and boards may not be as powerless as they may think," Mr. Livingston said.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/William Van Alen;
An Architect Called the 'Ziegfeld of His Profession'

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
THE Art Deco Chrysler Building at 42d Street and Lexington Avenue is a touchstone for New York City architecture. Yet its architect, William Van Alen, remains little known.
Only a few of Van Alen's works approached his 1929 masterpiece, but most show the hand of "the Ziegfeld of his profession," as he was described by a colleague. Although the dedicated may still make a pilgrimage to a few sites, many survive only in picture archives. 
 William Van Alen was born in 1882 in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. His father, Jacob, who founded the New York Stove Works, died around 1890. Van Alen's mother then married a hardware merchant. William Van Alen went to public school, and at 16 got a job as an office boy with Clarence True, at that time a major architect-developer of row houses on the Upper West Side.
Van Alen studied at night at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, and about 1902 was hired by the architectural firm of Clinton & Russell, working as a draftsman on the Hotel Astor in Times Square.
He later graduated from the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In 1930, the critic Kenneth Murchison wrote in The American Architect magazine that Van Alen was "the only American student who returned from Paris without a box full of architectural books." Murchison wrote that Van Alen's attitude as a young architect was, "No old stuff for me! No bestial copyings of arches and colyums and cornishes! Me, I'm new! Avanti!"
Van Alen started his own practice in 1911 with an office in the Metropolitan Life Tower at 24th Street and Madison Avenue, which from 1909 to 1913 was the tallest building in the world. No buildings designed by him independently in those years have been identified. In 1914 he formed a partnership with H. Craig Severance. In 1992, Severance's daughter, Faith Hackl Stewart, said that "Mr. Van Alen was a Beaux-Arts man, but my father got most of the business for the firm."
Many writers have credited Van Alen with the design of most of the firm's buildings, including their Standard Arcade, a two-story arcade of shops designed in 1914 at 50 Broadway. The building was not much more than two giant Doric columns with a wide sheet of glass between, unusual for its openness.
Another early design was the Albemarle, a 1915 office building at the northwest corner of Broadway and 24th Street, which was notable for the lack of a cornice. In this period Van Alen was still living at home in a Brooklyn row house at 411 Putnam Avenue with his mother, stepfather, sister and aunt.
On Jan. 16, 1916, Van Alen married Elizabeth Bagley at the Tompkins Avenue Congregational Church; Severance was his witness. The 1920 census recorded the Van Alens living in a five-story apartment house at 738 St. Mark's Avenue in Brooklyn.
In 1920 Van Alen began establishing his credentials as a modernist, with commissions for several big midtown buildings, including the Gidding Building, at 724 Fifth Avenue between 56th and 57th Streets, and the Bainbridge Building, at 37 West 57th.
The latter structure is the clearest Van Alen statement: a sheer wall of limestone with windows set flush at the line of the facade and giant show windows on the lower floors, discarding the pretense of heavy masonry walls "supporting" the upper ones.
These buildings were sophisticated but were appreciated mostly by connoisseurs. But in 1924, when Van Alen designed the new Childs restaurant at 604 Fifth Avenue, at 49th Street, everyone noticed. Van Alen rethought the midblock site (which had a church garden along the south end) and gave his building a curved corner wrapping back to the side wall so that the building overlooked the church lot, effectively doubling the frontage.
The Childs building, which still stands, had curved windows at this corner. It was apparently the first use of cantilevered construction, with no corner column, in New York. The critic John W. Harrington said the building seemed "at first blush to be entirely of rock crystal" and called the technique the "Quartz school of architecture."
Van Alen enlarged on this idea with his Lucky Strike storefront, at the northwest corner of 45th Street and Broadway, and the Delman shoe store at 558 Madison Avenue, at 56th Street, both completed in 1927. The Lucky Strike storefront was stainless steel, with an oval window curved around the corner, a spectacular feat of glazing that remains unduplicated.
At the Delman Building Van Alen put two oval windows on the second floor, where cobblers in blue smocks built shoes, attracting an audience. Murchison wrote that he made a "moving picture out of a couple of lasts." At the top he put a curious classic-modern touch, a triangular gable broken into an abstract rendition of the traditional form of a broken pediment.
In 1928 Van Alen was hired by Walter Chrysler to design a tall building at 42d and Lexington. Construction was nearly complete in late 1929 when the magazine The Architect awarded him a "Doctor of Altitude." The next year Murchison described Van Alen as "the Ziegfeld of his profession" and visited him in his office on the 65th floor of the Chrysler Building, which was guarded by "two firm and unyielding secretaries, both of them ex-shotputters from the Vassar College team."
That was the same year Van Alen had to sue Chrysler for his fee; he put a mechanic's lien on the building.
VAN ALEN also owned the northeast corner of 56th Street and Lexington Avenue, and a month before the October 1929 stock market crash he announced plans for a 26-story apartment hotel, which would have revealed how he would design to satisfy only himself. But the Depression killed that project, and the worsening economic climate must have cast a chilly gloom over the annual ball of the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design at the Hotel Astor.
Nonetheless, Van Alen appeared in a dazzling costume modeled on the Chrysler Building, made of silver metal cloth trimmed with black patent leather, flame-colored silk and flexible wood. The shoulder ornaments were the eagle heads at the 61st-floor setback.
There was not much to do for an architect of gaudy skyscrapers in the 1930's, but Van Alen tried other fields. In 1934 he published a design for a modernistic copper-clad house to be mass produced, and in 1936 he erected a similar steel house as a demonstration on a vacant lot at 39th Street and Park Avenue. The developer Charles Paterno built an apparent twin at the southeast corner of 107th Street and Riverside Drive in the same year. In 1938 Van Alen lost his Lexington Avenue site in foreclosure.
Although The Architectural Record reported that manufacturing plants for the house had been set up in New York, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Chicago to serve over 100 dealers, so far only the model itself is known to have survived. It was relocated to the Sea Gate section of Brooklyn about 1941, where it stands at 5100 Ocean View Avenue.
Van Alen died in 1954, leaving only his widow -- no children or even nieces or nephews are known to survive. He left most of his estate in trust for his wife, and upon her death it was distributed to the Beaux-Arts group. It sponsors a yearly Van Alen prize, and in 1995 took the name Van Alen Institute, to honor its benefactor. But of Van Alen's office records -- scrapbooks, drawings, correspondence, student work -- nothing is known to survive.
Van Alen's buildings have proved more durable. The Lucky Strike storefront in Times Square lasted only a few years, as did the Standard Arcade on lower Broadway. But the Childs restaurant building on Fifth Avenue, although altered, still survives. The Gidding and Bainbridge buildings are fairly intact, as is the Albemarle Building and, of course, the Chrysler Building.
The peculiar Delman Building, although demolished in the 1970's for what is now the Sony Building at 56th and Madison, has earned itself a minor footnote in history. Its successor, built as the AT&T Building, was considered remarkable for what was often called its "Chippendale top," the form of a broken pediment often seen on 18th-century furniture. A generation ago such classical details were startling.
In 1989 the architect Philip Johnson was queried about whether the origins of his newer building owed anything to the structure on the site. He wrote back that he had been unaware of Van Alen's building but that, in any event, "there is nothing very original about a broken pediment."

HEADLINE: What Public? Whose Use?

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
IF it were just a question of public relations, it would be no contest. On one side of Columbia Place is a casino belonging to Donald Trump. On the other are Vera Coking, a widow in a three-story building that she ran for decades as a boarding house; Clare and Vincent Sabatini, proprietors of a little Italian restaurant, and Peter Banin, a gold merchant who tends his shop into the wee hours, just himself and a small gray cat named Junior.
The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, a state agency, is condemning these properties, as the Federal and State Constitutions say it may do for a "public use." The plan is to turn them over to the Trump organization for parking and landscaping to enhance what one executive at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino called the visiting gambler's "sense of arrival." 
 That's not really a public use, the property owners say. But theirs is not an easy argument in the law of eminent domain, by which a government agency can take property. More and more often, courts are finding that a public use is whatever the legislature says it is -- not just building roads and schools but enticing bigger, better employers and taxpayers, whoever they may be. The old owner gets fair market value, the new owner moves in, and the government acts as real estate broker.
The case on Columbia Place is a test of how expansive this view can get. It is also a test of how far Atlantic City will go in breaking eggs to make omelets or, in this case, bigger casinos. That has been the story for 20 years of gambling in this city, an odd and spectacular social experiment that necessarily involves a lot of money and real estate changing hands.
 "New Jersey is so congested and urbanized, and because in Atlantic City casinos are almost a public use, Atlantic City is like a Petri dish for this stuff," said John H. Buonocore Jr., a Morristown lawyer who has handled several eminent domain cases in Atlantic City.
If it weren't for eminent domain, there would be no new Atlantic City. It owes its reconstructed self in part to the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, known as CRDA (CREE-dah), which in 13 years of existence has condemned 300 to 400 properties. Others have fallen to the city and its housing authority and similar agencies.
At the moment, the city map is dotted with condemnation fights involving casinos. Down the street from Trump Plaza, several properties around the Tropicana casino-hotel were condemned recently for its expansion. Up the street, at the site of the huge casino development planned by MGM Grand, one owner is contesting the designation of a tract including his property as an "area in need of redevelopment." And across town, several homeowners are suing in Federal court to stop a $330 million tunnel that would plow through a middle-class black neighborhood to deliver traffic to the planned Mirage casino development.
 
Trump Plaza Case: A Stark Example
But the question of whether a government can condemn land on behalf of someone else has seldom been presented to the courts in a case as stark as that now before Judge Richard Williams of Superior Court, who heard arguments last month on whether the constitutional concept of "public use" is large enough to encompass Donald Trump. A ruling is expected any day now.
"Even with a broad interpretation of government power, this case falls beyond it," said Dana Berliner, a lawyer for the Institute for Justice, a conservative legal organization in Washington that is challenging the condemnations. "I'm hoping this causes the New Jersey courts to draw the line. It's really hard to argue with a straight face that taking a woman's home of nearly 40 years to give it to Donald Trump for a limousine waiting area is a public use."
The Trump organization and the development authority do make this argument with a straight face. They point to the 1993 state law that authorized public funds and condemnation powers for the purpose of constructing hotel rooms and "appurtenant facilities" (later amended to include casinos) in Atlantic City. Under that law, they argue, these ends constituted a public use that the authority was securing when it entered an agreement with Trump Plaza Associates in 1993 to acquire the properties across the street.
"Our board acted appropriately four years ago," said James B. Kennedy, executive director of the development authority, in that the three parcels were necessary to the Trump expansion project as it was presented to the agency.
Now, however, the authority wants out. It is fighting Trump in the case before Judge Williams, claiming that the company's lawyers agreed last summer to drop plans to condemn the Sabatinis' restaurant and the gold shop belonging to Peter Banin and his brother Josef.
By then, the authority's lawyers argue, the hotel expansion was basically finished, having fanned out around the little corner occupied by the Banins and the Sabatinis. As for Mrs. Coking's property, sitting squarely in the middle of the expansion project, the agency says there is little it can do except proceed with condemnation.
In the meantime, the authority has taken a bath, public relations-wise. It did not look good when the British Broadcasting Corporation covered the fight, or when Garry Trudeau devoted six "Doonesbury" cartoons to the spectacle of Mr. Trump lining up against a little family restaurant.
Mr. Kennedy acknowledges the beating his agency has taken. He also notes that the authority's main job is collecting taxes from the casinos to rebuild the city, not helping the casinos acquire more property.
"When you're taking property from an established business or homeowner on behalf of a casino," he said, "even if you can make the legal, intelligent argument in terms of economic development and job creation, it's much, much harder for people to accept."
None of this hindsight was available in July 1994, when the development authority filed condemnation suits against the Sabatinis, Mr. Banin and Mrs. Coking. The authority had made its first and last offer: $700,000 for Sabatini's Restaurant, $169,500 for Mr. Banin's shop, which is next door, and $251,250 for Mrs. Coking's house, which stands alone down the street, across from the casino entrance.
The Sabatinis, who opened their restaurant in 1965, had done well. Mrs. Sabatini, in a quiet hour before dinner one recent evening, recalled the neighborhood when it was full of roses and hydrangea and guest houses that sent summer tourists to line up outside the restaurant.
When Trump Plaza was going up in the early 1980's, the Sabatinis fed so many company employees and workmen that they billed Trump by the week. Once the casino restaurants opened, business tailed off, but there's still a regular crowd at Sabatini's bar, including a lot of Trump employees. They had a few talks with Donald Trump's brother Robert ("Robert was a gem," Mrs. Sabatini said) about leasing the property to the Trump organization, but nothing came of it. Nor did anything come of vague talks with Donald Trump ("he's charming, but he's a businessman") in later years.
That's where things stood when the development authority announced its plan, made its offer and filed its condemnation suit.
"At first it's denial -- this can't happen," said Mrs. Sabatini, who acknowledges only that she and her husband are past retirement age. "You don't know where to turn except to lawyers, which is very expensive."
"When all this started, it was a personal dilemma," she continued. "At this point, it's a crusade for all small businesses in Atlantic City in conflict with government representing casinos. This shouldn't happen in Atlantic City. It shouldn't happen in this country."
That's what Peter Banin says, too. Mr. Banin, 42, a Russian immigrant and a goldsmith, runs the Golden Island, a jewelry business and pawnshop. The shop is tiny, but the price the Banins paid for the building five years ago -- $500,000 -- reflects what he says is the Golden Island's strong point: "location, location, location."
"I never thought that in the U.S. because one party wants something it will be backed up by the government," Mr. Banin said. "Here, you buy it, you pay for it, you work to pay for it again, and then CRDA says, 'I want this.' The worst part is this has nothing to do with public purpose. Trump Plaza Associates is not a public purpose."
He said Trump did make an offer last summer, for $225,000. "Everything has its price, and everything can be bought or sold," Mr. Banin said, "but not right now."
The Banins and the Sabatinis can at least hope that the development authority prevails in its efforts to drop condemnation proceedings against them, in which case they could stay put or negotiate directly with the Trump organization, which recently paid $1.2 million for a small parcel down the block.
For Vera Coking, there is no such possibility, unless the courts bar the condemnations altogether. Her white house stands alone in the shadow of Trump Plaza's east tower, with only a tiny skirt of sidewalk setting it off from an expanse of blacktopped parking lot.
 
A Clash Over Money, And Perhaps Over Egos
While the authority no longer wants to pursue her property, either, Mr. Kennedy said, it can find no legal grounds to drop the case and is obliged to carry out its condemnation of the house for $251,500, though that figure can be contested before a jury.
Mayor James Whelan, who favors leaving the Banins and the Sabatinis alone, is exasperated by Mrs. Coking. "It's a house next to a casino," Mr. Whelan said. "It doesn't work. We're rebuilding the city, and if Vera Coking wants to live in Atlantic City, and if she wants to live on a beach block in Atlantic City, we can accommodate her.
"Frankly, I think it's not so much an issue of Mrs. Coking wanting to stay there and live," he said. "It's a case of Mrs. Coking wanting a higher price for her property. That's what's going on."
Glenn A. Zeitz, Mrs. Coking's attorney, acknowledges that his client would accept a deal if it were sweet enough. "She has reached a point in her life where if they'd give her a fair price she'd sell," he said. "But she's not going to get run out of town on a rail from a place she has lived in for 35 years."
He cited the case of another elderly widow on the block who in exchange for her house accepted $150,000 from the authority, which then turned the property over to Trump; as part of the deal, Mr. Zeitz said, she was given a room in Trump Plaza and meals -- "all the meatball sandwiches they can make for her" -- for the rest of her life.
Mr. Zeitz says the Coking property is essential to Trump's plan because Trump never intended to keep using this block of multimillion-dollar real estate for surface parking but would put up more casino floor once it took title and razed the Coking house.
"Anybody who believes Donald Trump wants to take my client's property and use it to park 57 cars for 30 years also must believe in Santa Claus," Mr. Zeitz told the court last month.
Mr. Zeitz, who said he had talked to Mr. Trump several times about the case, speculated in an interview that "at this point it has become a matter of ego."
"Here's a man who has said the joy in life is in the getting, not the having," Mr. Zeitz said. "Well, this demonstrates it. If he was going to use good business sense, he would have settled this five years ago."
Mr. Trump and other company executives declined to respond. "We're just not going to comment while it's in litigation," said a spokesman, Thomas O'Neil.
Mr. Trump also figures in another eminent domain fight in Atlantic City, though in this one he is taking the other side. In this battle, he is supporting, to the tune of $165,209, some homeowners who would be displaced by the road and tunnel that is planned to link the Atlantic City Expressway with the property staked out for a casino development by Mr. Trump's rival Steven Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts.
Public use is not an issue here, as the project, which is to be financed mostly by the state, is a classic government use of land. Nonetheless, several homeowners and community groups have sued in Federal court to forestall condemnation by the state Department of Transportation on the ground that the decision to route the tunnel through an African-American neighborhood violates civil rights laws.
The plan would claim nine houses on Horace Bryant Drive, which runs along a canal on the city's west side, as well as scores of vacant and industrial properties. The lead plaintiff, Lillian E. Bryant, is a resident of one of the houses, a former freeholder and the daughter of Horace Bryant, who was the first black New Jersey Cabinet official.
Ms. Bryant, who campaigned in the 1970's to get casino gambling for Atlantic City, is not so bitter about Mr. Wynn, though she said she was infuriated to see him announce on television that "I'll be a great neighbor." Rather, she said, "I have to blame our elected officials who say people over on Horace Bryant Drive are getting in the way of progress."
"We were so intent on making sure organized crime wasn't going to come in," she said. "But we forgot to ask if we shouldn't have safeguards for our elected officials who might not be able to understand the sophisticated games people are going to play with them."
The case points up not just the power of casino money but the huge racial divide in Atlantic City. "The folks on the west side clearly feel betrayed," said Councilman Lorenzo Langford, who in the May 12 election is challenging Mayor Whelan's re-election. "The African-American community generally feels betrayed."
And like Ms. Bryant, Mr. Langford says the fault lies with the officials, state and local, who offer other people's real estate as economic incentives.
"Our economy is so healthy that everybody wants to be here," he said. "We need parking lots and hotels. Well, two things cannot occupy the same space, and we've got a limited amount of space. How many casinos should we have? Nobody's even asked that yet. I believe, personally, that we've got enough."
In court, that argument is mostly irrelevant. "In New Jersey, municipal action is almost always upheld," said Mary S. Henifin, a land-use lawyer who is representing residents of a downtown South Orange neighborhood that has been designated an "area in need of redevelopment."
Mr. Buonocore, the Morristown lawyer, is handling an Atlantic City case similar to Ms. Henefin's: his client, Joseph Zoll, owns eight lots in an "area in need of redevelopment" -- in this instance, redevelopment by MGM Grand on a 38.5-acre site subject to condemnation by the city. The city argues that Mr. Zoll is a speculator who has held out for a price substantially higher than other owners in the area received.
"It's just scary to me," Mr. Buonocore said, "when they can yell, 'Jobs! Progress! Development!' and say anybody who gets in the way is a bad person."
It has even been a little scary to the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, which changed its policy a year ago to work around property where possible rather than condemning it. Mr. Kennedy said the agency had changed since the Trump deal was struck, and that "there are folks on the board who look on condemnation as an illiberal practice."
Norman L. Zlotnick, the Banins' attorney, is encouraged by a recent state Supreme Court decision that urges "heightened scrutiny" of cases like these. But he said, "When you're trying to fight a condemnation on public-use grounds, New Jersey is a very hard state."
Meanwhile, if the court compels it, the authority will finish its work on Columbia Place. "In a perverse way," Mr. Kennedy said, "probably the most decent thing at this point is to try to move the condemnations as quickly as possible and let a jury decide what it's worth."

HEADLINE: Dear Shareholder: The Dog Ate Our Earnings

BYLINE: By JAMES SCHEMBARI 

 BODY:
THREE years ago it was O. J. Simpson's fault. In 1996, the Summer Olympic Games were blamed. Just last fall the fingers were pointed at Diana, Princess of Wales, of all people. When companies lose money, seemingly nothing is safe from taking the blame, except, maybe, the companies themselves.
This year's scapegoat is particularly defenseless: El Nino. Granted, the weird weather is the reason the anchovies of Peru left for cooler waters, the lobster catch is off in Cuba and gold mining has slowed in Guyana. But declining sunglass sales? A shrinking golf club market? No matter. Over the last month or so, one company after another has reported poorer numbers and blamed El Nino for the results. 

The Blame Game
Saks Holding, the parent of Saks Fifth Avenue, said in a monthly sales report that February sales were off because rain caused by El Nino kept shoppers at home. Similarly, the retailers Gottschalks, Federated Department Stores and Big Dog Holdings all cited El Nino for hurting sales. LaCrosse Footwear said it sold fewer shoes, Toro complained of lower snow blower sales and Callaway Golf didn't sell as many clubs. Labor Ready said it assigned fewer temps to outdoor jobs. Glacier Water Services didn't sell as much purified water. And with the sun behind the clouds so often in California, sunglass sales at Sunglass Hut weren't up to snuff.
Indeed, so many companies are blaming El Nino that some analysts wonder if this isn't just the latest "dog ate my homework" excuse.
"There's a habit to play up events of very low consequence," said Martin S. Fridson, a managing director of Merrill Lynch. "The nice thing about El Nino is that it's an act of God and nobody is going to blame management for a weather pattern."
Or as Robert Streed, a money manager at the Northern Trust Company, put it: "There's a joke that goes around my office: Whenever a retailer reports bad sales it is because of the weather; whenever they report good sales, it's because of astute management."
Hurricanes have always been linked to poor earnings. The Persian Gulf war was the villain in 1991. And as if O. J. Simpson didn't have enough troubles, he was blamed for keeping people inside watching his trial instead of going out to shop. Even the funeral of Princess Diana was blamed for keeping people at home.
"People were so transfixed by these events that they didn't go shopping?" Mr. Fridson said. "Can they prove that, can they measure that? I think the whole idea is to blow smoke in the investor's eyes."
Sometimes the excuse-making takes place on an even larger scale. Although news of the Titanic sinking affected the stock market in 1912, no company had the gumption to blame the disaster for poor earnings. But some executives in South Korea are reportedly complaining that the wildly popular movie "Titanic" is siphoning money from the nation's struggling economy.
 
Silver Linings
Mr. Fridson sees something at work in the company reports that he calls "earnings smoothing." Because Wall Street tends to reward a steady stream of positive earnings, he said, companies often use their leeway under accounting rules to manipulate their numbers to smooth out a negative quarter. But eventually they have to account for their losses, and an act of God is often an easy way out.
Of course, some companies have found silver linings in all the clouds.
The Coca-Cola Company, for example, says it has sold more soft drinks in Peru because those same abnormal warm temperatures that have driven away the anchovies have made Peruvians thirstier. The Michigan Ski Industries Association, while noting the lack of snow, reminded skiers that the warmer weather means "You can dress lighter and tan faster." At Liquidation World, a Canadian company that buys merchandise in insurance sales and bankruptcies and sells it to the public, Dale Gillespie, the chief executive, sounded almost gleeful about the weather.
"El Nino is wreaking havoc, from ice storms to flooding, which is providing a great variety of inventory for all of our 63 outlets," he said, noting that the company recently received hardware and clothing from a Montreal department store whose roof had collapsed in a storm. It also bid on a store full of women's shoes near Houston that was destroyed by a tornado.
"Every day is like Christmas around here," added Wayne Mantika, the company's vice president.
Peter L. Bernstein, an economic historian and investment adviser, is skeptical about the whole El Nino effect. "If El Nino was something endemic in the system," he said, "you wouldn't have seen the creation of more than 300,000 new jobs in January."

HEADLINE: DEMOGRAPHICS;
Reviewing Census Data, Essex Counts Blessings as Well as People

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
Few jaws dropped over last week's Census Bureau report showing that Essex County is not sharing in the general population increases of its suburban neighbors, and, indeed, has lost more people than any other New Jersey county. The cause was simply the march of history, demographerssay.
Still, the experts say, there are a few eyebrow-raisers in Essex County, which had a net loss of about 27,000 people from 1990 to 1997. (With more than three-quarters of a million people, it is still the state's second-biggest county, second only to Bergen). 
 For one thing, Newark seems to be faring rather well. Based on another batch of census data, released last November, 17 of Essex County's townships, cities and villages lost a higher percentage of population than Newark did. And that information was collected long before the New Jersey Performing Arts Center opened, an event hailed as a turning point in Newark's long-awaited renaissance.
There are other indications that Essex County's fortunes may not be fully represented by the population figures. James W. Treffinger, the County Executive, said that tax ratables -- everything the county can tax, from property to business transactions -- have increased by $120 million in the last two years, reversing a vicious decline. "The ratable base in 1992 was $38.1 billion," he said, "and between 1993 and 1995, we had lost an incredible $1.5 billion in ratables." Now, he said, "the ratable hemorrhage has stopped, and we're up by $120 million."
In 1995, he said, the county's bond rating was "one grade above junk bonds." He said the county's short-term bonds now earn Moody's highest rating, MIG-1. Additional improvements are expected if proposals to create a special improvement district in Newark are approved. The designation, already used in 30 areas in the state, including Jersey City, allows businesses there to charge lower taxes, and channels those taxes directly back into local improvements.
And jobs and population are a "chicken-and-egg story," said Thomas Wright, who directs the New Jersey office of the Regional Plan Association, which makes policy recommendations for sustainable growth in the metropolitan region of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
"People move out of urban areas because the quality of life is better and the cost of living is cheaper in the suburbs," he said. "Jobs go out there for the same reason. People go out because jobs are there, and jobs go out because people are there. The two trends reinforce each other."
What's worrisome about the trend, he said, is that while the population of themetropolitan region from Trenton to New Haven has grown by 12 percent in the last 30 years, its land use has grown by 60 percent.
The Regional Plan Association has long held that suburban crowding will destroy the very qualities that made the areas attractive in the first place. That could make urban areas like Essex County more attractive if they can increase their paying jobs and stock of affordable, attractive housing.
The housing is coming, according to Mr. Treffinger, who cited the 4,000 condominiums in Society Hill, a development that is bringing middle-class housing to downtown Newark. And Pam Goldstein, a spokeswoman for Newark's Mayor, Sharpe James, said that the Housing Authority had been tearing down the city's monolithic public housing units while building 1,700 to 2,000 units of low-density affordable housing. Still, there are no vast tracts of former farmland available for development as there are in the fast-growth counties, like Somerset, Hunterdon, Ocean, Sussex and Monmouth. In Essex County, new housing means demolition, rehabilitation, and lots of bureaucracy.
Mr. Treffinger noted that the county's tax levy as of December 1998 will be identical to the levy of January 1994. People on fixed incomes, like the elderly, will not find themselves priced out of their homes, he said, decreasing one source of population loss. And stable property taxes, he said, will make Essex County affordable to young couples, potential additions.
Demographic experts say that Essex County has found itself at the tail end of a wave of change that it used to lead. The county's boom time was in the 50's, according to James W. Hughes, dean of Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers.
"There was a tidal wave of metropolitan expansion in the postwar era in Bergen, Essex and Union Counties, counties that had both land for suburban development and urban centers," he said. The tract house movement was really focused in those three counties, he said, resulting in a chunk of housing stock now seen as antiquated.
"What's driving population growth and the housing market today is a maturing baby boom," he said. "The people born between 1946 and 1964 are now a generation with maturing derrieres. And in the process of their family-raising, they are trading up in the housing market. All the fast-growth areas are areas where the trade-up housing is being built." Otherwise, he said, such housing is hard to find.
The inner-city housing is no more appropriate, he said. The economic base of those early urban centers -- Newark, Elizabeth, and a dense core in Bergen -- was heavy manufacturing and industrial, and the housing for workers in those fields were houses for four to six families built in the late 19th century. "Those are at the end of their life cycle," Dr. Hughes said. "They have none of the amenities. People, to the degree they can leave them, will."
There are some "inlying suburbs" that remain very attractive, he said, but they are also very pricey. "Places like Maplewood, Short Hills, Livingston, and Montclair are ferociously expensive," he said, "so the broader middle class goes to the edge."
And while white residents are moving out of the county, so are black residents. The immigration of black southerners was a significant population source in the postwar era, but that has reversed, Dr Hughes said. "There is now a pronounced flow of African-Americans back to the South, particularly the middle class," he said.

Table: "BY THE NUMBERS/A Closer Look at Essex County"
New Jersey's population grew 4 percent, to a little over 8 million, from 1990 to 1997, according to date released last week by the United States Census Bureau. At the same time, however, Essex County lost 3.5 percent, more than any other New Jersey county. But there are some surprises in the statistics: for instance, Newark has lost less than most of the county's towns. Table lists population figures for cities in Essex county, during 1990 and 1997.

HEADLINE: Developmentally Disabled Want Institutions Closed

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Andrea Kannapell's cover article "Into the Outside World" (March 15) deals with the closure of two different kinds of institutions, one for people with psychiatric disabilities, and the other for people with developmental disabilities. They were set up to do entirely different things for people with entirely different disabilities. 
 I am writing in response to what she said about closing developmental centers, those places where 3,500 people with developmental disabilities still live in this state. Ms. Kannapell gives a very balanced view of the controversy over closing developmental centers. One gets the impression that opinions on the subject are equally divided and that equally cogent arguments can be made on either side.
Nothing could be further from the truth. The overwhelming majority of people who have lived in those places would never go back to them, want their friends freed from them and want them all closed. Most professionals and most parents of other people with developmental disabilities agree with them. Even though 4,500 families are on a waiting list for community placement, no parents are trying to put their child in one of those institutions today.
The closure is opposed by two small groups of people: those who make their living off of developmental centers -- employees and their unions, the politicians and the businesses in the communities where they are situated -- and a few hundred families of people still in there.
The economic interests of the first group should not be allowed to keep 3,500 people hostage. The opposition of the family members is more troubling, until one discovers that 25 scientific studies have shown that 83 percent of families find their loved one is better off living in the community after he or she is placed there, even though they may have opposed the closure before it happened.
As Ms. Kannapell points out, New Jersey leads the nation in the number of people in those places per capita. That only begins to tell the story of how far behind this state is in the humane treatment of its citizens with developmental disabilities. Five states have closed all their developmental centers; 17 have 200 people or fewer in them.
Those places are a thing of the past. Keeping people in them any longer is wantonly cruel and stains our state's good name. Governor Whitman should be commended and supported for moving to close them. Many of us who have disabilities voted for her last November for that reason alone. It is that important to us, that other people like us are set free to live their own lives at last.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Royal Blue Collars

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
FOR a quarter-century, the message from the job market has been loud and clear. Avoid traditional blue-collar work. Go to college. Scramble for a foothold in the service industry elite, where unions and seniority mean little and adaptability is the most prized talent. If you are really ambitious and prepared to risk your life savings, start your own business.
But don't try telling that to Lynn Hummel, a former bank clerk who tripled her earnings by becoming a longshoreman in Los Angeles. Or to Eugene Vasser, who says he makes "substantially more than $100,000 a year" working for a welding equipment maker in Cleveland that pays according to individual productivity. Or to Herman Aguirre, a Colombian immigrant who worked his way up from janitor to master jewelry maker in a New York City loft factory and now commands a six-figure income. 
 This handful of redwoods, of course, should not be mistaken for the forest. The median annual earnings of male high school graduates in 1995 were just $29,000, down by one-fifth since 1976 after taking inflation into account and barely 60 percent of those of their counterparts with college credentials. The earnings data for women show the trend, too: the average pay for those with high school diplomas was $19,856 in 1995, down 5 percent in 20 years and just 59 percent of the earnings of college graduates.
Nonetheless, in the right jobs and under the right circumstances, "there's still a pot of gold for blue-collar workers at the end of an increasingly slender rainbow," said Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas.
For some, success turns on working longer and harder. For others, high pay comes with highly valued skills not taught in college. And for still others it is a matter of breaking into the club -- of joining one of the small, powerful unions that vault semiskilled workers into the upper-middle class. Even if only a handful can follow these paths, the lack of earnings opportunities for people who work with their hands makes every case worthy of a close look.
Consider Ms. Hummel, who was a 29-year-old divorced mother of a chronically ill child and had no health insurance back in 1984, when she first heard about job openings at the Port of Los Angeles.
"All I knew -- and needed to know -- was that it paid well and came with medical benefits," she recalled.
Along with thousands of others, she applied for a place on the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union roster of "casuals" -- people who are eligible for employment on the wharves at union scale when seasonal demand exceeds the supply of union members. Five years and hundreds of phone calls later, she was allowed to take a test to prove she had the dexterity and strength for the work.
In an era when few women worked at the sprawling port, the initiation was rough. "The men called us tramps," she remembered. Worse, there was little formal training, and few colleagues were willing to show her the ropes in a risky job involving heavy equipment. But she persisted, eventually quitting her full-time job at Coast Federal Savings so she could accumulate enough hours to qualify for full union membership.
Ms. Hummel, now 43, made $81,000 last year operating the oversized forklifts that stack the big steel containers and instructing casuals to maneuver trailer trucks through the maze of dockside obstacles. Teaching -- especially teaching the women trying to break into the union -- is obviously a labor of love as well as money. "You have to remember where you came from," she said.
Most longshoremen make considerably more than Ms. Hummel: last year, full-time workers at West Coast ports averaged $97,000. Unionized clerks working comparable hours averaged $114,000, while foremen averaged $148,000.
Ms. Hummel has opted for regular hours, avoiding better-paid weekend and night work. And she can afford to. Apart from shoes ("I have a thing for Joan and David"), sport utility vehicles (she drives a Chevy Tahoe) and winter vacations in Mexico, her tastes are modest. Besides, she is now married to a longshoreman, and her daughter, who has grown out of her childhood asthma, has managed to join the union, too.
Loading and unloading ships is dirty and fatiguing work. "Just try attaching a 72-pound lashing bar to a container when it's raining and windy," Ms. Hummel said.
But mining and bricklaying are difficult jobs, too, though median annual earnings in those two fields barely top $35,000. Longshoremen earn much more for one obvious reason: their union controls the supply of labor at every West Coast port.
There is a less obvious reason, too -- what Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard, calls "the importance of being unimportant." While the $700 million paid to West Coast longshoremen in 1996 was hardly small change, their wages represent only a tiny fraction of the total cost of moving hundreds of billions of dollars worth of international cargo from factory to consumer. Accordingly, shippers are prepared to pay the premium needed to have the work done.
But just as competition has eroded the seemingly impregnable positions of other elite unions -- notably those of the construction trades -- pier workers may someday become vulnerable, too. There are no legal impediments, for example, to someone building a modern, high-volume port in Mexico, out of the reach of the union.
"It would kill us," said Joe Miniace, president of the Pacific Maritime Association, a trade group for cargo carriers on the West Coast.
Mr. Miniace isn't saying what the businesses he represents will ask from the longshoremen to forestall this threat. But he makes no secret of the potential for further automation on the docks.
"Computerization," he predicted, "could raise productivity as much as containerization has over the past 40 years."
 
The Profits of Productivity
If Ms. Hummel's good fortune seems a throwback to 30 years ago, when many unions had the leverage to dictate wages, Eugene Vasser's is in part a function of an even older labor tradition: piecework.
Mr. Vasser left Birmingham, Ala., after graduating from high school in 1968. Then he served in Vietnam as a noncommissioned officer, where he coordinated Army flight operations. And then he hit gold -- a job with the Lincoln Electric Company.
Lincoln is America's largest specialized manufacturer of welding equipment, with sales of $1.16 billion in 1997. But the reason that the company's name is familiar to almost every business school student is its longstanding commitment to linking pay to both individual productivity and the profitability of the corporation.
Millions of American workers, from sales representatives to truckers, are paid according to their output. Many others collect annual bonuses tied to their employers' profits or revenues. But Lincoln is nearly unique among large American companies, paying all shop-floor workers according to a formula based on how much they produce, how much they contribute to the team effort and how much the company earns.
In Mr. Vasser's case, that adds up to a whole lot. Last year, despite taking more than a month's unpaid leave in the Army Reserve, he had income of more than $100,000 from Lincoln.
In part, that was a matter of focus. He tends three different work stations in what could pass for a 1950's metal shop, tackling one set of tasks when there is slack in another. He takes just 20 minutes for lunch in his nonunion employer's grimly functional cafeteria. And he is constantly monitoring inventories of supplies. "You have to be pro-active," explained Mr. Vasser, who is 47.
In part, too, his income reflects the long hours he puts in -- typically 10 hours a day during the week, plus 8 hours on Saturday.
"I have a very understanding wife," he said.
Delayed gratification is apparently the watchword in many phases of Mr. Vasser's life. He lives simply in Twinsburg, Ohio, far from the tumult of Cleveland, and commutes in a five-year-old Toyota pickup. While three children (including two, by a first marriage, now in college) can run though a lot of cash, he and his wife, a social worker, still manage to save 40 percent of their income.
"When I retire, we'll go back to Alabama," he explained, where the Vassers have already bought some land.
Mr. Vasser, who has been at Lincoln Electric for 25 years, ranks in the top 10 percent in pay at the company. But all 3,400 Lincoln Electric shop-floor workers do well, with wages averaging $58,000 in 1995 (the last year for which the company would provide data), not counting the value of their rich package of medical, vacation and retirement benefits. And the company, which is publicly traded, hardly operates as a charity. Last year's net income of $85 million represented a healthy 20 percent return on shareholder equity in a very competitive industry.
Is there a lesson here for companies fighting tooth and nail to keep down wages -- or for the average production line worker making $13 an hour? Lincoln Electric thinks so. It publishes how-to books on incentive pay and invites anyone with a serious interest in the subject to study how the company manages to pay twice as much as competitors do while remaining a low-cost producer of welding machinery.
But very few manufacturers have taken the pay-for-performance route, and the reasons are not hard to fathom.
For one thing, it is difficult to sustain large differences in pay for the same job category. Measuring individual productivity in industrial settings can be a challenge, too, points out Edward Leamer, an economist at the Graduate School of Management at the University of California at Los Angeles.
Lincoln maintains an ever-changing catalogue that rates thousands of operations according to the time and skill they require. Inevitably, there is ambiguity. New equipment, which often reduces the pay associated with an operation, can anger workers. And the interdependence of operations, in which all workers must pull their own weight to maximize output, can lead to friction.
"People know each other's warts and bumps, and they don't always talk about them politely" at the regular shop-floor meetings, acknowledged Dick Sabo, a spokesman for Lincoln.
Lincoln's success is also difficult to replicate because it requires highly disciplined and motivated labor. The pace is fierce and overtime is often mandatory. Moreover, with very few foremen around, workers must often make decisions on their own.
"Only one applicant in 75 is hired," Mr. Sabo said, "and nearly half of them leave within 90 days."
 
The Apprenticeship Track
Herman Aguirre's work setting could hardly be more different than Lincoln Electric's Dickensian shop floor. The cheerful loft where Mr. Aguirre labors on Greenwich Street in Manhattan's TriBeCa neighborhood looks like an exceptionally tidy artist's atelier. But his rag-to-riches blue-collar experience is probably even harder to mass-produce.
Mr. Aguirre, the son of a cafe owner, finished high school in Bogota, Colombia, then worked there as a shoe and dress salesman. But ambition drove him to emigrate in 1980 to the United States, where relatives of relatives introduced him to Jose Hess, the owner of a company bearing his name that makes high-end gold and diamond jewelry.
Hired as a cleaner-upper and all-around gofer, Mr. Aguirre soon found his way to an informal apprenticeship, learning jewelry-making late in the afternoon after he had finished his janitorial duties.
"He was sneaking in early to get the cleaning done," Mr. Hess recalled.
Mr. Aguirre had no previous training as an artisan, but he clearly had the aptitude, working his way from tasks like polishing finished jewelry to far more demanding ones. At 40, he is now Jose Hess Inc.'s model maker, carving prototypes of new designs from blocks of wax and creating elaborate instructions for casting and assembling the pieces. "He's at the top of the craft," said Mr. Hess, whose jewelry is sold at Fortunoff and Saks, among other stores.
The job pays $30 an hour, plus benefits. Mr. Aguirre, however, has set up a workshop in his home in Elmont, N.Y., where he labors nights and Saturdays at his regular wage; that brings his average weekly earnings from Jose Hess to close to $2,000.
"With two children in Catholic school, parents in Colombia and a wife who stays home, I have a lot of bills to pay," Mr. Aguirre said.
This route to high-paying work -- an apprenticeship in a demanding craft -- is still open. But just barely. Efforts to integrate high school curriculums with local job demands have yet to have much impact. Unions that run apprenticeship programs, mainly in construction trades, are losing ground. And -- probably most important -- corporations are not motivated to invest heavily in worker training if the skills are portable.
"Employers won't train people who have a high probability of not being there next year," explained Alan Krueger, an economist at Princeton University.
Another key factor is that computers are changing -- and usually reducing -- the skills needed to perform traditional blue-collar crafts. Mr. Aguirre is now working to improve his English so he can use the software that is already available for designing simple jewelry. And it is a safe bet that the next generation of jewelry makers will need to know more about computers and less about carving butterflies out of wax.
 
Lessons From the Sea
The skills gap left by unions and employers could, in theory, be filled by government. Bill Clinton came to office preaching just this, and it remains on his agenda. But if hopes of a big push in training have not been fulfilled, there is evidence elsewhere in the economy of the payoff to government investment in "human capital." Indeed, that is how Neil Scheuerlein managed his shot at the brass ring.
Mr. Scheuerlein finished high school in Concord, Calif., in 1976. With better-than-average grades, he could have gone to a good college at the state's expense. But rebelling against the values of the day, Mr. Scheuerlein enlisted in the Navy immediately after graduation. He trained for two years to be a nuclear technician and then spent four years as an electrician's mate on the U.S.S. Porgy, a fast-attack submarine. But, disappointed by the prospects for advancement -- "they weren't going to let me command a sub," he jokes -- and yearning for a stable family life, he left the Navy in 1982 with the rank of electrician first class.
The nuclear Navy has long been a fast track to jobs in the commercial power industry; nuclear utilities covet the training, military discipline and rigorous psychological screening required for submarine service. Like many others before him, Mr. Scheuerlein followed the path of least resistance, taking a job at Southern California Edison's San Onofre nuclear complex north of San Diego.
At San Onofre, where twin 1,100-megawatt units can produce a fifth of the electricity consumed in Southern California, Mr. Scheuerlein quickly rose through the ranks. Beginning as an apprentice equipment operator, he passed the Federal licensing test in 1990 to become a control-room operator -- the highest nonmanagement job in a nuclear plant.
The work carries substantial responsibilities. Like airline pilots, control-room operators mix long stretches of boring routine with occasional moments of tense decision-making. Shutting down a malfunctioning reactor prematurely can cost the utility millions of dollars; permitting one to operate when there is a risk of releasing radiation is obviously even worse.
And, like airline pilots, nuclear control room operators are rewarded with modest hours and large paychecks. Mr. Scheuerlein works as many as 50 hours some weeks, but gets 14 consecutive days off in every five-week cycle. He is reluctant to reveal his exact pay. But under the Utility Workers of America union contract, control-room operators make $34.70 an hour plus very substantial premiums for working overtime, nights and weekends. "Just say I make between $80,000 and $110,000 a year," Mr. Scheuerlein suggested.
"Do I have enough money? Of course not," he said. His income supports two sons in grade school plus a stay-at-home wife, Renee, a college graduate just finishing the requirements for a California teaching credential. And there are mortgage payments on a house in the relatively expensive town of Oceanside.
Still, it's a lot more than most high school graduates can ever hope to earn, unless they begin successful businesses of their own. And it is tempting to credit his union -- or "the importance of being unimportant" -- with the achievement.
Tempting, but probably wrong. For starters, Mr. Scheuerlein served a long, poorly paid apprenticeship in the Navy, a qualification that Southern California Edison has found to be at least as useful for nuclear control room operations as a college degree. What's more, the Federal Government insists that a minimum number of licensed technicians be on the job at all times at nuclear power plants. For power companies, it pays to offer hefty wages to licensed operators in order to minimize turnover.
But that hardly makes nuclear technicians a model for improving the earnings of noncollege graduates in the real-world job market. Few blue-collar workers, after all, can benefit from so much training at Washington's expense -- or so much regulation at their employer's expense.
Indeed, as intriguing (and inspiring) as the success of these four workers may be, there is little in their stories to suggest a plausible route to upward mobility for the large majority of uncredentialed workers. Union bargaining power has long been on the wane. Lincoln Electric has few imitators. Employers are understandably reluctant to invest in long apprenticeships.
So the conventional wisdom rings true: Knowledge workers are kings, and opportunities for those lacking a college education are extremely limited.
"In an economy as large and varied as America's, you'll find some blue-collar workers who win the lottery," said Mr. Krueger of Princeton. "But the sad fact is, most people who lack white-collar skills aren't finding jobs that support a middle-class life."

HEADLINE: ANN ARBOR, MICH.;
It's Not Your Mother's VW

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
THE bull's-eye of Volkswagen's target market for the New Beetle is a place like Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan and tens of thousands of young, well-educated trend setters. So how do students, soon to be gainfully employed and ready to release their pent-up consumer demand, describe the car?
Sweet. Adorable. Cute, cute, cute. 
 Outside the Theta Xi fraternity house, members re-created Volkswagen-stuffing contests of past decades, and 10 managed to cram into a silver Beetle without trying too hard. "My mom fell in love with one of these long ago, and I think I could do the same," said one Theta Xi, Evans Longacre, a senior majoring in math and economics. "My mom had one, and she cried when my father forced her to sell it at a garage sale."
Across the street, a half-dozen young women dashed, squealing, out of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority house for a closer look.
"I love it -- it's the cutest thing," said Ali Felton-Church, 18, a sophomore biology major. "I like that it's compact on the outside but roomy on the inside."
Lindsey Yellich, 19, a sophomore in organizational studies, said she felt special ties to Volkswagens. First, her hometown is Santa Cruz, Calif., a laid-back town where Beetles have roamed for decades. And, second, "my mom went into labor for me at my dad's office, and he had to use his secretary's Beetle to take her to the hospital," she said, adding, "She got nauseous riding in the back seat, because there was no room."
Although the New Beetle got mostly standing ovations, there were a few Bronx cheers. Steve Raasch, 33, a graduate student in electrical engineering, conceded that the car was "striking looking, no question." But, he said, "the whole concept of 'It's a Bug, it's a Bug' is silly. It's not a Bug; it's a Golf." He described the car as "a brilliant marketing ploy on the part of VW."
And Ruben Delasierra, 36, a graduate student in natural resources, said: "It's oxymoronic to match a Bug with a water-cooled engine. The chassis is not a unique chassis. It looks like it has too much makeup. VW should give people something that is closer to the real thing."
But a group of high school students, visiting Ann Arbor from Lake Orion, Mich., called the New Beetle "awesome," "sweet" and, of course, "cute." And at Wines Elementary School, only one student in Cheryl Petsch's first-grade class dared to call the Beetle ugly. Most ran around the car to verify what their teacher had told them: Somebody moved the engine from the back to the front. MICHELLE KREBS

Welcome to Your Closet: Employers Cut Costs With Smaller Offices

BYLINE: By ELAINE UNDERWOOD 

 BODY:
WHEN Karen Berman starts her new job this week as director of marketing and sales at Tempest Software in New York, she will be sitting in a tidy cubicle no bigger than the average bathroom. Not that she minds.
"I don't need a big, fancy office -- in fact, I think it would be inappropriate," said Ms. Berman, who is more concerned that her sales calls will disturb Tempest's hard-working programmers. 
 Since the 1960's, corporate America has cut real estate costs by putting support staff in cubicles. More recently, though, cubes have also become the norm for senior managers like Ms. Berman. It has come to the point where requesting a spacious private office as a perk can be politically incorrect.
In the mid-1980's, a poll conducted by Michael Brill, a workplace researcher and architect, found that 65 percent of recently promoted workers wanted more office space as a reward for their labor.
"They wouldn't have the guts to say that anymore," said Mr. Brill, president of the Buffalo Organization for Social and Technological Innovation, which designs new office environments for Xerox, Sun Microsystems, I.B.M. and other blue-chip companies. "The world has changed drastically. You are not a team player if you ask for more space."
Personal space is shrinking as companies try to cut real estate costs, usually the second-largest corporate expense after personnel costs. In 1994, upper management's private stake averaged 289 square feet a person, according to the International Facility Management Association. By 1997, at the 297 corporations in the survey, upper management made do with 280 square feet.
And every foot counts. A loss of even nine square feet means that a coffee table and extra chairs may have to go.
Thanks to the booming economy, commercial real estate in Manhattan, like a number of other prime business markets, is as tight as prime residential properties. Jonathan Switzer, senior managing director at the Winoker Realty Company, who specializes in office space south of 30th Street, has seen real-estate costs mushroom. "Two years ago, I was doing deals at $16.50 a square foot; the last deal I did was at $23 a square foot," he said.
One tenant needed to add eight more people to an already crammed space. After having Mr. Switzer survey the market, then trying another broker, the client returned. "They said they'd renew their lease and find a space planner to figure out a way to make everyone fit," Mr. Switzer said.
As computer technology storms the workplace, companies are finding that employees need less space to store paperwork. And some corporate real estate planners are questioning whether employees who travel frequently even need their own offices.
Consulting businesses are among the most aggressive space shrinkers. Between 1992 and 1997, Ernst & Young cut workers' space from 300 square feet a person to 160 square feet. "We've reduced our real estate portfolio by almost 30 percent as we've continued to grow," said Larry Ebert, the director of real estate services at the firm. By holding space to a minimum, real estate has slid from the firm's second-biggest expense to third, behind technology.
TO get there, Ernst & Young took the next step, embracing "hoteling" -- a policy under which auditors and management consultants, who spend most of their time at clients' offices, call ahead to book cubicles at the home office as needed.
A few days before a trip home, for example, a consultant will call the firm's "concierge" to reserve a room. A credenza with the consultant's papers is wheeled in and his or her personal phone number is hooked up to the extension in the temporary office. The worker-to-office ratio at some Ernst & Young locations runs as high as 10 to 1.
"In some offices, hoteling is strained," Mr. Ebert said. "You call and we might not have a room. But over all, the system works very well."
Office furniture makers like Herman Miller of Zeeland, Mich., spend much time figuring out how to make tight spaces livable. One company system provides personal cabinetry for active work files, but workers are supposed to file works in progress in communal file cabinets in public areas. Finished work goes to off-site archives.
Other furniture systems in the Herman Miller line-up include "body pocket" desks that curve to make the space seem less confining, according to Keith Winn, a research program manager at the company. "Panel heights are coming down, too," he said. "We find the less enclosed you are, the less you will feel like you are in a box."
Facility managers can have problems, too. One told Shari Epstein, the associate director of research at the International Facility Management Association, that his job was like "trying to figure out how to fit 18 eggs into a carton that holds 12."
It is a growing refrain. Walter Hunt, a managing principal at Gensler, an architectural and interior planning company, said that when one client, a Boston financial institution, moved to new headquarters later this year, managers and administrators would receive offices measuring 42 square feet, compared with 64 square feet today.
Wanting universal standards for employee work stations, the company had Gensler study its South American operations, where managers and administrators had just 28 square feet of space apiece. "We found that to be too dense," Mr. Hunt said. "There's a limit to how tight you can go."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT: FOCUS ON HOME EQUITY LOANS -- 125 PERCENT LOANS;
Bigger Amounts May Bring Bigger Risks

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM 

 BODY:
PERHAPS the most aggressively promoted deal in home equity now is the "125 percent" loan, a financial product that seems to defy the usual laws of collateral.
Jim Palmer pitches these loans for the Money Store, and tabloids are filled with ads for them by other lenders. Even so, "I would never let someone in my family get one," said Margaret Scott, president of Mortgage Advisory Services, a mortgage broker in Manhattan. 
 Lenders have usually insisted that a mortgage and home equity loan add up to no more than 90 percent of a home's value. But about two years ago, some lenders raised that ceiling, issuing loans that, when combined with mortgages, came to as much as 125 percent of a home's market value.
Say a homeowner has a house worth $200,000 and a mortgage balance of $150,000. With a 125 percent loan, the homeowner can borrow another $100,000, resulting in total debt of $250,000.
By conservative estimates, about $10 billion in 125 percent loans were made last year, said Christine Clifford, vice president of David Olson Research, a Columbia, Md., company that tracks home equity data.
Earlier this month, the First Union Corporation entered the market by agreeing to buy Money Store, a Union, N.J., lender specializing in home-equity and mortgage loans to people with troubled credit histories that now offers 125 percent loans. Spokesmen for the Money Store declined to comment for this article.
Most of these loans are made by lenders other than banks, Ms. Clifford said; First Plus Financial Group in Dallas has about 40 percent of the market. Lenders say the loans are often used to pay off credit cards -- debt that averages $30,000, she said.
For lenders, the drawback of a 125 percent loan is clear: part of the debt is essentially uncollateralized.
Lenders hedge that risk by charging a steep price. Interest rates are generally in the range of 14 percent, far greater than for the average home equity loan, now around 9 percent. And to get the loans, borrowers may also have to pay three to six points in advance; each point is 1 percent of the amount borrowed.
Also, the interest paid on home equity loans, including the existing mortgage, is tax-deductible only up to the value of the home. Anything more than 100 percent of value is not deductible.
Lenders offering 125 percent loans defend them as serving a variety of consumer needs and being a route to cheaper debt.
Daniel T. Phillips, chairman and chief executive of First Plus, said that the average loan his company issued was $32,500 and that the average value, combined with the original mortgage, was 111 percent of the home's value. The majority of borrowers are 30 to 54 years old, have average income of $57,500 a year and want to pay off high-interest debt on credit cards.
Only about 5 percent of those who inquire about the loans end up getting them, he said. "The bar has been lowered in some companies," he said, "but we have continued to raise the bar."
Still, even some lenders in the "subprime" market are wary of the loans. Champion Mortgage, the Parsippany, N.J., lender that was bought last year by Keycorp, does not offer them. Daniel Rich, its chief financial officer, said, "We cannot see how giving someone a 125 percent loan makes them better off and how their ability to pay is that certain."DEBRA NUSSBAUM

FOR Ormond and Rosie Jackson, an elderly couple in Brooklyn living on Social Security, the problem started in 1990, when a salesman knocked on the door saying he could have the windows on their home repaired for payments of $43 a month over 15 years. Six years later, the Jacksons had amassed $88,000 in new debt, seen the equity in their home melt away, paid tens of thousands of dollars in fees and been served with foreclosure papers by their lender.
Helen Ferguson, a widow in Washington, needed money in 1991 to repair her home, on which she was making a monthly mortgage payment of $260. In the next five years, she says, she was talked into borrowing ever-larger amounts through a series of refinancings, each of which included hefty payments for points and credit insurance, leaving her with $70,000 in new debt and monthly payments of $810 -- far above her monthly income of $504 from Social Security. 
 Their stories -- laid out in testimony last week before the Senate Special Committee on Aging -- are increasingly common among people who have taken home equity loans. Regulators, consumer groups and Congressional investigators say the poor and the elderly have proved especially vulnerable to predatory lending practices by companies intent on generating big fees by constantly refinancing high-interest loans.
The problems have grown in tandem with the "subprime" lending industry -- companies that make loans to people with little income or with checkered credit histories. The industry has grown sharply in recent years, from a tiny niche in consumer lending to 15.5 percent of total home equity lending in the first half of 1997, according to the Federal Trade Commission.
A trade group for the industry said it condemned any abusive practices, but said they were limited to a tiny minority. One of the few companies whose practices were criticized by name during the hearing -- the Associates First Capital Corporation, which is in the process of being spun off to shareholders by the Ford Motor Company -- said in a statement afterward that it adhered to the "highest standards."
Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, who held last week's hearing, said most lenders acted ethically and legally.
But, he said, the industry is being tainted by a few lenders that mislead consumers and stretch or break the law. Jodie Bernstein, the director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said complaints about subprime lenders had increased.
Regulators and consumers groups said three types of lending practices drew the most complaints from consumers.
The first is known as equity "stripping." It occurs when the lender grants a loan to a consumer based not on the borrower's ability to repay but rather on the equity that the borrower has in a home. The elderly are particularly vulnerable to the practice because they often have substantial equity in their homes but live on fixed incomes.
"Loans made to individuals who do not have the income to repay such loans usually are designed to fail," Ms. Bernstein said.
The practice of "packing" credit insurance and other products and services onto loan agreements often exacerbates the problem. Regulators said lenders often wrapped the insurance into the loan package and failed to detail the costs.
According to a former employee of several big subprime lenders who testified anonymously, once a borrower has signed up, the lender's primary goal is to keep the customer refinancing the loan at regular intervals, providing opportunities to charge more points and fees. The practice, known as "flipping," was routine at the institutions where he worked, the former employee said.
Mr. Grassley said that while there might be legislation to deal with the problems, and that increased enforcement of regulations was helpful, the best solution was consumer awareness. "It is my belief that we cannot legislate ethics, morality and compassion," he said, "but I can do my best to insure that individuals that are served by the subprime market are fully aware of the situation before they sign on the dotted line."

HEADLINE: 'But Darling, It's You'

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
THE Oscars are here, and Hollywood is in full frivolous bloom. Wolfgang Puck is engaged in all-night souffle-making sessions at Spago. Experts who specialize in plucking famous eyebrows are booked around the clock in their suites at the Four Seasons hotel. And the boulevards of Beverly Hills are humming at high pitch with talk of Hollywood's most important power game: who's wearing what.
Whether or not you care if Kate Winslett is wearing Valentino or Alexander McQueen, or even if she's going to win the Oscar for Best Actress, one thing is reasonably certain: she'll look terrific, like all the rest (except for the conspicuous frump or two). Give the credit to a battalion of behind-the-scenes handlers called stylists, whose job is to perpetuate the carefully constructed illusion of Hollywood ease and glamour. (You thought David Bowie had style? Hey, there was one year in the early 90's when a stylist bought every piece of clothing he wore.) 
 And now, the long, refined arm of the stylist has started to reach beyond Hollywood. As high-powered, fashionable Americans become more pampered as they float on a buoyant economy, the personal stylist has arrived as one more professional adviser to add to the ever-growing entourage that already includes colorist, nutritionist, aromatherapist and personal trainer.
That powerful executive in head-to-toe Ungaro? She didn't choose that suit. The perfectly turned out long-lost cousin at the wedding? You're looking at some high-ticket help.
Stylists -- part wardrobe specialists, part image therapists and much more than personal shoppers -- are the people who hunt through department stores, boutiques, ateliers and showrooms in the quest for that special vintage evening bag, that perfect dress, that underwear that won't leave bulgy lines. They're the ones who book the makeup artist, kidnap the overextended eyebrow-shaper and arrange for the hairdresser, the trainer and the personal chef.
David Neuman, 37, the president of Touchstone Television in Los Angeles, decided he needed a stylist when he changed jobs. A former executive at Whittle Communications, Mr. Neuman moved to Touchstone, a division of the Walt Disney Company, two years ago. Accustomed to wearing sleek Armani suits, he was flummoxed when he crash-landed in Disney's J. Crew-and-jeans work environment.
"Every company has its own corporate culture," Mr. Neuman said. "Disney turned out to be casual. But there's casual, hanging-out-with-your-friends-on-the-weekend casual, and then there's corporate casual."
He called Deborah Waknin, a Hollywood stylist whose work he had admired when she re-styled the news anchors on "Channel 1," a Whittle national program for high school students. Ms. Waknin has worked over the wardrobes of actresses like Halle Berry and Kim Delaney, both of whom she is dressing for tomorrow night's Oscar ceremonies, and also dresses a regular group of Hollywood civilians. (Stylists can be hard to find: it helps to know someone in the industries around which they cluster -- film, television, music and fashion.)
Mr. Neuman's primary problem, it seemed, was Casual Friday.
"He said, 'My Fridays are supercasual and I can wear jeans or khakis,' " Ms. Waknin recalled. "So I went and ransacked his closets and edited out what he really didn't need, what was outdated, and kept a lot of what was great." Besides adding some plaid shirts and suede blazers, Ms. Waknin said she also bought Mr. Neuman "shoes, socks and comfy underwear."
Twice a year, Ms. Waknin overhauls Mr. Neuman's closets, arriving at his house with racks of clothing. She takes Polaroids as Mr. Neuman tries things on: if he passes something up and then decides he wants it, they can identify the outfit quickly and snatch it up. She also may suggest a haircut now and then.
"Some executives might have a spouse who does this for them," Mr. Neuman said, "but if you're single and you don't necessarily have someone who is going to take care of that part of your life -- well, it allowed me to turn this over to someone who is an expert."
In the rarefied world of the stylist, daily fees range from $1,500 to $5,000 a day (Ms. Waknin won't reveal her rate). And that doesn't include the price of the clothes, which Mr. Neuman pays for himself -- retail.
Neither Mr. Neuman nor Ms. Waknin said they considered it ironic that a man who can run a company should be so baffled by Casual Fridays.
"David is a workaholic," Ms. Waknin said. "He's 24-7. My clients don't have enough time. They'll call me and say, 'I'm going to an event -- it's black-tie and a little conservative,' or, 'It's at the White House' or 'It's an event at Francis Ford Coppola's winery for the weekend.' And I will understand what they are looking for. It's a costume-designing event. You get a script and you have to execute the outfit according to what the script says."
Of course, image consultants and personal shoppers have been around for years. Membership in the Association of Image Consultants -- a professional group whose members charge an average of $150 an hour for advice on wardrobe and makeup -- is up to 600, from 100 in 1990. But image consultants don't bring the full wardrobe to your house, don't have the top stylists' prized insider status at fashion houses, nor do they act as contractors for makeup artists and hair colorists. And personal shoppers are typically limited to merchandise from the stores they work for, don't handle the accompanying universe of beauty practitioners and don't get steep daily fees or even commissions.
Betty Halbreich, who has headed the personal shopping division at Bergdorf Goodman for 23 years, calls personal styling "day care in clothing."
Angelenos seem to demand more care than New Yorkers. Susan Ashbrook runs Film Fashion, a Los Angeles company that acts as a liaison between fashion designers and celebrities and places designers' clothes and accessories in films. She has started a division that caters to women who need personal stylists: it will open for business immediately after the Oscars rush. She has set her fees at around $1,500 a day.
"There are so many choices out there, and people have so little time," said Ms. Ashbrook, a former publicity director for the designer Richard Tyler. "It seemed about the right to time to expand beyond celebrities."
Ms. Ashbrook pointed to the popularity of In Style, the monthly magazine devoted to celebrity clothing. At In Style's inception, in June 1994, the circulation figure guaranteed to advertisers was 500,000; this January, that figure exceeded 800,000. Other magazines, like People, Us and Allure, have also tapped into the desire to mimic -- or maybe just dream about -- the elegance of celebrities. They regularly devote ample space to the clothes famous people wear. Of course, not everyone can be Sharon Stone, which is where Ms. Ashbrook comes in, her Palm Pilot at the ready.
"I'll be targeting women in politics, finance, women who are C.E.O.'s of major firms and who have the money and the means to pay for couture fashion," said Ms. Ashbrook, who recently styled Cathy Booth, the West Coast editor of Time magazine, for Time's 75th anniversary party at Radio City Music Hall.
"We went through her closet and planned an outfit -- something that made her feel empowered, sexy and pretty," Ms. Ashbrook said. Ms. Booth eventually chose a dress of her own -- "something that showed her great legs," Ms. Ashbrook said -- over the long skirt she had originally planned to wear.
But doesn't all this personal dressing bring to mind the image of a thumb-sucking child standing in front of a bulging closet and howling, "Mommy, I don't have anything to wear"?
Even Mr. Neuman of Touchstone admits that he sometimes feels that his closet is "a grown-up version of Garanimals," the clothing brand for children that lets them match outfits themselves (if the T-shirt has a lion on it, it goes with the lion pants).
Phillip Bloch, the Los Angeles-based stylist who calls himself "a fashion yenta" and "stylist to the stars," certainly has indulged his clients, who have included Jim Carrey, Sandra Bullock and Lauren Holly. Warner Books published his paean to the stylist culture, "Elements of Style: From the Portfolio of Hollywood's Premier Stylist," this year. And Mr. Bloch says he is particularly proud of the civilian styling he has done -- for example, the family and bridesmaids at Angela Bassett and Courtney B. Vance's wedding. He helped choose the gowns, supervised the tailoring and coordinated the hair stylists and makeup artists.
And then the most important moment arrived.
"There was Angela's entire family, all dressed up and crammed in the bathroom, everyone offering to help get her dress on," he said. "She just snapped her fingers, looked up and said: 'Phillip! Phillip!' "
"She had me -- me -- zip up her dress," sighed Mr. Bloch, whose range extends to record producers and television executives, past and present.
"A friend of mine called me yesterday and said: 'Jamie Tarses is going to call you -- she really needs you -- I gave her your number," Mr. Bloch exulted.
Nancy Berry, the vice chairwoman of the Virgin Music Group Worldwide, asked Mr. Bloch for his help on an outfit for last year's MTV Music Awards.
"You can't wear the same dress two or three times when you're in the public eye," said Ms. Berry, 39, "or else people think you don't have any clothes. And I was in a crisis." Mr. Bloch trolled through vintage clothing stores in Los Angeles until he discovered a short antique black kimono, over which he and Ms. Berry strapped a tight black corset.
"And I sure didn't have to worry about anyone else having the same outfit," Ms. Berry said with a laugh.
"These people are busy, they're important, and they're stars in their own business," Mr. Bloch said, adding that Ms. Berry had also asked him to help her find clothes for day wear. "But as I went from store to store trying to find the clothing she liked, I realized she had already bought everything, in her size, in every store. She had cleaned every place out."
And Mr. Bloch's solution?
"I went back to her and said: 'Honey, you don't need a personal stylist. You need a personal fashion designer.' "
Ah. But that's next year.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Scudder's European Emissary

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
FOR Carol L. Franklin, Park Avenue has it all over Ouagadougou. As a young woman, Ms. Franklin toyed with the notion of a career in the Foreign Service. During high school, she spent a year as an exchange student in Nicaragua. At Smith College, she majored in French literature, spending her junior year in Paris studying at the Sorbonne and l'Institut d'Etudes Politiques.
But it became clear over the years that the world of diplomacy was not the path she wanted to travel. 
 "As I learned more about it, I decided it wasn't for me," she said, "because you don't control your own destiny and make your own decisions. And so I thought I would try to marry my interests in international with the business world."
Investors in the two funds that Ms. Franklin manages can be happy that she did. For the three years ended March 13, the Scudder Greater Europe fund has returned 32.3 percent a year, on average, compared with 24.2 percent for its peer group of other European stock funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago.
The closed-end fund she manages, Scudder New Europe, has nosed past even that impressive tally: it returned 33.3 percent based on the fund's market price compared with 29.2 percent for its peer group of closed-end European stock funds.
Much of the funds' rally has come from the recent spurt in European markets, raising the question of how long the run can continue. "It has been a fairly breathtaking ride over the last year and a half," she said. "And we think we will have a pause. But if you look at where interest rates are, at the fact that these economies are recovering and at structural and cyclical factors, there is every reason to believe Europe could have an extended period of expansion the way we have in the United States."
In 1981, Ms. Franklin joined what was then Scudder Stevens & Clark and soon began to manage money. She has been investing in Europe the last decade, much of that time as lead manager of the high-profile Scudder International fund.
About four years ago, Ms. Franklin felt it was time for an open-end European fund.
"We could see all the structural changes that were going on in the region," she said. "Europe, which had experienced a period of premature euphoria after the Berlin Wall came down, just looked ripe for takeoff."
Spurred by global competition and the wave of restructuring that has washed over American businesses, Europe's companies are inching toward their own form of shareholder democracy.
And now that many of Europe's big economies are picking up, stock indexes are setting records in a number of countries .
Ms. Franklin cites several other reasons for her bullishness.
"In most countries, the economies are mature, but the stock markets are not," she said. "Expansion in European markets will take place because you will see a lot of small, family-owned and privately owned companies come to market. It is a region where we will see lots of new names."
Two of them are in Greater Europe's portfolio.
Telepizza S.A., a Spanish pizza franchise, went public in 1996. Now the dominant player in the country, with a 70 percent share of the fast-food pizza market and a growth rate upward of 40 percent, the stock has tripled since the fund bought it a little over a year ago. Ms. Franklin thinks that at 19,920 Spanish pesetas ($128.27), the stock still looks reasonable. .
Dassault Systemes S.A., a computer-aided design and manufacturing company in France, is another example.
Its initial public offering, a little over two years ago, was at 118 French francs and it now trades at 241.5 French francs ($39.41), or 32 times its expected 1999 earnings. But Ms. Franklin still thinks it is fairly valued. "They went public to give their employees options and also because they felt it was important for customer visibility, that their customers would feel more secure dealing with a public company that has some degree of transparency. I think that is a view other European companies will adopt,"
PRESSURE for change will come after the European Monetary Union creates a single currency next year. "Many believe E.M.U. will not go through, but I'm not one of them," Ms. Franklin said. "If you look at all the pressures the E.M.U. exerts, you can imagine that what it can encourage is something like a virtuous cycle that will create an equity culture which not only lowers the cost of capital but encourages the investment Europe needs."
The dynamism that Ms. Franklin sees today in Europe is reflected in her fund's strategy. "I look for one of two things in companies: growth or change," she said. "A company can be expanding into new markets or technologies. Or it could be adapting a new focus by shedding peripheral assets or bringing in new management."
Scudder Europe's portfolio is laden with finance and technology issues. "We like finance because it is a sector with growth prospects in asset management and is a change industry in terms of consolidation," she said. The fund holds a big stake in Commerzbank, which was up 57 percent in dollar terms last year, as well as several other bank stocks, in France, Italy and Portugal.
The fund's technology holdings include Cap Gemini Sogeti of France -- a software consulting company that Ms. Franklin believes has developed the best product to help companies adjust their computers to deal with the year 2000 problem. The stock is up 48 percent this year in dollar terms. It now trades at 749 French francs ($122.22), and it still seems fairly valued, Ms. Franklin said.
The fund's biggest holding is Misys P.L.C., a fast-growing British hardware and software company that provides services to the insurance, food and construction industries. Ms. Franklin said she bought in last August, at about 1600 pence a share. It closed on Friday at 2,742.50 pence ($45.71).
As far as geographic breakdown, the fund is currently heavily weighted in France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. While the fund has no money in Eastern Europe, Ms. Franklin expects to invest there. "We see more opportunity right now in Western Europe," she said. "Eastern Europe will be the next leg for this fund, as some of those countries develop."
What risks face investors in European stocks? Failure to implement monetary union would hit the markets hard, Ms. Franklin said. Some political factions in countries like France, which has high unemployment and expensive social welfare programs, are resistant to change and attempts at reform could lead to unrest. And the Asian crisis could hurt Europe, especially if it leads to a significant slowdown in the United States.
"Dealing with the social safety net is the bump in the road that has to be met, and E.M.U. will help to force that issue to be addressed," she said.
But Ms. Franklin has one sure-fire method for easing any fears about European markets. "When you compare how Japan is doing with its structural problems with how Europe is doing, it is very encouraging to be in Europe," she said.

HEADLINE: NEW YORKERS & CO.;
No Krantz, Koontz or Coffee Bars

BYLINE: By EDWARD LEWINE 

 BODY:
GABI FRIEDMAN stood transfixed before a towering wall of books. Clutching a work of feminist history and the essays of Walter Benjamin, she explained why she had come from New Haven, where she is studying law, to Labyrinth Books on Morningside Heights. "I heard about this place up at Yale," said Ms. Friedman, 28. "People were saying there is finally a good bookstore in New York."
That depends on your definition of a good bookstore. In this era of the bookshop as lounge, newsstand, coffee bar and pickup joint, in a city that might be mistaken for Barnes & Noble land, Labyrinth has gone in a different direction. It opened one year ago as a no-frills bookstore for scholars. 
 "We wanted to be an academic bookstore," said Christopher Doeblin, a 38-year-old college dropout who owns Labyrinth with Cliff Simms, 40 (B.A. in philosophy from Columbia). "We knew that this formula would work." Mr. Doeblin is emphatic that his first year in business has proved there is a market for scholarly books. "Can we sell a 'Cambridge History of Greece and Rome' at $120 each?" he asked, pointing to the 15-volume work. "Yes. There are people out there who will buy them."
But even as Labyrinth's owners celebrate what they call the "very satisfying" feeling of having made it through a year when many in the book world predicted failure, they face new challenges in their own backyard and on the Internet.
The 7,000-square-foot store occupies two floors of a squat bunkerlike building on a quiet block of 112th Street, between Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway, next to a post office. The floors are unpainted cement; there is almost nowhere to sit. The space is packed with rows of shelves filled with weighty tomes on subjects like history, philosophy, women's studies and math. The John Grisham fan should look elsewhere.
"Most contemporary book stores today convey a sense of space," Mr. Simms said. "We wanted an older, almost archaic idea of a space completely filled with books."
Labyrinth was born from the ashes of Barnard Bookforum, a store on Broadway near 116th Street that closed in 1995. Mr. Simms and Mr. Doeblin had been managers there, but they left in 1993 in a dispute with the owner over money. They also had a plan to open their own store and sell the kinds of books that Bookforum did not stock in significant numbers. "We stood on the sales floor of that store for six years and saw what people wanted," Mr. Doeblin said. "But we kept having to say no to people."
Already thousands of dollars in the hole from the Bookforum debacle, the two men borrowed all they could on their credit cards, $20,000, and opened a wholesale book warehouse in Yonkers, Great Jones Books. They buy remaindered books at auction and sell them to retailers. Last year, Great Jones did $2 million in sales, they said.
A bookstore, though, remained their goal. "We wanted to create this store," Mr. Doeblin said. "It's like that Bob Dylan song, 'When I Paint My Masterpiece.' "
Enter Jonathan R. Cole, a sociologist and the provost of Columbia University. He too thought the Columbia neighborhood needed a bookstore for scholars. After what Mr. Doeblin described as tough negotiations, the university agreed to construct a new building on 112th Street, where the rent is about $20 a foot, one-fifth of what it is on Broadway. The partners got a Federal small-business loan, and Labyrinth opened in March 1997.
Richard Howorth, who owns a store named Square Books in Oxford, Miss., and is the vice president of the American Booksellers Association, said that scholarly bookstores worked differently than those catering to the mass market. For instance, Labyrinth stocks a much wider range of books (about 90,000 titles), with fewer copies of each title than the average store. It carries an inventory of 130,000 volumes in all.
"The more depth you have," Mr. Howorth said of scholarly bookshops, "The more likely you are to get more orders."
Labyrinth does not carry profit makers like cookbooks, self-help manuals, children's books or novels by Dean R. Koontz. It is a tight business to run because the markup on scholarly books can be as little as 25 percent, compared to as much as 48 percent on mass-market titles. It is also time-consuming to deal with academic publishers and keep up with academic trends. "You have to be smart," Mr. Howorth said. "It's not every book buyer who can plumb the depths of cognitive psychology."
Labyrinth's owners said they sold about $2 million worth of books in the first nine months and broke even. But they freely admit they caught a big break because construction has forced the Columbia University Bookstore to operate out of a smaller, makeshift space on campus until 1999. That has given Labyrinth a crack at the lucrative course-book business, which amounted to 30 percent of sales in 1997.
Besides the Columbia store, run by Barnes & Noble, Labyrinth is under pressure from Posman Books, in the old Bookforum space, which stocks a variety of scholarly and popular books. The manager, John Hessler, said Posman would be refurbished this spring and probably take over a stationery store, growing to 6,000 square feet from 3,700. "We feel that we are better than Labyrinth in history, philosophy and poetry," Mr. Hessler said. "As far as the cutting edge, we are it in those areas."
As if all this isn't enough competition, Internet booksellers like Amazon.com special order scholarly books and ship them to customers worldwide. Labyrinth needs "to develop a national market and fight off the New York competition," said Robert Oppedisano, the director of sales for Oxford University Press in New York. "But they have as good a chance as anybody."
The owners say they aren't worried. They are taking bids from designers for a Web site to sell books on the Internet, and they say they wish their neighborhood competitors well. "I don't think there is such a hostile environment," Mr. Simms said. "I think there is a place for a good bookstore with a good focus."
That is music to the ears of scholars and aspiring scholars. "This is what it should be," Ms. Friedman of Yale said as she looked around Labyrinth. "There should be lots of great stuff everywhere."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT: FOCUS ON HOME EQUITY LOANS;
Lenders Laud the Value of Home Sweet Equity

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM 

 BODY:
DURING the recent stampede for mortgage refinancings, home equity loans -- consumers' solution for everything from high-interest credit card debt to college tuition -- were temporarily left behind. Now banks that want to keep the market going strong are promoting the loans aggressively.
"Are lenders ramping up offers? Yes, they are," said Keith T. Gumbinger, vice president of HSH Associates, a financial surveyor and publisher in Butler, N.J. "People are refinancing and paying off their second lien. As refinancing picks up, lenders are focusing on making new lines of credit to refill their portfolios." 
 But even as banks dangle such promotional teasers as below-prime interest rates, rebates and extended repayment schedules, some financial planners urge caution.
"They are selling money and they want people to buy it," said David Little, a planner with Eclectic Associates in Fullerton, Calif. "Don't take all this free money. It's not really free."
Home equity credit comes in two basic forms: a loan for a fixed amount to be repaid within a certain period, or a line of credit, which essentially lets homeowners convert equity into a checking account of sorts and draw on that account as needed.
A line of credit's variable interest rate usually floats with the prime rate, now 8.5 percent. The monthly bill is for interest only and there is no deadline for paying off the loan's principal -- except the borrower's tolerance for paying interest.
For consumers with equity in their homes, the attraction is loans with little or no closing costs, interest that is tax deductible and interest rates lower than those carried by credit cards or consumer loans.
Home equity lending is now a solid part of banks' portfolios, and lenders regard the borrowers as some of their best customers. People tend to keep up loans when the alternative is foreclosure on their homes.
Banks with accounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had $98.1 billion in home equity loans outstanding at the end of 1997, up from $85.3 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier. Yet growth was slowing, up less than $2 billion from the third quarter of last year.
That is at least partly a result of the latest wave in mortgage refinancings, whose customers make up much of the same market for home equity products. Additionally, if homeowners hoping to refinance already carry a home equity loan, they must pay it off to get the new mortgage.
All that puts extra pressure on banks' home equity portfolios. So deals are coming out in force. The national average for a fixed-rate home equity loan with a 10-year term is 9.37 percent, according to HSH. The average interest rate for a home equity line of credit is running about 9.69 percent. In its survey of 10 major markets, Bank Rate Monitor, a financial data company, says a credit line averages 8.56 percent.
But with a little hunting, a customer can easily find better rates and special offers. The Bank of New York started a special this month on its "Prime for Life Equity Link" credit line: prime minus 1 percentage point for the first six months, or 7.5 percent at current rates, then converting to the prime. The offer expires on March 31.
At the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis, home equity business has "seen a lift," said Janet LaFrence, senior product manager, because the bank changed its rules last fall to let customers take a home equity loan for 25 years, rather than 15, and monthly payments were lowered on lines of credit. (By stretching out the life of a loan, however, both provisions set up borrowers to pay more interest over the long haul.)
At the First National Bank of Chicago, borrowers can get a rebate of as much as $500 on the first month's interest payment on either a home equity loan or a line of credit. For a line of credit ranging from $25,000 to $49,999, the rate is the prime plus half of a percentage point -- now, 9 percent.
Even in a borrower's market, though, some financial planners and credit counselors question whether the loans are a good way for homeowners to handle debt.
Philip C. Johnson, a certified financial planner in Clifton Park, N.Y., does not favor using home equity loans to pay off credit cards. "You don't use your home to buy something that will expire before the debt does," he said. If the loans must be used, he said, use them for "a worthy long-term goal, not for going on a cruise."
He recommended calling banks and credit unions and making sure there are few fees and little or no closing costs. Consumers, he added, need to be clear what the rate is after the teaser rate expires; in this market, he said, a borrower should be able to get prime.
Ann B. Diamond, a financial planner in Manhattan, said that equity loans could be helpful in paying off credit-card debt or education loans. But borrowers have to realize the possible consequences.
"You have to understand your house is on the line," she emphasized. "You have your home at risk. If you can't make the payments, that's a pretty big penalty to pay."
Nancy Nauser, president of Consumer Credit Counseling Service Mid-America in Kansas City, Mo., a not-for-profit agency, said that home equity loans "can be very positive or negative."
The key, she said, is the borrower. "You need to make sure you are disciplined enough to not get in any more debt until that loan is paid off. If you use those credit cards again, you're just going to double the debt. People don't realize that."
Read the contract carefully, Mrs. Nauser said. "Ask how long are you going to be paying and how much interest are you paying," she said. "Compare all of the terms. Is there a big penalty if the payment is five days late?"
To Paul Froehler and Victoria Pena-Froehler in Chicago, a home equity line of credit made more sense than paying credit card debt. The Froehlers took a $15,000 line of credit from First National Bank of Chicago in January to replace their computer and television and to pay down a high-interest credit card.
"I'm going to permanently retire credit card debt," said Mr. Froehler, a first vice president for the Sanwa Business Credit Corporation, a commercial finance company. "To me, this is also for reserve. It's there if my roof falls in. I like the tax deductibility of it."
The Froehlers have used about $8,000 on the line so far. Mr. Froehler plans to pay off some of that with an annual bonus this spring, but will keep the credit line available to use toward a new car and for when their son goes to college next year.
The interest on Mr. Froehler's loan is 11.5 percent, higher than the usual offer because the loan-to-value ratio was 96 percent, meaning that the loan, when combined with the existing mortgage, came to 96 percent of his home's value. But the rate is still considerably lower than the 18 percent the couple was paying on their credit cards.
Mr. Little, of Eclectic Associates, said his firm does not suggest home equity loans for debt consolidation except as a last resort. Some home equity loans, he said, are "just allowing someone to live beyond their means. It doesn't address the problem, it just covers it up."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT/MUTUAL FUNDS;
The Art of Swimming Against the Tide

BYLINE: By MARCIA VICKERS 

 BODY:
"BUY when blood is in the streets." No one takes that investing adage more to heart than a contrarian like Anthony M. Gallea.
Mr. Gallea, 48, is a senior portfolio manager at the Smith Barney office in Rochester, where he oversees $600 million in client assets. He is also the co-author, with William Patalon 3d, a business reporter for The Baltimore Sun, of "Contrarian Investing" (Prentice Hall/New York Institute of Finance, $25). 
 Here, Mr. Gallea discusses the central premise of contrarianism -- that when everyone holds a stock or sector or country in low esteem, it may be precisely the time to invest. He also explains how to pick winners, how to limit risk in this chancy field and which investment areas he is keeping a contrarian eye on: Japan, the metals market and energy stocks, among others.
Q. What is the contrarian philosophy?
A. It attempts to ascertain an extreme or consensus opinion and then see if there is an argument for investing in the other direction. It's the theory that if everybody believes something and has acted on it, then the money available to push that investment in the same direction is diminished.
Q. What's the difference between contrarian and value investing?
A. I think that a contrarian starts with the sentiment or the psychology of the situation and then proceeds to the financials, and a value investor starts and ends with the financials. Both try to buy assets at a discount, but I think all investors try to do that, even growth investors.
Q. You have said that contrarians have nerves of steel. What other personality traits do they have?
A. I'm not so sure it's nerves of steel. It's more a willingness to think independently. For most people, it's not easy to invest in a way that is in disagreement with their friends, their seeing and reading and so on.
Q. Can you give an example of the extreme opinions contrarians seek?
A. The crash in '87 is one example. The consensus opinion was that the market was in deep trouble. That turned out not to be the case.
But right now the U.S. market isn't saying a thing to me as a contrarian. I don't think there's extreme bullish or bearish sentiment; opinion seems equally divided. People feel that I'm bearish, as a contrarian, because there's a lot of bullishness around. But I don't sense any extreme.
I sense more of an extreme in the Far East, in the metals market and in Japan. Those markets may be saying something to contrarians.
One sector that is worth watching is energy. People are becoming more bearish about energy and there's more in the papers about it that reminds me of what I used to see in the 70's. It's not there yet, but if you got some additional drop in energy prices, energy stocks would become a lot cheaper and then a contrarian might see it as a time to buy.
Q. How do you know if there is extreme opinion against a stock?
A. One difficulty we've had as contrarians is to quantify extreme opinion. Then we ran across a study by John Howe of the University of Kansas about stocks that are down 50 percent or more. He did an exhaustive study -- thousands of stocks over many years -- and found that stocks that had dropped 50 percent or more from their 52-week highs tended to outperform the market and those that were up 50 percent or more tended to underperform.
That led us to the work of other academics and market people saying that this works. So, we don't consider a stock unless it's dropped at least 50 percent from its 52-week high. That's our proxy for contrarian sentiment.
Q. Are you looking at any particular stocks right now? What about Nike?
A. There is no stock I'm looking to buy this morning. As for Nike, I've been following it. It doesn't meet the first criterion of down 50 percent, so I wouldn't buy it. But the world is awash in sneakers. People are generally not pleased with that whole sector. They think that sneaker prices are too high. If I could buy Nike 50 percent below its highs, then, sure.
Q. Because you still think that it's a good company.
A. Any time you can buy a big-name blue chip or a franchise stock at 50 percent off, the odds are well in your favor. These companies have lots of resources, lots of money, lots of people. They can work out problems that small, one-product companies can't. If you look back, all of these big, big companies that have gotten into trouble -- Citicorp, I.B.M. -- make it out, by and large.
Yet, people tend to take a piece of news, extrapolate a new worry from it, treat that as fact and extrapolate yet another worry. We take events and psychologically push them forever into the future in a straight line. We underestimate the muddle factor: that we all tend to muddle through problems eventually.
You have a parallel situation in Japan today. You have widespread difficulties in financial companies that are well publicized. The Government seems to be "pushing on a string" -- do you remember that phrase from many years ago, when the Fed was dropping interest rates but couldn't get the economy moving? The market there is down more than half from its highs of several years ago. Yet it's a great industrial power; it's not going to slide into the ocean and disappear. We have $10 million invested there now.
Q. Your secondary criterion is buying by insiders or savvy outsiders.
A. We found a study showing that a net increase in such buying tends to forecast a higher price. So we set inside buying as additional confirmation because once you've got a stock down 50 percent, that doesn't mean it's going to go anywhere.
Q. Can you give me some examples of insider buying?
A. Here's one: Sunglass Hut. I should note that we do make a market in Sunglass Hut and we have a speculative rating on the stock.
At any rate, you see them in all the malls. The stock declined from $20 to the $6-to-$7 range between July 1996 and July 1997. So it met the first screen: down at least 50 percent.
Then we picked up in the S.E.C. filings that Sunglass Hut insiders had bought about 100,000 shares in several transactions last summer.
The story was pretty simple: there hadn't been any new lines of fashion sunglasses in the prior year and there was a bit of overexpansion. But those are the kind of things you work out of. Anybody who's ever been in retail knows that you get overinventoried at times.
So we bought the stock at $6.75 last summer and it is now at $10.50. So it hasn't had a big move yet. But that is the kind of stock that we look for.
Q. How can you predict whether an ailing company will recover?
A. After you find a stock trading at a 50 percent discount to its 52-week high, you do the fundamental analysis by reading an analyst's report, whatever. Then we pick four of the fundamental ratios a value investor might look at. If we get a stock down 50 percent or more and then two of these four line up, you don't have to have insider buying.
Of course, in looking at these four ratios, everything is not necessarily going to be pretty because a stock doesn't drop 50 percent and look beautiful. What you want to get is a sense of whether the company has got time to work it out.
We start with a price-to-earnings ratio of less than 12. That means earnings are not highly priced. Next we look for a healthy price-to-free cash flow -- less than 10. Free cash flow is the money that's left over, after paying for basic expenses and enlarging the existing business, for creating new products, buying complementary businesses and the like.
Then comes the price-to-sales ratio. If it is less than 1, each share is backed by a good amount of sales -- say, the share is $7 and sales per share are $10. So you've got some good numbers coming in the top line, although whether they get to the bottom or not you don't know. And then if the book value is less than 1, that tells you there are good underlyingassets: bricks, mortar and the like.
Q. How long does it typically take for a contrarian portfolio to generate satisfactory returns?
A. Ben Graham, the father of value investing, believed that it took approximately two years for a company to work out its problems. But in some cases, a stock just seems to go right out of the chute.
Q. How do you limit risk?
A. We put no more than 3 to 5 percent of a portfolio in any single stock because these companies are in some trouble. And we have a 25 percent stop-loss order -- an order to sell if the stock falls below a certain price -- because you can be wrong and there are times just to get out.
If you find a stock with a big price decline you often are led to other stocks in the industry. So we limit ourselves to 15 percent, 20 percent, in any industry, so we don't substitute industry risk for a stock's risk.
As for selling, Ben Graham believed that a 50 percent profit was a good target. That dovetails with John Howe's work, that a stock up 50 percent tends to underperform.
If you believe a sale after a 50 percent profit is premature, you can stay in and set a stop-loss order at a 30 percent profit. So if the stock goes from 10 to 15 you're going to set a stop at 13.
Another risk rule we have is that after three years if you don't have a 50 percent profit, you just leave.
Those are the basic risk rules. You try to set some discipline for yourself because we're all weak. We go to cocktail parties and tell our friends about a stock we bought. Then the stock starts to drop and you find yourself defending it and then your ego is at stake. We need something to save us from ourselves.
Q. How can average investors get into the contrarian game?
A. If somebody has a 401(k), for instance, he may say, "Of all my funds, what hasn't done well?" If the Far East hasn't done well, he might say, "Maybe I should put 5 or 10 percent of my 401(k) there."
That is, just begin to take a more skeptical view and get some side investments that are going in a different direction. I'm not comfortable having all my assets moving in the same direction all the time. Maybe this is doing well for me this year, this isn't doing well for me. But next year maybe they'll flip-flop.
Q. Why do people overreact to news and create the kind of extreme opinion that you look for?
A. I think that's the real story about contrarian investing. People constantly look outside themselves for the answer, in the market. What is required is more introspection. I don't mean this to sound like crystals and Sigmund Freud, but we don't spend enough time analyzing ourselves. We are the filter through which all this information flows.

Anthony M. Gallea follows these principles for investing in an out-of-favor security. The presume the investor has studied the company's basics -- its financials, management, competition and so on.
 
BUY
If the stock is trading at 50 percent or less of its 52-week high and
Either insiders or savvy outsiders are buying large numbers of shares.
Or the stock satisfies two of these four valuation ratios:
* Price-to-earnings less than 12
* Price-to-free cash flow less than 10
* Price-to-sales less than 1
* Price-to-book less than 1
 
SELL
If the stock has risen 50 percent since purchase*
Or the stock has been held three years
Or the stock falls 25 percent below its purchase price.
 
BUT
To limit risk:
Never put more than 3 to 5 percent of a portfolio in one stock.
Never put more than 15 to 20 percent of a portfolio in one industry.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Do Preferred Shares Close the Door?

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
An investor has brought a lawsuit challenging a recent move by Gabelli Equity Trust to offer preferred shares. The suit, on behalf of all shareholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting last year, was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan and seeks to rescind a 1997 vote that allowed the shares to be issued.
Over the last 12 months, several closed-end stock funds like the $1.3 billion Gabelli Equity have been trying to offer preferred shares, typically depicting the move as an attempt to bolster returns. But some critics, like the shareholder suing Gabelli, say the issuance of preferred shares is aimed at thwarting attempts by holders of the funds' common stock to force a conversion to open-end status. 
 "Issuing preferred shares is a bad idea because it will deprive common shareholders of the ability to control major decisions of the fund, including any proposal to open-end the fund," said Theodore Hess-Mahan, the lawyer representing the shareholder, C. William Carter.
The lawsuit "is a scurrilous attack," said Mario Gabelli, president and chief investment officer of the fund. "Given the level of interest rates and everything that's going on, the offering of preferred shares is in the best interest of shareholders."
By investing the proceeds of preferred shares, closed-end funds can bolster their portfolio returns so long as they earn more than the dividend payment. But this leverage, which magnifies returns in up markets, has the opposite effect in down ones.
Critics focus on another feature of preferred shares: They typically allow their owners to veto attempts by holders of common shares to convert a closed-end fund to open-end status. Such attempts have become more frequent as shareholders lament that their shares trade at a discount to a fund's net asset value.
Shareholder skepticism is often well founded, said Thomas J. Herzfeld, a Miami investment adviser. "Shareholders have become very sensitive to fund managers' proposals because the industry record on manager proposals leaves a lot to be desired," he said.
Unlike open-end mutual funds, whose unlimited numbers of shares are bought and sold at net asset value, closed-end funds have a set number of shares that are bought and sold on stock markets. The shares may trade at a premium to the value of the securities held by the fund, but more often they trade at a discount.
Gabelli is no stranger to these types of lawsuits. Another Gabelli closed-end fund, Gabelli Global Multimedia, is grappling with a similar lawsuit, filed last year.
Recently, another closed-end fund, General American Investors, won shareholder approval to issue preferred stock. The move came after three shareholder attempts to turn it into an open-end fund.
 
A Repurchase Plan At Piper Capital
Piper Capital Management said last week that it planned to recommend that the boards of directors of 4 of its 16 closed-end funds ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow the funds to buy back up to 10 percent of their shares annually, for five years, at net asset value. The funds are American Strategic Income Portfolios I, II, and III and American Select Portfolio.
The buybacks would be contingent on the funds' discounts to net asset value exceeding 5 percent over a specified 12-week period each year.
Alternatively, the company said it might ask the boards of the four funds to authorize a buyback of up to 10 percent of the funds' shares at net asset value in 1999 and 2001.
The company said it would make the recommendation on the second buyback only if the S.E.C. did not approve the first repurchase plan. Under the second plan, shareholders would have to approve a new contract that continues Piper's advisory role at the funds. The contract results from the planned acquisition of Piper's parent, the Piper Jaffray Companies, by U.S. Bancorp, announced last year.
Piper also said it might ask each fund to adopt an open-market repurchase program, if shareholders approve the new advisory contract. Under the program, shares would be bought from investors at market prices. Purchases would be made only when the previous day's closing market price was at a discount to net asset value.
The management announcement follows one in February that five of Piper's other funds would seek to become open-end funds, allowing shareholders to sell their shares for full value. Piper said the four funds in the new proposal were not considered for conversion to open-end status because their investments were too illiquid. Presumably, the current buyback plan is offered in compensation, Mr. Herzfeld said.
"I think that they're throwing the shareholders a bone," he said. He described as "a little iffy" the prospects that the share repurchase plan would narrow the funds' discounts to net asset value, which on Thursday ranged from 7.0 percent to 9.4 percent.
 
The Road to Delaware For Vanguard Funds
The Vanguard Group is asking fund shareholders for permission to reorganize eight of its funds from Maryland corporations into Delaware business trusts at a meeting scheduled for May 1.
The changes would be the first in a wave of reorganizations planned for the 85 Vanguard funds. Proxies already have been mailed to shareholders of the eight funds: Asset Allocation, Equity Income, Growth and Income, Preferred Stock, Wellesley Income, Wellington and both Windsor funds. Proxies will be sent to shareholders in the other Vanguard funds by the end of May.
Because of lower tax rates in Delaware, the change should save $17 million in taxes on all its funds annually, said John Woerth, a company spokesman.
Vanguard, which has built a reputation on frugality, broke new ground by allowing shareholders to submit proxies on line, saving printing and mailing costs: so far, 10 percent have voted via computer, and another 20 percent by phone, Mr. Woerth said.
 
A New Fund for Dreman
Scudder Kemper Investments said it would offer a new fund, Kemper-Dreman Financial Services, to be managed by David Dreman, the value investor. The fund will be sold through brokers and carry a maximum initial sales charge of 5.75 percent. It will invest largely in the common stock of securities firms, investment management companies and insurance companies. Among other funds, Mr. Dreman manages Kemper-Dreman High Return Equity.

HEADLINE: New York's Riding High. But How Much Is Hot Air?

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY and ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
THERE are two commonly held beliefs about today's New York. No. 1: Things are good. No. 2: Everyone agrees about No. 1.
The prevailing wisdom holds that the city is basking in a glorious period of renewal, evidenced and enhanced by a robust economy, a revitalized cultural scene and surging self-confidence. 
 After all, the argument goes, Wall Street is up, crime is down and the sidewalks are cleaner than they've been in years. High-tech, media and financial businesses are growing, and theaters, bars and restaurants are packed. The Knicks are scrappy and even the Mets are showing promise.
The optimism seems to be catching. A recent New York Times poll found that Americans see New York as a place more likely to be revisited than reviled. More than 60 percent described Gotham's image as good, compared with 43 percent two years ago.
But in a city well stocked with skeptics, cynics and grumblers, some see this upbeat news as largely a creation of high-powered civic boosters -- financial, real estate, media and government elites -- who have a major stake in how the city is perceived. And, the critics say, the city's refurbished image has little to do with the lives of most New Yorkers.
"The question of whether the city has really improved depends on whom you ask," said Stuart Ewen, chairman of the film and media studies department at Hunter College and an expert on public relations. "For many middle-class people, it's a pleasing time, and of course it's good to have a city where people can walk the streets safely. But for many other people, it's become a very hard place."
Indeed, for every cheery headline and giddy proclamation about the new New York, you can find equally dour assessments of the city's fundamental well-being. Welfare rolls may be down, but the number of food pantries is up. AIDS deaths have declined, but the incidence of heart disease is still, per capita, among the highest in the country. Wages may be up, but so are rents.
Even some optimistic economists say the good times, such as they are, may not last. "The booming market is pulling the city's economy along by the nose," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of the Regional Financial Association, an economic consulting and research firm. "If that were to falter, it would be a significant problem."
Mr. Zandi observed that the city's economy is more diverse than it was a decade ago, and less dependent on Wall Street. But he also pointed out that Manhattan was enjoying the majority of the new opportunities, the bulk of which benefit highly skilled workers. "Manhattan is in the vortex of the boom," he said. "It's blossoming well ahead of the boroughs."
And even for those feeling the flush of success, there can be downsides.
"Everyone's so busy getting rich, they've forgotten how to have relationships, how to be good parents and how to live," said Dr. Herbert J. Freudenberger, a psychoanalyst on the Upper East Side who coined the term "burnout" in the 1970's. "I'm seeing more discontentedness than ever before. The pressure to make money, to succeed and to keep up an expensive life style has become so intense, so all-consuming, that work has become the be-all, end-all."
As stressed out as New Yorkers may be, the rest of America seems to think they're nicer than ever. The Times poll found that 41 percent of Americans now viewed New Yorkers as "friendly," compared to 27 percent two years ago. But despite the impression that New York has become a kinder, gentler town, reports of anti-gay and domestic violence are on the rise.
"We'd be the first to admit that New York is not perfect," said Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the Mayor. "It's a work in progress. Still, there's no denying that homicides are down 71 percent, that 360,000 fewer people are on welfare and that 209,000 new jobs have come into the city over the past four years."
"And besides," Ms. Roche added, "this is New York City. People will always find something to complain about."
Even some of the most hardened naysayers concede that in at least some respects, life in the city has improved over the last several years. But conversations with some three dozen New Yorkers -- from artists to executives, radicals to conservatives -- revealed a number of concerns, including the persistent notion that the recovery has largely favored the rich while neglecting some longstanding problems of the poor.
Others have more philosophical gripes. "I'm thrilled that the hedges in front of my house have stopped getting stolen, but I'm not crazy about the Disneyfication of our city and the moral police trying to eradicate anything that encourages impure thought," said the author Gay Talese. "Trash and that which offends are what makes New York the great city it is."
In a town with such wild diversity, of course, consensus would be difficult, if not impossible. Here's a sampling of nits, crits and opinions from some who see the Big Apple as half-ripe:
 
LUC SANTE
Author of "Low Life: Lures and Snares of Old New York" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1991)
 Whenever people get really excited about boom times, I begin to get worried and these days really have an edge of hysteria to them. It's one thing to be recovering from the Depression in 1936 and sing "Happy days are here again," but today the mood of congratulation is so strenuous. I'm especially suspicious because this unprecedented prosperity that seems to have affected everybody doesn't seem have affected anyone I know personally. Nobody is actually going hungry or losing their homes, but that possibility is never beyond the pale.
 
PENNY ARCADE
Performance artist currently performing in "Sex, Subversion and New York Values"
 The idea of New York as a cultural capital comes from the street up. Culture in New York starts on the street and not Madison Avenue. What made New York unique is that it was a big city made up of small distinct neighborhoods. Giuliani is making his bid for the big time by delivering the broken spirit of New York homogenized and sanitized to the rest of country. And even from a marketing viewpoint, that's killing the goose that laid the golden eggs that were in demand all over the world.
 
PETE HAMILL
Author and journalist
There is a palpable difference in the city right now, a lifting of the sense of menace and an exuberance walking in street and riding the subways. I don't know whether or not you can measure prosperity with statistics. I don't know what the unemployment rate was in Florence in 1460, but I know it was a hell of a city.
Now, on the other hand, there's all kind of problems that are associated with this boom. The middle-class people who used to flee to New Jersey as soon as kids got to be 6 or 7 are staying in lot of districts, and that puts a tremendous crunch on housing, which allows these rotten filthy slime landlords to take advantage and charge $4,000, $5,000 for a warehouse space. The reason that's bad for the future is we don't know who is not coming to New York -- that's the statistic that doesn't exist.
We don't know if we're losing kids who want to be painters, or actors or writers but can't afford to live here. Kids used to feel able to come and double up in apartments, but certainly nobody's going to come from the boondocks anymore and live in SoHo and be an artist. You can't afford to park there, let alone live there.
 
ANDREW S. HEIBERGER
President of Citi Habitats, Manhattan's largest residential brokerage firm
 I've never seen the market so tight. They say the vacancy rate is around 1 percent, but that's an illusion. The vacancy rate simply represents the amount of time it takes a landlord to clean out and paint an apartment. These days, some apartments last an hour on the market before they're snapped up. Professionals making $75,000 a year are being forced to live with roommates or to ask their parents for help paying the rent. In any other city, these same people would be living in spacious two-bedroom apartments.
The tight market is also making people rent-poor, forcing them to alter their life styles, making them live in non-doorman buildings, limiting how often they go out and forcing them into the outer boroughs. I had one couple from California come looking for separate apartments. They were engaged but were not ready to live together. Of course they couldn't afford to live apart.
Business may be good for us, but I feel bad for my customers. There's a lot more frustration and a lot more crying in the office. It makes our job more difficult because they are often angry and bitter.
 
LEWIS BLACK
Comedian whose one-man show "Black Humor" is running at the Cherry Lane Theater
Here we are paying a gazillion dollars in rent, and most of us don't even have a thermostat in our apartments. New York is the only place on earth where you can't control the heat in your home. We're stuck with all these heavy metal radiators that we can't turn off. All my windows are open, and it still feels like I've got malaria. If I lived on my ledge, maybe then I'd feel comfortable.
They talk about crime being down in New York. Well, I live on West 43d Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenue, which was once the unofficial worst block in the city. Now that Disney swept 42d Street clean, my block is the official worst block. Drugs, prostitutes, you name it. We've got people running around whispering, conducting all kinds of business, but they don't have briefcases.
And one more thing. The city thinks it's giving us a bargain by selling 11 subway trips for the price of 10. What kind of marketing is that? Buy two, get one free. Or buy four, get one free. But buy 10 and get one free? That's pathetic.
 
 
 
Step Right Up And Into the Cattle Car

 
GENE RUSSIANOFF
Staff attorney, Straphangers Campaign
 The good news is that people are coming back to mass transit in droves. The bad news, however, is also that people are coming back in droves. There's been a 30 percent increase in bus ridership since the free transfer. It's crowding the buses and slowing service.
Have you taken the M-23 lately? It's my mother's bus. Every time I mention free transfers to her, she goes into a towering rage. "Now it's like some cattle car," she says. There's not enough service, it's true, because people like me, who would walk a few blocks, now get on the M-23 because it's free. And there's a ton of us. People are virtually hanging on the sides. My mother is a senior citizen, and even she says it's a slow boat.
I mean, it's a good thing they're flooded with customers, it's a good thing people are leaving their taxis and family car and rental black cars, but there's definitely not enough buses to deal with rising number of riders and now longtime riders say they're facing unpleasant traveling conditions. There's no such thing as free lunch or a free transfer.
 
JOHN KAEHNY
Executive director, Transportation Alternatives, a bicycle advocacy group
 The thing that makes New York so attractive to people is the fact that it's the only walking city in the country. But instead of cultivating that, Mayor Giuliani seems to be promoting a car culture, putting pedestrians behind barricades, ticketing jaywalkers and encouraging people to drive to megastores. There are now seven million car trips into the city every day, and congestion is costing millions of dollars in delays and lost business, not to mention the cost to our air quality and quality of life. Thirty years ago, Mayor Lindsay recognized the problem of too many cars in the city and blocked off Madison and Fifth Avenues one day each weekend.
 
LARRY SEAMAN
Commercial fisherman, Jamaica Bay, Queens
 I got no major complaints about the water. But you ever get in a car and drive? That never changes. They say the roads have gotten better, but come on, before you couldn't drive anywhere, so what's the diff? I'm a waterman, but I got to go in the morning to get gas for the boats, and from what I seen they could be handling this a little better. Like when someone breaks down, how about clear them off the highway so the rubberneckers don't slow down? Other cities take cars off the road. What's the problem? It's just mismanagement. I see a lot of those D.O.T. guys sitting on their rears not doing anything. I fish all my life. What are they doing?
 
H. CLAUDE SHOSTAL
President of the Regional Plan Association
Things are clearly better, but all this euphoria is masking major problems that no one is addressing, mainly infrastructure. It's not sexy, but if we don't act during the good times, we're going to pay dearly during the next downturn, and we won't be able to compete with cities like Hong Kong, Paris and London, which are all investing in their infrastructure. Look around and the last thing we built was the Verrazano Bridge and that was 30 years ago. In the 80's, all we did was try to catch up from the years of neglect.
We should be building the Second Avenue subway to relieve the overcrowded Lex line. We should be building a new west side subway to help develop the far west side. The Long Island Rail Road should be brought into Grand Central. And it's absurd to rebuild the elevated Gowanus Expressway. A tunnel makes more sense.
Government has to get over this idea that we can't build anything substantial. If you think about what makes this city great, it's things like Central Park, the subway, the bridges; these things didn't just happen.
 
BRENDAN SEXTON
President of the Municipal Art Society
We're a city that fought its way back from the ravages of graffiti, vandalism and litter, but we don't seem to show any imagination for what to do next.
Unlike other cities, New York's public spaces, newsstands, kiosks and street furniture don't look like much. And the things that are beautiful we tend to tear down in the name of progress. New York thrives on commerce, and unfortunately this sometimes leads to shortsightedness.
It doesn't cost more to design and plan well. It is now, during the good times, that we should be thinking about the long view. A little bit of imagination goes a long way. Just as it's important for a city not to be scary and dangerous, it's also important for a city to be attractive. Now that people feel safe, we have to make them feel pleased.
 
 
 
A Bigger Bank Account, A Better Spouse

 
WILLIAM S. BESLOW
Manhattan divorce lawyer
Ironically, prosperity isn't necessarily a good thing for marriages. In fact, I've found that a sound economy actually promotes more divorce. As people work harder to achieve and maintain success and their ever-escalating life styles, there is less time to devote to spouses and kids. That often leads to more friction and more unhappiness at home. Strangely enough, it seems that the more successful you are, the more stress and pressure you feel.
People's selfish impulses also get fed by a booming economy. The harder people work and the more they achieve, the greater their sense of entitlement. They want to spend more time going out, dining out, and rewarding themselves. Then there's the sense that they're entitled to an across-the-board upgrade: a better job, a bigger income and a better spouse.
 
HEATHER MAC DONALD
A fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor for its publication, City Journal
 Family breakdown is a large and, unfortunately, nearly completely unaddressed problem. Giuliani mentioned it in his State of the City, but I'm not aware of any follow-up. As long as illegitimacy remains as high as it is, any other social initiative, whether it be school dropout rate, or poverty, is doomed to failure.
I think many of our policies implicitly support single parenting, not just welfare, but our housing policies give priorities to homeless families. Guess how many homeless families are two-parent operations? Almost none. Single-parent family equals poverty, and the city gives priority to single-parent families. I advocate rewriting the policies to give priority to married parents. The same goes for day care.
And I think most appalling of all is day care centers in high schools. There's already 41 day care centers that completely normalize teen-age pregnancy and send the message that we expect you to get pregnant and then have a nice day care center for children. And the city is planning to put in a day care center every time they renovate a school.
 
TRACY QUAN
A spokeswoman for Prostitutes of New York, a sex workers advocacy group
Whenever the economy and tourism improve, the sex industry benefits as well. But at the same time, this new wave of repression, arrests and anti-sex hysteria is really hurting prostitutes. It's all very hypocritical since the sex industry provides real benefits to New York's economy. We spend plenty of money at restaurants, beauty salons and other city services; prostitutes feel strongly about working instead of living off welfare. The reality is that tens of thousands of New Yorkers directly and indirectly depend on the sex industry for their livelihood.
Just as important is what we provide to tourists, businessmen and conventioneers. People expect a certain level of excitement and entertainment when they come to New York. So while diplomats, CEO's and politicians will probably continue to have access to their high-end trysts, the eradication of the most accessible commercial sex will hurt the average tourist and middle-class john. The crackdown on commercial sex is an attack on the middle class while claiming to pander to middle-class morality.
 
 
 
Still Reading A Tale of Two Cities

 
JOHANN MOORE
Founder of the New York City Medical Marijuana Buyers' Club and a candidate for the gubernatorial nomination for the Green Party
I think there is a lot of apathy in the activist community, and I certainly believe that that apathy is partly a result of the hype campaign that everything's getting better and if we only keep on working within the system things will keep on getting better.
 
THOMAS K. SMALL
A Brooklyn lawyer who has used a wheelchair since childhood
They talk about a booming economy, but all I know is that I've sent out 20 resumes in the last month and I've only gotten one nibble. I think employers in New York are still afraid to take a chance on disabled workers.
In fact, life in the city hasn't gotten much easier for people like me. Taxis are still not accessible, and the subway is basically off-limits to wheelchairs; buses are fine if you have all the time in the world. Even traveling on the sidewalk can be perilous because so many intersections still don't have curb cuts. Sometimes I mount the sidewalk, go to the next corner and find there's no way to get down. Then I have to go all the way back and either cross over or go into the street, which scares me because one of my friends was hit by a car and killed that way.
 
DENNIS M. WALCOTT
President of the New York Urban League
If you look beyond the positive pronouncements, you'll see that African- Americans are not benefiting from the boom as much as whites. Thousands of people have to work two or more jobs just to put food on the table. They have no health insurance, no child care, and they are forced to send their children to terrible schools, limiting opportunities for their children to do better.
Another worry is the black middle class, which is seriously vulnerable to an economic downturn. Compared to white homeowners in similar neighborhoods, especially in southeast Queens, black households are usually kept afloat by the combined income of two or three family members, many of whom work as civil servants or hospital workers. If layoffs occur, these kinds of jobs are the first to go, which will threaten the viability of these communities.
 
PHILIP KASINITZ
Associate professor of sociology at City University of New York's Graduate Center and author of "Caribbean New York: Black Immigrants and the Politics of Race" (Cornell University Press, 1992)
Despite all the celebration, New York is still a tale of two cities, a place of stark disparity between rich and poor, black and white. But more troubling is that these disparities, it seems, have become largely accepted. There are still plenty of neighborhoods like Howard Beach and Bay Ridge where blacks cannot live. Of course demographics are constantly changing; white flight is still going on, even though there isn't much attention focused on it. The fault lines of race are shifting all the time, and in places like Canarsie and Flatlands in Brooklyn and portions of southeast Queens, whites have been moving out one block at a time.
 
DENNIS DeLEON
President of the Latino Commission on AIDS
 In terms of the Latino community, the permanent underclass is still there. Life has not changed. Unemployment is enormously high, among young people especially, and the opportunity for jobs and education seem to be shrinking.
But there's this weird phenomenon under way: Because the media say things are better, many people really feel things have gotten better, even though by the quantitative indices there's no difference. There's this kind of buzz; people actually believe the quality of their lives has improved even it hasn't improved one iota. It's a great public relations effort.
I guess it's kind of like everyone wants to be a winner. People get tired of being negative. I think previous administrations had a tendency to dwell on bad stuff in the community and the problems and everything you don't have. And so finally when someone says things are better and you can be part of it -- even though nothing has changed -- people want to hear that. People want to hear things are good.
 
 
 
Safe and Happy, And Aching for a Fix

 
STUART EWEN
Chairman of Hunter College film and communications department; author of "Pr!: A Social History of Spin" (Basic Books, 1996)
 As the news media become increasingly consolidated in New York and increasingly dominated by voices of vested wealth, they have become among those who have been the prime beneficiaries of the current barbeque. You have to understand that the people guiding the editorial policy in this city are making six or seven figures and are hobnobbing with the powerful; and spin and effectiveness of spin is all in proximity.
Handing people a press release does not get things in the newspaper. What's been created is basically an ongoing exchange of saliva between the media establishment and the people who can provide good news. That's what's happening vis-a-vis the new New York City. There may be some who feel uneasy with Giuliani's authoritarian style, but they're the very people who, to a large extent, are benefiting from the story of New York as a safe and happy place.
 
JASON FARRELL
Executive director of Positive Health Project, a Manhattan-based agency that works with intravenous drug users
Thanks to Hollywood and the fashion industry, heroin use among white professionals is on the rise in New York. Besides the fact that people have more money to spend on drugs, they're attracted to heroin because they think it's chic and risque. Of course it's as dangerous as it ever was.
While the rate of HIV transmission continues to drop for some groups, new infection among intravenous drug users is still growing by about 3,000 a year. The numbers are pretty scary. About 30 percent of the city's injecting drug users are now infected with the virus. The city's crackdown on deviant behavior may be pushing the drug problem further out of sight, but it's not reducing the dangers associated with addiction. In fact, it's making it harder for us to reach people because they're fearful of surfacing.
 
CHRISTINE QUINN
Executive director of the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project
We keep hearing about how crime is down in New York, but if you are a gay man or lesbian it's still pretty dangerous out there. There were 658 anti-gay incidents last year, up from 575 the year before. That's a 14 percent increase during a period that most crime plummeted.
More than 80 percent of the anti-gay incidents we documented were violent. And unlike in the past, when the typical weapon was a rock picked up from the ground, these days it's more likely to be a bat or a pipe brought from home. That means that people are traveling around the city with the primary objective of hunting down a gay person. We're also seeing much more serious injuries, more attacks taking place in the outer boroughs and more incidents involving police officers.
If everything is so wonderful in the city and people are so much happier, why are so many New Yorkers acting uncivil to gay men and lesbians? Maybe the police should focus less on jaywalking and more on those who beat up gay people while they're jaywalking.
 
ALAIR TOWNSEND
Publisher of Crain's New York Business
What's happening in New York is quite positive, but people have to realize that we still haven't figured out how to overcome the business cycle. I've always thought of New York as a city of manic-depressives, people who need direction to be happy. Frankly, we need to get a grip.
People seem to think there's no end to how high is high and how tall is tall. Of course, I remember a time not long ago when we talked about how the last person leaving New York should turn the light off. These days the talk is about how much everyone loves New York and how great everything is. I just hope a small part of their brain remembers this when times aren't as good.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
A Ski Area Without the Extremes

BYLINE: By GIOIA DILIBERTO 

DATELINE: ALTA, Utah

 BODY:
WITH the white peaks of the Wasatch Mountains rising behind him, Onno Wieringa, manager of the Alta Ski Lifts Company, stood in the middle of the road leading to this venerable resort and politely, but firmly, stopped every car trying to get in.
"We are sorry you will be unable to ski Alta today," read the note Mr. Wieringa gave to each driver he turned away. "If we were to permit more skiers on the mountain it would compromise the quality of the experience skiers have learned to expect from us." 
 In a business that has been downhill for a decade, Alta stands out as one of the nation's few ski areas with more customers than it needs. While most ski operators are pouring large sums into capital improvements -- big hotels, ice rinks, nightclubs, snowtubing chutes -- to lure more people, Alta continues to turn a profit, even as it limits skiers to about 3,500 a day.
"We've always been on a steady upward basis," said Jodie Shrontz, a granddaughter of one of the resort's founders. "Some years aren't as big a leap as others, but we've always made more every year."
With a reputation for some of the best snow in the world and lift tickets that are relatively cheap -- $28 a day compared with $56 at Vail, Colo. -- Alta seems poised to grow. But that doesn't appear likely.
For one thing, there simply isn't the space. The resort lies at the narrowing top of Little Cottonwood Canyon, 25 miles southeast of Salt Lake City. Only about 125 acres of vacant land are available near the ski area, and much of that sits in avalanche paths. Five small hotels are within skiing distance of the slopes, but further development is limited because of access to water -- controlled by Salt Lake City -- and the zoning rules of Alta, a town of 397 people.
What's more, the Alta ski area is protected by old money and its stockholders' commitment to preserving the area. They are supported by loyal, hard-core skiers, a blend of locals and out-of-staters who return to the area season after season. "We want to keep Alta as it is," said Paul Laughlin, whose family owns a controlling stake in the resort.
Indeed, Alta hasn't changed much since it was founded nearly 60 years ago. Most of Alta's runs are natural, and there are no nightclubs, T-shirt shops or fancy restaurants. Only eight exposed chair lifts serve the slopes. (Aspen, Colo., has 30.) All carry only two or three skiers a chair, and most open onto knife-edged ridges that cannot accommodate many people.
The elements that Alta enthusiasts regard as strengths, other skiers might call deficits. There are no gondolas, and the longer trips can make for frosty rides on chillier days. The food at the restaurants on the mountain is basic burger-and-chili fare, not the gourmet experience, say, at nearby Deer Valley.
Even so, "Alta is one of the few places that's beautiful and romantic as skiing was in the old days," said Bill Levitt, Mayor of the town of Alta for 28 years and owner of the 55-room Alta Lodge.
As large conglomerates take over more ski areas, the small, independent resort that grew from one person's passion for the sport is an endangered species. In recent years, four big companies -- Vail Resorts, American Skiing, Intrawest and Booth Creek -- have been snatching up ski areas nationwide. They now own 31 percent of the nation's 507 ski resorts.
The conglomerates are bucking up the industry, which, based on 50 million skier days each year, generates more than $1.5 billion in lift tickets alone. "In general, the industry did well this year," says Mark Manson, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette. Revenues are up, he added, and the conglomerates "are enjoying very strong growth." Capital expenditures across a sample of 177 ski resorts nationwide increased from $167.5 million in 1995-96 to $237 million in 1996-97 -- a jump of 41 percent, according to the National Ski Areas Association.
Confidence in these ventures is fueled by the growing popularity of snowboarding, which is expected to account for 20 percent of lift ticket sales this season. Indeed, boarding, once disdained as the industry's ruin, is now embraced as its possible savior.
Yet Alta is one of only six resorts in the National Ski Area Association where snowboarding isn't allowed. "For us it was a business decision," Mr. Wieringa said. "We already have enough people at our door."
Alta, though, is an industry anomaly, not "an economic model that works," said Barry Rothberg, an analyst for Furman Selz. Typically, resorts "that rely on lift ticket sales alone have very horrible business models," he said. "Basically, Alta is an uphill transportation company. They're getting paid because they're taking you to the top of the mountain. Alta provides a very Bohemian old-fashioned experience and is able to pull it off because the terrain is spectacular and the weather is about as reliable as it gets."
The ideal, Mr. Rothberg said, would be a resort whose profits reflected a third of a skier's total vacation costs, including transportation, lodging, food, entertainment and lift tickets. Vail Resorts comes close, earning between 25 percent and 30 percent from each ski vacation on the mountain.
Alta looms nearly 11,000 feet up Little Cottonwood Canyon, just south of Salt Lake City. Storms dump an average of 550 inches of light powder on Alta's slopes annually, more snow than elsewhere in the region, including Snowbird, only 1.5 miles away.
In the mid-19th century, Alta was a silver mining town. But in the early 1900's it was destroyed by fire and avalanches. For years, the lone resident was the eccentric George Watson, who lived in a tiny cabin, declared himself mayor and bought some old mining claims that turned out to be worthless. In 1939 he deeded 1,800 acres to the United States Forest Service in lieu of back taxes.
Soon thereafter, Joe Quinney, a Salt Lake City lawyer, and James Laughlin, the New York publisher of Delmore Schwartz and Ezra Pound, obtained a lease from the Forest Service and started putting in chair lifts. They recruited two Norweigen ski-jump legends, the brothers Sverre and Alf Engen, to run a ski school.
THE Forest Service still owns most of the resort's 2,200 acres. The five lodges belong to individual families. The Alta Ski Lift Company owns the lift operation, a few administration buildings, three restaurants and the Alf Engen Ski School. The Laughlin family owns 51 percent of Alta Ski Lift; the Quinneys, 25 percent, and Dick Bass, the owner of Snowbird, 11 percent. The rest is divided among a handful of others. (Quinney died in the 1980's, and Laughlin died last summer.)
The owners won't release figures on revenues, but gross income from the more than 453,000 lift tickets sold in the 1996-97 season alone would be about $12.6
million annually. Alta Ski Lifts pays 2.5 percent of net income to the Forest Service for use of the land.
As with any business at the mercy of the elements, revenues depend on the weather. But in 60 years, there have been only two disastrous winters. In 1976-77, a severe drought hit the mountain, leaving it tufted with grass at Christmas; in the early 1970's, it rained all January and "everyone in the lodges checked out," recalled John Cahill, owner of the Alta Peruvian, one of the resort's hotels.
The founders envisioned Alta as a playground for themselves, their friends and the locals. Ms. Shrontz, who lives in Alta, said Quinney, her grandfather, wasn't interested in the ski area as a way to become rich.
Indeed, Alta's pricing policy is different from that at other resorts, said Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association: "There's no kids' pricing and no discounts -- except to skiers over 80. Also, they don't spend very much money, if any, on marketing. It's all word of mouth."
Because the company has no mortgages, it is financially healthier than most other ski resorts. "A lot of places go out on a limb to build 500-room hotels. Then they can't fill them, and they're in trouble," said John Guldner, the town manager.
In contrast, nearby Snowbird, a world-class resort, was in financial trouble until recently. It opened in 1970 and serves slightly fewer skiers a year than Alta does. Lift tickets that include a high-speed tram to the top of the mountain cost $47, and the ambiance is much different -- "lots of concrete and fast lifts," Mr. Rothberg, the analyst, said. Moreover, Snowbird advertises heavily and positions itself as a four-season resort.
But Alta's commitment to staying small and independent remains firm. When Mr. Wieringa first proposed at a town meeting several years ago that Alta limit the number of cars and buses that could park on the mountain, some local shop owners were opposed. But Mr. Wierenga convinced them, Mr. Levitt said, "that in the long run, it was the smart thing to do."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Looking Back At Jackson Hole

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
SINCE the start of the 1970's, an obscure group of economists and health specialists had been flogging notions of universal medical care to the deaf ears of legislators and Presidents.
The group's organizers, Paul M. Ellwood, formerly a pediatric neurologist in Minneapolis, and Alain C. Enthoven, a health economist at Stanford University, had a theory about expanding the cost-efficient practices of managed care into a vast system that would cover all Americans. 

'Grotesque' Version
Then six years ago, during the Presidential primary campaigns in New Hampshire, they received a call from Bill Clinton's health advisers, who wanted a briefing about the plan. Suddenly, the Jackson Hole Group, as they called themselves, was a household name.
"The rest is bad political history," Dr. Ellwood said.
Four years after the demise of the Clinton Administration's "grotesque" formulation of the Jackson Hole plan, as Mr. Enthoven puts it, managed care now dominates the marketplace, having evolved on its own because of economic pressures.
Eighty-five percent of all workers are now covered by some sort of managed-care plan, up from 50 percent four years ago. But the results are mixed, many consumers are unhappy and health care has returned to the top of the nation's political agenda. No one in Congress or the White House has an appetite any longer for grand schemes and revolutions. And no one is picking the brains of Jackson Hole this time around.
As they look back at the swift and far-reaching changes they helped inspire, the Jackson Hole planners say they were right about some things and wrong about others.
"The real weakness in the system now is nobody trusts anybody," Dr. Ellwood said. "Health plans are on the defensive, doctors are on the defensive and patients are skeptical."
The unadulterated Jackson Hole plan was simple, at least in theory. Called managed competition, it envisioned a Government-guided system of private health plans and insurance companies that would compete to enroll large regional pools of workers and other groups. Vigorous competition to win contracts with employers would drive down the cost of care. The savings would then be used to extend health care to the uninsured. Plans that enrolled disproportionately high numbers of young, healthy workers would subsidize plans with older and sicker workers.
In hindsight, Dr. Ellwood and Mr. Enthoven acknowledge that it was unrealistic to expect Congress to revamp the whole health care system with a single bill.
Peter Boland, a health care consultant in Berkeley, Calif., said the plan was "a plausible model that probably could have worked with modification." One flaw, he said, was the assumption that employers could readily be organized into regional groups to purchase care. Another was "a distinct lack of choice on behalf of consumers," he said.
 
No Consumer Voice
Mary Jane England, a psychiatrist and a Jackson Hole member, said the plan was drawn up without the involvement of consumers. "From 1993 to now, the biggest shift that we've seen is the shift to consumers," said Dr. England, who is the president of the Washington Business Group on Health, an organization of large employers.
It was the luxury of wide-open choice, and the accompanying rise in costs, that inspired the Administration's pursuit of a plan in the first place. Enrollees in the prevailing fee-for-service plans could get whatever care they wished from doctors who could prescribe and charge whatever they wished. Insurers would write them checks and then raise the premiums they charged employers.
As managed care has spread, so have complaints from consumers and physicians about the loss of choice and prerogatives. A consumer rebellion has already prompted at least 43 states to enact laws expanding consumer rights.
But managed care, left to the marketplace, has had some successes. It met the overriding goal of the planners -- stopping the soaring inflation in health costs at the start of the 1990's. The nation's spending for health care in 1996 reached $1 trillion, 4.4 percent and $50 billion more than in 1995 -- the smallest percentage increase in 37 years.
Still, the planners did not anticipate how the marketplace would reward the system's participants. Employers are unscathed. They have been holding the line on the premiums they pay to insurers and managed care organizations, forcing the managed care industry as a whole to lose money last year. And employers have been requiring workers to pay ever larger shares of the premiums.
As a result, the Employee Benefit Research Institute reports, 41.4 million Americans under 65, or 17.7 percent of the population, has no insurance at all, compared with 38.3 million, or 17 percent, in 1992.
As the White House and Congress tinker with the system the marketplace wrought, that gap could begin to shrink. Last year, Congress voted to try to extend coverage to five million of the nation's 10 million children, and this year the President has proposed extending Medicare coverage to the uninsured among people who are 55 to 65.
Such initiatives have become possible, Dr. Ellwood says, because of the Federal budget savings arising from managed care's leveling of health care costs. "Our idea," he said, "was that enough money could be saved from managed competition to pay for the coverage of those who didn't have it."
 
Healthier, Not Happier
For those who are insured, it is too soon to tell whether managed care has improved health in any significant way. Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that people are no sicker than they were in the fee-for-service days.
But managed care, by encouraging preventive medicine, with all but free mammograms, physical examinations, prenatal care and childhood immunization, has probably produced some health improvements.
"Maybe people aren't happier," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton. "But they're healthier."
This month, Mr. Clinton told the American Medical Association that he is taking a "step by step" approach to health care reform.
In the new debate, the lightning rods are the President's promise of better quality of care -- implying more choice and regulation -- and industry's warnings of rising costs, driven by regulation, that could leave still more people uninsured.
And the debate will center on new questions, like how much government should intervene to stop abuses of the market-driven health care system; how far to go toward coverage for the working poor who have no insurance; how much choice to allow H.M.O. enrollees; how much to let doctors reclaim control of health care decisions, and how much consumers, their employers and the economy will accept in higher premiums to pay for greater choice.
"The best thing the Clinton plan did," said Jack Faris, president of the National Federation of Independent Business and a participant in the Jackson Hole deliberations, "was to tell us in the private sector we'd better get our act together and improve quality and lower cost and give us a wider selection of care."

HEADLINE: The Nation: What New York Renaissance?;
Left Wing, Right Wing, Sneering at This Town

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:

CONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM
To: The United Media Elite
From: The I Love New York Subcommittee
Subject: Naysayers
 WE don't know how it happened, but there is now strong evidence that many out-of-town writers and thinkers aren't getting the message about New York City's glorious comeback. In recent months, dissenting voices have been heard, daring to suggest that the city may actually have much more work to do. 
 Granted, most of these voices are coming from the provinces, from chip-on-the-shoulder places like Washington, London and Los Angeles, towns that long ago lost their bids to become capital of the world. But what is striking about these dissents is that they are coming from across the ideological spectrum, from conservative publications like The Weekly Standard and National Review to centrist Democrats to socialist university professors.
They are filtering their arguments through their own ideologies, of course. Those on the left believe the city has become increasingly oblivious to the social costs of prosperity, while conservatives believe the city hasn't gone nearly far enough in cutting taxes and stimulating the economy. Others are regionalists, passionately promoting areas like the Pacific Rim at our expense. But each is using our renaissance to once again set New York apart as a unique cultural symbol -- and just at the moment when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is finally poised to lead us into the American mainstream.
It is that entry that they most resist, even as they applaud the sudden decline in crime and sleaze that for so long served as our city's trademarks. They all seem to make the same point: We in the media elite, who have worked so hard to control what the nation thinks, have no idea what is really going on west of the Hudson, and thus we cannot fathom how far New York still has to go to catch up with prevailing economic and social trends. Thanks to our efforts, the world is flocking to our suddenly safe streets but knows nothing of our sky-high unemployment rate or business taxes. We in the media elite would rather rhapsodize about the tourist and immigration boom than explain the 1.07 million New Yorkers who, according to last week's census figures, joined the exodus from the city during the 1990's.
 
'Hype'
Take Joel Kotkin, for example, a centrist who used to work for the Democratic Leadership Council and now writes about urban policy as a senior fellow of the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy in California. In an op-ed piece in The Los Angeles Times last month headlined "The Hype That Made New York," he argued (with a distinctly anti-Eastern accent for a former New Yorker) that "New York's much ballyhooed 'resurgence' " is more public relations than economics. At the behest of the city's real estate industry, he charged, we have exaggerated our turnaround while ignoring more significant shifts in places like Houston, Boston and, God forbid, Los Angeles.
Because our industry is clustered in a few blocks of midtown Manhattan, he said, we have been lulled into complacency by Mr. Giuliani's soothing reductions in crime without even realizing that economic growth in the other four boroughs has been stagnant for years. (At least the city is doing better than the surrounding three-state region.)
 
Manhattan-Centered
"Not surprisingly, the Manhattan media elite tends to share perceptions growing out of common experiences," Mr. Kotkin wrote. He even quoted a Smith College professor, Stanley Rothman, who said: "These guys are basically all from the same place. They all read The New York Times and they talk to each other more than anyone else."
Asked in an interview to explain a recent New York Times poll that found that the image of New York around the country had vastly improved, Mr. Kotkin laughed and said all of us have created that perception with our flattering newsweekly profiles of Mr. Giuliani, our merry Seinfeld episodes, our Fortune cover stories promoting New York as the most improved city for business.
"The fact is that Houston and Dallas have had much stronger recoveries than New York, but you never read about that because you don't know about it in New York," he said. He doesn't seem to understand that our frame of reference is our own historical experience, not that of lesser cities.
Mr. Kotkin is no conservative, but his skepticism has been echoed in right-of-center publications like The Weekly Standard, The Economist, National Review and The Financial Times of London. Many conservatives seem uneasy with the idea that New York could begin to turn itself around while retaining its rent control system, high tax structure and enormous municipal budget. And the libertarians among them recoil at the Mayor's notion that government should encourage civility. Even The City Journal, a quarterly published by Mr. Giuliani's favorite think tank, the Manhattan Institute, reminds the Mayor in its current issue that New York's city and state tax burden is twice as high per capita as those of the average Midwestern or Eastern city, and nowhere near as low as those of the South and West.
William Tucker, who wrote an article in The Weekly Standard in January titled "New York City, Economic Backwater," said in an interview that New Yorkers are so excited to have escaped their doldrums that they don't realize how much greater the booms are in places like Research Triangle Park in North Carolina. For all the hype that he accuses us of giving New York's multimedia industry in downtown's Silicon Alley, the community remains tiny and may be growing stagnant. Several promising New York-based Web sites have recently closed down, including two last week.
"New York is doing tremendously well this year, but there are all these underlying structural difficulties with the city's economy that are invisible now because the market is so high," he said. "It's still crushing small businesses with its tax structure, which makes me think of what unbelievably vast potential the city would have if it really got in gear."
The Giuliani administration, of course, argues that it has just begun the task of rolling away years of anti-business policies, and insists that the turnaround has just begun. But The Financial Times says the recovery has not been evenly distributed.
"The Wall Street boom, and the megabucks it has generated in New York, has already driven up property prices to the point where, by and large, only the reasonably well-off middle classes (and those benefiting from controlled rents) can afford to live in Manhattan," Richard Tomkins wrote in the newspaper last weekend. "Conspicuous consumption is rampant, and the highest form of artistic endeavor is regarded as the ability to get a table at Balthazar."
 
Creative Complacency
Though this trend may mean more ad pages and higher revenues for all of us, many writers have suggested that it is spreading a stifling blanket of complacency over the city's "creative sector," which often thrives in hard times. Dwight Garner, an editor at the on-line magazine Salon, wrote last year that he is taking the subway more than ever now, seeing it as "one of the last places where the city feels genuinely alert, racially mixed, edgy, engaged." Robert Fitch, author of "The Assassination of New York," says the city's failures to create economic diversity are having serious cultural consequences.
"There's a somnolent quality to the characteristic areas of New York City activity," said Mr. Fitch, a professor at New York University who will be making this point in a speech to the Socialist Scholars Conference this weekend. "Where's the vitality in the art world? In music and dance? Cultural life has been narrowed down to entertainment."
Fortunately, no one need ever know of these fringe seditionists with their talk of Houston and underground railways, if we can simply remain united and ignore them. By the way, does anyone know if the subway runs beneath Midtown?

HEADLINE: The Nation: Pride and Prejudice;
The South's History Rises, Again and Again

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss.

 BODY:
LIKE an anthology of short stories threaded by a common theme, a confluence of events in Mississippi last week provided a poignant test of William Faulkner's wry observation that "the past is never dead; it's not even past."
Clearly that was more true in the mythic South of Faulkner's fiction than in the modern South that promotes itself so relentlessly as New. But as developments in Mississippi last week demonstrated, the region's noble ambitions are still weighed down by the transgressions of the past. Hard as it tries -- and it tries more earnestly with each passing day -- the South never quite pulls free of the most repellent aspects of its history. 
 The week began with a contentious forum held by the President's Advisory Board on Race at the University of Mississippi, an institution still coming to terms with the deadly riots of 1962 that greeted the enrollment of its first black student, James H. Meredith. Next came the unsealing of 124,000 pages of documents from the state's defunct Sovereignty Commission, a domestic spy agency disbanded in 1977 after waging an illegal, 21-year war on the civil rights movement. And the week ended with an ugly confrontation in the state Capitol between legislators and Gov. Kirk Fordice over a voting rights bill that has generated yet another debate over states' rights and race.
 
Anguish and Anger
At the intersection of all three events there is reason to believe that many in this most Southern of states have concluded that they must address their past forthrightly to move forward. But in doing so they must inevitably confront anguish and anger -- evoked by haunting images of Medgar Evers and other civil rights martyrs. And they face a paradox: the fact that revisiting the past both stimulates catharsis and stokes resentment. Whether it ultimately speeds healing or retards it is hard to know.
"Medgar Evers and James Meredith both said that if we ever turn the corner on race, Mississippi will be the best place in the world to live," said David Sansing, a University of Mississippi historian, who turned to the metaphor of a traffic circle to explain the South's progress. "We have turned the corner, but it's not a 90-degree turn," he said. "It's like one of those things that I drove in England last summer, a roundabout. Maybe we'll get off of it one day. But at least we're in motion, and that's more than you can say for much of the country."
That race relations in the South do not always advance in a straight line could be seen Tuesday morning at the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, where the Sovereignty Commission files were unsealed.
Ellie J. Dahmer, the widow of Vernon Dahmer, a leader for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Hattiesburg whose 1966 firebombing death is being reinvestigated, was there with her two children, hoping to discover something in her late husband's file that would implicate a local Ku Klux Klan leader, Sam Bowers. "At last, Mississippi is willing to rebuild some of its past," said Mrs. Dahmer, clutching the agency's surveillance records on her husband.
But also on hand was Richard Barrett, a white lawyer from Jackson who defended the members of the Sovereignty Commission as patriots. He handed out fliers arguing that Mississippi's streets were safer and its schools were better when the commission was at work.
The commission, supported by tax dollars and housed in the Capitol, was, in the words of a longtime Mississippi journalist, Bill Minor, the "K.G.B. of the cotton patches." As the civil rights movement was sustained by the Federal courts, Mississippi and several other Southern states institutionalized their resistance by creating such agencies to track the activities, associations, political affiliations and sexual proclivities of their citizens.
When the Mississippi Legislature shut the agency, it sealed the records -- those that had not been destroyed -- for 50 years. The American Civil Liberties Union and several other plaintiffs challenged the closing of the files, and succeeded in opening them 29 years early.
The records show that the commission used both physical and economic intimidation to fight its foes. A 1958 memorandum from a commission investigator, for example, noted approvingly that steps had been taken to silence a black preacher, W. B. Ridgeway of Hattiesburg, who had testified before a Congressional committee about the curtailment of black voting rights.
"Economic pressure had been applied to members of his congregation in such a way that they got on Ridgeway pretty hard and effectively," wrote the investigator, Zack J. VanLandingham, "and since that time there has been nothing heard out of Ridgeway."
Few details were too inconsequential for the commission's records. The purchase of a new Singer sewing machine was noted in the file on Rita Schwerner, a civil rights worker whose husband, Michael, was later murdered. License plate numbers were collected and traced. Marital spats were detailed.
 
States' Rights Redux
Against that legacy, it was hard to miss the irony unfolding in the Capitol, where lawmakers argued last week with Governor Fordice, a Republican, over his insistence that voters show identification at the polls.
Last month, Mr. Fordice vetoed a bill that would have made Mississippi the final state to adhere to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which requires states to make registration forms available in drivers' license bureaus, social service agencies and other state offices. Mr. Fordice has said the "motor voter" law should be renamed the "welfare voter" law, and has charged that it is an unconstitutional imposition on his state's rights.
Under pressure from the Justice Department, however, he has said he would sign a bill that included a mandatory voter identification provision to deter fraud. The Legislature has rejected that proposal, specifically because of objections from black Mississippians who harbor fresh memories of the obstacles erected by the state to keep them from voting in the past.
State Senator John Horhn, a black Democrat from Jackson, said black Mississippians were very suspicious of the voter identification requirement, given that the state once had an agency charged with the surveillance of its citizens and the abridgment of their rights. "It's something that we are very wary of and that we don't trust," he said.
Mr. Fordice charged last week that many of the legislators opposing his proposal "are here because of voter fraud." Mr. Horhn responded by saying that the Governor "has repeatedly shown himself to be a callous, unthinking dolt."
On Monday and Tuesday in Oxford, members of the President's Advisory Board on Race gathered at the University of Mississippi for a forum dedicated to gauging the community's progress on race. Again, the old South and the new one clashed.
A black student and a white student from Oxford High School declared their friendship with a heartfelt hug, but also pointed out that black and white students segregated themselves at lunch. Black speakers complained about the lack of a black doctor in town, adding that a nonwhite physician would have trouble attracting white patients. When a white man in the audience stood to proclaim that it was his "freedom" to wave the Confederate flag at Ole Miss football games, a white student responded by saying that most students would appreciate it if he did not.
Former Gov. William F. Winter, a member of the advisory panel, and John Hope Franklin, the historian who serves as its chairman, both commented on the progress reflected in the simple fact that such a discussion was being held at Ole Miss, a place with such a history of racial strife. The university's chancellor, Robert C. Khayat, who has tried to tone down Confederate symbolism at the school, said events in the South "move forward and backward, seldom in a straight line."
Such acknowledgements of the region's complexities are becoming more common across the South, as are apologies for past behavior. Last fall, at a 40th anniversary commemoration of the desegregation of Little Rock Central High School, Arkansas' Republican Governor, Mike Huckabee, said the violent white resistance to school's integration "may be forgivable, but it is not excusable."
"In the Proverbs," added Mr. Huckabee, formerly a Baptist preacher, "it says that he who conceals his sins does not prosper. But whoever professes and renounces them will find mercy."

HEADLINE: The World;
Clinton's Spotlight Now Turns to Africa

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ABUJA, Nigeria

 BODY:
FOR millennia, Africa has largely remained a mystery to the outside world, marked perhaps more by its isolation than by any other feature.
This stubborn reality can be traced to the earliest times and is reflected in the hopelessly misrepresented images of ancient cartographers, whose graphic distortions were as errant as the half-myths and false science that passed for knowledge about a place long known among Westerners as the Dark Continent. 
 From the Roman era, trade winds from the west made maritime commerce with remote India much easier for the Mediterranean world than it ever was with the much-closer eastern coast of Africa.
And on the west of the continent, Africa's greatest civilizations rose and fell with hardly an echo; the formidable natural barrier imposed by the vast and hostile expanse of the Sahara Desert enforced the silence.
When outsiders have engaged Africa at all, Africans complain, they have almost always done so in the interest of extraction. And the products they have taken, from salt to slaves, gold to oil, have consistently served prosperity elsewhere rather than any development here.
The perspective of millennia may seem needlessly long for those who will watch President Clinton visit Africa this week, the first trip by an American leader to the continent in 20 years (except for a lightning trip by George Bush to visit American soldiers in Somalia).
But for guests and hosts alike, it will ultimately be against this backdrop that Mr. Clinton's voyage will be measured.
The logic comes direct from Mr. Clinton's quarter. For this President, a man as versed in the art of the message as any modern leader, the first order of business will be one of images: changing the way Americans think of Africans, and perhaps vice versa.
 
America, Meet a Continent
Mr. Clinton has already spoken of "introducing the people of the United States to a new Africa -- an Africa whose political and economic accomplishments grow more impressive each month." He comes promising to help pull Africa out of its long isolation, and to assist in what he calls the continent's budding renaissance. There will be talk of new trade initiatives, certainly, and of democracy, of the environment and of working together for peace.
Both the backdrops selected and the countries to be visited (Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, Botswana and Senegal -- all of which, except for Rwanda, exemplify strides toward democracy or economic growth or both) reveal the underlying message -- a belated welcoming of Africa into a shared and fast-shrinking planet from perhaps the only man alive who can credibly make such a greeting.
Like every other important message these days, Mr. Clinton's message to Africa will be borne on the wings of the media. The television images beamed back to the United States promise to be of an Africa that few Americans suspect exists: of modern cities and articulate statesmen and fully fleshed-out people rather than the cartoon-like images of Africans as tribalized villagers that have prevailed.
"We are hoping to accomplish two things," said Susan Rice, assistant Secretary of State for Africa. "The first is to try and show Americans a picture of Africa that is different from the one-sided view they often get of conflict and warfare and famine." The President, she said, "also wants to convey that the United States is serious about building a new relationship with Africa for the 21st Century, one built on mutual interest and mutual respect."
Experts in American policy toward Africa who have seen past flourishes of interest fade like desert blossoms say they are cautiously optimistic that this time something different may be at work.
The mutual interest that American officials now speak of concerns the continent's huge, if mostly unrealized, economic potential, and growth rates that have been creeping up for a decade. Mr. Clinton comes armed with new legislation that, if ratified by the Senate, would lift barriers on much African trade with America and encourage American private investment as well.
 
To Be Heard
It would also create annual cabinet-level meetings between African and American officials. "Africa is the only continent that doesn't have something like this already," said Salih Booker, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "It gives Africans a real opportunity to step up to the plate and articulate some ideas and defend their positions on important issues rather than waiting for outside powers to simply decide matters on their behalf."
As happy and proud as many Africans will be to be playing host to the leader of the United States, there will also be real skepticism borne of long history. Where American Presidents are concerned, the gold standard in Africa was set by John F. Kennedy and Jimmy Carter, two leaders still seen by many Africans as having been uniquely interested in the fortunes of their continent -- even more significant, as Presidents who not only took from Africa but gave as well. After the echoes of Mr. Clinton's rhetoric have faded, it is against this measure that many will judge him.
At the height of the Cold War, Mr. Kennedy created the Peace Corps, sending the first volunteers to Ghana, Mr. Clinton's first stop. Mr. Carter is still revered here for his emphasis on democracy and human rights -- two themes that over the years have mostly been absent from Washington's policies toward the continent.
Mr. Clinton and his entourage will arrive with a mantra focusing on trade, not aid, and the point will be made insistently, if delicately, that America's budget priorities cannot include the large-scale assistance that many African countries say they badly need.
But Africans have been growing more confident in their own emergence from decades of dictatorship and dependence, and so they think of more than just economic aid when they ponder what might constitute a meaningful gesture from outsiders who want to give back something to a continent that they have long taken from.
In one capital after another, educated youths look to an Asia where Western-dominated financial institutions are rushing to ease an economic crisis, and these young people are posing incisive questions about why their poor countries have not received similarly sympathetic hearings on issues like crushing foreign debt.
And there is the matter of democracy. When Africans have worked so hard in this decade to change the rules of politics in their countries, fighting authoritarianism and trying to make the citizen count, why has the West so often been silent?
"Clinton's best gift to Africans will be to take us seriously as people," said Totobi Kwesi, a Ghanaian university student. "Let Africans and the world know and never forget that we suffer like other people, perhaps more, and that our needs are the same. That is worth more than money."

MARKETS
Higher Still and Higher
Ignoring earnings warnings from several companies -- most recently, Sunbeam and Rockwell International -- investors kept bidding up stock prices, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to five consecutive records. The Dow ended the week at 8,906.43, up 303.91. Behind the market's gains are low interest rates, low inflation and bullish analysts. Abby Joseph Cohen, the co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company, raised her 1998 Dow target to 9,300. . . . The boards of the National Association of Securities Dealers, and the American Stock Exchange backed merger plans. Frank G. Zarb, chairman of the N.A.S.D., said a market of markets would result. The N.A.S.D. promised to invest at least $110 million in technology and other improvements if it takes control of the Amex. 

TRADE
A Yawning Deficit
The United States trade deficit surged in January to its deepest level in a decade -- $12 billion, up from $10.9 billion in December -- the Commerce Department reported. It said the financial crises in Asia had depressed demand for American goods in that part of the world, and the Administration again called on Japan to address the imbalance by stimulating its economy. Japan reported that its trade surplus for February climbed 88.7 percent from a year earlier, to $9.8 billion. The surplus with the United States, Japan's biggest trade partner, rose 32.9 percent, to $4.14 billion.
 
BASEBALL
Media Moguls on Deck
Even before the baseball season opens, Rupert Murdoch seems to have hit a home run. His Fox Group took over the Los Angeles Dodgers from the O'Malley family for a record $350 million. Club owners turned aside objections of Mr. Murdoch's rival, Ted Turner, baseball's first media mogul-owner, and overwhelmingly approved the sale, which ends an era of family control. Tom Schieffer, president of the Texas Rangers, said Fox's TV involvement with baseball was a key factor in the approval. Fox is in the third season of a $575 million, five-year national TV contract with the major leagues; it has a $43 million-a-year national cable deal and local TV agreements with 22 of the 30 clubs. . . .The New York Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, said that he had discussed selling a portion of his franchise to Cablevision Systems, which owns the Knicks and the Rangers, but no deal had been struck.
 
MERGERS
Insurance Battle Ends
Maurice R. Greenberg, chief executive of American International Group, appeared to bow to a rival, Henry R. Silverman, chief executive of Cendant, which offered $67 a share, or a total of $3.1 billion, for American Bankers Insurance Group of Miami. The offer was $9 more than Mr. Greenberg's latest bid. . . . Aetna agreed to buy New York Life Insurance's health care subsidiary, NYLCare Health Plans, for $1.35 billion. . . .Alltel, an independent local telephone company, agreed to acquire 360 Communications, a big cellular carrier, for more than $4 billion. . . .Ispat International, a London-based steelmaker known for global acquisitions, agreed to buy Inland Steel of Chicago for $888.2 million and to assume $538.6 million of debt. . . .Carl C. Icahn withdrew his $43 million offer to bail out Pan Am.
 
BRITAIN
Labor's New Tight Fist
Presenting the first full Labor budget in 20 years, Gordon Brown, right, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pledged incentives to get people off welfare, saying, "Your responsibility is to seek work, and my guarantee is that if you work, work will pay more than benefits." He and Prime Minister Tony Blair, at left above, explained in a public meeting that the budget also included more money for education and health, cuts in corporate taxes and rewards for long-term investments and personal savings. Called the "Iron Chancellor" for his tight-fisted approach to spending, Mr. Brown has raised the standing of the Labor Party in financial circles to a level previously unknown.
 
BANKING
A West Coast Behemoth
The nation's two largest savings and loan companies agreed to a $9.9 billion deal that would create a giant capable of competing with the big new players of consumer banking. Washington Mutual of Seattle agreed to buy H. F. Ahmanson of Los Angeles in a stock swap that would make it triple the size of its nearest competitor in the savings and loan business. It would become the seventh-largest company in the banking industry, behind BankAmerica on the West Coast but ahead of Wells Fargo. . . . Chase Manhattan, the nation's largest bank, said it would lay off 2,250 employees, or about 3 percent of its work force, as it consolidated administrative and business functions.
 
IN BRIEF
Canning Digital Spam
Unsolicited electronic junk mail -- commonly called spam -- is increasingly bedeviling cyberspace. Now Sendmail, the electronic post office used on about 75 percent of the computers that route E-mail messages to recipients on the Internet, is being fitted with software tools to battle spammers. . . . An unexpected ruling by a Federal judge in Colorado sharply increases the risks associated with financing and leasing airplanes. It threatens to make it much harder for new and financially troubled airlines to get airplanes. . . . Boeing said that by 2000 it would eliminate 8,200 jobs, mostly in Long Beach, Calif. The reductions are in addition to 12,000 job cuts announced in December. . . . Fidelity Investments plans to close three of its largest and best-performing mutual funds -- the Growth and Income, Contrafund and Low-Priced Stock funds -- to new retail investors after April 3, but it will offer several new funds.

HEADLINE: DIARY: THE ECONOMY;
'Eerily,' Fed Sees Prosperity

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN 

GRAPHIC: Photo: The economy in all regions of the United States remains strong, the Federal Reserve said in its "beige book" survey of regional economic conditions, yet inflation seems "eerily calm." Indeed, the Consumer Price Index for February rose only 0.1 percent, held down by falling oil prices. That left the inflation rate for the last year at just 1.4 percent. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the index rose 0.3 percent, its biggest jump since last April. Another sign of strength came in the nation's housing market. Starts rose 6 percent in February. The Fed report also cited rising industrial activity, good retail sales and strong demand for labor. I.B.M., for example, hopes to attract job applicants from students on spring break. In Panama City, Fla., two workers carved an image of an I.B.M. Think Pad computer into the sand.

HEADLINE: Too Many Arms to Twist

BYLINE: By Jack F. Matlock Jr.; Jack F. Matlock Jr., a professor at the Institute for Advanced Study, was Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1987 to 1991.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's frenetic diplomatic activity in recent weeks in and around Serbia's Kosovo region provides a fresh example of floundering in today's international environment. Senior Administration officials have made public threats that, if carried out, could embroil the United States in an ethnic war with slight if any relevance to American security.
In response to outrageous Serbian police attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced on March 7 that the United States held Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader, "personally responsible" for developments in Kosovo and reiterated that the United States "will not tolerate violence." Earlier, Robert Gelbard, the United States envoy, was even more pointed when he threatened "the most dire consequences imaginable" to the Yugoslav Government. 
 By making implied threats to use military force -- an idea that has no support among our NATO allies -- and by blaming Mr. Milosevic for all the violence, the Administration is setting itself up for a Hobson's choice: if our threats do not deter him, we will either have to take action that can only worsen the situation or be seen as engaging in a bluff. Worse, our posturing can encourage those Albanians who use force and violence to assert their irredentist claims not only in rump Yugoslavia but also in Macedonia.
Certainly it is in the American interest to deter another Balkan war, as it is to discourage brutal Serbian treatment of ethnic Albanian citizens. But the problem cannot be solved by bluster or military action, much less unilateral American strikes. A solution will require Mr. Milosevic to agree to restore the autonomy to Kosovo that he took away in 1989 and to protect the rights of ethnic Albanians and Serbs alike.
By blaming Mr. Milosevic alone for the recent crackdown, and not giving adequate public attention to the violent actions by armed Albanian separatists that provoked it, we hardly encourage compromise. By not insisting publicly that the Kosovo Albanian leaders drop their demand for full independence and negotiate in good faith for autonomy within Yugoslavia, we seem to be insisting on something no Government in Belgrade can accept, with or without Mr. Milosevic.
Our NATO allies and, importantly, Russia have taken a more balanced approach, exerting pressure on each side to conduct negotiations on self-rule. But if armed Kosovo Albanians continue to attack Serbs in the region, it is difficult to see how talks could lead to a settlement or how the Yugoslav Government could resist public pressure to retaliate.
If the American threat were an isolated tactical error, it could be excused as an uncharacteristic blunder easily fixed. Unfortunately, it fits a pattern of strategic misjudgment that has marked the Administration's foreign policy of late. The Administration has maneuvered itself very close to a lose-lose choice in dealing with Saddam Hussein, and has weakened American leverage and ties with allies by attempting a "dual containment" of Iraq and Iran.
The Administration has also reduced our ability to keep weapons of mass destruction away from terrorists and rogue regimes. By pursuing a mindless expansion of NATO, the United States has given Russia more cause to hold on to its nuclear arsenal and resist an American role in preventing leaks of nuclear technology.
The collapse of the Soviet Union transformed the international environment. The United States no longer has a global rival that can threaten it by exploiting local conflicts. We, therefore, can safely insist that other countries accept the prime responsibility for keeping peace in their neighborhoods. The United States must be able to counter threats to regional balances of power when they occur. But over the long run, we can maintain our strength and influence only if we can do so with the support and participation of our friends.
Europeans should be required to bear the prime responsibility for insuring peace in the Balkans. Islamic states, which along with Israel have the most to lose from Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, must be responsible for supporting effective means to contain Saddam Hussein. Israelis and Palestinians must understand that they bear the responsibility for settling their problems and that others will not intervene to save them from themselves. Tough love works.
Our assistance will often be essential. But we need to resist the temptation to jump into every unstable situation. As the Persian Gulf war showed, our military power is most effective when used in coalition with others. It also showed that even a spectacularly successful military victory cannot assure future peace. It takes an orderly regional neighborhood to do that, not an overeager sheriff rushing in from another continent.
The United States is now strong enough, both economically and militarily, to commit blunders without sensing the immediate effects. The public seems oblivious to the dangers that lie ahead if the United States continues, without strategic design, to inject itself into one crisis after another, treating much of the world as its protectorate.
Uncle Sam still needs a big stick in this dangerous world. But the American people and our friends abroad will eventually whittle it to a toothpick unless he remembers Theodore Roosevelt's advice to speak softly and use it sparingly.

HEADLINE: Blacks Seek Focus on Africa Policy

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: DENVER, March 21

 BODY:
The scene outside was pure Denver: a March blizzard. But inside City Hall, Mayor Wellington E. Webb was talking about Africa -- human rights, trade expansion, and debt relief.
"African-Americans should have the same sense of allegiance, of support, for working with African countries as Irish-Americans have for working with Ireland," Mr. Webb, Denver's first black Mayor, said as he prepared to join President Clinton and an entourage of about 600 politicians and business leaders for an 11-day, 6-country tour of Africa. 
 Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the poorest regions in the world, often ranking at the bottom of destinations for American foreign investment. But the fact that President Clinton sets off on Sunday to Africa for the longest overseas trip of his Presidency is a tribute to the growing influence on foreign policy of this country's 34 million African-Americans.
This grass-roots pressure can be seen here in the heartland, in Denver. Africa ties have become a priority under Mayor Webb, who is the chairman of Africa committees for the United States Conference of Mayors and the National Conference of Black Mayors.
Last June, a few days before the summit meeting of the world's leading industrialized countries here, Mr. Webb was host to African Ambassadors and black leaders for a "Town Hall Meeting on Africa." The event helped prod the visiting leaders to issue a statement on promoting economic development in Africa.
In December, Mayor Webb was in Florida, where he persuaded the Conference on Black Mayors to adopt a resolution urging the Clinton Administration to give greater importance to Africa.
In Washington in January, he led a daylong "Africa Summit" attended by 225 mayors, 3 Cabinet members and 4 African Ambassadors. The session opened the winter meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, a rare foray into foreign affairs for an organization devoted to municipal issues.
"America should redefine its relationship with Africa," Mayor Webb said at the meeting. "It's time we placed Africa at the top of our foreign policy agenda."
In response, Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, promised the mayors, "The time has come to place Africa on America's front burner."
The session's organizers included the mayors of Chicago, Dallas, Fort Wayne, Kansas City, Missouri, New Orleans and San Francisco.
"Mayor Webb is not atypical; as African-Americans have moved into positions of authority, elected positions, Africa has become more important," said Randall Robinson, leader of TransAfrica, a Washington-based group devoting to influencing policy on Africa and the Caribbean.
Black American interest and expertise in Africa has been bolstered by a steady increase in tourism, Mr. Robinson said. From only a handful of visitors to Ghana in 1957, the year of its independence, the number of black Americans visiting Africa has swelled to around 100,000 a year, he estimated.
With blacks voting overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates, Democratic Administrations have seemed to be more interested in Africa than Republican ones. The last, and only, state visit to Africa by an American President, was in 1978, by Jimmy Carter, the last Democratic President before Mr. Clinton.
"We've dealt with China, we've dealt with Asia, we've dealt with Bosnia, we've dealt with Nafta, with Canada, with Mexico," Mayor Webb said. "Now, it's time for Africa."
"This is a continent with untapped resources, with 600 million people, with countries that are making monumental strides in terms of democratic reforms," said the Mayor, who has visited Ethiopia and Kenya. "European nations have always had a 30 percent market share. Why are we down with Japan, with a 7 percent market share?"
Pressure by the Conference of Mayors contributed to a House of Representatives vote last week to pass a trade and investment liberalization bill for Africa, the African Growth and Opportunity Act. The bill, which has strong Republican support, is expected to go before the Senate later this year.
Mayor Webb hopes to expand trade and investment by leading a Colorado trade delegation to Africa later this year. Two weeks ago, he held a breakfast with representatives of Colorado companies that do business in Africa.
Mr. Webb first became interested in Africa during the decolonization era of the 1960's and 1970's. Today he believes that the most constructive interest in Africa "comes from people with a business perspective."

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., March 20

 BODY:
With the A.F.L.-C.I.O. focusing on recruiting more workers, the labor leaders gathered here for the federation's winter meeting were stunned and stumped by the latest news on union membership.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, union membership fell by 159,000 last year, to 16.1 million, even though unions have pumped millions of dollars more into organizing and said they recruited 385,000 more workers in 1997. This decline was especially worrisome, union officials acknowledged, because the economy added 2.8 million jobs. 
 In addition, the percentage of workers belonging to unions fell to 14.1 percent last year, from 14.5 percent in 1996 -- and less than half of the 35 percent of workers who were members in the 1950's.
There are numerous explanations for declining membership in 1997, a year when unions boasted they had broken organizing records. The gains were offset, at least in part, by factors that have shrunk labor's ranks for years: plant closings, layoffs and workers' voting to decertify unions at their workplaces.
"Most of the decline was because we lost a lot of workers out the back end," said Richard Bensinger, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s director of organizing.
Nonetheless, labor experts are somewhat baffled by what happened last year because they estimate that over all the unions normally need to recruit 100,000 to 150,000 members each year to offset losses caused by layoffs and decertifications.
"If labor unions organized 385,000 new members last year, there should not have been a drop in membership," said Richard Hurd, a professor of labor relations at Cornell University.
Some labor experts suggested that the Bureau of Labor Statistics might have overestimated the drop in membership and that the A.F.L.-C.I.O., relying on figures from individual unions eager to boast how fast they grew, might have overstated the organizing gains.
"I see more organizing activity than I've seen in 25 years," Professor Hurd added. "But the basic truth is it remains very difficult to organize workers."
A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials say one important factor holding down membership is that newly organized workers whose unions have not signed first contracts with employers are often not counted by the Government as union members. Mr. Bensinger said that at least one-third of the estimated 385,000 newly unionized workers did not have contracts.
In other trends working against unions, employment is falling in those manufacturing sectors, like steel, where unions are most heavily organized, while job growth has been strong in sectors where unions are largely absent, like computers and financial services.
Despite the news from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials say they are encouraged by last year's organizing performance. John J. Sweeney, who has been the federation's president for two years, has repeatedly said that several years would be needed for the stepped-up organizing to translate into higher membership.
Last year, the labor movement experienced some of its biggest organizing victories in decades. The Communications Workers of America organized 10,000 ticket agents at U S Airways, and the American Federation of Teachers unionized 9,500 teachers in Dallas.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. said it picked Las Vegas for its executive council meeting to celebrate and study the unusual success of unions there. Membership in the Culinary Union of Las Vegas, which represents kitchen workers, waiters and maids in the casino hotels, has soared to 40,000 from 18,000 in the mid-1980's.
A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials boast about the 385,000 they say they organized last year because it was far more than the 200,000 or so they have averaged in recent years.
A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials point to several stellar performers. The Service Employees International Union says it added 58,000 workers last year, while the American Federation of Teachers says it added 48,000 members over the last two years. Underlining the fluidity of the membership numbers, labor leaders say the United Food and Commercial Workers organized 100,000 new workers last year, but the union's ranks grew by just 9,000 because many supermarkets closed or laid off workers, and some workers voted to oust the union.
In what many union leaders considered the most promising news about organizing, 150 union locals, at Mr. Sweeney's urging, have increased spending on organizing to more than 15 percent of their budget. Two years ago, just 15 locals were spending that much on recruiting. "One good piece of news is 90 percent of the organizing is now done by 10 percent of the union locals," Mr. Bensinger said. "It's not just by 2 percent anymore. But that's still not good enough."

HEADLINE: Rapid-Fire Inspections Planned for Iraq Sites

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 20

 BODY:
As Iraq and the United Nations position themselves for a critical test of the agreement that averted an American military attack in February, the head of the commission disarming Iraq says that he plans rapid-fire inspections of previously off-limits Presidential properties to determine what buildings will get spot inspections later -- with much less notice.
"If any conception is held that this will be one-off, that is not correct," the commission head, Richard Butler, said in an interview. The inspections, a result of the agreement reached between Secretary General Kofi Annan and President Saddam Hussein, are expected to begin by the end of this month. 
 Mr. Butler, who is to arrive in Baghdad on Sunday, was referring to speculation among diplomats that once United Nations inspectors have visited the eight Presidential sites, accompanied at Iraq's insistence by diplomatic observers, Iraq will argue that this phase of the arms investigation is over and that the country can move closer to a lifting of sanctions.
To underline his point that this is only the beginning of this part of the process of ferreting out all prohibited weapons systems, Mr. Butler said he intended to put one of his highest-ranking inspectors in charge of the initial visits to the eight Presidential sites. They are scattered across Iraq, from Mosul, in the north near Turkey, to Basra, on the Persian Gulf.
The inspections will take place against a background of Iraqi confidence that a new system outlined in the agreement with Mr. Annan will be the key to a quick ending of sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
"But only if they keep their cool," a senior official said here. Some officials say they believe that a new confrontation with Iraq is inevitable.
On their part, inspectors will eliminate a few irritants to the Iraqis. They will be asked not to display any national symbols like flag patches sewn on their clothes.
The inspectors will go armed with a new set of reports showing in detail how far the Iraqis are from accounting for biological and chemical weapons as well as missile warheads that could be used to deliver them.
The reports were requested in January by Iraq, which apparently thought that independent teams of experts not drawn from Mr. Butler's Special Commission would look more favorably on Iraq's assertions that it was no longer harboring weapons of mass destruction or the means and material to make them.
The teams studying chemical weapons and warheads met in Iraq in February; the biological team is meeting now in Vienna and will report within the next few weeks. There are also outstanding questions about nuclear issues. Mr. Butler will be accompanied to Baghdad by Gary Dillon, the chief inspector for Iraq for the International Atomic Energy Agency.
The reports of the first two teams reveal the gap between Iraqi perceptions of where Baghdad stands in the disarmament process and what the experts conclude.
The chemical experts decided that Iraq still had the know-how and equipment -- and possibly the chemical components -- "to manufacture as much as 200 tons of VX," an extremely lethal chemical agent.
"To fully verify the extent of Iraq's VX program, Unscom needs to receive the production records and R & D reports, including munitions trials, for the entire period of VX activities," the team report said.
The group looking at the documents on special warheads found confused accounting, and indications that some warheads never declared were destroyed and buried in at least one site not listed by Iraq in any of its many "full, final and complete" disclosures.
"The team recommended that a specialized inspection team be scheduled to address all issues of warhead design and testing with Iraq's experts," the report said. "The team has not found the level of verification achieved so far to be satisfactory. Further work is required."
In an official reply, Iraq's Minister of Oil and head of Baghdad's delegation, Amir Mohammed Rasheed, asked the experts not to get bogged down in "technical details" but to focus instead on "the agony of the Iraqi people" suffering under sanctions that have crippled Iraq's economy.
John Bolton was Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations Affairs in the Bush Administration when the sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990 and the disarmament process begun in 1991. He said in an interview Thursday that Mr. Hussein has been trying to gut the inspection system dealing with his weapons of mass destruction while extricating himself from sanctions to acquire the money from oil sales to improve his conventional military forces, an often-forgotten part of the Iraqi arsenal.
"What has happened since the crisis began in October has been the clearest indication of the linkage in his mind, the interplay between the two things, that we have we seen since the cease-fire," Mr. Bolton, now senior vice president of the American Enterprise Institute, said.
He is doubtful that if Mr. Hussein breaks his latest agreement on inspections there will be more willingness to use force against Iraq, as Mr. Annan has said. One of the Administration's sharpest critics on Iraq policy, Mr. Bolton said that President Clinton had lost control of events.
The new chapter in Iraq opens with Russia playing a major role in formulating United Nations policy. Senator John Warner, Republican of Virginia, who met with Mr. Butler last week in the company of more than 60 other Senators, said in an interview that the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, appeared to be the principal author, working with France, of the plan Mr. Annan brought back from Baghdad.
Mr. Bolton agrees with Senator Warner that Russia and France are now guiding international policy in the area. Both countries have significant commercial interests in Iraq, potentially one of the world's largest oil producers.
Mr. Bolton and Senator Warner single out the role of Mr. Primakov, who became Foreign Minister of Russia two years ago. Both men had seen Mr. Primakov dominate policy on Iraq even before the collapse of the Soviet Union. Senator Warner calls him "the second coming of Gromyko," a comparison with Andrei A. Gromyko, the hard-line Soviet Foreign Minister.
"When I heard that Primakov was going to become Foreign Minister, I knew this was a real step backward on Iraq,"' Mr. Bolton said. It was Mr. Primakov who tried but failed to avert the 1991 Persian Gulf war by shuttling to Baghdad to talk with Mr. Hussein. Senator Warner said that when he visited Moscow with Secretary of Defense William Cohen and Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, on Feb. 12, a week before Mr. Annan went to Baghdad, Mr. Primakov laid out for them a plan to defuse the inspection crisis and asked the three men not to talk about it publicly. The plan, Senator Warner said, has been put together with the help of France.
If the Russians and French succeed now in persuading Mr. Hussein to keep his word on opening all Iraq sites to inspections, the United States will, on one hand, be freed of the need to use force in the near future. But on the other hand, United Nations officials say, Washington will find it much more difficult to continue comprehensive sanctions on Iraq when two crucial reviews of progress take place in April and October.
Bill Richardson, the United States representative at the United Nations, said in an interview that he rejected the contention that Russian influence is pre-eminent in the Persian Gulf.
"It was America's force and American's military presence that enabled the agreement and the full access to inspections to happen," he said. "I believe that, as we evaluate a future Iraq policy that will be more activist in containing Saddam Hussein, our influence since the agreement has increased in the region."

HEADLINE: Changing Fortunes: Hubris and Humility as U.S. Waxes and Asia Wanes

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 21

 BODY:
Judging from today's economic landscape, it must have been a few million years ago when a Japanese member of Parliament named Shintaro Ishihara offered a few pointers for the West.
"There is no hope for the U.S.," Mr. Ishihara declared. He added, "Right now, the modern civilization built by whites is coming close to its practical end." 
 But that was less than a decade ago, in 1989, and although Mr. Ishihara was unusually racial in his analysis, the notion that Japan was on the rise and America on the decline was then widespread. In one formulation that was widely repeated, the scholar Chalmers Johnson declared: "The cold war is over, and Japan won."
Now that conventional wisdom has been turned upside down, and the United States looks particularly grand after Asian economies toppled like dominoes. But if one message from Asia's crisis is the tremendous resilience of the American markets, another is the danger of hubris.
In the case of Japan in the 1980's and Southeast Asia just a year ago, excessive self-confidence led to over-priced stock markets and to over-extended corporations. In Asia these days, some see a milder echo of that in the United States today.
"Americans are patting themselves on the back and congratulating themselves on all the wonderful things that are happening in the United States, and I can understand that, but I think one should step back," said Glen S. Fukushima, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan. "It wouldn't surprise me if 10 years from now, or even 5 years from now, we see the U.S. having some economic troubles and Japan recovering."
One of the lessons of the misjudgments of the 1980's may be how prone even experts are to expect dynamos to remain dynamos simply because they have been dynamos. A result is that some analysts raise questions about American triumphalism today.
"I think this is a time when we ought to be pretty humble," said Jeffrey E. Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, "and at all costs not beat our breasts and try to demonstrate that somehow we have got the formula, because it was in this decade that an awful lot of people thought we didn't. I think it's very possible that within the next four or five years there'll be the kind of problems that create another level of doubt."
In particular, Asia's crisis has created new risks of a global economic downturn. Mr. Garten warned that if Asia's problems thus lead to a slowdown in the United States, then the American business structure will no longer seem so magnificent "and a huge number of critics will emerge."
To be sure, virtually everyone believes that the American boom is genuine and unlikely to run off a cliff the way Japan's did in 1990 or Southeast Asia's did last year. But some say that the United States is also growing in part because of a cyclical expansion and that it may risk being humbled in the next cyclical contraction.
"Great economic success at least temporarily hides all sorts of problems," noted M. Y. Yoshino, a professor at Harvard Business School. "Unless we've somehow found a way of breaking the economic cycle, which I don't think we have, then we'll face a downturn, too. And then our economic and social problems will reemerge."
John F. Neuffer, an American at Mitsui Marine Research Institute in Tokyo, noted that people have a tendency to think that the boom will never end when times are good, or, conversely, that the bust will never end when times are bad. The message from Asia's experience, he said, is this: "Beware complacency."
"The Japanese don't see the light at the end of the tunnel, and Americans don't see they cliff they may walk over," he warned.
Still, while there are some parallels between the exuberance in America today and that of Japan a decade ago, experts in Asia point to some important differences.
"I think the U.S. situation is much more balanced than the one in Japan was," said Peter J. Morgan, an economist in Tokyo for HSBC Securities. In particular, he noted that the United States boom does not rest on a speculative bubble of overpriced real estate as happened in Japan, where the Imperial Palace grounds in Tokyo in the late 1980's were said to be theoretically worth more than all of California.
From the vantage point of Asia, economists also emphasize that the pendulum in favor of American economic growth did not swing on its own; rather, the United States genuinely restructured in important ways since the doom-and-gloom talk of the 1980's. The United States has worked to eliminate its budget deficit, deregulated broad areas of the economy, cut tax rates and nurtured a new industry in information technology that is the envy of the world.
"Market capitalism certainly had its defects, but a number of them were addressed during the 70's and 80's," said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist of Morgan Stanley in Tokyo.
Some analysts suggest that one lesson of the Asian economic mess -- and of America's difficulties a decade ago -- may be how easy it is to come up with myriad explanations for why a trend is likely to continue. A decade ago, experts were full of intelligent-sounding explanations for why Japan was going to bury the United States, and now there are an equal number of intelligent-sounding explanations about why Japan is finished.
What is especially dizzying is that precisely the same factors that were cited then as fundamental American weaknesses are now viewed as strengths.
Now almost everyone believes that the great American advantage is the flexibility of its businesses and the lack of Government intervention in the economy. But Ezra Vogel, long one of America's most distinguished experts on Asia, reflected a widespread view when in 1985 he hailed "the superior flexibility of Japanese institutions, coordinated by government, to adapt more quickly to new opportunities."
Back then, industrial planning was the rage, and it was America that was considered inflexible.
"The recent progress achieved by Japan and several European countries, and America's relative decline, require no convoluted explanations," declared Robert B. Reich, then a Harvard professor and later Secretary of Labor, in a 1980's book praising industrial planning. "For largely historical reasons these countries are organized for economic adaptation. And for largely historical reasons, America is not."
Likewise, the main problem Japan now faces -- by its own reckoning and that of American analysts -- is dismal bank oversight and a mountain of bad debts. But in 1989, Harvard Business Review hailed Japan's financial regulators as "unsurpassed" and extolled Japanese banks for their "high-quality assets."
One message may be that when an economy is booming along, there is a tendency to give a bit too much credit to the brilliance of its economic and social structures. More broadly, many analysts say that an essential lesson for America from Asia's experience is not to spend too much time patting one's own back.
Thomas S. Foley, the former House Speaker who is now Ambassador to Japan, mused: "I'm worried a trifle that this kind of mild triumphalism that we have in the United States about our economy -- you know, the model of the world now, we're going up and up and up -- may benefit from the biblical injunction that pride goeth before the fall."

HEADLINE: CASINOS INCREASE THEIR DONATIONS TO U.S. CAMPAIGNS

BYLINE: By BRETT PULLEY 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., March 20

 BODY:
Confronted by a rising concern about the pervasive growth of casinos and by the threat that a national commission studying gambling could recommend new regulations and taxes, casino operators and other gambling interests have more than quadrupled their contributions to Federal candidates and political parties since 1991.
Over the last decade, finding a place to make a legal wager has become as easy as buying a beer. And though Las Vegas is still the center of growth, so many states turned to gambling during tough fiscal times in the 1980's that the gambling industry could begin to rival the tobacco industry in political influence. 
 As gambling revenues have grown, the industry has increased its donations to Democrats and Republicans alike. According to an analysis conducted for The New York Times by the Campaign Study Group, a research company in Springfield, Va., casino interests donated $7 million to campaign war chests in 1995 and 1996, more than four times the $1.7 million they contributed in 1991 and 1992. In 1993 and 1994, they gave $3.3 million.
The industry has also spent more than $13.5 million on lobbying since January 1996, the analysis found.
The increase in support for politicians came as grass-roots groups opposed to gambling were rallying to defeat local measures on new casinos and as Congress was considering passage of the legislation that established the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, which is looking at the social and economic impact of gambling.
"Most politicians in both parties are receiving huge donations from gambling interests," said James C. Dobson, a member of the national commission and president of Focus on the Family, a nonprofit organization in Colorado that opposes legalized gambling. "It's an effort to gain Access and influence."
The rising importance of the casino industry as a source for campaign money was fully evident here on Thursday night, when Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, joined other Democratic leaders in sponsoring a reception at Harrah's casino to raise money for their party's Congressional candidates.
The fund-raiser, which was timed to coincide with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention here this week, was attended by casino executives who paid $5,000 each to sip wine and hear brief remarks from Mr. Gephardt, as well as Representative Martin Frost of Texas, the chairman of the party's Congressional campaign committee, and Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the finance chairman of the committee.
The event was closed to the press, and the guests gathered inside a cavernous Italian restaurant that sits among seemingly endless rows of slot machines inside the casino.
"We had been wanting to come out here for an event for a long time," said Matt Angle, the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington, which was expected to raise more than $100,000 from the reception.
"With a lot of members in town for the convention, this was a good opportunity," Mr. Angle said.
Since 1991, the earliest year analyzed, gambling interests have donated $13.7 million to the Democratic and Republican National Committees, other party committees and the campaign coffers of candidates running for Federal offices.
"As the gaming industry has grown, Federal issues have more impact on us," said Alan Feldman, a spokesman for Mirage Resorts, a casino company in Las Vegas whose chairman, Stephen A. Wynn, has been one of the most prodigious political fund-raisers and contributors in the industry. "The Federal Government has turned on to gaming, with an eye on taxing or regulations."
The amount contributed by gambling interests over the last seven years is about half of what the tobacco industry donated in the same period.
Although tobacco manufacturers have been pushing for the enactment of legislation that would shield them from future lawsuits by smokers, casino companies want nothing more than to be left alone by the Federal Government. As a result, they hedge their bets, putting equally large sums on Republican and Democratic candidates.
In the 1996 Presidential race, for example, Mr. Wynn personally raised more than a million dollars for Bob Dole's candidacy, only to later aid in raising money for President Clinton. Also underscoring the industry's pragmatic approach to campaign giving, the Democratic National Committee received $1.7 million from casino interests in 1996, while the Republican National Committee received $1 million. And of the total amount donated by casino interests since 1991, Democrats received $7.6 million, while Republicans took in $6.1 million.
"They were just covering their bets," said Tom Grey, executive director of the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, a nonprofit group. "At the Federal level, they just want to be protected."
Mr. Grey predicted that the industry's increasing campaign largess would make it more of a target for criticism from anti-gambling organizations like his. "The more money they spend the easier it is for us to point out their money and muscle," he said. "It's going to be like tobacco."
Casino operators have been successful at advancing their interests. Congress ultimately went forward with its plan to convene the gambling commission, but not before casino industry supporters in Congress had significantly narrowed the panel's subpoena power, and had changed the language in the bill to make the commission's official mandate less antagonistic toward the industry.
Moreover, the industry's supporters were able to get casino insiders appointed to the panel. Terrence Lanni, the chief executive of the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, is one of the commission's nine members. (He was among those on the guest list at Thursday night's Democratic fund-raiser.) The commission, which held hearings this week in Boston, is expected to complete its study in June 1999 and make recommendations to Congress at that time.
Also, a proposal floated by the Clinton Administration in 1994 that would have imposed a 4 percent tax on gambling revenues to help pay for welfare reform was quickly abandoned when casino operators sent their Congressional allies to appeal to the White House. The prospect that the gambling commission might recommend imposing a Federal tax on casinos lingers, though many people in the industry now think it is unlikely.
The total amount that Democrats have received from gambling interests has been largely enhanced by contributions from Native American tribes, which in 1996 alone donated $1.3 million to Democratic candidates and organizations, compared with $182,196 they contributed to Republicans that year.
For example, since 1991, the Mashantucket Pequot tribe, the owners of Connecticut's Foxwoods casino, has donated $203,525 to Republican committees but has given $812,675 to the Democrats. Most of that money was intended to help Mr. Clinton's candidacy. The Native American casinos must answer to the Administration's Department of Interior on issues concerning their reservation gambling operations.
The major casino corporations, on the other hand, have tended to bet only slightly in favor of Republicans. Between 1991 and 1997, $5.7 million was contributed to the Republican Party by casinos other than those on Indian reservations, while $5.2 million went to the Democratic Party.
The analysis done for The Times found that the American Gaming Association, the industry's trade group in Washington, has spent $1.6 million on lobbying over the last two years, making it the second largest gambling lobbying group. The association's chairman, Frank Fahrenkopf, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, attended Thursday night's fund-raiser. The Mississippi band of the Choctaw Indians, which runs the Silver Star Resort and Casino near Philadelphia, Miss., was the top lobbying group, spending $1.8 million.
The top individual recipients of gambling dollars were mostly politicians from Nevada and New Jersey, the states with the largest casino revenues. Representative John Ensign, Republican of Nevada, ranked first in contributions from gambling interests, with $363,500. The top Democratic recipient was Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, with $298,692. New Jersey's top recipient was Representative Frank A. LoBiondo, a Republican who received $82,750.
In what is expected to be a tight contest, Mr. Ensign and Mr. Reid are facing each other in a Nevada Senate race this year, and casino interests are likely to show a keen interest.
"I think you're going to see a lot of the major casinos in Nevada committing to both of these men," Mr. Feldman, the Mirage Resorts spokesman, said.
Beyond Nevada, the top recipient of money from gambling interests was Mr. Gephardt, whose campaigns and political action committee received $121,895. Mr. Gephardt has been an enthusiastic supporter of the gambling industry since 1994, when voters in Missouri elected to open the state to riverboat casinos. "He's been a supporter and will continue to be a supporter," said Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gephardt. "The gaming industry has been a net positive for our state."
So far, there is little evidence that politicians are suffering any significant backlash from voters for taking donations from casinos.
Gambling is an issue of increasing concern for social conservatives, however, and Republican politicians could eventually find it more difficult to balance their need to appeal to their conservative base with their desire to accept the casino industry's largess.
Some fierce opponents of gambling, like Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, have appealed to party leaders to stop accepting casino donations, but with little result.
As Alex Pratt, a spokeswoman for Senator Fred Thompson, said, "It's never been any sort of a controversy." Mr. Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, has received $26,750 from casino interests since 1991, ranking him 14th among Republican recipients.
Clearly dismayed by the widespread willingness of politicians to take money from gambling interests, Mr. Dobson, the Focus on the Family president, noted that political leaders like Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, had been actively involved in raising campaign money from gambling interests for party organizations.
"I have seen no evidence whatsoever that they're embarrassed by it," Mr. Dobson said.

HEADLINE: As Jordan's Troubles Grow, Uneasy Lies Its Crown

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan

 BODY:
These are uneasy times in Jordan.
As most people see it, the peace that King Hussein signed four years ago with Israel has brought no tangible gain. 
 Instead of getting better, the economy has turned worse. The Government is less tolerant of dissent. A sense of crisis endures in neighboring Iraq, and Jordanians fear they may somehow pay the price.
And by many accounts, the gap between public opinion and public policy is growing, with the boldest of critics finding resonance in attacks increasingly directed at King Hussein himself.
"Today if you talk about the opposition, you don't exclude a group -- especially the center," said Radwan Abdullah, a political scientist.
The King has ruled Jordan for nearly 45 years with a patriarchal touch that has earned him wide affection. There is no sign that his regime is in any danger. But even some close allies suggest that this is a period of strain.
"It seems to me that his style is changing," said Layla Sharaf, a member of Jordan's appointed Senate. "He has so much on his mind that his contact with people is taking on a different shape: it has become a little more remote. And people have trouble dealing with that new remoter style."
Throughout his reign, the King has frequently relied on magnanimity to defang his opponents. In the 1950's, people who plotted against him became Cabinet ministers. In the last six years, he has twice pardoned an outspoken critic, Leith Shebalit, after Mr. Shebalit's conviction for crimes against the state. The second time, in November 1996, the King drove Mr. Shebalit home from prison in the royal Mercedes.
But in the current environment, magnanimity has not worked. Mr. Shebalit, 50, a former Member of Parliament who until recently led the engineers' union, renewed his harsh attacks, and angered the Government in January when he went to Iraq to take custody of 79 Jordanians who had been detained by Iraq.
Now Mr. Shebalit is behind bars again after a speech in which, Jordanian officials say, he called the Government "Zionist" and falsely declared that Jordanian troops were preparing to join an American-led attack on Iraq. Two days of rioting followed in Maan, the southern town where the speech was delivered, and Mr. Shebalit has been charged not only with inciting the riots but also with slandering the King.
In the last year, the Government has pushed through a tough law restricting press freedom, and Islamic parties boycotted parliamentary elections they charged were unfair.
Such events have contributed to an environment in which many people regard Mr. Shebalit as a voice of courage. And while he has no real constituency, Jordanians say the admiration he has won reflects popular frustration.
"Leith Shebalit is harmless," said Khaldun A. Abuhassan, chairman of the Amman Chamber of Industry. "But what I'm really scared of is the next step, which would be extremism."
Jordanians generally direct their bitterest complaints at the Government, which is led by a Prime Minister appointed by the King and which is responsible for day-to-day affairs. Since 1990 the Government has changed nine times. But the King's role in promoting peace with Israel has altered that dynamic, leaving him more vulnerable to criticism.
So deep is the discontent about what peace has brought that a number of leading Jordanians say they have begun to dare to hope that the King might abandon the path he chose four years ago when he signed the accord with the neighbor they had known only as a foe.
Jordanian officials and Western diplomats say they are confident that the King's commitment to the peace accord with Israel is absolute. But they say the combination of a troubled economy, problems on two borders and increased restrictions on public expression mean that little is likely to relieve the internal pressure any time soon.
"What people tell me is: 'It seems like every time we begin to get our heads above water -- wham! -- we get hit by something else,' " a senior Western diplomat said.
Though Parliament endorsed the 1994 accord with Israel, the agreement probably never had the support of more than a small minority of Jordanians, and many people say faith in it is at an all-time low.
The harshest blow to that faith was undoubtedly dealt by the assassination attempt on a Hamas leader by Israeli agents last fall on the streets of Amman, the capital. The incident left King Hussein so angry that he refused to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he flew here on a mission of contrition.
On several occasions the King has vented his deep frustration about the policies adopted by Mr. Netanyahu and his Government. People who have met with the King recently say his impatience has been compounded by an infection of the lymph nodes that he has been battling for months, which they say has made him more conscious that an imperfect peace would diminish his legacy.
But the King has continued to say that he sees no option but to give Israel a chance. And that message increasingly runs counter to the prevailing public view that the breakdown in talks between Israel and the Palestinians has proved that the Israelis cannot be trusted.
A lack of progress in economic ties between Israel and Jordan has meant that Jordanians have tasted little of the fruit that King Hussein and others suggested peace would bear. Even the Foreign Minister, Jawad Anani, said in an interview: "The failure of the peace process has become a liability. I can say that if I knew then what I know now, I would not have moved forward with the peace process on economic grounds, because it created expectations that we could not meet."
Those disappointments have added to disillusionment caused by widening gaps between rich and poor and an overall decline in the standard of living.
To reschedule the country's crushing international debt, Jordan has had to follow an International Monetary Fund program that has reduced subsidies and frozen salaries, and now Amman must begin to cut into a Government payroll that still accounts for nearly 50 percent of the work force, adding to unemployment that private experts estimate is approaching 30 percent.
The other reason for discontent lies in Jordan's complicated -- and evolving -- relationship with Iraq.
Jordan is still paying an economic price for its stance during the Persian Gulf war, when public sympathy lay overwhelmingly with Iraq. King Hussein kept out of the American-led coalition that drove Iraqi forces from Kuwait, and in revenge gulf countries cut off aid and oil supplies to Jordan and sent home 300,000 Jordanian workers, a major source of foreign exchange.
In recent years King Hussein has seemed to have shifted course, even suggesting in 1995 that he favored a change in the Iraqi rulership. But that has unsettled Jordanians who saw that stance as an indication that he had become too closely aligned with American policy.
The King steered a cautious course in the latest crisis, never embracing American threats to use military force against Iraq. Since the threat of imminent conflict has passed, he has argued that the United States ought to move toward direct talks with Iraq -- an argument rejected by the White House.
But throughout the crisis, he sounded less vehement in his public opposition to American policy than other Arab leaders and that was noticed by Jordanians, who remain sympathetic toward Iraq.
Many people express particular dismay at the prohibition imposed during the crisis on demonstrations in support of Iraq -- and at the Government's decision to respond with a heavy hand when protests did break out. Troops and armored personnel carriers were dispatched to suppress the rioting in Maan, a town of 30,000, then maintained a weeklong curfew, arresting dozens of people, closing schools and businesses, and cutting telephone lines.
And King Hussein himself traveled to the scene, where he spoke scathingly about the "ungrateful" people behind the protests -- apparently a reference to Mr. Shebalit.
"They are using a big hammer to hit a fly," said Ahmed Obeidat, a former Prime Minister. "The Jordanians in general are moderate, but the Government and the police are leaving no room for moderation. They are cornering the people day by day."

HEADLINE: Investing in Future, States Spend More on Preschool Classes

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, March 21

 BODY:
State lawmakers across the country are beginning to recognize what first-grade teachers like Roseann DeLuca have long known: Children who attend full-day kindergarten and preschool are far better prepared to succeed in school than those who do not.
"They seem more ready to learn to read," said Ms. DeLuca, who has taught first grade for 10 years in Perth Amboy, N.J. "They are more verbal -- not all of them, but the majority of them. I would say that they are used to the school routine. It is very important, otherwise you spend your time teaching that." 
 With one study after another showing the benefits of early childhood education, a growing number of states are creating and expanding school programs for 4-year-olds.
In the last year alone, New York, Connecticut and New Jersey have begun spending tens of millions of dollars to make more preschool and full-day kindergarten programs available.
New York is providing $50 million in state aid to help school districts with the most low-income children, including New York City, make more preschool slots available to 4-year-olds beginning in September. Legislation adopted last year would eventually require all school districts to provide half-day prekindergarten classes, regardless of income, within four years. State aid would then rise to about $500 million annually.
New Jersey and Connecticut, like most states, are targeting school districts with large numbers of children from low-income families. But New Jersey's State Supreme Court is considering whether to require the state to expand its half-day program for 4-year-olds to full-day preschool for children ages 3 and 4.
At least 33 states are now spending some state dollars on preschool programs, with about two dozen substantially increasing such spending in recent years. Most programs focus on children from low-income families.
In Connecticut, House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, a Democrat from Hartford, said he became convinced that increasing spending to put children from low-income families in preschool would save taxpayers millions of dollars over the long run.
"I did not come into this as an early childhood expert or advocate," said Mr. Ritter, who pushed through the legislation. "But it was clear from study after study that every dollar you spend now saves seven dollars down the road. And it levels the playing field for children and gives them an opportunity to succeed."
He pointed out that most children from higher income families attend preschool. The most recent Federal study shows that three quarters of the children age 3 to 5 from households with more than $50,000 in income were enrolled in prekindergarten programs, compared with 45 percent of children from families with incomes below $30,000.
Connecticut has outlined the most ambitious agenda for children from low-income families by seeking to provide full-day, year-round programs for 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds. The state will spend about $86 million over the next two years in 14 mostly urban school districts with the expectation that spending will double in five years.
Instead of giving the money to school districts, the state is asking municipalities to design and oversee the programs with newly created advisory councils. The state is encouraging local governments to make grants to existing nursery schools, day-care centers, and community-based organizations, like Head Start, rather than to add classrooms in already crowded school buildings. The legislation also provides extra money for child care subsidies to help working low-income families and tax-exempt financing to help child care centers expand to accommodate more children.
The Federal Head Start program has been providing early childhood education to help children overcome the disadvantages of poverty for almost 30 years. But there are only enough Federal dollars to provide services to 40 percent of eligible children.
That is the gap some states are trying to fill. Some, like Ohio, are using state dollars to expand Head Start programs. Others, like Kentucky, are trying to reach more children from low-income families by offering prekindergarten to children who would qualify for the Federal free-lunch program.
The most comprehensive effort has been made in Georgia, where Gov. Zell Miller and state lawmakers are spending $211 million in state lottery funds this year to offer full-day, preschool programs to 75,000 4-year-olds, regardless of family income. The state first began concentrating on children from lower income families in 1992 and made preschool programs available to all 4-year-olds within the last three years.
The state has begun studies to measure the impact of prekindergarten programs on school performance in later years, said Pam Shapiro, deputy director of the Office of School Readiness, which was created to oversee the implementation of Georgia's preschool program. She said that smaller studies of children considered to be at greater risk of failing in school had already shown promising results. When the children reached first grade, she said, they outscored the control group on every measure, and scored above the national average on reading and math. "That is fairly significant because they were all at-risk children," she said.
Despite the new commitment by states to invest in prekindergarten programs, there are limitations in the services that most states are willing to offer.
New York and New Jersey are investing only enough money for half-day preschool programs, not for extended day care and other services. Experts in early childhood education worry that half-day programs are not as much help to working families and to parents moving into the workforce to meet requirements for Federal welfare benefits.
"I am glad to see what the states are doing," said Edward Zigler, director of Yale University's Bush Center in Child Development and Social Policy. "But here is the problem. We have all these women in the workforce. To educators, a full day is to 3 P.M. To a working father or a working mother, a full day is 5:30 P.M. or 6 P.M."
In New Jersey, the state began distributing $286 million this year to 125 school districts where at least 20 percent of students qualify for the Federal free lunch program. The money is to be used to provide half-day preschool and full-day kindergarten programs. The legislation requires school districts to have their programs operating by September 2001.
But the legislation, adopted to meet the demands of the New Jersey State Supreme Court that the state end the spending disparity between the state's richest and poorest districts, may not have gone far enough for the state's highest court.
The state's Supreme Court is now considering whether to order New Jersey to pay for full-day preschool programs for all 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds in the 28 poorest districts.
In January, Judge Michael Patrick King of the Appellate Division of Superior Court, appointed by the Supreme Court to make recommendations in this area, concluded that the state should provide full-day preschool programs for children ages 3 and 4. He estimated that it would cost the state $148 million more than what state officials say they are now willing to spend.
But the administration of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is strenuously arguing against Judge King's recommendation, pointing out that the State Constitution only requires New Jersey to provide educational programs for children between the ages of 5 and 18. The Whitman administration contends that the court would be overstepping its authority by requiring full-day preschool programs. They argue that the half-day program for 4-year-olds is sufficient.
Steven W. Barnett, a professor of economics at Rutgers University's Graduate School of Education, said that it is not that half-day preschool programs don't work. "When you compare them to the more intensive full-day programs, they don't work as well," he said.
In New York City, the Schools Chancellor, Rudy Crew, has expressed concern that the new state aid for half-day preschool programs is not enough to meet the needs of all eligible children. The state per-pupil expenditure for city children in prekindergarten is $2,300, far below what other states, including Connecticut and New Jersey, expect to spend.
There are now 14,690 city children from low-income families enrolled in preschool programs under a state-financed "experimental" prekindergarten program that began more than 20 years ago.
An additional 16,000 children are supposed to be served beginning in September with the extra state aid. The Board of Education will open the program first to children who meet certain income eligibility requirements or who have other needs that might put them at risk of failing in school, such as children from non-English-speaking households. Within four years, the Board of Education needs to come up with enough seats in preschool programs for about 75,000 children annually.

HEADLINE: Africa Enduring Rebirth Awaits Clinton's Arrival

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ABUJA, Nigeria, March 21

 BODY:
On Sunday, when President Clinton begins the longest foreign trip of his Presidency, a 12-day visit to sub-Saharan Africa, he will be touring a region very different from the one last traveled by an American President when Jimmy Carter came to this country 20 years ago.
Back then Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, was one of the few to have experimented with democratic politics. There was no hint to an end of apartheid in South Africa. And politically, Africa was distinguished mostly by dictatorial rule and economic disaster. 
 Today, military-ruled Nigeria, where Mr. Clinton is pointedly not stopping but where Pope John Paul II began a visit today, stands out as one of a dwindling number of countries whose leaders were not elected. The anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela is completing his first term as President of South Africa's new nonracial democracy.
And in place of the ruin that was prevalent throughout Africa as recently as a decade ago, reforms have bolstered a continent-wide economic expansion to an estimated 4 percent annual growth this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Thus, for the first time, Africa's growth rate has been lifted above its rate of population increase.
Mr. Clinton's trip will take him to six countries -- Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, Botswana and Senegal. In his planned series of speeches and public appearances, he will be emphasizing the positive changes that have swept Africa.
One clear aim will be to persuade an American audience with few notions of the continent that Africa not only exists but matters. But to his hosts, as well as to the public back home, Mr. Clinton will also be emphasizing a point just as important as the positive changes: Where Africa is concerned, the United States has changed dramatically as well.
Through recent African visits by other senior Administration figures -- Vice President Al Gore, two Secretaries of State and Hillary Rodham Clinton -- the President's themes for this trip have been gestating, going through public auditions all the while.
Rhetorically the expected watchwords -- mutual respect, shared economic interests and deep veins of common history -- all mark a substantial, even dramatic, break with a past in which Africa was rarely treated seriously by the world's most powerful nation.
Indeed, Africans have often complained that when their continent was dealt with at all, it was as a sideshow in America's cold war competition, or as a relief response to disaster.
"Clinton's visit is dealing mostly in symbols, but symbolism is sometimes very important," said Donald McHenry, who was the United States representative to the United Nations during the Carter Administration. "The focus that President Clinton brings to this trip will be critical in terms of bringing the problems and progress of Africa into a new focus for the American people."
But if the chosen themes have been emerging for some time, even in the final days of preparation there have been signs of shifting emphasis.
"If this trip is simply a collection of set pieces filled with easy slogans," said Richard Joseph, an Africa scholar at Emory University in Atlanta, "the President will have wasted a tremendous opportunity to seriously engage Africa. There has got to be more to it than that, and the African audiences have to sense that Clinton's mind is engaged with the continent, and that there will be some follow-through."
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright has already been working hard to dispel such concerns, saying Washington is not "blowing smoke" with its stated intention to upgrade relations with Africa.
Perhaps with such ideas in mind, Mr. Clinton reportedly added Rwanda to an itinerary deliberately studded with upbeat story lines. The decision seemed to defer to East African leaders who felt that a visit to their region would be incomplete without some attempt to address the 1994 genocide of more than 500,000 Rwandan Tutsi.
And as for Congo, which the President will not tour but which Ms. Albright visited in December, Washington has suddenly sharpened its remarks about the autocratic leadership style of the new President, Laurent Kabila.
Mr. Clinton will meet him, along with other East African leaders, in Uganda on the second leg of his trip. And Ms. Albright's recent criticisms of Mr. Kabila appear aimed, at least in part, at pre-empting the kind of reproof she received from international rights groups and others for appearing to anoint Mr. Kabila as a member of a "new generation" of promising African leaders.
Sub-Saharan Africa's three largest countries -- Congo, Nigeria and the Sudan -- are also the three most notable absentees from Mr. Clinton's itinerary -- all because of what Washington regards as glaring violations of democratic principles.
And recently, Washington's strongest language about Africa has concerned Nigeria, one of its leading suppliers of petroleum, which has long been under military rule.
The Assistant Secretary of State for African affairs, Susan Rice, recently broke the silence about the country, issuing an unusually sharp warning to its leader, General Sani Abacha.
"Let me state clearly and unequivocally to you," she said last week, "that an electoral victory by any military candidate in the forthcoming presidential elections would be unacceptable. Nigeria needs and deserves a real transition to democracy and civilian rule."

HEADLINE: A New Baseball Strategy: Latin-American Bargains

SERIES: DIGGING FOR DIAMONDS: First of two articles.

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Sandy Alomar Jr. hits a home run that wins last summer's All-Star Game. Edgar Renteria drives in the winning run in the 11th inning of the seventh game of the World Series last October. Pedro Martinez is voted the National League's best pitcher for 1997, later becoming the highest-paid player in baseball history.
Baseball has long had its share of Latin players, even stars, but the recent dominance of an increasing number of Latin players has led the sport to redirect its search for future talent. 
 Teams are mining the fields of Latin America, from San Pedro de Macoris in the Dominican Republic to Maracaibo in Venezuela, in a hunt for teen-age players that is driven by two facts: the talent in this country is dwindling, and the cost of signing American players is skyrocketing.
Players from outside the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada are not subject to the amateur draft and can typically be signed for a fraction of the cost of American players. Already, there are twice as many Latin American players in the major leagues as there were 20 years ago -- 184 or 16 percent of all major leaguers.
Thus baseball, not unlike other industries looking to foreign countries for a cheaper way of doing business, is embarked on an effort that could fundamentally alter both the economics and the face of the game.
For the first time, all 30 clubs have development personnel in the Dominican Republic -- from a single scout to sophisticated training academies -- and roughly half have similar operations in Venezuela. Clubs have also engaged in blanket signings, writing checks for dozens of young players for as little as $2,000 each. And the Baltimore Orioles, in a move of strategy and symbolism, have shifted several scouts from New England to the Dominican Republic and Venezuela. The Dominican Republic's 88 current major leaguers outnumber those from any other foreign country and place it second only to California as a producer of major leaguers.
But the sport's aggressive foray into Latin America has also provoked a range of policy violations and concerns. Players as young as 14 are lying about their ages in order to sign contracts, sometimes with the complicity of the clubs. The often tiny bonuses given to young Latin players have produced cries of exploitation. Eager for their own cut, American agents have moved in to negotiate better deals for the players, and in the process have angered local Latin officials who believe they threaten a thriving, if imperfect, baseball economy.
Cuba, too, is producing players for the majors, although their route to professional American baseball is far different and dangerous. This past week, air, land and sea searches were conducted for four Cuban players and a coach who left Cuba in a small boat on March 10, apparently in hopes of joining countrymen who have signed lucrative contracts in recent years.
"There are players there and we want to get the best players," said Randy Smith, the general manager of the Detroit Tigers. "Baseball is still the No. 1 sport in those countries. Baseball is, unfortunately, not the No. 1 sport in the U.S."
Pablo Peguero, general manager of the Dominican baseball academy owned by the Los Angeles Dodgers, said cost savings were as appealing as the talent.
"Everybody, as a matter of standard business practice, tries to make as small an investment as possible," Peguero said. "Some companies make shoes or electrical appliances or clothes. It's not just baseball. But I'll tell you, the best raw material anywhere in the world is here in the Dominican Republic."
 
A Rich Environment
Players May Be Raw, But They Are Willing
In the Dominican Republic, baseball is a part of life's fabric. Children play it with cardboard gloves in sugar cane fields. Those who make it to the big leagues are followed as heroes, and the riches they reap are dreamed of by aspiring shortstops and pitchers. A home run against an archrival in a local tournament can move fans in the ramshackle stands to pass money to the player through the chain-link fence by the dugout.
"You can't go past any open space there without seeing kids playing, even if it's with a broomstick and a ball wrapped with tape," Sandy Johnson, an official with the Arizona Diamondbacks, said of the Dominican Republic. "It's probably like the 20's and 30's and 40's in the United States."
That environment generates a dynamic for producing players who the officials find lacking in the United States. Increasing numbers of the talented young athletes in this country, the officials say, are choosing basketball, football or something else.
"I haven't seen a Dominican player on a skateboard yet," said Doug Melvin, general manager of the Texas Rangers.
Thus baseball has set up shop in the Dominican to purchase and develop these players. Venezuela and the Dominican Republic are filled with academies -- complexes with dormitories -- although some are of greater quality than others. For $250,000 to $500,000 annually, teams with academies can develop youngsters into major leaguers, working on their skills, the English language and North American cultures.
The Los Angeles Dodgers operate the most successful Latin academy, a 70-acre facility known as Campo Las Palmas in Guerra, just outside of Santo Domingo. Roughly 100 players live at the complex, which has two full-size fields, two practice fields, batting cages, exercise machines, dormitories and a spacious dining room. Peguero said 13 percent of the youngsters who have come through the academy have reached the major leagues, including the Dodgers' Ramon Martinez and Raul Mondesi.
But organizations get by with much more bare-bones operations. At the St. Louis Cardinals' facility, the accommodations are spartan and players sleep on beds that rest on cinder blocks. Still, applicants, weighing the conditions against working in sugar cane fields or selling cookies on the street corner, flood the facilities.
"If there's no competition for a player, you don't have to pay him," said Chuck LaMar, general manager of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. "A kid in the U.S. has options. He can go to a two-year college or a four-year college or he can sign. The more options a kid has the more money you have to pay him."
Still, there are scores of Americans, either undrafted or taken in the later rounds, who sign for four-figure bonuses, too.
The youngsters in Latin countries who are talented enough to sign a contract can live well on the roughly $850 a month they earn as prospects. Others, who technically can only remain in the facilities for 30 days if they are not signed to a contract, make the best of it. Pedro Osuna, a young shortstop at the Cardinals' camp, laid out the equation bluntly. "Here you get to eat every day," he said. "That's not always the case at home."
Candida Leonardo is the mother of Raul Pimentel, a 19-year-old infielder in the St. Louis organization who signed for $2,000 two years ago but has yet to advance to the American minor leagues. A cook at the baseball school, Leonardo raised her son for the sport.
"Ever since he was 7 years old, his entire formation has been shaped on the playing field," she said. "I've never allowed him to do anything else. He dropped out of school after sixth grade, but I've never been after him to get a job. Baseball has been his entire upbringing."
For the clubs, the training facilities, in addition to providing a financially practical way of developing hundreds of players a year, are vital because even many of the most gifted Dominican players suffer from a lack of proper nutrition and a shortage of fundamental skills.
"You're taking these kids on as raw material," said Omar Minaya, a former Dominican scout who, as assistant general manager for the Mets, is the highest-ranking Latin American executive in baseball. "You have to invest money in teaching them how to run, the proper way to throw, plays to make."
The difficulty, then, in being able to accurately predict a Dominican player's long-term potential places an added premium on signing lots of players at low prices. Mel Rojas, a $4.5 million-a-year relief pitcher for the Mets, had only a 78-mile-an-hour fastball when he signed as a youth. "He never would have been signed in the U.S. throwing 78," Minaya said.
The best of the Latin prospects, even those signed at 16, can be sent to play in low-level minor leagues in the United States soon after they are under contract. Others can remain in their countries playing in summer leagues for several years before they are promoted or let go.
The move to sign scores of young Latin players has raised questions about whether they risk greater incidence of injury. Major League Baseball is concerned enough, said Bill Murray, the sport's director of operations, that it has begun a long-term study of patterns in how Latin players have fared in recent years.
And thus it remains to be seen how much the clubs will be willing to invest in a fuller cultivation and protection of their prospects.
"I believe it's imperative to have a program on the personal development side," said Sal Artiaga, who works for the Chicago White Sox as the only coordinator of cultural development in baseball. "We have to prepare a kid with linguistic skills and survival skills as well as personal development. The industry has to adopt a program."
For now, though, baseball will continue to grab as much talent as it can in Latin America. Tampa's Chuck LaMar said, "You're going to see more and more money spent by major league organizations in the scouting and developing of those players."
 
Discount Shopping
Is It Opportunity Or Exploitation?
Money is at the root of the pursuit of foreign talent -- a drive that has taken scouts to Asia and Australia, but that is most intensely focused on Latin America. Some clubs, such as the Dodgers and the Toronto Blue Jays, have been a presence in Latin countries for years, but others began heading there after deciding they were spending too much money for too little return.
The average cost of signing a first-round draft choice -- American, Canadian or Puerto Rican players tend to be represented by agents -- has increased sevenfold since 1989. The player who cost $170,000 to sign in 1989 now costs $1.3 million. Under the draft, instituted in 1966, teams cannot sign players until they graduate high school when they are 17 or 18 years old.
The American investments can wind up busts. For example, the top three picks in the 1991 draft of amateur players cost the Yankees (Brien Taylor), the Atlanta Braves (Mike Kelly) and the Minnesota Twins (David McCarty) a total of $2.52 million for players who either haven't played in the majors or have performed unimpressively.
In places like the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, with players not subject to the draft, players can be signed as young as 16, and almost all lack any kind of representation beyond a family member.
"People realize that for the same amount of money they're signing a first-round pick here, they could sign virtually a hundred players or 50 players and bring them to their complexes in the Dominican and develop them inexpensively," said Fernando Cuza, an agent, whose Chicago firm hired him to represent professional Latin players.
The dividends of such wholesale signings can be striking. A year ago the Baltimore Orioles had seven young Dominican players on their 40-man roster who cost them a total of $7,000 to sign. One pitcher, Armando Benitez, could be the team's No. 1 reliever this year. More recently, the Colorado Rockies signed eight Dominican teen-agers for bonuses ranging from $4,000 to $20,000. One of them, 17-year-old David Martinez, received $17,000. He said his father earns $2,500 a year fixing air conditioners and iceboxes.
The reach into Latin America, modestly under way for years, is changing who Americans see playing at the ball parks. The 184 Latin Americans who played in the major leagues last season was a record, and one in five players on baseball's 40-man team rosters this spring is Latin American.
Gerry Hunsicker, the Houston Astros' general manager, said Latin America is especially important for small-market clubs. In 1989, the Astros became the first club to build a training academy in Venezuela. "We're at the point where it's almost prohibitive to participate in the United States draft," he said. "For what we'll spend on one high draft pick here, we can run our academy and sign 10 to 12 players a year."
Of course, not all Latin players can be had cheaply, either because their talent is so obvious or because they have enlisted agents or family members who themselves are major leaguers.
Jackson Melian, a Venezuelan outfielder who now plays at the second-lowest level of the minor leagues, received a record bonus of $1.6 million when he signed with the Yankees as a 16-year-old in 1996. Two Dominican youngsters, Ricardo Aramboles and Josephang Bernhardt, who were declared free agents after it was found that they initially had signed before they were 16, recently received $1.52 million and $1.1 million, respectively, from the Yankees and Blue Jays. Both will play in a rookie league or low minor league this year. In Panama, Omar Moreno Jr., son of the former major leaguer, signed last year for $900,000 with the Dodgers and will play in an American rookie league this year.
But the prevailing experience for the young Latin players is much more modest, and they typically receive bonuses of $2,000 to $30,000.
Robert Pepen, who will get his first crack at American minor league experience this summer, signed with the Mets in 1996 when he was 17 for $7,500. Rafael Gomez, a 20-year-old pitcher whom the Mets signed for $2,000 when he was 17, said he was discovered by "buscones," or bird dogs, the men who bring players to a team's scouts. The bird-dog scouts are sort of free-lance operators who roam the countryside in search of young talent to then broker to established organization officials.
"Two thousand dollars doesn't go very far," said Gomez, who will pitch in Class A ball this year. Gomez, though, said he does not feel exploited, that all he wants to do is play baseball.
Others have come to interpret that mixture of desperation and gratitude as exploitation.
"A lot of people are taking advantage of the situation," Tony Bernazard, a Puerto Rican native, a former major leaguer and an official of the players union, said. "Teams say they're giving kids an opportunity. The kid has talent, and teams are looking for talent."
One talented youngster is Martin Genao, a 19-year-old Dominican pitcher who in 1994 received $13,000 from the Dodgers.
"They exploit us like you would exploit a mine," said Genao, who is recovering from a shoulder injury. "Here you find people playing in garbage dumps, in alleyways, everywhere. That's why the supply of Dominican ballplayers will never run out."
Some baseball officials defend the small amounts paid to the young players. Sandy Alderson, president of the Oakland Athletics, said the bonuses might be exploitation to some, but "to the kids it's an opportunity."
"Let's say you have $200,000 in signing bonus money for the year," said Alderson, whose organization runs a highly regarded academy on the island. "Is society down there better off having you sign one or two kids for $200,000 or a lot of kids for $200,000?"
Other officials say signing the Latin players for any price affords the teen-agers an opportunity at wealth otherwise unimaginable. Sammy Sosa signed with the Texas Rangers in 1985 for $3,500; last year the Chicago Cubs gave him a four-year contract for $42.5 million. Pedro Martinez signed with the Dodgers in 1988 for $5,000. The Red Sox recently signed him to a six-year contract for $75 million.
"They want to get out of the island so they keep playing and they sign for practically nothing," said Howie Haak, a retired scout who made his reputation in Latin countries.
Milton Jamail, a professor of Latin American studies at the University of Texas, agreed. "Most of the players I've talked to see it as a chance to win the lottery," said Jamail, an expert on Latin baseball. "Sammy Sosa signed for next to nothing and now makes $10 million. It's worth the opportunity to get into the system."
Perhaps. But many challenges face both baseball and the Latin countries producing the players as the industry's shift plays out. In the Dominican Republic, the traffic in fraudulent birth certificates is epidemic as the youngest players try to fake being 16. Meanwhile, American agents have developed their own networks to sign young clients before they negotiate with the clubs and get them fairer deals.
For their part, major league baseball officials, as well as certain baseball officials in the Dominican Republic, wince at the prospect of more expensive deals. They fear they will lose their supply of cheaper labor, and local officials worry that, if the price for players rises, fewer will be signed, and the foundation of their baseball industry will erode.
Jose Cuello, a Dominican father whose son, a second baseman, signed with the Rockies, spoke of how appealing that local industry can be.
"He was so smitten with the organization he nearly forgot about the money," Mr. Cuello said of the recruitment of his son. He added, "The big contract is waiting for him up there in the big leagues."

Chicago's Jordan-Jackson-Pippen Triangle

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
He is becoming more vocal all the time, detailing his team's plight to anyone who will listen. Either Michael Jordan feels eternally wronged by the management of the Chicago Bulls, or he is up to something more productive, something that might lay the groundwork for his guaranteed return next season.
Something like keeping Scottie Pippen as his teammate. 
 Jordan has often said that his future in Chicago is tethered to whether Phil Jackson remains as coach. But as he keeps criticizing the desire of the owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, and the general manager, Jerry Krause, to break up the aging dynasty after this season, it is clear that he is doing more than just complaining.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity, at least three of Jordan's teammates said that he was sounding off because he wanted management to take a serious look at retaining Pippen, and that he would in fact play without Jackson as his coach.
The thinking is that the Bulls would not have a shot at winning another title without Pippen, who becomes a free agent at the end of the season. Given that Jackson is committed to taking a year off or signing a long-term deal with another team, Jordan's ill feelings toward Krause and Reinsdorf are directly related to how they have treated Pippen.
"There should never be this type of turmoil on a championship team when an organization is about to win their sixth championship," Jordan said last week. "I felt we were treated better when we hadn't won than when we won five. This organization bent over backward for us, had a better appreciation for us when we were on the verge of winning. Now we're on the verge of winning six and it's a different approach. It's a waste."
He was recently asked by a reporter from The Dallas Morning News whether he would return next season. "As for that," he replied, "you damage so much of the relationship, what's the purpose?"
It sounds as if Jordan is finished with the game again. But what if he is merely trying to siphon one more season of salary from Reinsdorf for Pippen and himself?
 
Time to Strike a Labor Deal
 With the worst-kept secret in the league about to be made public tomorrow at the Board of Governors meeting in Dallas -- the owners will vote to exercise their right to re-open the collective bargaining agreement on April 1 -- one pertinent issue remains: can the two sides work out a deal before November and prevent the league from losing any games to its first work stoppage?
"Lockout isn't part of our vocabulary right now," said Russ Granik, the league's deputy commissioner. "We've got three months to focus on putting some kind of deal together. You never know, but we have a very cordial and professional relationship with union leadership, and we'll do our best to try and maintain that."
Said Billy Hunter, the players association's executive director: "If you factor in a potential lockout, we've still got between now and October and November to work out a deal. I intend to objectively consider what's on the table."
The current agreement will not officially expire until July 1.
If a lockout is imposed, teams cannot sign free agents and the summer shopping spree is considerably shortened, at the least.
To make the deal work, the league is said to be interested in employing any strategy necessary -- a hard salary cap like the National Football League, perhaps, or limiting the amount a team can pay a single player -- that will put a ceiling on overall players salaries, so that they cannot increase at a greater percentage than league revenues.
Granik claims that 13 of the 29 teams failed to show profit last season and that 57 percent of basketball-related income is currently going to the players.
The threshold for opening the agreement was any number over 51.8 percent. With television revenues taking up a big chunk, the difference between 57 and 51.8 percent is roughly $85 million.
While the union disputes some of those figures and will point out that a 70 percent jump in television revenues next season should not equate to anyone crying poor, more than 20 of 29 teams are interested in fixing the current system.
The give-and-take process over the next few months should be intriguing, given that the league has not battled a unified players association for some time. And who knows what will become of the rookie salary scale, which has been blamed for the current haves and have-nots economic climate.
But expect both sides to compromise before the summer ends. It is not easy when a bunch of grown men who make their living off a game have to find a way to divide up millions of dollars. But Commissioner David Stern, Granik and Hunter are smart people, smarter than most baseball people who foolishly tested the patience of their consumers in 1994.
 
Duncan a Slam Dunk for Prize
 As his double-doubles keep piling up and he runs away with the rookie of the year award, Tim Duncan soon will have another honor bestowed upon him. Duncan, the No. 1 pick of the San Antonio Spurs last June, is almost a shoo-in to be named to the team for the world championships this summer, two officials with USA Basketball confirmed.
The team, which is viewed as a precursor to the team the United States will send to Sydney, Australia, for the 2000 Olympics, will compete in Athens from July 29 to Aug. 9.
If Duncan is named to the team -- two spots still remain -- he will join Grant Hill, Terrell Brandon, Gary Payton, Vin Baker, Christian Laettner, Glen Rice, Allan Houston, Chris Webber, Tom Gugliotta and Kevin Garnett.
Shaquille O'Neal was originally named to the team, but declined. He was replaced by Gugliotta, meaning the need for a center was not met. Besides Duncan, there is still one more roster spot that could filled by any of a plethora of capable swingmen.
Antoine Walker might be the most logical choice, but there are marketing needs to weigh.
Does the N.B.A. give Kobe Bryant time to develop, or do they just need to sell more jerseys?
 
Washington on Carlesimo
 One of P. J. Carlesimo's former players not affiliated with the N.B.A. has finally spoken out about the demanding style of the Warriors coach.
 
Well, sort of.
 Denzel Washington, while a sophomore at Fordham in the 1970's, played for the junior varsity under Carlesimo. He remembers long practices, lots of screaming and, too, a lot of unforgettable basketball lessons.
"He would run us all day and make us work and work," the actor said. "We always thought it was crazy.
"But you know what? We were always prepared for the fourth quarter, and we hardly ever lost. Some of the things I learned from him, I still apply myself. I coached my son's team, and that was one of the philosophies I got across to them, to always be ready for the end of the game."
Washington, who plays the father of Ray Allen's character in Spike Lee's new film, "He Got Game," which comes out on May 1, was not on scholarship at the time.
"I was kind of a taxi-squad guy," he said. "I just walked on because I played with a lot of those guys in intramurals. I didn't get to play that much, but it was a great experience playing for him. Now in retrospect, I had no idea where he was headed."

HEADLINE: 3 Men Accused of Killing Brooklyn Father

BYLINE: By KIT R. ROANE 

 BODY:
An unemployed Brooklyn man found dead in his ransacked apartment on Wednesday afternoon had been tied up, beaten, asphyxiated and then urinated on by a former roommate and two accomplices who wanted to steal his stereo, the police said yesterday.
Tips from neighbors and anonymous callers led to the arrests Friday of the three suspects -- the former roommate, Omy Irizarry, 24; Daniel Bonefonte, 19, and John DeMatteo, 30 -- said Sgt. Brian Lavin, supervisor of the 60th Precinct's detectives bureau. 
 The men went to the apartment of the victim, Joseph Guidone, 39, in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn shortly before 3 P.M. on Wednesday, Sergeant Lavin said, then hid in the second-floor hallway, waiting for Mr. Guidone's 16-year-old son to return home.
When the son was spotted, the three men donned black masks, grabbing the youth from behind and forcing him to open the door to his father's apartment, the sergeant said. Once inside, he said, they tied the teen-ager with rope to the foot of his father's bed.
The attackers then waited in the apartment, Sergeant Lavin said, knowing that Mr. Guidone would be home soon to care for his son, who neighbors said is mentally handicapped. When Mr. Guidone arrived a few minutes later, the three men overpowered him, dragging him into the bathroom before tying his hands and legs and sealing his mouth and eyes with tape, the sergeant said.
The pillage began in earnest, with furniture upturned and possessions thrown to the ground, the police said. But in the end, the three men escaped with only a few old television sets and a stereo system. They were displeased, and before they left, the men went back to visit Mr. Guidone on the tile of his bathroom, Sergeant Lavin said.
"They started taunting him, hitting and kicking him around," Sergeant Lavin said. "Then they covered his head with what appears to be a plastic bag and suffocated him. We don't know why, but they were laughing. Two of them urinated on the body."
Police officers found his body around 4 P.M., after Mr. Guidone's son managed to break free of his bindings and ran to a neighbor's house to call 911. The son, who is under a doctor's care and taking medication, was placed with relatives, Sergeant Lavin said.
Leads came quickly, he said, adding that residents recalled seeing Mr. Irizarry and two strangers loafing around the building around the time of the killing. The police also received several anonymous calls with information about where to find the former roommate, and around noon on Friday, Mr. Irizarry and Mr. Bonefonte were spotted talking on the telephone at a nearby pool hall, Prime Time Billiards. They gave up to officers without a struggle, the police said.
Mr. DeMatteo was arrested 11 hours later as he stood on the corner of 46th Street and Sixth Avenue in Brooklyn, a few blocks from his mother's home, the police said. When detectives went to the house, according to the police, they found Mr. Guidone's stereo sitting on the floor in a bedroom there.
All three suspects have been charged with murder, burglary and robbery, the police said. If convicted of the most serious offense, they would each face 25 years to life in prison. Each suspect has prior convictions, Sergeant Lavin added. He said Mr. Irizarry is on parole for a burglary conviction and Mr. Bonefonte is on parole for robbery.
Mr. Guidone had few possessions other than a couch and his stereo, residents at the Marlboro Housing Development said yesterday as they recalled a quiet man who spent his days caring for his son and always smiled at neighbors in the hallway.
"When the ambulances came, I just thought that somebody was sick because there are a lot of elderly people here," said Mary Ruiz, 75. "But it was Joseph, and God, I was shocked when I heard people talking about it."
"They took the best things he had and now what about his son?" she added. "I feel sorry, real sorry, for that boy."

HEADLINE: AIDING CONSUMERS IS NOW THE THRUST OF ANTITRUST PUSH

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY with LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20

 BODY:
When the Government challenged the proposed mergers of the nation's four largest drug wholesalers earlier this month, the pronouncements from the Federal Trade Commission did not follow the script that trustbusters used for much of the last century, decrying the power of big, monopolistic businesses.
No, the Government's chief complaint was that the mergers might raise the prices consumers pay for drugs by even as much as 1 percent. 
 The United States is in the midst of a merger boom, the greatest in a generation. Nearly as many mergers were announced in the last three months of 1997 as in all of 1991. As many of these deals join together giants in the same markets, the Clinton Administration has been re-engaging the machinery of antitrust enforcement after it fell into disrepair in the 1980's.
The Justice Department, for example, is threatening to go to court on Monday to block the merger of two military contractors, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.
But the motivation -- or at least the explanation -- for the Government's actions has changed. Ever since the Sherman Antitrust Act was enacted in 1890, the Government has mostly acted to protect the ideal of competition within industries and prevent price gouging.
In practice, though, that doctrine usually revolved around a simple "bigness led to power and unfair behavior," said Eleanor Fox, a professor of law at New York University and an antitrust expert. In the last few years, the Government has offered a more politically attuned explanation for bringing its antitrust club out of the closet. Now officials concentrate on protecting consumers and select cases largely on their ability to trumpet that argument.
"These cartels are taking billions of dollars out of the pockets of American consumers," Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said in an interview. "So the antitrust focus is intensifying."
The new approach arose after the Reagan years, in which bigness in business was rarely considered to be particularly bad. By giving antitrust a focus on consumer impact, the Government has not only offered a more appealing reason to revive antitrust enforcement when old-fashioned populism no longer stirs many voters, it has also given itself a tool for distinguishing between those mergers -- even some of the biggest -- that can be viewed as benign and those that pose a real threat. And even when Washington takes on a high-profile case that resembles the old trustbusting, like the attempt to restrain Microsoft, the Government now puts the benefit to consumers at the forefront.
William J. Baer, director of the Bureau of Compliance at the Federal Trade Commission, which shares responsibility with the Justice Department for overseeing mergers, explained the difference. "It used to be that the presumption of control of the market was enough," he said. "But now we are trying to tell the story of how the consumer will be worse off."
That was the case when the F.T.C. ruled against the drug mergers. At that time, Mr. Baer said, "If the merged companies were to have raised their drug prices so that consumers would have felt even a 1 percent increase, that would have been a problem."
A year ago, when the commission ruled against the merger of Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc., the nation's two largest office supply discounters, the chief complaint was that eliminating competition between the two chains, even if there were plenty of other companies selling office supplies, would inevitably lead to higher prices for consumers.
As part of its new focus, the Government has also begun taking on cases that it used to ignore. In the 1980's, the Government showed no interest in nonmerger situations, such as the case against the Microsoft Corporation, where companies were accused of using their market domination to stifle innovation.
Standing on the courthouse steps in January, after a Federal judge accepted Microsoft's offer to sell Windows 95 with the company's Internet browser hidden or partly removed, Mr. Klein said, "This will increase consumer choice and send precisely the right message to the market."
Businesses recognize this change. Charles Koob, an antitrust lawyer at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in New York, says he advises clients who want to know whether a merger is likely to win approval to ask themselves what customers will say. "The one thing the Government is concerned about is when customers are unhappy," he said. "They have a strong base of customers who have complained and complained loudly."
Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said the change was a reaction to conservative critics in the 1980's, who complained that antitrust activism often propped up weak, inefficient businesses.
"They were right," Mr. Pitofsky said. "Now we care about competitors not because they are more worthy people but because without them, consumers will be hurt. And I think the system is better now."
Some experts believe the new approach is merely rhetorical at times. "Everyone knows how to put the arguments in terms of consumer protection now," Professor Fox said. "But sometimes it can be an empty buzzword."
Nonetheless, the nature of today's mergers often raises the threat of harm to consumers in different ways than mergers of the recent past.
In the latter half of the 1980's, there was another large merger wave -- 2,883 mergers announced in 1989, for example, compared with 3,702 last year. But many of the combinations back then brought together unrelated industries, raising fewer antitrust concerns. Today, many corporations are merging with competitors, giving the combined companies the power to dominate their industries and, in theory, control the prices and availability of products.
That is one reason, among others, why the Justice Department has stepped up its investigations, to a total of 276 last year, compared with just 83 in 1989 and 74 in 1988, at the peak of the last wave of mergers. Another is that the current Administration rejects the common argument of that era that the free market could largely police itself.
Yet even as the Government trains its antitrust guns on some highly visible deals, such as the drug wholesalers' mergers and the proposed merger between Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, its enforcement chiefs insist that they are not mounting a new offensive against mega-mergers. The investigation into the military contractors' merger, they say, revolves around the same question: Would it foster too limited a choice and higher prices for buyers -- or in this case, a single buyer, the Pentagon?
Indeed, the current approach still allows the vast majority of mergers to pass muster. The commission's figures show that the Government investigates about 15 percent of mergers and challenges less than 5 percent of them.
Corporations, meanwhile, generally do not seem to be shying away from mergers because of regulators.
"We haven't seen clients who say, 'We don't want to merge because Justice will block it,' " said an investment banker who asked not to be identified because he is handling several merger deals being reviewed by regulators.
The Clinton Administration is also moving to revive interest in nonmerger cases against companies where market power alone, antitrust officials contend, may pose a threat to consumers. The Justice Department's decades-long investigation of I.B.M. fell apart in the early 1980's at the same time that its case against AT&T was settled with the breakup of the telephone monopoly.
Now, in addition to the Microsoft case, the Justice Department is investigating accusations that Anheuser-Busch, the nation's largest brewer, is using its dominance to persuade distributors not to carry several competing micro-brewery brands.
The department is also looking into charges by smaller competitors of what they call predatory practices by some of the major airlines, which can leave travelers to and from cities dominated by a single carrier with overpriced air service.
And a senior Federal official said the Government was studying Intel's practices to see whether it, as the nation's dominant manufacturer of microchips, is unfairly squeezing competitors out of the market. No decision has been made on whether to open a formal investigation.
"There's definitely a large increase in these civil, nonmerger cases," said Robert Litan, director of Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution and a former antitrust official in the Clinton Administration. The overall increase in enforcement comes at a time, Mr. Litan said, when the need for it might have been expected to decline. Open markets and the integration into a world economy were always thought to increase competition and reduce the need for antitrust action, he said.
Earlier this month, the Aluminum Company of America, the world's largest aluminum maker, announced that it would pay $2.8 billion in stock and cash for Alumax, the third-largest aluminum maker in the United States. At the time, Alcoa's chairman and chief executive, Paul O'Neill, said he was confident that the Justice Department would find little in the merger to haggle over. The aluminum market is global and the combined United States companies would be more competitive against foreign competitors. To Mr. O'Neill, the "idea that some of this has anything to do with concentration in the U.S. is ludicrous."
Mr. Klein, while not commenting specifically on the aluminum case, thundered in reaction to that general thesis, "I thoroughly reject the analysis that globalization reduces the need for enforcement."
In general, Mr. Klein added: "We are pro-competition. And that is pro-consumer."

Skirmishes In Jones Suit Raise Harassment Issues
Over the last two months, the sexual accusations involving President Clinton have unleashed a torrent of debate about sexual harassment, and where to draw the legal line between uncouth behavior and that which is grounds for a lawsuit. Sexual harassment, a rapidly evolving legal field, was never defined by statute, but developed as an offshoot of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 1
 
After four years of exchanging news-conference salvos and blizzards of briefs, Paula Jones's case against President Clinton is set to got to trial on May 27, with the verdict in the President's own camp far from settled on whether his lawyer, Robert S.

HEADLINE: Former Boyfriend Arrested in Killing Of a Law Student Near Columbia

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
The police said last night they had arrested a 23-year-old former boyfriend in connection with the death of a Columbia University law student who was found with her throat slashed in her university apartment on Friday.
Investigators disclosed no motive in the killing of Hyeseung Lynda Hong, 26, a third-year student and native of South Korea who had accepted an offer of a full-time job at a prestigious Manhattan law firm, to begin after her graduation. 
 But Assistant Chief Kevin Farrell, commander of the Manhattan detectives, said they believed the suspect, Edmund Ko, of Cliffside Park, N.J., had killed Ms. Hong about 11 P.M. Wednesday, two days before her body was found. Chief Farrell said Mr. Ko, who is to be charged with murder, had been arrested last November as a co-conspirator in the slashing of another of his former girlfriends.
Mr. Ko, who is also from Korea and is unemployed, had not confessed to killing Ms. Hong as of last night, Chief Farrell said, but witnesses had told the police that they had seen him at her apartment on Wednesday night.
The body of Ms. Hong was discovered by a male friend -- identified by some of Ms. Hong's friends as a current boyfriend -- on Friday night in her apartment on West 113th Street. The crime horrified students and faculty there, who mourned the violent end of a life on the threshold of a bright future.
"All of us kind of think in the future -- 5, 10 years from now," said Karl Barrios, 25, a classmate. "To have someone die like that seems very sudden, very painful. Everybody here is still in a state of shock."
Mr. Barrios said he remembered Ms. Hong bringing a date named Edmund to a gathering of law school students about two years ago. He described him as an "affluent guy," who dressed well. He was "a pretty unremarkable person, nothing out of the ordinary, not weird or anything," Mr. Barrios said.
Chief Farrell said that Mr. Ko and Ms. Hong had apparently ended their relationship about six months ago. In Mr. Ko's earlier arrest, the Chief said, he had been accused, along with two women, of slashing the face of a former girlfriend in New Jersey. One of the other women actually did the slashing, Chief Farrell said.
The police had said there was no evidence of forced entry into Ms. Hong's ground-floor apartment, owned by the university, in Morningside Heights. They also said there was apparently no theft involved. Detective Mark Patterson, a police spokesman, said there did not appear to be any evidence of sexual assault, although investigators were awaiting results of an autopsy.
Law enforcement officials said yesterday that Ms. Hong's family was in Korea and had not yet been notified of her death. The family now lives in Virginia.
Her friends yesterday remembered Ms. Hong as exceptionally talented, even in a class of high-achieving students. After a summer internship at the law firm Cravath Swain & Moore last year, she had been working there part-time this semester and was expected to join the firm as a full-time associate in the fall, said Harry Silver, the firm's executive director.
"She was very friendly, always smiling, always optimistic," said Alla Lee, 34, a third-year classmate of Ms. Hong's. She was "kind of laid back in a way, not a worry type at all. Also a very attractive woman."
Details of Ms. Hong's life were sketchy yesterday, but friends said she moved with her family back and forth from Korea and graduated in 1990 from Millburn High School in Short Hills, N.J. Neighbors said her father is an importer. The family, which also includes her mother and a younger sister, apparently spent some time in California.
In high school, neighbors said, Ms. Hong worked for the student newspaper, sang in the girls' chorus and took several advanced-placement courses. She already talked then about becoming a lawyer, they said, but she also considered medicine.
A high school classmate described her as "a nice person, intelligent, always full of life."
"To me this is shocking because it's someone who lived across the street from me, that I saw day in and day out for three years," said the former classmate, who insisted on anonymity. "It really hits home."
Ms. Hong, a psychology major, graduated from Cornell University. Friends said she planned to become a corporate lawyer.
At Columbia, she was active in Asian-American issues, and a leader of the Asian-American and Pacific Law Students Association, which met and held seminars to explore the role Asians and Asian Americans in law and society. Last year she helped put together a seminar on the extent to which Asians were reflected in United States case law, and she attended meetings about the role of minority women in society.
"I think she was one of those people who felt like we were going to be ground breakers," said her friend and classmate Anny Huang, 24. "Women have worked and struggled for many generations to do whatever their talents and character and intelligence would let them, and she intended to do it."
Ms. Huang said that even though Ms. Hong was clearly driven, she did not seem to show it.
"That is one of the things that people really admired about her," she said. "She didn't seem to take everything so seriously. She was able to do really well but there was no arrogance about her. She had confidence. And of course she knew she was very, very pretty."
Tom Yun, 55, the owner of the Mill Korean Restaurant down the street from Ms. Hong's apartment, said she was a regular customer, who mostly came alone to eat. He said he has seen her less in recent months, apparently as she has been making her move from student to young lawyer.
About two weeks ago, Mr. Yun said, "She was carrying a briefcase, all dressed up. I said, 'Where are you going?' She said, 'I'm going downtown. I have work to do.'
"Usually she wasn't dressed up," he said. "That's why I remember that."
The police said that Ms. Hong, who lived alone in an apartment in a neat four-story building at 548 West 113th Street, was last seen on Wednesday. The police said that her male friend said he had become worried and went to her apartment because he could not get in touch with her. He called the police, saying he found her unconscious in an apartment covered with blood. Chief Farrell said the apartment was so bloody that it appeared that there had been a struggle or that Ms. Hong had wandered around the apartment after being slashed.
The police say that Ms. Hong was dead when the officers arrived. No weapon has been recovered.
The slaying set off a wave of fear on the campus and along the quiet block, between Broadway and Amsterdam, which is home mostly to Columbia students and professors. The last slaying on Columbia's campus was in 1988, when a security guard was shot and killed.
"This is the first real serious gruesome incident I have been anywhere close to," said Margaret Connelly, 21, a senior studying political science. "It's a reality check."
Albert Sheu, 25, a friend of Ms. Hong's said: "It's incredibly tragic. This doesn't happen to law students here. It doesn't happen."
Columbia University said it was in the process of setting up special counseling services for both students and Ms. Hong's relatives.

HEADLINE: Big Macs to Go

BYLINE: By Nicholas D. Kristof; Nicholas D. Kristof is the Tokyo bureau chief of The Times.

 BODY:

Golden Arches East
 McDonald's in East Asia.
 Edited by James L. Watson.
 256 pp. Stanford, Calif.:
 Stanford University Press. Cloth, $45. Paper, $16.95. 
 I once asked my 5-year-old son, who has grown up largely in Tokyo, about his favorite Japanese foods. Gregory thought for a moment and decided on rice balls and McDonald's.
It makes perfect sense to think of Big Macs as Japanese food, since McDonald's is a much more important part of his life in Japan than it is when we are on vacation in America. In particular, given the cramped homes in which most Japanese live, when his Japanese friends have birthdays the most common place to hold parties is McDonald's.
"Golden Arches East" is a fascinating study that explores issues of globalization by focusing on the role of McDonald's in five Asian economies, and it comes to conclusions that Gregory would approve of: that in many countries McDonald's has been absorbed by local communities and become assimilated, so that it is no longer thought of as a foreign restaurant and in some ways no longer functions as one.
At a time when academics regularly write impenetrably about abstruse irrelevancies, this book is engaging and arises from straightforward questions: how do countries react to McDonald's, and what does the interaction say about those nations? This book, edited by James L. Watson, a distinguished China scholar and professor of anthropology at Harvard University, was a terrific idea, and the authors pull it off very well. Separate scholars look at McDonald's in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.
The inquiry is not trivial. McDonald's has had an enormous impact in Asia, affecting manners and mores and the way people live. Ten percent of the beef sold in Japan is in McDonald's hamburgers, and the daily lives of most Japanese people have been shaped more by McDonald's than the State Department.
The most fascinating aspect of this study is its exploration of how McDonald's changed Asia. While America may envision itself as a global beacon for democracy and free markets, this book suggests that the most powerful American influences in East Asia are more mundane.
Take toilets. Bathrooms in Hong Kong restaurants used to range from the merely dirty to the wrenchingly disgusting. And then McDonald's rode into town, in 1975, with bathrooms that offered a novelty -- cleanliness. Perhaps the impact is exaggerated, but this book credits McDonald's for helping to raise standards of cleanliness in public rest rooms in Hong Kong.
Likewise, the concept of waiting in line was an alien one in Hong Kong in the old days, and the battle to get on a bus or to get to a cash register was usually like a rugby scrum. Then McDonald's, aghast at the chaos, rigorously imposed lines at its restaurants. The result, many Hong Kong natives think, was that McDonald's helped spread the concept of waiting in line throughout the territory.
Japan's mores have been changing for decades, as an extremely formal country has become steadily more casual, and McDonald's may be a catalyst in that process. Japan has an ancient taboo against tachigui, or standing while eating, but this is breaking down, and this book suggests that part of the reason is the spread of McDonald's -- whose first outlet in Japan did not have any seats at all.
In China, restaurants traditionally have been maelstroms of loud conversations and bones strewn on the floor. But according to this book, customers at McDonald's outlets in China spoke in lower tones than in other restaurants and were careful not to spit or throw rubbish on the ground: "People in McDonald's were, on the whole, more self-restrained and polite toward one another. One possible explanation for this difference is that the symbolic meaning . . . of the new food, along with customers' willingness to accept the exotic culture associated with fast food, has affected people's table manners in particular and social behavior in general."
All this may amount to American cultural imperialism. But it is hard to imagine even the most passionate nationalist in Asia denouncing American exports like courtesy or clean toilets.

HEADLINE: Hoosier Hysteria

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re " 'Hoosiers' No More, but Heroes All the Same" (Sports pages, March 19): As someone who grew up during the heyday of the single-class basketball tournament, I think you did an excellent job of capturing the history and essence of Hoosier hysteria. 
 The decision to go to the four-class system was driven by economic benefits for the small schools. Polls showed that the general population favored staying with the single-class tournament; it was the schools' athletic directors who did the voting.
Consolidations created an even greater size gap between the original small schools that were left and the rest. (For example, in my county, which was once a sectional site of about 20 teams, there are now only four schools.) Yet I think that in the long run, most will like the four-class system just as much.

HEADLINE: What the Elephant Forgot

BYLINE: By David Frum; David Frum is a contributing editor to The Weekly Standard.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A friend of mine recently ran for office on the ticket of a right-of-center political party. He'd call me late at night, after finishing a hard day of campaigning, and burst into a self-mocking parody of the speeches he had been embarrassing himself by making from dawn to dusk. "Let me say how sickened I am by the evils of child abuse! I yield to no one in my condemnation of the illegal trade in puppies! We must move ahead, while leaving nobody behind!"
My friend is a British Conservative, but he could just as well have been running for Congress as a Republican. The vapid, empty politics he was ridiculing has become almost the official credo of Congressional Republicans. The party's politics today careers wildly from feel-good mini-policies a la Dick Morris (the cigarette tax increase) to vast but empty gestures (the repeal of the Internal Revenue Code). 
 Four years ago, the Republicans won a major Congressional victory by promising large and important reforms in the operation of the Federal Government. Four years later, they are hoping to hold onto their majority by refraining from doing anything at all.
Psychologists have observed that if you apply electric shocks to a dog at random intervals, it falls into a condition called learned helplessness. It decides it's going to be punished whatever it does and ends up lying on the floor and whimpering.
Something like that seems to have happened to the Republicans. They appear disoriented. They trample on their professed principles, discarding (for example) their alleged commitment to federalism by knuckling under to the President's poll-driven scheme to force all states to adopt the same drunken-driving rules. They meekly accept the gutting of the work requirements in the 1996 welfare reform law and abjectly assent to huge Presidential spending proposals.
Worse, they are dreaming up equally bloated spending programs of their own, like the colossal highway bill, which would leave scarcely a blade of grass in the lower 48 states unpaved. (Where are the environmentalists when we need them?)
By heroic effort, the Republicans narrowly avoided losing the House in 1996. Having won, they no longer seem to have any idea what to do with their victory.
This is sad, because very soon they are likely to have an opportunity to do a lot. The Clinton Presidency is badly damaged -- much more badly damaged than polls alone reveal.
This is a President who did not address the nation from the Oval Office during the Iraq crisis, who doesn't dare take questions from the press and who lives in dread of the evidence gathered by the independent counsel's office. Just as a weakened Richard Nixon offered his Democratic opponents national health insurance in 1974 if only they would relent on Watergate, this President too may soon be asking his opponents, "What can I do for you?"
Sometime between now and then, the Republicans need to work out an answer.
The right answer, or answers, must be bold without appearing reckless. In 1995, the Republicans wounded themselves with a program that sounded radical (to the alarm of some voters) without producing much in the way of political change. The task for 1998 is the opposite: to assemble a program that advances Republican principles while reassuring voters of the party's moderation and good sense. There are dozens of possible elements of such a program. But here is one that might form the basis for all the others.
In his 1996 campaign, President Clinton claimed that the Government was the smallest it had been in 30 years. But the Federal tax burden as a share of gross domestic product will in the coming fiscal year exceed 20 percent for the first time since 1945. The figure was less than 18 percent when Mr. Clinton took office. The Tax Foundation, a Washington research organization, points out that tax burdens on middle-class families have returned to within whispering distance of their 1981 peaks.
Mr. Clinton defeated Bob Dole by convincing Americans that any tax cut would require unacceptably large spending cuts in Medicare and Medicaid and in education and environmental programs. But now, with the budget balanced, Republicans might be able to put their case in a new way.
In the 1999 fiscal year, the Federal Government expects to spend $6,443 for each of the 269 million people living in the United States. In 1996, President Clinton convinced Americans that the Federal Government should spend no less. Why, then, can't Republicans try to convince Americans that the Federal Government should spend no more? What if the Republicans made no net increase in per-person Federal spending their central negotiating demand? You could even fit it on a bumper sticker "$6,443 -- and not a penny more."
With the budget balanced and the economy growing, a per-person spending limit would quickly reverse the relentless growth in Government. Should the economy continue to chug along at the 4 1/2 percent predicted by the President's budget, a per-person spending limit would shrink the Government's overall tax claim to some 16 1/2 percent over the next five fiscal years. That would make about $330 billion available to return to the people in the form of grand tax cuts, and all without nicking a single dollar from any existing Federal program.
 Spin-meisters like Frank Luntz argue that Republicans should avoid harsh words like "cut" and "control" when referring to Government programs and instead say "preserve" or "protect." Somewhere along the way, however, what began as advice about communications metamorphosed into injunctions on policy. Not only did Republicans avoid talking about spending control; they ceased practicing it. Unfortunately, despite the spin-meisters -- despite Mr. Clinton's famous concession that "the era of big government is over" -- the battle over the size and scope of the Government remains the central divide of modern politics.
Republican leaders in Congress show little patience with external critics who do not have to face voters, who are not under attack by the President as "extremists" and who urge the Republicans to gird for another round of seemingly hopeless combat. But today's accommodationist strategy also exacts its price, and the feebleness and drift that we see in today's Republican Party are only the first installment.
There is a middle way between suicide and surrender, and the balanced budget gives Republicans a chance to explore it. They should put the spin-meisters back in their place: figuring out new and attractive ways to explain conservative principles, rather than figuring out new and attractive substitutes for those principles.
The Republican task now is to stand for something bigger and better than highway spending. Republicans must prove to the voters that as fervently as they oppose the illegal trade in puppies (and of course they yield to no one in their opposition to that!), they actually have some idea of what they intend to do with the trust the people have reposed in them.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Journal Joins Life-Style Bandwagon With New Section

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

 BODY:
Since 1889, The Wall Street Journal has helped its readers make money. On Friday, it brought out a new section to tell them how to spend it.
Like a Hawaiian shirt on a stockbroker, Weekend Journal is the monochromatic business daily's full-color embrace of the kind of life style journalism and its rich advertising base that other American dailies, including The New York Times, began adding two decades ago. 
 Weekend Journal has a wine column, an antiques column and an expensive-house-of-the-week feature that joins the book, movie reviews, sports and travel articles that already appear in the five-day-a-week paper.
There is even The Journal's first crossword puzzle, whose clues will hardly strain a languid weekend in the country. Example: four-letter word in phrase ending "sapiens."
The new section adds about six pages of news space to the paper, said Richard J. Tofel, a spokesman for Dow Jones & Company, which owns The Journal. The section will be devoted largely to the kind of high-end consumer, retail, entertainment and life style advertising the paper has been losing out on with its all-business, no-play format. Significantly, three of the new advertising pages, including the premium back page, can be bought in color.
The Journal hopes that Weekend Journal will travel home on Fridays and that both men and women will pick it up and spend time with it over the weekend. The daily version is now read mostly by men, and mostly at work.
"The business strategy is about broadening the advertising base, but the reader side is not about broadening but deepening, because the most precious thing to us is how much time people spend with the paper" Mr. Tofel said. "Journal readers already spend more than 40 minutes a day with the paper, and anything you can do to add to that number is absolutely key."
Coincidentally, USA Today also changed its weekend format on Friday. The paper's Life section has been split in two for Fridays, producing Life Weekend and Life Destinations & Diversions to expand the amount of room for editorial content and advertising by 14 pages, said Steve Anderson, a spokesman for the paper.
USA Today, which has a Friday circulation of two million, charges $75,600 for a full page in black and white and $114,500 for color. The Wall Street Journal, with a weekday circulation of 1.8 million but with a more affluent readership, charges $99,998 for a page in black and white for consumer, entertainment, leisure and travel advertising -- the kind sought by the new weekend section -- and $124,859 for color. The Journal charges higher rates for financial advertising.
The new Journal section is edited by Joanne Lipman. In her message to readers on Friday, she introduced the section as an "appeal to your passions, not just your obligations."
Ms. Lipman also wrote: "The Journal has always been essential reading when it comes to daily business. Now we hope we can become just as essential in helping you manage your personal business."
The first Weekend Journal devoted most of its front-page space to the Oscars and to examining what the prize would mean in salary to the main contenders. A movie review, which appears behind the editorial page in the first, or A section, on other days, occupies the left-hand column on the front page. The final front-page feature describes sport utility vehicles as politically incorrect but still desirable and lists the safest of the big trucks. The article hints at the section's target audience by illustrating the piece with a photo of the Mercedes ML320.
Other columns cover decorating, wine, antiques ("Economic turmoil abroad means bargains in Asian art at home"), travel and wine. Nat Hentoff reviews jazz, and the section is anchored on the next-to-last page by Taste, a page of columns on American culture edited by Robert L. Bartley, The Journal's editor.
Friday's main feature in Taste was a roundtable discussion whose participants, including Judith Martin, a.k.a. "Miss Manners"; Don McLean, composer-singer of "American Pie," and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, debated whether American culture is healthier or sicker than it was 30 years ago. Their answer: sicker.

HEADLINE: Taking In the Sites;
Finding Business Ethics on and About the Internet

BYLINE: By SREENATH SREENIVASAN 

 BODY:
The World Wide Web is not exactly a haven for good business ethics. It can be a lawless place filled with unscrupulous operators pushing get-rich-quick schemes and other scams.
Naturally, those who study business ethics worry about the Web. "Every possible abuse of integrity and decency takes place on the Web," said Laura Pincus Hartman, director of the Institute for Business and Professional Ethics at DePaul University in Chicago. 
 Randy Pennington, an ethics consultant based in Dallas, said there was "a sense that moral and ethical values are not important" on the Web. But that does not surprise him. "There is no standardization in technology on the Web, so why do we expect standardization in behavior?" he said.
Mr. Pennington said that to avoid an attempt at "regulation of ethical behavior in the future, the on-line community must regulate itself."
"This country has a history of regulating those industries that do not control themselves," he added. Despite the global nature of the Web, he sees the possibility of Government intervention.
The Netcheck Commerce Bureau is one attempt at self-regulation. The agency, which has 700 corporate members in about 80 countries, maintains a list of companies involved in electronic commerce. Visitors to Netcheck's site can register consumer complaints about anything from unsolicited E-mail to copyright disputes. There is even a place to compliment a company. The site's philosophy is that "public pressure is the only real deterrent in this new frontier."
The Web is also a great place to learn about and research the issues of business ethics, both within the Internet and beyond. An excellent starting place is the site of the institute at DePaul that Ms. Hartman heads. The site provides an introduction to business ethics but goes well beyond that. It is home to the Online Journal of Ethics and has comprehensive links to other sites that deal with the topic.
The business of domain names and how they are registered involves some of the worst breaches of ethics on the Internet. Corporations and nonprofit groups are being forced to spend a lot of time, money and energy to fight piracy of high-profile .com and .org addresses. Even in the world of business ethics, names can be less than clear. For example, Business-ethics.org is the home of the International Business Ethics Institute, and Businessethics.org belongs to the Council for Ethics in Economics. The institute, which has a truly global background, has a site that contains a sparse brochure. The council -- which is trying to "strengthen the ethical fabric of business and economic life" -- has a more substantial site with articles from the quarterly publication Ethics in Economics, and texts of speeches on ethics organized by the institute, based in Columbus, Ohio.
The Ethics Resource Center is a leading nonprofit ethics consultancy. The site offers information about the center's work with large corporations in developing ethics programs.
The Center for Business Ethics, at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., is home to the Ethics Officer Association. This group represents the executives that help police many of the nation's large corporations.
Few industries have been mired in as many questions about ethics, both real and perceived, as the military industry. One attempt to address its problems is the Defense Industry Initiative on Business Ethics and Conduct, a group of large military contractors, which has an in-depth site about the organization and aspects of Government contracting. Much of the information is applicable to other industries.
Unlike many other sites, the Better Business Bureau site, which is run by the Council of Better Business Bureaus, is aimed at consumers in addition to the corporate world. It provides tips on various consumer frauds. It also has a guide to "establishing an ethical business" and a detailed code of advertising that explains common abuses and misleading claims.
Establishing an ethics code is an important step for any company or industry, and a growing number of sites carry such codes. The DePaul site has compiled a list of direct links to a variety of codes, including Johnson & Johnson, Northern Telecom and the National Association of the Remodeling Industry. Also included is the code of ethics of the International Ethical Business Registry, a Canadian organization that promotes ethics codes. Among the aims of the registry: donating at least 10 percent of its gross income "toward the betterment of mankind." Its site has pointers about setting up a first-time code and answers a common question: "Is a code of ethics like a mission statement?"
(Answer: "No. A mission statement states what you do. A code of ethics states how you do it.")
At first glance, a site that promises "business ethics from an Islamic perspective," as the Islamic Training Foundation does, seems to be far removed from most of what is available on the Web. But in a closer look at some of the material, readers learn that Allah describes successful people as those who are "inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong." What non-Islamic business ethicist would not endorse such a view?

HEADLINE: Box Office: Top Gauge For Films

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD

 BODY:
The movie industry concerns itself with many things, from artistic expression and storytelling to deal-making. But the business is nearly unanimous on one basic measure of success that supersedes all else: ticket sales.
Artistic merit is important. Creativity counts. Novelty is appreciated. Oscars are coveted. But all of those things matter more if they help produce ticket sales. The best evidence of Hollywood's embrace of this standard is that when a movie studio boasts to the movie community, it takes out an ad in Daily Variety and plasters across one or two pages the name of the film, a photo of the actors and, in huge type, the box- office gross, usually followed by an exclamation point. 
 And this gold standard has caught on outside of Hollywood. Many newspapers, including The New York Times, run a table of the weekend box-office grosses early each week. Teen-agers today are as conversant with the weekend box-office figures for "Titanic" as children of another era were with Bob Gibson's strikeout totals or Maury Wills's stolen bases.
Given the reliance on these figures, it is perhaps surprising how old-fashioned the systems are for collecting them, particularly when compared with those used for other forms of entertainment.
In the television business, Nielsen's Media Research uses sophisticated devices attached to thousands of television sets nationwide to automatically provide data on viewing habits. Soundscan has developed a point-of-sale computer system that feeds detailed data on sales of recorded music to central computers, and the systems for registering the sale of magazines in supermarkets is almost completely automated.
But the method of collecting the box-office figures is more prosaic. Basically, it is a relay system of faxes and telephone calls, and then some improvising.
The basic figures are generally collected by the E.D.I. unit of A. C. Nielsen, a market research company. Daniel Marks, a senior vice president of the company, said that the heart of the system was a room with about 35 people on telephones. Those people race to begin their work at the end of every weekend.
Starting on Sunday, they communicate with hundreds of theaters with a total of about 25,000 screens. This covers 80 percent to 85 percent of the market, including most of the busiest screens, Mr. Marks said.
"It's not a simple task, but the numbers are pretty good," he said, adding that the method of collecting the numbers has not changed appreciably in decades.
Initially, A. C. Nielsen provides what are called flash figures, or quick tallies that do not include the entire weekend. The studios frequently subscribe to the company for these figures and then adjust them with their own surveys of theaters that had not been counted. Most of the studios then estimate the entire weekend's box-office grosses, and these are the figures many publications print on Monday morning.
Studio executives said that they must subsequently produce audited box-office figures and that experience had made these early estimates quite accurate. But there are exceptions. Late last year, Miramax had to acknowledge that it overstated the opening weekend gross for "Scream 2," announcing that $39.2 million in tickets had been sold. Miramax later announced that the figure was actually $33 million.
"There are mistakes, but it rarely happens, and there is a self-adjusting mechanism," Mr. Marks said. "This is maybe a little old-fashioned, but it really works."


GRAPHIC: The list often used in Hollywood to determine which movies have made the most money adds the amount a movie made in each year of release to a running total. By this method, "Titanic" has already taken in more at the box office than any other movie. But this method does not account for the effect of inflation. For example, the average price of a movie ticket in the United States in 1948 was 36 cents. Today, it is $4.59, nearly 13 times as much.
Chart: "Big at the Box Office"
 Among movies for which complete historical data are available, here are the films with the largest domestic box-office grosses, adjusted for inflation. The list excludes some high-grossing older films, like "Gone With the Wind" and "The Ten Commandments" because historical data were not available. Variety estimates, using a different method, that "Gone With the Wind" has earned more at the box office than any other movie, taking in more than $1 billion since it was first released in 1939.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Forget About the Next Star; Look for What's Different

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., March 22

 BODY:
The line to see the seminal New York rock band Sonic Youth spilled outside the club La Zona Rosa here on Thursday, winding along Fourth Street in a motley, traffic-blocking mess of teen-agers and music industry drones. Though the club was already full, the crowd was reluctant to leave. The occasion was the South by Southwest convention, which in 12 years has changed from a showcase for local acts to the reigning meet-and-greet of the rock business.
A subject of front-page, above-the-fold articles in local papers, South by Southwest attracted some 6,000 people for four days of deal making, drinking, panel watching, cell phone brandishing and concert hopping. (Nearly 12,000 music fans registered just for the concerts, not for the discussions and panels.) The event pumped some $8 million into the city's economy. Each night there were 220 or so shows, and Sonic Youth's was probably the most anticipated and crowded one of the week. 
 Though music conventions like this are celebrations of the new, opportunities to expose young bands to jaded, busy and self-important music industry players, Sonic Youth is -- despite its name -- an older institution. It is an emissary from a time in the early 80's when being a noisy guitar-rock band meant sacrificing commercial ambitions for a small but loyal niche audience. That was before alternative-rock was coined as a genre, before Nirvana and Pearl Jam broke the music through to a mass audience, before record labels began tempting these noisy bands with contracts worth millions of dollars. In the time from the start of the music's popular crest to its decline, from about 1990 to 1996, rock conventions like South by Southwest thrived. They were places to feel one step ahead of the game, to pick out the rock bands that seemed destined for success.
But now, with the pop pendulum swinging back into the middle of the road, the music audience tiring of carbon copies of carbon copies of Nirvana and Pearl Jam, and bands like the Spice Girls and Hanson (who actually tried to get a deal at the convention four years ago) making popular music G-rated again, the atmosphere at this South by Southwest was very different. It was no longer about seeing the up-and-coming rock star, the baby band that record labels are relentlessly competing to sign, but about looking for something different. It is a time of confusion in the rock world: few people even know what genre, let alone what band, will be catapulted from clubs to arenas.
The highlights at the festival were acts dabbling in electronic dance music; groups augmenting standard rock instrumentation with flutes, violins, brass instruments, vintage keyboards, even bagpipes; history-rummaging lounge and country acts; innovators from Asia, Europe and Australia, and rockers sporting matching outfits, choreographed stage moves and theatrical flourishes in direct opposition to the downtrodden realism and anti-showmanship esthetic of alternative bands. Rock music is once again sinking into a diverse mire out of which in a few more years (when the pendulum swings away from the middle of the road and out toward a more extreme or innovative sound) any one of these styles could be plucked and deposited on top of the pop charts.
Sonic Youth's performance brought home the cyclical nature of the music business. Though the concert was packed, and the band is among rock's most influential explorers, it was once again out of step with the times. The bulk of its performance consisted of detuned, deconstructed, wide-open songs from its forthcoming album, resulting in a show challenging enough for several talent scouts to admit that if Sonic Youth were an unknown band performing this same set at a smaller club, it would never be signed to a major record label. (It's currently on the Seagram-owned DGC Records.)
"I'd rather see the bands that are all dressed up, playing weird instruments, running around screaming and singing in Japanese, because it's different and exciting," said one fan at the conference.
The Japanese actually had a major presence at South by Southwest, delivering some of the week's best performances. Cornelius, an eclectic Japanese star in his first American concert, played with his band in matching red-and-white crew-neck shirts and sunglasses, vacillating unpredictably between beautiful Beach Boys-inspired pop, dense clusters of noise and loose sonic tinkering as film collages flashed and fluttered in perfect synchronization with the music.
Delivering a more modern sound from Okinawa, a Japanese island known for its distinct traditional music, Cocco was the festival's sleeper hit, coming on like a Japanese Fiona Apple. Waifish, passionate, gifted and seeming disturbed, she belted out dark yet beautiful ballads and angst-riddled, violin-enhanced rockers while lost in a poetic hell of her own.
Other noises from Japan included the avant-garde wailing of O*N*T*J; the dense guitar assault of Zoobombs; the loose, fragmented, faux-naif rock of Seagull Screaming Kiss Her Kiss Her, and the freeform, double-drumming cacophony of Demi Semi Quaver, led by a singer dressed like a glam version of Marie-Antoinette who announced, "I wonder why we play here because we are so Japanese."
Elsewhere, American Indian groups like the family rock trio Blackfire sang angry songs of protest and alienation as did rappers like Latryx. Groups from Sweden like Cloudberry Jam played a bar-band equivalent of lounge-rock; New Zealanders like Te Vaka presented ethnic amalgamations of music and dance; Mexican rap noodlers like Plastalina Mosh presented themselves as their country's answer to the Beastie Boys, and Welsh bands like the Stereophonics played straight-ahead, hook-heavy power-pop.
No matter what country they were from and how different their music was, rock bands seemed to be screaming: "Look at me! We're something different!" They spit fire and set their instruments ablaze (Motor City Devils, Nashville Pussy), wore bizarre or coordinated outfits (Motor City Devils, the Eyeliners, Cornelius, Demi Semi Quaver), played nontraditional rock instruments (Drums and Tuba, for example, were exactly what the name promised) or simply strove for classic pop perfection (the High Llamas, Richard Davies, the Push Stars, and Apples in Stereo), all of these acts a throwback to a time before and a contrarian response to alternative rock.
Unlike the Winter Music Conference, a dance-music convention that gathered some of the genre's top underground disk jockeys and electronic musicians for all-night parties in Miami earlier this month, at South by Southwest there was no sense of vitality and urgency; there wasn't an audience that felt it was in the know and onto something that the rest of the country would soon wake up to. Dance music at South by Southwest was simply presented as one element in the panoply of sounds.
Even within its niche, dance acts were extremely diverse: Amsterdam's Junkie XL pushed the big beats of the Chemical Brothers and the Prodigy further into the realm of fraternity party music; Germany's To Rococo Rot looked back to its country's legacy of progressive rock for minimal, propulsive electronic-enhanced jams; the Propellerheads showed how well two English white men could appropriate old-school rap scratching, beat-boxing and breakbeats, and Martyn Bennett merged drum-and-bass dance music with bagpipe and woodwind solos.
More than dance music, the sound at the conference most recently scooped out of its pocket and onto the pop charts was ska, one of the few longtime underground genres that -- despite two great ska showcases at the festival -- the cognoscenti in the business refuse to take seriously, explore or even discuss in a sentence that doesn't end with "all the same" or "be happy when that's over."
There is another way to navigate through the concerts here besides looking for new bands, and that is to see the Texas legends: the folk, country and roots singers who have become local institutions, representatives of a legacy as looming and active as an oil rig. In the street during the day, at the homes of musicians like Joe Ely and Jerry Jeff Walker in the evening, and at clubs all through the night, performers (including Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Alejandro Escovedo, Don Walser, Ray Price, BR5-49 and Junior Brown) displayed their virtuosity as singers, songwriters or guitarists.
Every year most of these musicians perform at the festival, and their shows are nearly always packed. It is a reminder to the business that there is music out there beyond trends, charts and radio play, that chronicles in timeless terms an individual's search for meaning and stability in a country built on violence and eclecticism. More than a multimillion-dollar deal with Sony or Warner Brothers, the status and longevity of these musicians is a goal for the hundreds of fledgling bands that performed at the festival to aspire to.

HEADLINE: Military Mischief in Indonesia

 BODY:
American military training for Indonesia's notoriously brutal anti-riot troops is a dangerous idea that was expressly prohibited by Congress on human rights grounds years ago. But such training has been going on, quietly, since 1992. The Pentagon cynically sidestepped Congressional objections by moving the Indonesian training from the military education program, where it was prohibited, to a different bureaucratic pocket.
The case for an end to the riot troop training is now especially strong because it seems likely that the troops will be used to crush legitimate democratic protests. President Suharto's erratic response to the severe economic crisis and his stage-managed re-election have sent demonstrators into the streets and his Government's legitimacy to a new low. 
Regrettably, the Defense Department persists in believing that all military training programs are of great benefit to the United States. Pentagon officials argue that such training forges valuable friendships with future foreign military leaders and teaches trainees greater respect for civilian authority and for human rights.
Such benefits may realistically be expected in countries where top military and political leaders are committed to professionalizing the armed forces. But the record of American training efforts in repressive military cultures like Indonesia's is bleak. Unambiguous success stories are rare, while some military graduates of American training programs, like Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in Panama, have gone on to lead ugly, anti-American dictatorships. In Indonesia, the riot-suppression trainees can be expected to absorb American instruction in subjects like advanced sniper techniques and special air operations and ignore any accompanying civics lessons.
Washington faces difficult enough challenges as the Indonesian crisis unfolds. It should not be complicating its agenda by tying the reputation of the United States to anti-riot troops whose history is marked by gratuitous violence and whose future behavior Washington is powerless to control.

HEADLINE: Ugandans Hope Trip Will Aid Democracy and Trade

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: KAMPALA, Uganda, March 22

 BODY:
Charles Katongole, a taxi driver by trade, swung the pickax into the earth at the main traffic circle outside this hot and humid capital with a purpose today. Sweat drenched his face and body.
The sidewalk he had volunteered to repair was still just a strip of chewed-up earth, and it had to be completed before President Clinton's arrival on Tuesday. 
 "If this work isn't finished, we will keep going through the night," he said, mopping his brow. "I'm very excited to see the President. I think he will bring us peace. What I want from him is to say something about this one-party system. This system of one party -- I don't like it."
Ugandans, whose country a decade ago was a brutal dictatorship in economic collapse, are now preparing for President Clinton's visit with pride and great expectations. Some, like Mr. Katongole, are hoping that Mr. Clinton will push their President, Yoweri K. Museveni, to abandon the ban on party politics that has been the hallmark of his Government.
Others say they expect the Presidential visit to attract American investors. It is a chance, they say, for Ugandans to show the world that their country has been transformed from an economic basket case into a great place for doing business.
Still others are hoping that Mr. Clinton will come bearing gifts: grants for schools, infrastructure and the like.
What is certain is that when Mr. Clinton's airplane touches down at Entebbe Airport at 1:30 Tuesday morning, he will be entering a country that is a far cry from the dirt-poor and oppressed nation ruled by Milton Obote and Idi Amin in the 1970's and 1980's.
Mr. Museveni, a guerrilla leader who seized power in 1986, has won accolades not only for restoring security and the rule of law to most of the country, but also for liberalizing the economy, restricting the money supply, cutting the public payroll and raising taxes.
He has sold off Government-owned industries, scrapped currency controls and established free markets for coffee and the other commodities that power this economy, shoring up agricultural production and exports.
On paper, the result has been stunning, diplomats and economists say. Uganda has seen an average annual economic growth of 6.7 percent for the 12 years of Mr. Museveni's tenure.
But on the ground, Uganda, a fertile, rain-fed land the size of Oregon, remains one of the poorest countries on earth, with an average per capita income of around $260 a year. A guerrilla conflict in the north and west of the country has sapped the Government's resources, forcing Mr. Museveni to spend a fifth of the $1 billion annual budget just to keep the army supplied.
In the end, the country's growth has been phenomenal partly because the economy had sunk to such a low point in the mid-1980's. In addition, Mr. Museveni has been helped by aid from the United States and other major industrial countries who want to support his pro-market policies. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have provided loans and debt relief, and foreign aid now pays for about 46 percent of the national budget.
In 1996, Mr. Museveni won the first election to be held in 16 years by a landslide. His opponents were crippled by the ban on party activities. He has steadfastly delayed a return to party politics, arguing that economic development must come first and that parties have done nothing in Uganda's history but foment chaos and sectarian violence. A referendum on party politics is planned for 2000.
But aside from some grumbling from businesses about taxes and from opposition leaders about the one-party system, Mr. Museveni remains immensely popular. Most Ugandans who remember the days of Mr. Amin and Mr. Obote, when thousands of people were routinely imprisoned or killed for political reasons, see him as a savior.
For the White House, Mr. Museveni's Uganda is the perfect place for Mr. Clinton to promote his vision of America's new relationship with Africa, a partnership based on commerce rather than economic aid.
"This journey will be my opportunity and yours to help to introduce the people of the United States to a new Africa, an Africa whose political and economic accomplishments grow more impressive each month," President Clinton said this month.
In an interview today, Mr. Museveni said Mr. Clinton's policy of promoting commerce rather than economic aid was the best way to develop the continent. He added that he expected the visit to generate "trade, investment and tourism" for Uganda.
"I think Mr. Clinton has taken a wise decision by recognizing the potential of Africa, which others have not appeared to have recognized," he said. "I think this is good for America, not only for Africa."
But what Mr. Clinton sees is unlikely to be representative of Uganda's poorer regions. Ugandans have been sprucing up their capital and the three sites Mr. Clinton will visit, all of which are within 40 miles of Kampala.
In the capital, the police have removed hundreds of beggars, street children, prostitutes and the disabled from downtown Kampala, telling them to go elsewhere for a few days and putting some in temporary lodging outside the city.
Volunteers and civic groups have been working feverishly to sweep the streets, remove rubbish piles, repair sidewalks and fill potholes. Several roads where Mr. Clinton will travel have been repaved, and the shoulders have been repaired.
On Tuesday, Mr. Clinton will meet with Mr. Museveni and then fly to a grade school in Kisowera, about 12 miles east of the capital, where he is expected to give a speech and announce a new American aid program for education, Ugandan officials said. He will then go to Wanyange, a village near Jinja, the lake port about 36 miles further east, to see a program that provides loans to small entrepreneurs.
Wednesday will be dominated by a meeting with heads of state from East and Central Africa at a hotel in Entebbe, the Lake Victoria port 20 miles south of Kampala. The President is expected to fly to neighboring Rwanda in the morning for a quick visit.
The mood in Kampala is ebullient and excited. In dozens of interviews, residents said they saw Mr. Clinton's visit as a final confirmation that their country had been resurrected from the depths of dictatorship and has rejoined the world's respectable nations.
"Uganda used to synonymous with Idi Amin," Edith Ssempala, the Ugandan Ambassador to the United States, said on a talk radio program, echoing the views of many Kampala residents. "We are overcoming that, quite clearly."
Leila Lule, 36, a housewife, was also lending a hand with the cleanup operation. "It seems Uganda has become one of the countries that will develop," she said. "We have never had a President from America come to visit us here. It implies that maybe in the future there is something good for us -- development and modernization."
Down in the city's commercial area, owners of small businesses took a more pragmatic view of the President's visit. Several said the economic policies so admired by foreign diplomats and the World Bank had meant nothing to them but higher taxes, lower profits and less money in circulation.
They said they hoped that Mr. Clinton's entourage of American officials and business leaders would include investors who might put money into Uganda.
"It will help our Government bring investment here," said Godfrey Bukenya, 28, a partner in a tiny shop selling kettles, pots and pans. "We are finally recognized. We have a stable Government. We are moving forward."

HEADLINE: Yugoslavs Try to Outwit Albright Over Sanctions

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President, may have made just enough concessions over the conflict in Kosovo Province to confound Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's efforts to intensify Western sanctions against him, American and European officials said today.
Ms. Albright heads off to Europe on Monday evening to try to increase the pressure on Mr. Milosevic to open a serious discussion about political autonomy with the ethnic Albanians who make up 90 percent of the population of the province, which is in southern Serbia. 
 It will be a difficult test for American diplomacy. Even Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany said on Thursday, after meeting in Belgrade with Mr. Milosevic and with Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine of France, that "the demands we made have, generally speaking, been met."
Mr. Vedrine said that "significant progress has been achieved."
The Americans disagree, saying there has been only modest progress that can best be sustained through further pressure, like seizing Serbian and Yugoslav Government assets abroad and placing restrictions on foreign travel by Yugoslav officials.
Serbia and the much smaller Montenegro are the two republics that make up what is left of Yugoslavia since the secession of four other republics.
Ms. Albright and other officials have also implied that the United States may be prepared to use force to get Mr. Milosevic to recognize the "legitimate political rights" of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and to prevent a new ethnic conflict.
That threat, while kept vague and presumably meant to reinforce American diplomacy, has no support even among NATO allies who were willing to bomb the Bosnian Serbs into negotiating the Dayton accords of 1995 that ended nearly four years of war in Bosnia.
Ms. Albright will meet in Bonn on Wednesday with ministers of the five other members of the so-called contact group, which monitors events in Yugoslavia and the nations that broke away from it, to discuss further sanctions raised at the group's earlier meeting on Kosovo in London on March 9.
That emergency meeting -- of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States -- followed a vicious crackdown on Albanian separatists after separatists attacked Serbian police officers. At least 80 people died, many of whom were quickly buried in a mass grave.
At the time, Ms. Albright said, "We are not going to stand by and watch the Serb authorities do in Kosovo what they can no longer get away with doing in Bosnia."
She compared Serbian actions in Kosovo to the "ethnic cleansing" and war in Bosnia, to which the West was slow to respond.
Mr. Milosevic was the Serbian leader before he became the Yugoslav President, but he was considered a major supporter of Serbian aggression in Bosnia.
During the London meeting, Ms. Albright and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook of Britain had to spend three hours persuading three other members to consider actions like a comprehensive arms embargo against Serbia at the United Nations, a halt to supplying equipment that could be used for internal repression or terrorism, a denial of visas to those responsible for the Kosovo crackdown and an end to export credits to Belgrade for trade and investment.
The Russians were willing to agree only to the first two measures. And Moscow, which is Serbia's prime supplier of weapons and the traditional ally of the Orthodox Serbs, has since backed away from supporting a comprehensive arms ban.
To bolster support for further action, Ms. Albright will travel to Rome to meet with the Italian Foreign Minister, Lamberto Dini, whose country has been nearly as reluctant as Russia to crack down economically or diplomatically on Serbia. But her efforts on Friday to arrange a pre-Bonn meeting with Mr. Vedrine have not yet succeeded, because of scheduling problems, French officials say.
In London, the contact group demanded that in 10 days, Mr. Milosevic publicly agree to a number of steps: political negotiations with the Albanians, led by a moderate Albanian, Ibrahim Rugova, who has lost ground to more violent groups seeking independence; removal of the Serbian special police, who had been sent into the region where separatist activity was centered and who carried out the crackdown, and full access to the area for organizations like the International Committee of the Red Cross, the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Mr. Milosevic has not made an offer of talks. The current President of Serbia, Milan Milutinovic, did so, offering Kosovo "a great degree of self-rule," provided that the province remain part of Serbia.
American officials objected to the offer coming only from the Serbian president -- not, as demanded in London, from Mr. Milosevic -- and coming with conditions.
The Americans fear that even renewed autonomy for Kosovo within Serbia, a status Mr. Milosevic revoked in 1989, will not be enough to contain aspirations for independence that the recent violence has intensified. The American special envoy to the Balkans, Robert Gelbard, pressed the Albanians hard last week to line up behind Mr. Rugova.
The Americans are pressing for Kosovo to be given the status of a republic within Yugoslavia, like Montenegro. But Kosovo is the Serbs' historic heartland and Mr. Milosevic cannot afford to lose it, since even his democratic opposition opposes its separation from Serbia.
Mr. Milosevic has ignored the efforts of moderate Albanians to win more autonomy over the last eight years and thus contributed to the growth of the independence-minded Kosovo Liberation Army.
While the killings in Kosovo have stopped, the Serbian special police remain entrenched and are massing in the area of Drenica, the area of the earlier conflict, the State Department said on Friday, suggesting that more violence could erupt.
While senior American officials say Ms. Albright will not be content with "lowest common denominator" diplomacy from the contact group, the European concern is more complex than simply economic relations with Serbia.
They say the United States has done too little to criticize the Kosovo Liberation Army and has not been clear and forceful enough in saying that independence for Kosovo is unacceptable and unattainable. "By blaming Mr. Milosevic for everything," one senior European diplomat said, "Washington blames the violent Kosovars for nothing."
As the German Foreign Minister, Mr. Kinkel, said on Thursday in Belgrade, "Things are not so easy for President Milosevic as everyone believes." The difficulty for the United States is that Mr. Milosevic remains crucial to the success of the Dayton accords and stability in Bosnia, where United States troops have joined NATO forces on the ground. "In the end, he knows we need him," one American official conceded.
Warren Zimmerman, American Ambassador to Yugoslavia from 1989 to 1992 and now a professor of diplomacy at Columbia University, says the Clinton Administration did a good job, once the Kosovo crisis began, to move quickly to tamp it down.
"I'm much more sympathetic to the Administration and its efforts on Kosovo than over Bosnia, where they dithered," Mr. Zimmerman said. "But Kosovo is much more complicated than Bosnia."
To get a workable constitutional solution, Mr. Zimmerman said, international pressure is essential. "Even if we are forced to move unilaterally against Serbia," he said, "we need to convince other countries in the neighborhood, like Russia, why we're doing it."

Big Oil Producers Agree To Reduce Their Output
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico said they would cut their oil production and had received pledges of similar cuts from other nations. The move is expected to reverse the long decline in oil prices and eventually to increase the cost of gasoline at the pump. The oil ministers of the three nations said their countries would cooperate with others to cut production by 1.6 million to 2 million barrels a day from the current production of 75 million barrels.

Clinton Starts Africa Trip
President Clinton began a 12-day trip to Africa, the longest foreign visit of his Presidency and the first in a series of trips to four continents in four months. Mr. Clinton's journeys will keep him out of the United States for more than four weeks between now and early July. Cynics say his extensive itinerary has much to do with his domestic turmoil. A1 

Some Ugandans hope that President Clinton's visit will showcase the transformation of their country from a brutal dictatorship in collapse into an economic up-and-comer. Others hope it will attract investors to a country that is still one of the world's poorest. A6

Supreme Court to Take Up Definition of Disability
The Supreme Court is to hear arguments this month in a case that brings to the fore one of the most important unresolved issues under the Americans With Disabilities Act: the definition of disability. The question before the Court is whether the law applies to a person with H.I.V. who has not developed any of the acute conditions that come under the label of AIDS. A1
 
Conservatives Feel Betrayed
In private meetings, at conferences and on radio call-in shows, the talk among conservative Christian activists these days is of frustration and betrayal. People like Paul Weyrich say they have run out of patience as they watch their social agenda pushed to the back burner, year after year, or bargained away in legislative deal-making. A1
 
Privilege Claim Attacked
Leading Republicans attacked President Clinton for formally invoking executive privilege to block grand jury testimony of senior White House aides in the Monica S. Lewinsky inquiry. "It doesn't pass the smell test," Representative Dick Armey of Texas said on "Fox News Sunday." The White House countered that the Republicans were playing partisan politics. A13
 
Caterpillar Contract Approved
The United Auto Workers approved a six-year contract with Caterpillar, their first deal with the maker of heavy equipment since 1991. The contract covers roughly 13,000 Caterpillar workers. It lowers wages for new workers and gives the company greater power to limit overtime and use temporary workers. But current Caterpillar workers get raises and increased pension benefits, along with job security until 2004. A11
 
Energy Department Criticized
The Energy Department is now moving to find out more about how radioactive waste from the nuclear weapons plant in Hanford, Wash., moves through the soil. But some people are troubled by another problem: how the department avoided the question for so long and whether that reflects on its competency. A report scheduled for release today cites warnings to the department going back to 1989 that it needed to pay closer attention to the issue. A10
 
Dispute on Needle Program
A sharp disagreement between President Clinton's two key policy advisers on the issue of needle-exchange programs makes prospects for Government financing of such programs more unlikely when a ban on spending for them expires at the end of March. A10
 
11 Die in Cabin Fire
An early morning fire in Miles Township, Pa., killed all 11 campers in a mountain cabin Sunday, including high school and college students. Some reports indicated that a gas furnace had exploded, but state police said the cause of the fire had not yet been determined. A13

Welfare to Work Often Not the Sequence
The first survey of people who have left New York State's rapidly shrinking welfare rolls has found that the majority of former welfare recipients do not find legitimate full-time or part-time jobs within up to six months of leaving the rolls. The two-year study calls into question a basic premise of the nation's new welfare laws: that tougher restrictions nudge people from government dependency into jobs. A1

HEADLINE: U.A.W. Members Back Contract With Caterpillar, First Since '91

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., March 22

 BODY:
Members of the United Auto Workers voted today to approve a six-year contract with Caterpillar, the union's first such deal with the heavy-equipment maker since 1991.
"The agreement represents economic progress, security for the future and, perhaps above all, justice and dignity," said Steven Yokich, president of the U.A.W. 
 Just over 54 percent of the union workers voting on the deal nationwide approved it, the U.A.W. said in a statement. The agreement covers about 13,000 Caterpillar workers, most of them at plants in Aurora, Decatur, East Peoria and Pontiac. The contract also covers smaller numbers of workers in Pennsylvania, Colorado and Tennessee.
The vote at Local 974 in East Peoria, the largest local covered by the contract, was 55 percent to 45 percent, U.A.W. officials said. Union leaders said the contract was the best they could get and urged its passage.
The union approved a deal that included many of the provisions that started the dispute years ago, including a two-tiered wage system and limits on overtime pay.
"What are we going to do if they hire 1,000 people next week at $10 an hour and start displacing us?" said John Backes, a 24-year veteran at Caterpillar and a former candidate for president of the Peoria local. "We have no protection against that. It's time for us to unite and try to rebuild this union."
In the dispute between Caterpillar and the U.A.W., the union wanted to follow the pattern used in past contracts, but the company wanted more power to trim its work force, hold down pay and bring in temporary workers.
The last time the union faced this question, a month ago, the members rejected the contract, 58 percent to 42 percent. But that was when the company refused to rehire some workers the union said had been illegally dismissed. That issue was a sore spot with many union members, who considered the fate of those workers a matter of honor, especially because Caterpillar had asked the union to take back members who had abandoned U.A.W. strikes.
Caterpillar, based here in Peoria, then offered to re-hire all 160 of the disputed workers and submit to arbitration the cases of 200 others whose dismissals were not related to the contract battle.
The contract also establishes a two-tiered pay scale, lowering wages for new workers and giving the company greater power to limit overtime and use temporary workers. It introduces insurance co-payments for retirees but current workers get raises and increased pension benefits, along with job security until 2004.
The U.A.W. and Caterpillar have battled since their last contract expired, on Sept. 30, 1991. The dispute led to two long strikes, but Caterpillar forced the union back to work both times, primarily by hiring replacement workers and luring union members across the picket lines.
Caterpillar, the world's leading maker of earth-moving and construction equipment, has achieved record profits despite the years of turmoil. The company made almost $1.7 billion last year.
Many workers say the dispute has permanently damaged their relationship with the company.
"It caused a lot of hard feelings and bitterness," said Larry Wilson Primm, who had been dismissed by Caterpillar. "My kids and my grandkids will never work at Caterpillar. They know what it's like."

HEADLINE: Candidates Use Conference To Court the Hispanic Vote

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 22

 BODY:
Amid workshops on subjects like immigration, welfare reform and the status of Puerto Rico, there was the unmistakable, ever-present undertone of election-year politics during a statewide gathering of Hispanic elected officials here.
For many politicians, it was an opportunity to court the Hispanic vote. There was Peter F. Vallone, the New York City Council Speaker and gubernatorial candidate, walking from cocktail party to corridor, shaking hands and slapping backs. 
 There was Richard Kahan, a former state economic development official who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, standing in the lobby of the Omni Hotel, greeting the politicians, students and business leaders who came to the conference.
There was Representative Charles E. Schumer, a candidate for the United States Senate, speaking to a dinner crowd of more than 1,000, presenting a framed copy of remarks reprinted in the Congressional Record in which he lauded the conference.
Clearly, recent census and election data pointing to the growth in New York State's Hispanic population and political influence were not lost on the many candidates who attended this year's conference of the New York State Assembly and Senate Puerto Rican and Hispanic Task Force. The conference, known as Somos el Futuro (We Are the Future), has become something of a pilgrimage for the politically ambitious.
In a rousing banquet speech Saturday night, Representative Nydia M. Velazquez of Brooklyn spoke of the growing importance of the Hispanic vote in New York State, suggesting that it could provide the margin of victory in many of this year's contests. "We know that we've got the numbers and we can take the power," she told a cheering audience. "Decision makers who ignore us do so at their own risk."
Not all the major candidates attended, however. More than a few politicians at the conference commented on the absence of former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate, and District Attorney Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn, who is running for governor.
Still, all manner of political aspirant attended the conference, which ends Monday, from candidates for Congress to those hoping to be elected to a district leader spot. Those running for statewide office seemed to attract the most attention. And if the presence of political buttons was any gauge of popularity, Mr. Vallone seemed to be doing best.
Whether any of the candidates for statewide office made headway in garnering support was unclear. Many of the elected officials suggested that, at least among the politicians in attendance -- all Democrats -- no candidate seemed to have developed anything approaching momentum.
"So far, I don't get the sense that any of the Senate candidates are speaking to issues affecting Latinos," said Robert Quintana, a City Councilman from Buffalo. "But it's good for them to be here."
Representative Jose E. Serrano of the Bronx said: "There is a lot of jockeying going on here. But I don't get the sense that any one of the candidates has developed any degree of momentum yet."
The conference brought together not only virtually every Hispanic elected official in the state, but also a large number of candidates who are trying to replace them.
At Saturday night's banquet, for example, Mr. Serrano found himself seated with Luis Sepulveda, a Democratic district leader who has formed an exploratory committee to weigh a run against the Congressman. With Mr. Schumer between them, the two uttered not a word to each other.
Ms. Velazquez said she never actually saw New York City Councilman Martin Malave-Dilan of Brooklyn, who is considering opposing her in the Democratic primary. But the Councilman was nonetheless there.
Adriano Espaillat, a Democratic Assemblyman from the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, found himself repeatedly running into Victor Morisete-Romero, executive director of the Community Association of Progressive Dominicans, who is considering opposing the Assemblyman in the Democratic primary. In a continuation of an intense Washington Heights political feud, Guillermo Linares, the first Dominican-born City Councilman, said he would support Mr. Morisete-Romero should he run against Mr. Espaillat, the first Dominican-born member of the Assembly.
"You never know who you're going to run into here," Mr. Espaillat said.

HEADLINE: Most Dropped From Welfare Don't Get Jobs

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 22

 BODY:
A vast majority of people who have dropped off New York State's rapidly shrinking welfare rolls have not obtained legitimate jobs, a state survey indicates.
The survey found, among other things, that of the legions of people who came off the welfare rolls in New York City from July 1996 through March 1997, only 29 percent found full-time or part-time jobs in the first several months after they were no longer on public assistance. 
 The survey, which has been circulating among policymakers statewide and has been obtained by The New York Times, has raised questions among welfare experts about a bedrock premise of the nation's new welfare laws: that tougher restrictions move people from government dependency into jobs.
The survey, by the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, compared lists of people whose benefits ended during a given quarter of the year against records of wages that were reported to the state by employers in later quarters. Employers are required to file wage reports to the state each quarter.
Of the families in New York City who dropped off the rolls from July 1996 through September 1996, 32.7 percent showed earnings in the next quarter, according to the report. Of those who disappeared from the rolls from October through December, 32.2 percent showed wages in the next quarter. And of those who left the rolls from January through March 1997, 22.1 showed wages in the next quarter.
For the purposes of the study, anyone who made $100 or more in three months after leaving the rolls would have been counted as employed. The report does not distinguish between those who found full-time permanent jobs and those who found only part-time or occasional work.
The numbers were generally better statewide, where slightly more than one-third of families on average who left the rolls from July 1996 through March 1997 showed earnings at or above the $100 threshold.
The research provides a rare peek into the fate of those who leave welfare, though an imperfect one. It does not take into account people who are self-employed, work off the books or move out of New York. It also does not include those whose employers fail to report wage data promptly or are not required to report wages at all, like farm owners.
But the survey represents the first statistical attempt in New York to determine what has happened to the 480,000 people who have left the rolls of the two main welfare programs -- Aid to Families With Dependent Children and Home Relief -- across the state in the last three years, 350,000 of them in New York City. It also calls into question claims by state and city officials that the steep reductions in caseloads are strong evidence that their welfare initiatives are working.
The figures are especially useful because the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has resisted requests to release records that would allow an independent survey of former welfare recipients. The administration has also declined to conduct such a survey itself.
Dan Hogan, the executive deputy commissioner for the State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, warned against drawing too many conclusions from the state survey. He said that the disparity between the number of people reporting wages from one quarter to the next was one indication of the survey's imprecision.
He added that the state intended to develop more precise ways of determining the fate of former welfare recipients, including cross-checking the names of former recipients against labor statistics over a longer period than officials currently do. That change, he said, would make up for employers who do not report employee wages to the state on a timely basis and thereby make it seem as if some former recipients are unemployed when they actually have jobs.
"Are we satisfied that these numbers tell us enough? No," Mr. Hogan said. "We want to know more."
But Marcia Meyers, an assistant professor of social work at Columbia University who specializes in welfare policy, said the survey provided a singular opportunity to gauge the overall impact of the changes in welfare policy championed by Mr. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki. The changes include cutting off aid to recipients who fail to comply with requirements to work for their benefits, commonly known as workfare.
"Up to now, there have been claims and counterclaims about the success of welfare reform, but there has been no data with which to evaluate those claims," she said. "This really gives us the first glimpse of life after welfare, and it is alarming."
Experts and advocates for the poor say that despite the limitations of the study's methods, its income threshold was so low -- a mere $100 over three months -- that poor people should have shown up in the labor statistics if they indeed had jobs. They say the state's research provided the strongest evidence yet that people were being knocked off the welfare rolls by a host of new sanctions and rules even though they had no prospect of legitimate employment.
The advocates say the numbers help confirm what they have long suspected: that the stringent policies of the Pataki and Giuliani administration are driving thousands of former welfare recipients into deeper poverty, not self-sufficiency.
"The more people you require to be in workfare, the greater the opportunity will be to sanction them for failing to comply," said Shelly Nortz, a policy analyst and lobbyist for New York State Coalition for the Homeless. "That policy is just going to drive more and more people off the welfare rolls even though there aren't enough jobs for them."
The situation will only get worse, advocates say, because new welfare rules enacted in Washington require the state to both place greater numbers of recipients into so-called workfare assignments and cut off assistance to those who fail to comply with those assignments.
Among the other interesting findings in the survey is one that deals with childless single, able-bodied adults who received aid under the state-financed program called Home Relief. Those who support making the welfare system more restrictive have often pointed to this group, made up mostly of men, as the most employable and therefore the least in need of public assistance.
But the study appears to support an assertion by welfare advocates that many people on Home Relief are drug addicts or mentally ill, or suffer from other problems that make them difficult to employ.
The study showed that about 20 percent of the people who left Home Relief in New York City from July 1996 through March 1997 had reported earning at least $100 in the immediate months after they stopped being on the rolls. Statewide, the average was about 23 percent.
The state, however, fared much better when New York City was not factored in, with an average of 30 percent of the people who left Home Relief showing incomes a few months after their public assistance was stopped, the report showed.
Anne Erickson, the legislative coordinator for the New York Upstate Law Project, an advocacy group for the poor, said the numbers were particularly distressing because they come at a time when a good economy has allowed the most employable people to get jobs and leave the welfare rolls.
"The true test will be when the economy takes an inevitable downturn and the people who remain on the caseload are less-skilled and harder to serve," she said. "It's troubling."
But Mr. Hogan said the state was using the money it had saved from caseload reductions and reinvesting it in creating more child-care slots, job-training programs and other initiatives aimed at getting people into jobs.

HEADLINE: 3 BIG OIL NATIONS JOIN TO ANNOUNCE A PRODUCTION CUT

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico, in a surprising show of cooperation, said yesterday that they would cut their crude oil production and that they had received pledges from other countries to make similar reductions in a move that is expected to reverse the sharp decline in oil prices.
The cutbacks are likely to contribute to a jump in gasoline prices, which have fallen below $1 a gallon in some parts of the United States. 
 Oil industry analysts said the agreement was significant because Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, and Venezuela, one of the largest, were leading a unified effort to rein in production. Until now, each country had been waiting for the other to cut its oil output first.
Moreover, analysts said, Mexico's unusual role as a leader in this effort demonstrated a broad commitment among many oil-producing countries to restrain production to raise prices. Mexico, unlike Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and is not subject to the production quotas the group sets.
Oil prices have fallen sharply from the $23-a-barrel range since October, reaching a nine-year low of $12.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange early last week before ending Friday at $14.61 for the most active futures contract. In early trading today in Asia, however, oil prices soared as high as $16.50 a barrel.
If Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico succeed in their effort to reduce oil production sharply, "we could see crude oil prices go up by $3 to $4 a barrel," said Ann-Louise Hittle, the director for world oil at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an energy consulting group based in Cambridge, Mass.
Kevin Lindemer, a senior director at Cambridge, said gasoline prices at the pump would rise by about 10 cents a gallon in a month if oil prices rose by $4 a barrel and remained at that level.
Some previous efforts by OPEC to restrain oil output have failed because its members have cheated on their production quotas. But the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico seemed confident yesterday that they would be able to join with other countries, including those that are not members of OPEC, to cut oil production by 1.6 million to 2 million barrels a day from the current worldwide production of about 75 million barrels a day.
They said that their countries and others had already pledged cuts of as much as 1.1 million barrels a day, beginning in April, and that they expected to get commitments of even bigger cuts in the next several days.
The agreement was reached in talks that began on Friday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and continued over the weekend, mainly between Ali Naimi, the Oil Minister of Saudi Arabia; Luis Tellez, the Energy Minister of Mexico, and Erwin Arrieta, the Oil Minister of Venezuela.
Ms. Hittle, the Cambridge analyst, said that for prices to rise significantly, the three nations have to reach their goal of cutting production by two million barrels a day and demonstrate the discipline to maintain those cutbacks for the foreseeable future.
Ms. Hittle said there were about two million barrels of surplus production in the world during the first three months of this year and that cuts of this magnitude would eventually consume that oversupply.
John Lichtblau, the chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a research group based in Manhattan, said nations that pledged to cut production would be under great pressure to abide by the cuts. "If they pledge and play games, then the market will lose total confidence in their ability to maintain production curbs," he said. "Then they would all be worse off."
The glut of oil, along with a mild winter in the Northeast, has contributed to a drop in gasoline prices, which have fallen to as little as 75 cents a gallon for regular gasoline in some parts of the country. The Lundberg Survey of 10,000 service stations nationwide said the average price for all grades of gasoline had fallen nearly 2 cents in the last two weeks, to $1.07 a gallon.
The move by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico comes at a time when gasoline prices normally begin to rise as Americans increase their driving with the improving spring weather.
Many industry analysts had been predicting that the economic pain from the sharp decline in oil revenues would eventually force oil-producing countries to reach some agreement to rein in production. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela are highly dependent on the revenue from oil for their economic well-being and the dollars needed to purchase vital goods.
In their statement yesterday, the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Mexico alluded to this economic pain, saying, "It is feared that such a drop in oil prices could lead to a reduction in the investments needed to secure international supplies, which would destabilize the world economy in the medium term."
The major OPEC producers have been reluctant to act on their own, because in the past when they showed restraint, major non-OPEC producers like Mexico and Norway would pump all the oil they could, taking away revenue and often blunting the effect of OPEC cutbacks.
Mexico's Energy Ministry said yesterday that it had instructed Pemex, the huge state-owned oil company, to cut exports by 100,000 barrels a day.
The ministry also said that Venezuela had agreed to cut its exports by 200,000 barrels a day and that Saudi Arabia would cut its exports by 300,000 barrels a day.
The three countries did not identify the other oil producers that had pledged to join in the cutback. But Kuwait, Nigeria and Indonesia were among the countries reported to have promised export cuts.
Reuters quoted Tore Sandvold, the director general of the Norwegian Oil and Energy Ministry, as saying that while Norway was not ready to take steps to make cuts, it had not excluded that possibility.
Mr. Lichtblau of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation said the major significance of yesterday's step was that Saudi Arabia and Venezuela were able to overcome their differences.
To Saudi Arabia's consternation, Venezuela has flagrantly ignored the quotas set by OPEC last November, pumping all the oil it could produce to gain more market share, particularly in North America.
The cheating on the quotas by OPEC members, combined with the warm weather and decline in the growth of demand in Southeast Asia due to the economic crisis there, has led to a continuing decline in oil prices since November.
With more Iraqi oil coming on the market because of the easing of United Nations sanctions, there was a growing consensus that only firm action by major producers could prevent the continuing slide.

HEADLINE: Clinton Packs Up His Care and Woe To Trot the Globe

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22

 BODY:
President Clinton left the country today. And you had better get used to it.
The 12-day trip to Africa that Mr. Clinton began today is not merely the longest foreign visit of his Presidency; it is also the first in a series of trips that will sweep him away to four continents in four months. Those travels will keep him out of the country for more than four weeks between now and early July. 
 All in all, not a bad itinerary for a fellow under fire from an independent counsel, assorted lawyers and a pack of Congressmen who have taken to occasional mutterings about impeachment.
"I believe he's looking forward to his trip," the President's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, said mildly on Friday, as the latest wave in the Paula Corbin Jones case crashed over his head.
Cynics, wags and Republicans have been quick to invoke a time-tested political rule to explain Presidential wanderlust, citing the example of President Richard M. Nixon's 1974 visit to Egypt during his Watergate turmoil.
"If you're in trouble, go abroad," said Lyn Nofziger, the former strategist for President Ronald Reagan. "It changes the subject pretty thoroughly."
But advisers to Mr. Clinton dismiss that idea, noting that while his schedule has been rearranged and expanded a bit in recent weeks, most of his overseas destinations for the year were picked long before Ms. Jones's sexual misconduct lawsuit against him made Monica S. Lewinsky a household name.
Weighty matters of foreign policy -- not the tangled wranglings of domestic politics and legal actions, White House aides insist, with some exasperation, are what have turned the President into a rolling stone.
Which is not to say that the White House is unhappy at the prospect of television's carrying images of Mr. Clinton preoccupied with affairs of global security and economics, and standing beside the likes of Nelson Mandela, the President of South Africa.
"Pictures of the President as a world leader are always nice," an Administration official conceded, on condition of anonymity.
But, he added, that is far from the reason for Mr. Clinton's trip to Africa.
"It's something that he's always wanted to do, and he feels that it's an important part of the world that doesn't get enough attention," this official said.
In fact, Presidential trips themselves do not receive the attention they once did. With the cold war over, superpower prestige, ego and security are no longer perceived to depend as much on the fates of tiny countries, including some African ones Mr. Clinton is visiting.
Partly to insure some coverage of the trip back home, the Administration has loaded the President up with what officials call "deliverables" -- new programs, like increased financing for education and food security, for Mr. Clinton to announce. White House aides also note that the trip has already received widespread attention among American blacks, one of the Democrats' most important constituencies.
"There are audience segments that pay a lot of attention," another White House aide said.
Further, officials said, they have learned that Mr. Clinton can generate news on a domestic issue, like the budget, just as easily from abroad.
Whatever the vagaries of coverage and political reaction in the United States, Presidents are assured a personal boost from wall-to-wall foreign coverage and from ecstatic crowds lining motorcade routes and filling cobbled or dirt plazas.
"Foreign travel does a lot for a President under siege in terms of his own psyche," said Marlin Fitzwater, the former press secretary for Presidents Reagan and George Bush. "Every President enjoys traveling in foreign countries because it makes him feel like a President again."
After focusing his first Presidential campaign on domestic issues, Mr. Clinton found himself, to his aggravation and occasional dismay, repeatedly distracted in his first term by foreign policy crises like Somalia. But he has grown to relish his foreign policy duties, aides say, and no longer feels the need to rely on more experienced mentors in his decision-making. He is said to love the travel and the opportunities it provides to soak up information, trivia and stories.
After his trip to Africa, Mr. Clinton plans to go to Latin America next month for the Summit of the Americas in Santiago, Chile. In May, he plans to go to Birmingham, England, for an annual economic summit meeting. The White House has been adding stops to that trip, including a visit to Berlin before and perhaps one to Northern Ireland at the end. And while he is in Europe, Mr. Clinton just might bop over to Moscow.
The President is expected to be back in the United States in plenty of time for the Jones trial, which is scheduled to begin on May 27 in Little Rock, Ark. Having already given a deposition, he does not have to testify in the trial. But his advisers are holding open the option of having him appear in his own defense.
Then, in June, Mr. Clinton is off again. He is planning to make a 10-day trip to China, beginning near the end of that month.
The China trip was originally scheduled for November, but last week the White House moved it up, saying the President was eager to preserve momentum in relations with China. White House aides insisted the change in plans had nothing to do with the Jones trial.
Later in the year, Mr. Clinton plans a trip to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, as well as one to Malaysia.
The Africa trip is planned to be the longest of the year -- indeed, the longest foreign tour of any President at least since Mr. Reagan went to Europe in the spring of 1985. White House aides said the schedule was driven by Mr. Clinton's desire to make what he has called the first "serious trip to Africa" of any President.
"If you're going to do this," a senior Administration official said, "to have the story be all the places you didn't go versus all the places you did go would be to pay a big price for not spending a couple of extra days." As it is, Mr. Clinton will still visit only 6 of the 48 sub-Saharan countries: Ghana, Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, Botswana and Senegal.
Mr. Clinton's advisers describe African nations as poised for extraordinary growth the way Asian countries were in the 1960's and 70's.
"So many of these countries are at a lift-off point," the Administration official said. Decades hence, this official and others believe, the visit may appear to be a historic moment, cementing American and African ties.
Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said, "One of the overriding goals of this trip is to help Americans rethink Africa, and Africans rethink America."
For all the high-minded foreign policy goals, some Clinton advisers expect little to change in their daily routines besides the food and the scenery. The 800-member traveling delegation includes scores of reporters attuned to the continuing investigations back home.
Asked at a news conference if there was no "side benefit" to Mr. Clinton's "getting out of town for a couple of weeks," Mr. Berger said, "Well, you come with us."
Some aides hold out the hope that reporters might get a dose of perspective upon witnessing the troubles of some African nations.
"They don't have the luxury of getting diverted to the kinds of stories we've gotten diverted to in the last eight weeks," a Clinton adviser said.
But because reporters have had little chance to question Mr. Clinton about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and recent developments in the investigations, White House aides expect a joint news conference by Mr. Clinton and Mr. Mandela on Friday to turn into a circus.
"It's probably a safe bet," one of Mr. Clinton's advisers said sourly.
That is one event for which the White House seems rather uninterested in generating much of an audience. It is scheduled for 11:20 A.M. in Cape Town -- 4:20 A.M. in Washington.

HEADLINE: Religious Right, Frustrated, Trying New Tactic on G.O.P.

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Early in March, Paul Weyrich, the godfather of social conservatives, summoned about 25 prominent leaders from the religious and political right for a secret meeting in his office here overlooking the rail yards behind Union Station.
They fumed that they had been used and abused, like some cheap date. In one election after another, they said, conservative foot soldiers had dutifully worked the phone banks, walked the precincts and turned out masses of voters for Republican candidates who had promised action on issues like abortion, pornography and homosexuality. And the Republicans, they complained, had consistently failed to deliver. 
 In private meetings like Mr. Weyrich's, at conferences and on radio call-in shows, the talk among conservative Christian organizers these days is of frustration and betrayal. They say they have run out of patience as they watch their social agenda pushed to the back burner year after year, or bargained away in legislative deals.
"There is virtually nothing to show for an 18-year commitment," laments Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, who once served in the Reagan White House.
"What I hear these days," said Tom Jipping, a co-host of the program "Capitol Watch," which appears on the conservative network America's Voice, "is a huge dissatisfaction with the assumption made 20 years ago that the Republican Party was the best vehicle for achieving public policy goals."
Such talk might sound surprising, given the Republicans' promotion of conservative Christian priorities like ending late-term abortion, instituting a $500-a-child tax credit and stemming the tide of Internet smut.
But many of them believe the Republicans they have helped to elect have been too timid and too passive at every crucial juncture. Far from having too much power in the Republican Party, as many moderate Republicans assert, leaders of the religious right assert they have much too little.
The "good soldier" strategy, of compromising with moderates in the party and settling for incremental gains, was a failure, in the view of many religious conservatives, and they are calling for a new militancy.
Some Christian conservatives like James Dobson, whose daily Focus on the Family radio show draws 5 million listeners, have threatened to bolt the Republican Party. But his colleagues acknowledge that abandoning the party is unlikely, and that much of the recent saber-rattling is intended to test the party's mettle. If the meeting in Mr. Weyrich's office is any indication, the movement's leaders are more likely to try to consolidate their forces and push the Republican Party to put issues like abortion, sexual morality and family values in the forefront of every campaign and legislative session.
"The go-along, get-along strategy is dead," said Richard Land, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. "No more engagement. We want a wedding ring, we want a ceremony, we want a consummation of the marriage."
Republican Party leaders appeared to be taking steps to quell the discontent. Just recently, a Republican Party leader said, Speaker Newt Gingrich met with Pat Robertson, the Christian Coalition founder, and with, Ralph Reed, the former coalition president, and agreed to press three initiatives important to Christian conservatives: the religious freedom amendment, which Christian conservatives hope would reintroduce prayer in the schools; tax deferrals for tuition at religious and private schools; and elimination of financial support for the National Endowment for the Arts.
In the meeting, the party leader said, Mr. Gingrich made a commitment to involve party leaders in promoting these issues heavily, and to bring all three pieces of legislation to votes in the House before the November elections.
In a separate, recent gathering, Mr. Dobson met with Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, and other principal House Republicans, who also promised to put Christian conservative concerns at the top of their list. After that meeting, Mr. Dobson quickly canceled interviews he had arranged with reporters and editors at the Washington Bureau of The New York Times and the editorial board of The Washington Post, saying that he had been persuaded to hold his fire.
Back at the meeting in Mr. Weyrich's office, on March 2, the participants agreed that the time had come for a muscular strategy. Some favored forming a political party, but that was shot down as impractical and self-defeating, said two people who attended the meeting. Some urged Mr. Dobson to run for the Republican Presidential nomination, to which Mr. Dobson is said to have replied, "I'm not the savior, I'm John the Baptist" -- the prophet who points the way.
They resolved to lay aside their past rivalries and form what they called an "independent political force" that would speak with one voice, line up behind one Presidential candidate and collaborate on finding state and local candidates to champion their agenda.
Mr. Weyrich was named the chairman. Lawyers are researching how to incorporate the group, and the participants planned to keep it all quiet until they could refine the proposal at the next meeting.
Mutual desperation is not the only reason for the collaboration. Another factor is that Mr. Reed, the pragmatist who pioneered the strategy of compromise and incremental progress, is no longer at the helm of the Christian Coalition. Mr. Reed and Mr. Bauer had been frequent rivals, clashing on matters of style and strategy, their colleagues say.
Mr. Bauer is more of a purist and less prone to compromise. Mr. Bauer consults regularly with Mr. Dobson, and their organizations operated together for several years.
Now, with Mr. Reed off pursuing his career as a political consultant, the opportunity arises for a meeting of both minds and methods. The new president of the Christian Coalition, Donald P. Hodel, once worked for Mr. Dobson. Mr. Bauer made a point in a recent interview that he had spent a half hour on the telephone that morning talking congenially with Mr. Hodel.
"We really are working more closely together than I ever was willing to work with the previous leadership," Mr. Bauer said.
The impact of these personal ties has already been demonstrated in two recent House and Senate races in California and in Illinois. In both states, the Christian Coalition and Mr. Bauer's new political action committee, the Campaign for Working Families, invested heavily in the races of two upstart Republican candidates who beat more moderate Republicans backed by local party officials in the primaries.
In both states, Mr. Bauer's PAC paid for television advertisements (spending $200,000 in California alone), while the Christian Coalition blanketed churches with voters guides. In both states, their candidates won the primaries, although one lost in the general election.
The Republican Party is built on an uneasy alliance of social conservatives, a constituency that includes the religious right, and economic conservatives, committed to a smaller-government, lower-tax agenda.
"The two constituencies are married to each other," said one Republican Party official who labors at keeping the peace between factions, and did not want to be named. "If one could survive without the other, you'd have seen a break long before now. If one component spins off, the party is marginalized."
But it is not an easy marriage. The social conservative forces suffered through disillusionment over how much was left undone by the Reagan Administration.
Conservative Christians sensed a second chance four years ago, when they played a major role in electing a Republican Congress. But Republican leaders, with the acquiescence of conservative Christian strategists led by Mr. Reed, pushed their economic and political agenda before tackling the social issues. Their "revolution" lost much of its energy in that first year, their majority narrowed in the 1996 elections and much of the social agenda was left unfinished.
Moreover, the Republican primary for President split open the fault lines underlying the movement. The purists backed Patrick J. Buchanan or Alan Keyes. The pragmatists backed former Senator Bob Dole, the party standard-bearer. Mr. Dole won the endorsement of Mr. Robertson, chairman of the Christian Coalition.
The disenchantment with the Republican Party deepened as Mr. Dole, in an effort to play to the center, remained mute on nearly every issue dear to Christian conservative voters. "Bob Dole did everything he could to insult" them, Mr. Dobson said in a recent speech in Arizona.
On March 12 at the headquarters of the Christian Coalition in Chesapeake, Va., the staff members who sit at computers answering letters said they were still getting mail from supporters angry that Mr. Robertson and the Christian Coalition squandered the election on Mr. Dole and were allied too closely with the Republican Party.
From its offices in an industrial park, the coalition is regrouping after a series of setbacks. The group lost much of its visibility when its ubiquitous leader, Mr. Reed, left last year. And the Federal Election Commission is investigating possible illegal in-kind contributions from the coalition to the Republican Party.
Donations to the coalition dropped to $17 million last year from a high of $26.2 million in 1996 (though a spokesman, Arne Owens, said that so far this year, contributions were rebounding). The group laid off about one-fifth of its staff, folded its magazine and discontinued two fledgling programs: the Catholic Alliance and the Samaritan Project, an outreach to black churches.
Replacing Mr. Reed are Randy Tate, the executive director, a boyish former Republican Congressman from Washington State, and Mr. Hodel, the president, who served as a Cabinet secretary in the Reagan Administration for seven years. The two said they would seek to avoid a repeat of 1996 when it appeared, because of Mr. Robertson's endorsement, that the coalition had thrown its weight behind a moderate Republican Presidential candidate.
"Both Randy and I have a great reluctance to repeat what was done in 1996," Mr. Hodel said in an interview in his office.
The highest priority right now, said several major leaders, is to identify, groom and promote the next generation of conservative politicians for local races.
"It's time," said Mr. Land of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, "for candidates who will not only work with us, but for candidates who are us." He added that they particularly needed to find women to run and to speak out against abortion.
But the Presidential race in 2000 is nevertheless a major focus of energy and resources for the conservatives. Mr. Dobson says he is considering taking a leave from Focus on the Family, a nonprofit organization that cannot legally endorse candidates, so that he can campaign for candidates in local races and endorse a candidate for President.
Mr. Bauer is encouraging the speculation that he will run for President. "I call this the semi-Oval Office," Mr. Bauer said in a recent interview at his Family Research Council headquarters.
The council occupies a new six-story, marble-floored headquarters in Washington paid for by two Michigan families, including Helen and Rich DeVos. The late Mr. DeVos was a co-founder of the Amway Corporation. The building houses a radio studio and television taping room, a fitness center, 85 employees and 13 interns learning how to lobby.
Mr. Bauer says that his PAC, only 13 months old, has raised $2.7 million, making it the 12th largest in the nation. He says he is considering whether to take a leave at the end of this year to form an exploratory committee for a Presidential run.
"We want to put these issues of what's happening with American values at the center of the campaign," Mr. Bauer said. "And if nobody's willing to do it, I'm interested. If I see someone else I think is serious, I would say, there he is, leave me alone."
Yet there is no shortage of bigger names who have signaled their interest in courting social conservatives, among them Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri, Rep. John R. Kasich of Ohio, former Vice President Dan Quayle, and Steve Forbes, the millionaire publisher who ran for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1996.
All of which prompts a question from some Republicans. "If you look at the potential field in 2000," said the Republican official, "everybody could be left scratching their heads saying, 'What more do you want?' There are two or three or maybe four credible candidates embracing their issues. What more could a movement want?"

HEADLINE: At the Hospital, a New Doctor Is In

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL ZUGER 

 BODY:
ANYONE who has been a patient or a visitor on an ordinary medical ward in an American hospital knows the usual routine. During the day a steady parade of residents, nurses, aides, students, therapists, nutritionists and social workers marches in and out of the room, but the doctor responsible for a patient's welfare is not among them.
Instead, the doctor usually makes a brief bedside appearance early in the morning or late in the evening. During standard work hours the doctor is in an office seeing outpatients. A sick patient in the hospital may receive phone calls or benefit from the occasional mad dash from office to hospital, but thoughtful face-to-face contact waits for after-hours. 
 Now the routine is changing in some American hospitals. Impelled by factors from insurers' impatience with a costly and inefficient system to doctors' frustrations with their inability to be in two places at once, a new species of doctor is evolving.
These new doctors are inpatient specialists, often called hospitalists, and they spend their workdays caring for hospitalized patients, taking over for patients' regular doctors.
From scattered beginnings less than a decade ago, the ranks of these specialists are growing fast. About 2,000 now practice across the country, with a new national organization lending structure to their role.
Studies consistently show that hospitalizations are 15 percent to 25 percent shorter when hospitalists care for patients, and hospital costs also go down 15 percent to 25 percent, said Dr. Robert M. Wachter, chief of medical service at Moffitt-Long Hospital in San Francisco. Dr. Wachter is an inpatient specialist and an expert on the new system.
Large health maintenance organizations are among the most enthusiastic users of inpatient specialists for these reasons, as well as for the fact that the specialists free doctors to see their full quota of outpatients on time.
But hospitalists are also among the most controversial figures on the medical scene. Critics argue that while they may promote efficiency and lower costs, their role threatens to undermine the traditional relationship between patient and doctor. If a doctor abandons a longtime patient at the hospital door, just when the patient needs the doctor most, they say, trust begins to crumble.
Critics also contend that valuable information about a patient's life and illnesses -- ranging from allergies and blood tests to preferences for end-of-life care -- may be lost as care is transferred from one doctor to another.
Advocates of the new system counter the criticisms. The Norman Rockwell doctor who takes solo care of a patient from womb to tomb has become a myth anyway, they say. Group practice already fragments a patient's care, while computerized data bases can insure that details about a patient's health are never lost.
Furthermore, statistics show that doctors admit far fewer patients to the hospital than they used to, and hospitalized patients are sicker than they used to be, forcing office doctors to maintain the difficult technical skills of caring for acutely ill patients even though they use them less and less often.
"In 1978 the average internist spent almost half of his or her time in the hospital, caring for 10 to 15 patients at a time," Dr. Wachter said, while now 10 percent of the doctors' time is spent in the hospital, where they may care for only one or two patients at a time.
"Once you're down below a certain number it may just make more sense on a lot of levels, both economics and quality, to have someone else take on that role," Dr. Wachter said. "And as institutions and physicians are under more pressure to be efficient this becomes a very attractive way of doing it."
Medically, patients seem to fare about as well under one system as the other, Dr. Wachter said. But often patients -- and doctors -- have distinct preferences.
In Springfield, Mass., Dr. Winthrop F. Whitcomb has been working as an inpatient specialist since 1994 in a group practice that provides round-the-clock care to patients in a community hospital. "I loved it from the beginning," said Dr. Whitcomb, a co-founder of the new National Association of Inpatient Physicians. "I was available for patients in the hospital and for their families through times of serious illness in a way that I wasn't when I was in the office setting."
Over the years just the steady presence of a few familiar doctors in his hospital during the day has begun to improve the hospital's overall functioning, Dr. Whitcomb said.
"Because we're here all the time, when there's a systems problem we're more motivated to try to fix things," he said.
"We end up spending a lot of the day on the phone," he said, "talking to the outpatient doctor and letting them know what's going on with the patient."
But in Granite Hill, N.C., Dr. Sanford Guttler is a family doctor who continues to take care of his own patients in the hospital. "Some of my colleagues continue to practice the usual way, and some have given up their hospital practice," he said. "They're all happy and all think they're doing the right thing. The hospitalists in town are very busy. But I'm still staying the course."
Dr. Guttler finds that patients are so grateful to see a familiar face in the hospital that he continues his hospital work, although every patient he admits extends his workday further into the night.
"The guys who don't have a hospital practice may think they're going to read a discharge summary from the hospitalist and understand what happened in the hospital," he said, "but I don't think you really get the full picture if you're not there every day."
In Britain and Canada, a system of separate inpatient and outpatient doctors has been widely used for decades. But when Dr. Warren Rubenstein, family physician in chief at the Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, was able to establish a ward in his hospital where he could care for his own patients in the usual American way, his patients were delighted, he said. "They'd say, 'I can't believe you're here to take care of me,' " he said.
Dr. Rubenstein's unit closed last summer and now he is back to signing his inpatients over to a hospitalist's care. "The patients were devastated," he said. "You have a person you know for 20 years, and now all of a sudden they're taken care of by some stranger in the hospital."
Without inpatients to care for, Dr. Rubenstein's work life is "a little easier," he said. "But I didn't mind the extra work. It made for better health care."
A new hospitalist program at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan is intended to smooth the stays of patients with rare or complicated conditions who are admitted to wards staffed by interns and residents. On these teaching wards, attending physicians who are legally responsible for patient care have traditionally come to the wards only for several hours a day for one month or two out of the year. Inpatient doctors, on the other hand, are present throughout the day for half of the year. The rest of the time is devoted to teaching and caring for outpatients.
"It's the nature of medicine to be skeptical of any change," said Dr. Allen I. Hyman, chief of staff at the medical center. But hiring young, enthusiastic hospitalists to teach residents and students the efficient use of hospital resources has been "one of my happy achievements," he said.
Dr. Roy Lackey has worked as a Columbia-Presbyterian hospitalist for a year and a half. On a recent morning he checked on his dozen or so patients admitted for conditions ranging from diabetes to cancer with a team of medical residents and other professionals.
Dr. Lackey knew none of these patients before he became their doctor in the hospital. Still, he said, the paradox is that the hospitalist may actually reduce rather than increase the fragmentation of medical care for poor urban patients without regular doctors who rely on emergency rooms or clinics for care.
"We're here to trouble-shoot," he said. The hospitalist can arrange for smooth transitions to outpatient care, and often comes to know quite well the patients who are repeatedly hospitalized, Dr. Lackey said.
Packing his belongings to head home after one of his frequent admissions for sickle-cell anemia, Barry D. Fredericks, one of Dr. Lackey's patients, was philosophic about the system. Mr. Fredericks's regular doctor is a hematology specialist he has known for about 10 years, but when he is admitted to the hospital, he has become used to getting care from strangers.
"It gets kind of frustrating," said Mr. Fredericks, 30. "You want your doctor there." But he said his recovery from a serious blood clot in the lungs had gone well, and his doctor had stayed informed throughout.
"The input of all camps made for a positive outcome," he said.

The new 'I Love NY' commercials do without the Governor.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE custodians of the "I Love NY" campaign seem to have decided that Governors, tall and rugged-looking as they may be, are perhaps not actually scenic wonders.
Gov. George E. Pataki, whose prominence in last year's "I Love New York" tourism advertising generated vociferous complaints from critics, is notably absent from the initial batch of commercials for 1998, a year in which the Governor is up for re-election. The spots, which are scheduled to begin running this week, continue using a theme introduced in 1997 -- "What did you expect? This is New York" -- but omit any star turns by the Governor or members of his family, who also appeared last year. 
 Three commercials by Toolbox, a small agency hired last year to work on tourism advertising for the New York State Department of Economic Development, compare scenic attractions around the state -- wineries, white water rapids and canals -- with tourist destinations like France, the American West and Venice. The goal is to persuade busy baby boomers who live in New York State, the Northeast and eastern Canada that they can save money and time by visiting nearby locales in New York State.
"Baby boomers who are squeezed for 'quality time' are the real audience for us," said Jan Zlotnick, a partner and co-creative director at Toolbox in New York. "This is a perfect opportunity to surprise them that they can go white water rafting, winery-hopping or cruising down canals in New York."
For instance, in the winery commercial, a young woman pedals her bicycle through a beautiful vineyard as French music plays in the background. As an older man proffers her a glass of red wine, an announcer says, "There are over 100 wineries right here in New York."
After the young woman sniffs and drinks the wine, she pronounces it "magnifique." The man replies, in a French-accented voice: "What did you expect? This is New York." The spot ends with the familiar four notes of the "I Love NY" jingle, which was created in 1977.
The campaign was developed after research showed that time- and budget-pressed boomers "want to do something different," Mr. Zlotnick said, and "want that experience to be something memorable, even if they have only three, four or five days and $500 or $1,000 to spend."
"If we can tell people you can do it in New York," he added, "it opens up a whole new world to them of convenience and affordability."
Unlike last year, when the Pataki family helped proclaim the unexpectedness of New York, the commercials are politician-free.
"We're trying to show scenic areas," said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, "and we felt just showing the scenes was good enough."
Mr. Gargano said the decision to exclude the Governor was not related to the forthcoming gubernatorial election or the attacks on his role as a pitchman last year.
Mr. Zlotnick said, "It's always a creative decision and a strategic decision as to what works best with the spots." The state officials responsible for tourism "have been really good," he added, "about going with our instincts about what's best in connecting with this sophisticated and very jaded travel audience."
One insistent critic from last year is declaring himself satisfied.
"Whatever their motivation, it's a good thing," said Gene Russianoff, senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group, an advocacy organization, because "it's smarter on their part not to have this as an election issue."
"It's easier to compose a pretty scene without elected officials in it," he added, laughing, "no matter how good they look."
New York City is missing in action along with Governor Pataki in that none of the initial commercials take place in the five boroughs. Previously, spots showing Governor and Mrs. Pataki in Times Square and other Manhattan locations had been interspersed with spots centered on nonurban activities like fishing.
"Certainly we're going to cover New York City" in future commercials, Mr. Gargano said, because "it's very important."
"This batch is really to highlight leisure activities not usually associated with New York State," he said.
"We're also focusing on trying to attract tourists coming to New York City to take upstate vacations and not limit themselves to New York City," Mr. Gargano added, particularly those who "come to New York City and then go off to Pennsylvania or Connecticut or New Jersey."
"No matter what you do, someone's going to complain about it," he said. "Last year, the upstaters felt there was not enough emphasis on upstate. We're trying to do the best we can to balance it out and show all of New York State, not just New York City or Long Island."
The first spots for 1998 will run for five weeks with spending of "a little under $4 million," Mr. Gargano said; the annual budget for the campaign is $10 million.
The broadcast and cable TV commercials will run in New York State, Montreal, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Toronto and throughout the Boston-Washington corridor.

HEADLINE: SHAKE-UP IN RUSSIA: THE REACTION;
Washington Listened, But Moscow Didn't Call

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin did not call. Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin did not call. No top American officials in Washington heard from their Russian counterparts today.
In spite of the silence, United States officials, expressing some surprise but no shock at Mr. Yeltsin's sudden sacking of his Cabinet, said over and over that relations with Moscow remained utterly unchanged by the upheaval. 
 With the assurances, there was uncertainty. Hope was a word often heard today. That hope lay largely in American officials' dialogue and diplomacy with the dismissed leadership. No one in Washington claims to have crystal ball for telling what might lie ahead for Russia and its rocky path out of the Soviet past toward some form of democracy.
President Clinton, traveling in Ghana, said: "I hope the general direction of the policy will be unaffected." His spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, added: "We certainly hope that as the new Government is constituted it will reflect President Yeltsin's strong admonition that policies of reform should continue."
Vice President Al Gore, whose close consultations with the now-deposed Prime Minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin, appeared to be one of the more productive parts of recent relations, said in Washington: "President Clinton and I will continue to work closely with the Russian Government to build a peaceful and more stable world, support Russia's aspirations for reform and a prosperous and democratic future, and deepen our engagement with the people of Russia."
While his talks with Mr. Chernomyrdin, are over for the time being, both men may have hopes of resuming them -- if they can get elected President in 2000.
In sync with Mr. Gore's statement, State Department officials and National Security Council staff members were speaking as one today, or at least reading from similar scripts. They said the relationship with Russia was one of continuity, not change; based on policies, not personalities; and founded on mutual interests, not mutable individuals.
Ever since Mr. Yeltsin took power in 1991, becoming as the first post-Communist leader of Russia, United States officials have kept up their public support for him. Their stance has not wavered, notwithstanding his swerving shifts of policy, his sometimes mystifying public statements, his disappearances due to health problems and his swift shuffling of his associates.
But today the silence on the Russian end of the dialogue was somewhat unnerving. White House officials said that Mr. Clinton had no immediate plans to call Mr. Yeltsin. As of midnight in Moscow, Mr. Gore had not heard from Mr. Chernomyrdin.
"We have not had high-level contact with Russian authorities, to my knowledge, to date," James Foley, the deputy State Department spokesman, said this afternoon. "We had no advance notification of the formal decision" to dismiss the Cabinet, he added.
The first such contact may come on Tuesday night, when Secretary of State Madeline K. Albright has a long-scheduled meeting in Bonn with Yevgeny Primakov, until today the Russian Foreign Minister. She plans to discuss "the implications of the change of Government in Russia" with him, Mr. Foley said. Mr. Foley said that Mr. Primakov considers himself the Acting Foreign Minister, and "apparently is continuing in that capacity" and hopes to be reappointed.
State Department officials said Moscow's silence was unsurprising. But it contrasted with the two-day warning that Mr. Yeltsin gave President Clinton when Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of Russian economic reform, resigned in 1994.
Publicly and privately, United States officials warned against overdramatizing the dismissals. They noted that President Richard M. Nixon asked his Cabinet to resign before his second term, and that many democratic nations give the president the right to dismiss the government. Russia was unlikely to unravel, they said, simply because a government was dismissed; another will take shape soon.
"This is something that happens in democracies from time to time," Mr. Foley said.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, expressed the same hope tinged with uncertainty about Mr. Yeltsin's decision as was voiced by Administration officials. "I hope that the course of reform in Russia is irreversible," Senator Lott said. "I hope that their movement toward democracy and economic freedom will continue on track."
He added: "I think we are all a little bit surprised that he made this dramatic move."

HEADLINE: Budget Deficit Rose in February

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23

 BODY:
Tax refund claims helped raise the Federal budget deficit to $41.8 billion in February, but an overall surplus is still possible by the end of the 1998 fiscal year on Sept. 30.
The red ink compares with a $25.4 billion surplus in January, the Treasury Department said last week. Still, it was in line with economists' expectations and 5.1 percent below the $44 billion shortfall a year earlier. 
 For the first five months of the fiscal year, the deficit totaled $56 billion, 37.6 percent less than the $89.8 billion accumulated during the same period of the 1997 fiscal year.
Though acknowledging the possibility the year will end in surplus, the Clinton Administration is still officially forecasting a $10 billion deficit for the year, compared with a 23-year low of $22 billion last year.
But the Congressional Budget Office is predicting an $8 billion surplus. If realized, it would be the Government's first year in the black since 1969, Richard M. Nixon's first year in office.
Robust economic growth and large stock market gains are being credited with pushing tax revenue up faster than spending. Revenue in the fiscal year to date has totaled $646.9 billion, up 10.2 percent from 1997. Spending in the period added up to $703 billion, up 3.9 percent.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Studies Whether Mutual Funds Pass Along Merger Benefits

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission has begun a study of whether mutual funds are passing along to investors the benefits of a recent wave of fund company mergers, particularly in the form of lower fees, the commission's top mutual fund regulator said yesterday.
The study, undertaken because of the recent high rate of mergers among fund companies, will include an examination of distribution fees associated with 401(k) retirement programs and of the regulatory and compliance issues raised by the mergers, said Barry Barbash, the director of the commission's division of investment management. 
 Speaking to a conference of mutual fund executives in Orlando, Fla., Mr. Barbash said the S.E.C.'s mutual fund division was deluged with information regarding proposed mergers. Over the last year, the commission's division of investment management has received at least one merger-related application a week, he said.
"We need to pause and consider the implications and the consequences of this growth and consolidation," Mr. Barbash said.
The study will look at "trends in the overall level of fees, the way fees are assessed, and whether fees continue to reflect the existence of economies of scale that are passed along to shareholders," he said. Expenses charged to investors in retirement programs have also been studied recently by the Labor Department, which oversees pension and retirement investment policy. Industry analysts have raised questions about why fund fees have not declined as the industry has grown enormously over the last three years.
In addition to fees, the mutual fund division has been looking at compliance issues raised by the wave of mergers among fund companies, Mr. Barbash said. So far, the S.E.C. has found among merged companies examples of inconsistencies in compliance policies, uneven enforcement of compliance procedures and the hasty elimination of compliance departments among merged firms, he said.
No regulatory actions have yet been taken on the basis of those findings, however.
Fund investors have recently not paid much attention to fund expenses because investment returns have been so great. But, Mr. Barbash said, "At some point in the future, a consolidating fund industry may be faced with a penny-pinching financial services consumer, and will have to tailor fees and other aspects of the business to accommodate this change."

HEADLINE: Mr. Yeltsin's Latest Surprise

 BODY:
Russia's President, Boris Yeltsin, is turning the abrupt dismissal of top government officials into his trademark governing style. Yesterday Mr. Yeltsin, only recently returned to work from a severe respiratory infection, surprised Russia and the world by dismissing his Prime Minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, along with his entire Cabinet. Mr. Yeltsin's achievements over the years have been impressive. But his increasingly mercurial leadership, marked by erratic pronouncements, frequent health crises and sudden removal of top aides, now threatens to undermine Russia's political stability and the confidence of foreign governments and investors.
As acting Prime Minister Mr. Yeltsin chose Sergei Kiriyenko, a 35-year-old technocrat associated with Boris Nemtsov, one of the most reform-minded members of the Chernomyrdin Government. No sharp lurches in economic or foreign policy are likely, and many ministers and officials are expected to return in old or new roles. But Mr. Chernomyrdin's departure instantly scrambles the outlook for the 2000 presidential election and revives uncertainties about a smooth succession should Mr. Yeltsin's health further deteriorate. 
 Mr. Yeltsin blamed the Chernomyrdin Government for failing to translate its economic reforms into a better life for ordinary Russians. That is a fair indictment in a country where life expectancy is shrinking, public services are collapsing and paydays are frequently payless. But by some economic measures, the Chernomyrdin Government has not performed badly. It has halted the long slide in output and has controlled inflation. It is still struggling to get taxes paid, although it recently moved to collect from some of the bigger corporate holdouts. It has strengthened ties with the United States through twice-a-year meetings of the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission.
These policies are likely to continue under Mr. Kiriyenko and his still-to-be-chosen permanent successor. But so too is the pervasive corruption that stained the Chernomyrdin record. Seven giant banking and business groups have close ties to the country's most powerful political leaders, and Mr. Yeltsin's own re-election campaign was largely financed by these businessmen and bankers. They have been rewarded with chances to scoop up shares in former state enterprises at well below market rates.
Unfortunately there are no quick fixes for most of the sufferings that have soured many Russians on reform. But reform would surely be helped by more confidence-inspiring political leadership, from Mr. Yeltsin on down.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Increase in Oil Prices Sends Most Market Gauges Lower

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
A jump in oil prices reverberated through financial markets yesterday, leaving stocks generally lower, precious metals higher and the bond market unchanged.
The different responses reflected investors' varied interpretations of the impact of the oil price increase. In the stock market, it seemed that it was mostly an excuse to sell after the major stock gauges had set a string of new highs last week. 
 The sharp jumps in the prices of gold and silver showed that some investors were worried about inflation. But the bond market's calm signaled that other investors were less worried as they concluded that the price of oil is still very low compared with just five months ago.
"It was a topsy-turvy day," said Timothy M. Ghriskey, senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus.
In the stock market, oil stocks did rally, and along with a rebound in technology stocks that helped lift the Nasdaq index 3.35 points, to 1,792.51. Among technology stocks, Microsoft was up 2, to 83 7/8, and Cisco Systems jumped 1 1/8, to 64 3/4. Oil stocks were led higher by Royal Dutch Petroleum, up 1 1/4, to 58 1/4, and by Exxon, up 7/8, to 68.
But declines in drug and financial stocks and oil-related selloffs in transportation stocks helped pull the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks down 3.61 points, to 1,095.55. The stocks of all the major airlines, which have been benefiting from lower oil prices, ended lower.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped further, falling 90.18 points, or 1 percent, to 8,816.25. It was pushed lower by the Boeing Company, which said late Friday that it was facing delays in the delivery of some of its new 737's. Boeing was off 1 13/16, to 51 5/8. Coca-Cola fell 1 5/8, to 75 7/8, after an analyst at Lehman Brothers lowered his earnings estimates.
But stock market analysts did not think that the stock market decline was important. "Nothing really significant happened, but it was an excuse to sell," said George Cohen, a principal at Cohen, Klingenstein & Marks, an investment manager.
Mr. Ghriskey added that the flow of cash into stocks from investors is so strong that he does not see the stock market correcting, or dropping 10 percent, any time soon.
In the bond market, the news was that nothing happened. After declining a little in the morning, bond prices recovered. The price of the 30-year bond was unchanged at 103 13/32. The yield remained 5.88 percent.
Robert Pugliese, senior vice president at J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., said the market's initial reaction to the jump in oil prices was a knee-jerk fear of inflation.
"Oil producing countries have always had some difficulty in maintaining some price support system, and on a worldwide basis it would be virtually impossible," he said, referring to a weekend agreement among leading producers to cut their oil production.
But he also warned against completely discounting yesterday's oil price increase. "Low oil prices have given everyone a sense of security."
This metaphorical shrug in the bond market was a stark contrast to the reaction in the commodities market. The price of gold for April delivery jumped $7.30, or 2.5 percent, to $299.50 an ounce, while the price of silver for May delivery rose 24.5 cents, to $6.38 an ounce.

HEADLINE: SHAKE-UP IN RUSSIA: THE CONTENDERS;
4 Who Would Succeed Chernomyrdin

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

 BODY:
Here are brief sketches of the people most often mentioned as Boris N. Yeltsin's next Prime Minister.
 
Grigory A. Yavlinsky
A radical economic reformer and populist, Grigory A. Yavlinsky, 45, has jealously guarded his position as Mr. Yeltsin's most ardent democratic critic. Mr. Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal Yabloko faction in Parliament, complains that Mr. Yeltsin has failed to push economic reforms far enough. 
 Although he has parted ways with the President on economic and foreign policies in principle, the ambitious Mr. Yavlinsky, who ran for president in 1996, has made it clear that he would join the Cabinet if offered the post of Prime Minister.
Intelligent and charming, Mr. Yavlinsky is admired by politicians and scholars in Washington and in Cambridge, Mass., where he is a frequent speaker at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. His image is more shaded in Russia, where his sometimes naked ambition and chronic inability to get along even with like-minded politicians have alienated some supporters.
 
Sergei Kiriyenko
Sergei Kiriyenko, 35, is a close ally of the leading reformer remaining in Mr. Yeltsin's Cabinet, Boris Y. Nemtsov.
He found out about his new position as Acting Prime Minister when he woke up yesterday.
His relative obscurity as Fuel and Energy Minister and his lack of a track record with Parliament might help him get confirmed without a fight.
Although he is a liberal from the reform crucible of Nizhny Novgorod, he has worked well with representatives of the oil and gas industries. They are by far the most important sources of income in the nation, and nobody who crosses them would have a chance of becoming Prime Minister.
 
Boris Y. Nemtsov
The First Deputy Prime Minister, Boris Y. Nemtsov, 38, is a charismatic man who has often been spoken of as Mr. Yeltsin's heir apparent. As Governor of Nizhny Novgorod, he gained a reputation as one of Russia's boldest young leaders. Despite his outspoken stance against Mr. Yeltsin's conduct of the war in Chechnya, the President sought him out to help lead the reform group in his second Administration.
When he decided to come to Moscow he was quoted widely in the press as saying that he was on a kamikaze mission but that some kamikazes survive. It's unclear whether he will be among them. His reputation suffered because Mr. Yeltsin blamed him for some of the Government's failings, but he has agreed to stay on. His high profile as a reformer would make it hard for him to be confirmed by the Communist-led Parliament.
 
Yuri M. Luzhkov, 61
Yuri M. Luzhkov, 61, a highly unlikely choice, is nonetheless somebody Mr. Yeltsin might want to draw into the Kremlin rather than letting him remain aloof. Mr. Luzhkov is the brutish, gruff Mayor of Moscow, who manages more than any politician in Russia to get things done.
He has presided over the biggest building boom in Russian history, and he became so popular that Mr. Yeltsin had to rely on him to help win his own re-election in 1996. Like all powerful people attached to the President, Mr. Luzhkov finds that his star rises and falls with some regularity.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Photos: "Who's Out"
Viktor S. Chernomyrdin
Dismissed as Prime Minister, Mr. Chernomyrdin, 59, had served for five years in a Cabinet where one-year careers are considered lengthy. Stolid, solid, loyal and unassuming, Mr. Chernomyrdin managed to lead the Government through years of painful reform that are nowhere near through, but he helped insure that the future will look nothing like the past.
 
Anatoly B. Chubais
Lionized in the West as the man who vowed above all to bring Russia to the free market, Mr. Chubais, who was First Deputy Prime Minister, may be the most despised man in Russia. His early efforts at privatization were widely viewed as vast federal gifts to inside operators at the expense of millions of workers who got nothing but promises they cannot redeem.
 
Anatoly S. Kulikov
As Interior Minister, General Kulikov presided over the most aggressive attacks on Grozny during the war against Chechnya, but he was largely responsible for Russia's defeat and humiliation. The former national security adviser Aleksandr I. Lebed once demanded that President Boris N. Yeltsin choose between the two men. Now he won't have to.

HEADLINE: Hotel Company in Talks to Buy Four Seasons

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Strategic Hotel Capital Inc. is close to a deal to buy the Four Seasons Hotel, New York's tallest hotel and a symbol of the city's economic fortunes, for more than $350 million, according to real estate executives.
Strategic Hotel Capital has been in discussions for several weeks with the Hong Kong owners of the imposing limestone hotel on 57th Street near Park Avenue. Designed by the architect I. M. Pei, the 52-story, 370-room Four Seasons has some of the highest room rates in the city. The 3,000-square-foot Presidential Suite on the top floor is $7,000 a night. 
 If the deal is struck, the current owners, the Lai Sun Group, will have nearly doubled their money in a mere 18 months. Lai Sun and a consortium of Hong Kong investors led by Polylinks, a Hong Kong real estate company, bought the hotel in August 1996 for $190 million.
Strategic Hotel Capital would gain an expensive but well-known property to add to its rapidly expanding collection of hotels. Analysts say that the company is preparing a public stock offering for the near future.
"There's a lot of demand for hotels in New York today from any operators or investment groups that aren't already here," said Paul Stern, a hotel broker with the Sonnenblick-Goldman Corporation. "The Four Seasons is unique in that it's a world-class trophy. It would be a nice centerpiece for their contemplated public offering."
Laurence Geller, president of Strategic Hotel Capital, declined to comment.
The value of the Four Seasons has fluctuated significantly, as has much New York real estate. The chairman of the EIE International Corporation of Japan, Harunori Takahashi, hired Mr. Pei in the 1980's to design the tallest and most luxurious hotel in New York.
By the time it was completed, during the recession in 1993, it had also become the most expensive to build. The cost had swelled to $477 million, or $1.3 million a room, and the hotel market in New York was in bad shape, and room and occupancy rates were heading downward.
Mr. Takahashi lost the property and most of his empire to the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
In 1996, Ambrose Cheung, a director of Lai Sun, led a group that bought the hotel at a 60 percent discount. At a party celebrating the acquisition, Mr. Cheung led a jubilant rendition of "New York, New York," while a karaoke machine projected the lyrics on a screen. He said at the time that the deal reflected his faith in the value of New York.
In the meantime, room rates at New York hotels have increased, as has the number of tourists and business executives coming to the city. Rates at the Four Seasons average more than $550 a night, among the highest in the city, hotel analysts say. Since it opened, the hotel has been run by the Four Seasons, a hotel management company.
Strategic Hotel Capital, the investment group to which Mr. Cheung is considering selling it, was formed last year by Goldman Sachs & Company, Security Capital Group and Mr. Geller.
"It's not a done deal," an executive familiar with the negotiations said. "But I would assume Strategic badly wants a trophy hotel."

Players Foresee Release As Other Refugees Wait

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: NASSAU, the Bahamas, March 23

 BODY:
Four Cuban baseball players being held in a detention center here negotiated with sports agents today and were told they could expect to be released after just a few days in custody. Meanwhile, more than 100 other Cuban refugees locked up with them, who have been held for months in the bare-bones compound, began a hunger strike to protest their plight.
While all the refugees shared the same muddy encampment, there was a marked division between the gaunt-eyed detainees who have few prospects and the athletes who could think about having it all. 
For the Bahamian Government, caught in the middle of high-stakes diplomatic and business negotiations, there was little choice. If the ballplayers succeeded in getting another Caribbean country to sponsor them, the Bahamas would release them and put them on an airplane for that nation, presumably a stopover before the United States and, possibly, baseball glory and riches.
Joe Cubas, a Miami sports agent who has helped other Cuban baseball players who defected obtain major league contracts, is petitioning Costa Rica and Nicaragua to admit the group, an associate said today. The players, a coach and four other defectors left Cuba by boat last Friday. Before leaving, they hid for more than a week waiting for good weather, and rumors swirled that they had been lost at sea or washed ashore in the Dominican Republic.
The players are first baseman Jorge Luis Toca, 23; second baseman Jorge Diaz, 23; catcher Angel Lopez, 25, and shortstop Michael Jova, 17. A new team of agents, from Total Sports International, turned up at the detention center today, beckoning individual ballplayers from the barracks-like shelters that house 151 Cubans and 50 or so Haitians and other illegal immigrants.
As each athlete walked to the perimeter fence to speak to the agents, the less fortunate refugees sat stone-faced outside the barracks, their backs pressed against the wall.
"They get a good Bahamian diet," said Arthur Rolle, superintendent of the center, commenting on the detainees' complaint that their health was being compromised by meals often lacking in protein. "Peas and rice and some chicken. Maybe even some pork chops. Sometimes."
William Nottage, a Bahamian immigration superintendent, said: "I don't blame them for being upset. Some have been held here since November. They are asking if their cases are any less credible than these athletes."
Unless another country offers political asylum, Cuban refugees here must await an interview by representatives of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees, said Luther E. Smith, permanent secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Most are judged economic refugees and sent back to Cuba, a track record that has kept Bahamian relations with Havana cordial, he said.
If the High Commission recommends political asylum, it is usually granted, Smith said, but the process can require months. Top Cuban athletes usually do not have to endure normal channels. Sponsorship by a third country facilitates quick release to that nation and makes possible relocation to the United States.
Defecting players who reach the United States after first entering another country do not have to enter the free-agent draft and can negotiate with clubs as free agents.

HEADLINE: Throngs Greet Call by Clinton For New Africa

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: ACCRA, Ghana, March 23

 BODY:
Be fore the largest crowd he has ever addressed a whooping and clapping throng estimated by the Government here at more than half a million -- President Clinton opened his 12-day tour of Africa today by pledging more American interest and aid while calling for a deeper African commitment to democracy and free markets.
But Mr. Clinton was careful to pair his message with scorn for American "stereotypes that have warped our view and weakened our understanding of Africa." Describing his trip, by far the longest undertaken here by an American President, as "long overdue," Mr. Clinton said, "It is time for Americans to put a new Africa on our map." 
 Mr. Clinton's midmorning speech on a sweltering day was joyfully received -- too much so, at one point, for his taste. When he shook hands after his speech, the crowd surged against the steel barricades, threatening to crush at least one woman and perhaps even overwhelm the President.
Mr. Clinton, his face contorted in anger, raged at the crowd to get back, as ferociously pounding drums seemed to lend it momentum. But as the President gestured with his arms, scores of hands continued to clutch at them. It was a rare public display of what some of Mr. Clinton's close advisers and friends have described as private bursts of temper.
Braced by Secret Service officers, Mr. Clinton moved farther along the barricade and the pressure of the crowd subsided somewhat.
There was no precise count, but the crowd filled the concrete parade ground of Independence Square, which has a capacity of more than 200,000. As Mr. Clinton appeared with the Ghanaian President, Jerry Rawlings, the air over the upturned faces became a blur of tiny American and red, green and gold Ghanaian flags.
At one point in his speech Mr. Clinton dabbled in Akan, the language of Ghana's largest ethnic group, the Ashanti, and briefly draped a brilliant cape of golden kente cloth over his black suit.
"Democracy requires human rights for everyone, everywhere," he said. "For men and women, for children and the elderly, for people of different cultures and tribes and backgrounds. A good society honors its entire family."
On a day so humid one almost had to chew to breathe, people started gathering more than four hours before Mr. Clinton appeared. Scores were overcome in the heat, with only an occasional breeze off the Gulf of Guinea; hundreds pleaded for water with Ghanaian officials and American reporters.
The President, traveling with 800 aides, members of Congress, security agents, reporters and others, arrived after an overnight flight from Washington, and left eight hours later for a late-night flight to Uganda.
This afternoon Mr. Clinton visited a project run by an American nonprofit concern, TechnoServe, with Peace Corps volunteers to improve farming, increase access to credit and teach women to read. Ghana was the first nation to accept Peace Corps volunteers, in August 1961.
In remarks at the project, Mr. Clinton dwelled on the significance of his visit for black Americans, one of his most loyal political constituencies. The President was accompanied by the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, his special envoy to Africa; by several black members of his Cabinet and Congress; and by black businessmen like Bob Johnson, the owner of Black Entertainment Television.
"I don't think you can possibly imagine what this day means to the members of the Congressional Black Caucus, to the African American members of my Cabinet, and those who hold senior positions in the White House and in the departments of Government," Mr. Clinton said. "It wasn't so very long ago in the whole sweep of human history that their ancestors were yanked from the shores of western Africa as slaves. Now they come back home to Africa and to Ghana as the leaders of America."
Mr. Clinton also praised Mr. Rawlings "for his leadership for democracy, for economic reform."
In meetings with Mr. Rawlings, Mr. Clinton promised some new American aid beyond the $52 million in development assistance the United States provided last year. A severe drought has crippled Ghana's hydroelectric plants, cutting the country's power supply in half. Mr. Clinton told Mr. Rawlings today that the Department of Transportation would provide a guaranteed $67 million loan to pay for two natural-gas power plants mounted on barges.
In a gesture that fit the day, Mr. Clinton also promised $500,000 to help the Ghanaian police improve their crowd control.
The centerpiece of the day was Mr. Clinton's 15-minute address this morning, which was intended to frame his tour of Africa.
"My dream for this trip," he said, "is that together we might do the things so that 100 years from now, your grandchildren and mine will look back and say this was the beginning of a new African renaissance."
Consistent with the optimistic theme of his visit, the President emphasized the progress of Ghana, whose economy grew about 5.5 percent last year. But his audience's sentiments about the country's state was better illustrated by the loud applause when Mr. Clinton said, "The United States is ready to help you."
People in the crowd rattled off lists of the country's needs. "Ghana needs everything," said Esther Guiama, 47. Michael Gyebi Sarpong, 53, added, "We need money for infrastructure, education, health and farms.".
In a 24-minute speech before Mr. Clinton's, Mr. Rawlings called for foreign investment here. He said that Africans had learned that "only by allowing the individual to flourish can our communities also flourish." Mr. Rawlings wore a traditional war dress known as a batakari, a puffy brown patterned shirt with spotted animal skin attached to the left shoulder.
Mr. Rawlings introduced the President as "a very innovative politician with a very dedicated wife."
This trip has come at a propitious time for Mr. Clinton, who is under pressure at home from the independent counsel investigating his relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, the former White House intern. But it was clear that the President would not escape his troubles in Africa.
Ghanaian reporters grilled their American colleagues about details of the crisis, and Mr. Rawlings appeared to refer to it in his address. He told a lengthy story about how well the Clintons had treated a Ghanaian nurse they employed in Arkansas, and then declared, "When you are talking about the character of a person, this is how some of us define the character of people."

Clinton Arrives in Uganda
 ENTEBBE, Uganda, Tuesday, March 24 (By The New York Times) -- President Clinton's jetliner, Air Force One, touched down smoothly at Entebbe International Airport in Uganda at 1:21 this morning.
Twenty minutes later, the President and his wife emerged, waved, smiled and descended the steps. Looking tired, Mr. Clinton shook hands with the Ugandan President, Yoweri K. Museveni, exchanging a few words and smiles. Then he and Mr. Museveni walked leisurely to a Marine Corps helicopter, which carried the President and Mrs. Clinton to the capital, Kampala, about 20 miles northeast.

HEADLINE: Method or Madness? Lewinsky's Lawyer Baffles Washington Establishment

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Back in the days before he became as familiar a television fixture as "Seinfeld" reruns, William H. Ginsburg once observed, "A trial is not a game, but it is theater."
In a Washington drama that has often seemed closer to "Waiting for Godot" than "Advise and Consent," few of the actors have been harder to read or subjected to more baffled, sometimes dismissive, reviews than Mr. Ginsburg, the Beverly Hills medical malpractice lawyer whose defense of Monica S. Lewinsky has put him at the center of the furor swirling around Bill Clinton's Presidency. 
 Mr. Ginsburg has morphed from a little-known California lawyer to an unavoidable TV talking head to the avuncular half of Washington's ultimate power couple of the moment -- squiring his client around town from dinner at the Cosmos Club to Larry King's book party to Washington Wizards basketball games.
Legal experts have wildly differing assessments of Mr. Ginsburg's loquacious, seemingly contradictory performance, but if they do not agree on the answer, they do agree on the question: crazy or crazy like a fox?
Whether Mr. Ginsburg is blundering his way through unfamiliar terrain or roiling the legal and political waters to his client's benefit has become one of the more intriguing subplots of the Lewinsky matter. And while the political and legal fallout from the accusations of Kathleen E. Willey could make Ms. Lewinsky's position even more precarious, legal experts have sharply differing views on Mr. Ginsburg's role so far.
"You can talk to 20 lawyers and get 20 different notions of what's going on," said William B. Moffitt, a Washington defense lawyer, "but what really matters is what happens to his client, and that remains up in the air right now. If he manages to get his client out of here without testifying and without being prosecuted, he'll have had a successful run."
Mr. Ginsburg has been widely criticized, particularly by Washington lawyers who say he could have got complete immunity for his client easily and early. But if, as some legal experts have suggested, Mr. Ginsburg's strategy has been to protect the former intern legally, diminish her value to a grand jury and to any prosecution and perhaps prevent her from going down in history as the woman who helped bring down a President, his tactics and strategy may be harder to read.
What is clear is that Mr. Ginsburg and his client have had a constantly shifting trajectory. When Mr. Ginsburg arrived in Washington, his air of authority and oratorical flourishes were viewed as instantly invigorating to Ms. Lewinsky's defense. Now he is regularly accused of irresponsibly milking his 15 minutes of fame and changing course like a traveler lost in a blizzard.
Ms. Lewinsky seems to have gone from the center of the drama to someone like Beckett's Godot, hovering tantalizingly out of sight.
And while Mr. Ginsburg said that he welcomed the degree to which both of them had been pushed out of the spotlight by the attention now being focused on Ms. Willey's accusations that President Clinton forced himself on her sexually, others say Ms. Lewinsky could resurface in a more vulnerable position later.
Critics say Mr. Ginsburg has spent too much time on television and not enough time boning up on criminal law. They say he has sown confusion rather than told a consistent story. They say he inexplicably seemed to negotiate from weakness rather than strength when the special prosecutor desperately needed Ms. Lewinsky's testimony, and then lost his chance to protect her and receive immunity.
Mr. Ginsburg went from portentously saying his client was ready to "unload everything she has -- everything" to flatly denying that Ms. Lewinsky had had any sexual relationship with the President. He coyly said early in the proceedings that Ms. Lewinsky "at this time" was standing by her original affidavit. Later he said the affidavit was "factual."
He has publicly questioned the credibility of his own client, saying, "All 24-year-olds and all 18-year-olds and 19-year-olds tend to embellish."
"Chauncey Gardiner," sniffed Joseph E. diGenova, a Washington lawyer and former United States Attorney, referring to the dim-bulb gardener whose inanities were misinterpreted as profundities in the novel and film "Being There." "It's an amazing performance. To what end, I know not."
Others say Mr. Ginsburg has left Ms. Lewinsky a ripe target for possible prosecution on perjury or obstruction of justice charges, particularly in connection with talking points she apparently delivered to Linda R. Tripp about Ms. Willey.
"At the end of a criminal trial there would barely be enough of her left to pour into a shot glass," said Jonathan Turley, a Washington lawyer and professor at the George Washington School of Law.
But Mr. Ginsburg says most of the criticism reflects the clubby tribalism of Washington lawyers. "I have discovered that anyone who is not practicing law inside the Beltway is a country lawyer," he said.
And he denied that his account had shifted over time. He said that the hiring of a Washington lawyer, Nathaniel Speights, had compensated for any criminal law or Washington shortcomings in Ms. Lewinsky's defense and that any zigzags in his account had resulted from trying to keep up with the leaks coming from the independent counsel's office. With a bit of exasperation, he said that people who criticized his early proffer in the case or the degree to which he negotiated for immunity had no understanding of the specific facts of the case.
While standing by remarks that he hopes the country avoids the economic and social turmoil that would come from the fall of a President, Mr. Ginsburg derided speculation that his strategy was affected by concerns about Mr. Clinton's future.
"That's screwball, that's nuts," he said. "I'm defending a little girl, young lady. I don't care about bringing the President down or holding him up."
Lawyers who know Mr. Ginsburg from Los Angeles say he is anything but a legal naif. They portray him as a knowledgeable, politically astute lawyer, with a startling record of winning difficult cases and a sharp, strategic approach to the law.
Bruce Givner, a former partner of Mr. Ginsburg, describes him as a "superb courtroom lawyer," with an actor's command of the courtroom and the ability to instantly develop strategies in hostile situations. He recalls the way Mr. Ginsburg spent years in the 1970's and 1980's defending a swimming pool maker, Anthony Pools, parachuting into small towns in Arizona, Louisiana or Texas to defend the company against lawsuits filed by parents whose children had been rendered quadriplegics in swimming pool accidents.
"He was defending this big California public company, arguing to jurors who were neighbors of the kids crippled for life, and he always won," Mr. Givner said. "He's the kind of guy who walks into the courtroom and everyone says: 'He's a nice guy. He's trustworthy. He's honest. He's sincere,' and he won time and again against staggering odds."
His success as an advocate leads those who know him in Los Angeles to see his news media appearances more as a sign of his confidence in his ability to argue his case to the largest possible constituency than as evidence of egocentric grandstanding.
Robert Levinson, who practiced with Mr. Ginsburg for six years, said Mr. Ginsburg had "the uncanny ability, sort of a sixth sense, to know what to do in all kinds of situations."
He said Mr. Ginsburg's approach could either be "a pure defense strategy" or something less conventional in which he was trying both to demonize Mr. Starr and to render his client increasingly less useful to the prosecutor.
"If it's the latter, look what's been accomplished," Mr. Levinson said. "Now you even have Trent Lott criticizing Starr, and Monica's account has become such mush there's nothing concrete to be gained by pursuing her. There's nothing to grab hold of."
Skeptics say that just because Mr. Ginsburg is a fine malpractice lawyer does not mean he is the ideal lawyer to handle this case and that if Mr. Starr has been demonized, the White House and Mr. Starr's own behavior have more to do with it than Mr. Ginsburg. And they say that Mr. Ginsburg might have stumbled more than dashed to a position that could help his client.
But others say that, for all the smoke and ever-shifting political winds, Mr. Starr still has no criminal case against either Ms. Lewinsky or the President.
"Whether he planned it or lucked into it, Ginsburg has a client who didn't testify before the grand jury and is moving out of the zone of danger daily," said Larry Pozner, a Denver defense lawyer and president-elect of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. "Ken Starr has a nothing-burger. A good prosecutor could not get to first base with what he has, and Ken Starr can't find the ball park."
Of course, none of those passing judgment know the details of Mr. Ginsburg's dealings with Mr. Starr and what sort of designs Mr. Starr has on Ms. Lewinsky.
And ego being in no short supply among lawyers, Mr. Ginsburg is hardly the only lawyer being routinely hooted at by his peers.
As a result, the conventional legal wisdom has been that Mr. Ginsburg is playing out of his league; President Clinton's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, is responsible for a legal blunder worthy of the hall of fame by allowing the Paula Corbin Jones lawsuit to head toward trial, and Mr. Starr has been so majestically inept as to put the whole independent prosecutor mechanism in jeopardy.
"This is a ballet of incompetence," said Alan M. Dershowitz, the Harvard University law professor. "You could use it to teach a whole year's course on how not to practice law."
Still, as the ebb and flow of the furor surrounding Ms. Willey once again proved, it is impossible to predict where Mr. Clinton's legal odyssey is headed and who the winners and losers will be.
"Members of the bar ought to be a little more cautious about kicking each other's teeth in until we see what the results are," Mr. Moffitt said.

HEADLINE: Into Africa

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: ACCRA, Ghana, March 23

 BODY:
Africa is the Rodney Dangerfield of continents; the world seems to pay it scant heed and shows it less respect.
The United States has been no exception. In a 1994 study of United States policies toward Africa, Peter J. Schraeder of Loyola University in Chicago wrote that they have always been marked "by indifference at worst and neglect at best." 
 That is what President Clinton is setting out to change in his trip here, which will last for 12 days -- three times longer than all of his predecessors combined have spent in this vast continent, which the missionary David Livingstone once described as the "running sore of the world."
In recent decades Africa has mostly meant trouble, from the Biafran insurgency to civil war in Angola, from famine in Ethiopia and Somalia to genocide in Rwanda, from Ian Smith to Idi Amin.
Only the transition from apartheid to democracy in South Africa under Nelson Mandela's leadership has broken the pattern dramatically enough to catch the eye of significant numbers of Americans.
Surveying Africa in 1994, the Nigerian novelist Wole Soyinka, a Nobel laureate, commented, "Rwanda is our nightmare; South Africa is our dream."
Mr. Clinton landed in Accra this morning on a journey he described as "long overdue." He thinks the winds of change are blowing, says a "new African renaissance" is at hand, and just by coming he has accomplished something. He has demonstrated, say diplomats and students of Washington's African policy, that the United States no longer considers Africa peripheral.
"The Africans had pretty well concluded that we didn't give a damn about them," said C. Payne Lucas, who heads Africare, an organization of American volunteers in 30 African countries. "We've ignored this continent, except for the Peace Corps, the big oil companies and a crisis here and there, so this trip is a very helpful signal."
Yet there is widespread, profound skepticism about the President's broader goal of establishing important, lasting economic links with Africa. Mr. Clinton is raising expectations, perhaps beyond his capacity to fulfill them.
Richard M. Moose, who served as Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs in the Carter Administration, said last week: "It is going to take huge human and financial resources to transform the place, and we haven't the slightest idea where they are going to come from. Certainly not from us. It's hard to believe that we will ever again offer aid on a cold war scale."
The United States hopes that trade, not aid, will do the job.
But most African countries have small populations, shaky legal frameworks, if any, and negligible middle classes. Education and health care are often inadequate. Transportation links among African nations remain primitive.
That is a formula certain to worry potential foreign investors, who are skittish in any event after last year's reversals in Southeast Asia. Investors want predictability and order, which are hard to guarantee even in the new Africa.
The chosen White House instrument is the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, which the House of Representatives approved this month. Senate action is pending.
The legislation forms the background of this trip. It seeks to promote the privatization of government enterprises across Africa, with sales of state assets open to all comers, including foreigners. In return, African countries could export to the United States without the hindrance of tariffs or quotas.
Critics argue that the act would allow foreign corporations to buy African resources at fire-sale prices and exploit low-wage African labor.
"This bill nakedly and unqualifiedly promotes the interests of American business," said one vocal foe, Randall Robinson of the lobbying group TransAfrica. "It should be called the African recolonization act, because the United States and Europe have the money and would grab the assets."
Mr. Clinton has chosen an itinerary that will take him to countries the Administration sees as success stories -- countries described in carefully modulated terms by Susan E. Rice, the influential Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, as "pretty good performers, economically and politically, all things considered."
One aim, she said in an interview in Washington, is to show Americans "the side of Africa that's not bodies floating down rivers."
The President himself was less guarded in remarks broadcast throughout the continent before his arrival, talking of "an Africa whose political and economic accomplishments grow more impressive each month."
That is a very carefully edited Africa. It excludes Somalia, where 18 American soldiers died five years ago trying to end chaos and famine: it still has no Government. It excludes Angola, where the United States is promoting peace negotiations that have not brought peace.
It excludes the Congo, although Mr. Clinton will meet with its leader, Laurent Kabila, during a stop in Uganda. Mr. Kabila seems to be drifting into the cruel and corrupt pattern of the man he deposed only last year, Mobuto Sese Seko, and the decision to include him on the schedule came only after a heated argument within the Administration.
Most important, it excludes Nigeria, which with South Africa is the most important country in sub-Saharan Africa in terms of population and resources.
Pope John Paul II landed there on Saturday and called on Nigerians to guarantee human rights. The Vatican asked the Government of Gen. Sani Abacha to free 60 political detainees.
United States officials have been sending signals to General Abacha that it disapproves of his apparent plan to take off his uniform and run as a "civilian" candidate in elections planned for August, but it is not clear what Washington could do to stop or punish him if he does so.
Administration officials speak enthusiastically about what Mr. Clinton called "the new face of Africa" and about a new breed of democratically inclined leaders. But Mr. Moose, warning that the picture is spotty, describes such comments as "a pretty thin batter they're spreading."
Ghana is a case in point. It is rich not only in manganese and cocoa but in talented people, proud that one of its sons, Kofi Annan, is Secretary General of the United Nations.
Economically, though, Ghana is still not back to where it was a quarter-century ago. To a correspondent returning to Accra after an absence of almost three decades, progress seems sparse.
There is an exuberant animation to street life, as always, and bars are full. But power outages are more commonplace than ever, and most of the population of three million still lives in dusty shantytowns ringing the more modern buildings at the city's center. And democracy has been elusive -- Jerry J. Rawlings, the President, seized power by military force not once but twice, although he has committed himself to leaving office in two years in accordance with Ghana's Constitution.
The nation's economy is growing at 5.5 per cent a year, an encouraging figure, and the Ashanti Goldfields Company, as it proudly noted in newspaper advertisements today, became the first sub-Saharan enterprise listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1996. The big aluminum smelter, owned by the Kaiser Aluminum Corporation and the Reynolds Metals Company, continues to produce ingots for export to the United States, though at sharply reduced rate because of power shortages.
Ghana's per capita income is still less than $500 a year. Like most Africans, most Ghanaians are little touched by industrial growth. Few of the dreams that Ghana dreamed in 1957 -- when it became the first black African country to free itself from colonial rule and a leader in the non-aligned bloc -- have been realized. Many opportunities have been missed, beginning in the heyday of Kwame Nkrumah, the charismatic, American-educated politician who led the nation with so much verve and so little wisdom.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The two front-page "Help Unwanted" articles (March 19 and 21) on the European job drought note that joblessness in the United States is at a record low because of a surge in the service industry, wage flexibility and fewer regulations. However, two other important aspects of the American growth model were left out. 
 First, the United States sends three times as many people to prison, as a percentage of its population, as any European country. This reduces the number of unemployed, since prisoners are not counted as jobless in labor statistics and there is increased job growth in the prison industry. Second, America's defense industry is a job-creating machine few other countries can match.

Struggling to Survive

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A March 19 front-page article describes the anger of France's unemployed toward a welfare system that does not provide a "decent standard of living." 
 In the United States, welfare provides less than survival benefits. A typical family of three on assistance in New York City receives an average monthly grant of $577, half the Federal poverty level. After rent, this leaves families with at most $6 per person a day to pay for food, clothing, utilities, transportation and school supplies.
New York has not raised the public assistance grant since 1990, although the cost of living has increased by 25 percent since then. A cost-of-living adjustment in the welfare grant would go a long way to help recipients participate in education, training and employment.

HEADLINE: SHAKE-UP IN RUSSIA: THE OVERVIEW;
YELTSIN DISMISSES HIS ENTIRE CABINET IN SHOW OF POWER

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 23

 BODY:
Demonstrating once again his enormous power and his mercurial nature, President Boris N. Yeltsin astonished the nation today by dismissing his entire Cabinet, including his loyal and dedicated aide, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin.
Even for people who have grown used to Mr. Yeltsin's almost Shakespearean penchant for casting off those closest to him at regular intervals, today's actions seemed difficult to comprehend. 
 Theories swirled through the capital like a cyclone. Some said it was part of a larger battle between factions of rich businessmen seeking to control the Government. Others are convinced that Mr. Yeltsin acted from confusion.
But there is a simpler explanation. In the last two months, with the 67-year-old President often ill, disengaged and out of the public eye, discussion of his possible successor has again become a common topic on television and in the press.
The next elections are not until 2000, and nothing infuriates Mr. Yeltsin more than the suggestion that he has lost any of his political authority.
By abruptly removing Mr. Chernomyrdin, Mr. Yeltsin has lost the only stable figure in his Cabinet, and the United States has lost its most direct pipeline to the Russian leadership. In Washington, American officials expressed worries over future relations with Moscow. Page A8.
"This decision grows from a simple fact, said Aleksei Zudin, an analyst at the Center for Political Technologies here. "While the President was ill, Viktor Chernomyrdin became much stronger. Boris Yeltsin interprets such things with great jealousy and annoyance."
Mr. Yeltsin has a long and well-documented history of dismissing anyone -- including aides who once resided comfortably within his inner circle -- whom he considers capable of challenging his leadership.
Last year he dragged himself from a hospital bed to dismiss Aleksandr I. Lebed, the national security adviser who he had once hinted was his heir apparent but who then grew a little too visibly eager for the job. And this is the third time in three years that Mr. Yeltsin has dismissed Anatoly B. Chubais, the highly controversial economic reform leader, from a senior post.
Although much was made today of Mr. Yeltsin's having dismissed his entire Cabinet, which is technically true, there are only three major victims so far: Mr. Chernomyrdin; Mr. Chubais, whose departure as First Deputy Prime Minister was expected, and Anatoly S. Kulikov, the hard-line Interior Minister.
Mr. Kulikov was a proponent of the disastrous war in Chechnya and in charge of the tax police, whose failure to increase revenues has also damaged the Kremlin's credibility.
Most of the other Cabinet members will almost certainly keep their jobs. "The dismissal of the Cabinet does not mean a change of course in our policy," Mr. Yeltsin said in a surprisingly folksy and conciliatory speech to the nation. "It is an effort to make economic reforms more energetic and effective, to give them a political push, a new impulse. The renovation of power is a natural process. You can't have a Government without changes."
Mr. Yeltsin initially said he would take over temporarily as his own Prime Minister, but then he named the young Energy Minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, as First Deputy Prime Minister until he names a permanent Prime Minister.
Mr. Kiriyenko is an obscure official who has solid reform credentials, and the President's spokesman said tonight that Mr. Kiriyenko would have to be considered the leading candidate.
That would make some sense if what Mr. Yeltsin wants is a weak Cabinet. Because he is not well known, Mr. Kiriyenko would have a far easier time gaining confirmation in the Communist-dominated lower house of Parliament.
He would also be entirely dependent on Mr. Yeltsin, having no significant political power of his own.
"The offer came as a complete surprise," Mr. Kiriyenko, 35, said at a news conference today in which he pledged to adhere to the course of reforms. "I learned about it this morning."
Mr. Chubais, who has battled bitterly over the future course of economic openness and reform in Russia with a small group of businessmen, most notable among them Boris A. Berezovsky, stated often in the last few months that his time in the Kremlin would soon end.
As for Mr. Chernomyrdin, almost from the day that he became Mr. Yeltsin's Prime Minister, there have been rumors that he would be relieved of his post.
Stolid, unimaginative and almost deadly dull, Mr. Chernomyrdin somehow developed into the most respectable and predictable member of the Cabinet. He remained in part because his loyalty was absolute.
That and his unique ability to work with the Communists in the Parliament, foreign colleagues like Vice President Al Gore and representatives of the powerful oil and gas industry he once led kept his job secure. But recently Mr. Yeltsin's daughter, Tatyana Dychenko, his closest and perhaps only real confidante, has been said to consider Mr. Chernomyrdin a threat.
Today, Mr. Yeltsin said he had told Mr. Chernomyrdin that it would be best for him to take a political course and prepare for the 2000 elections. But nobody would see that as an endorsement. Mr. Chernomyrdin, an uncomfortable speaker, was unable to say today that he would seek the presidency when Mr. Yeltsin's second, and last, legal term expires.
Few political analysts give him much chance without the power of the prime ministership or the direct support of Mr. Yeltsin. During parliamentary elections in 1996, the profoundly uncharismatic Mr. Chernomyrdin -- at the behest of the President -- helped create a new party, Our Home Is Russia. It was trounced at the polls. Today he seemed oddly resigned to his fate.
"I want to tell you openly that I worked six years in the Government," said Mr. Chernomyrdin, appearing somber but self-assured at a news conference, "including five years as Prime Minister, and I was ready every day for this turn of events. This was not a tragedy for me."
The Russian markets at first plunged on the news of Mr. Yeltsin's action, but they recovered during the day after it was clear that a radical new course was not likely.
Still, Mr. Yeltsin's latest surprise may damage the economy that he said in his speech he wanted to rescue. The Central Bank had to immediately intervene in the currency markets this afternoon to keep the ruble stable. Needless expenses like that will make it much harder to find the money to pay the back wages owed to millions of workers, which is one of the reasons Mr. Yeltsin gave for dismissing the Cabinet.
He will also have to make some effort to convince the West that his decision today was not as capricious as it appears. And he will have an opportunity this week when he meets here with the Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President Jacques Chirac of France.
"Boris Yeltsin loves to surprise everyone and to make moves that no one expects from him," said Nikolai Petrov of the Carnegie Moscow Center.
Mr. Yeltsin often blames his Government for the problems of the Russian people. It is a role that the Russian chief has taken on himself since the days of the czars -- and it usually works.

HEADLINE: Wine Talk;
Price Chaos on Restaurant Lists

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
IT is time for a significant celebration, an elegant dinner with wine. Not just any wine, either, but Chateau Petrus. You might do it at Lespinasse, in the St. Regis Hotel. They have the rare 1982 Petrus. At $5,000 a bottle.
Or you might bypass Lespinasse and amble a few doors west on 55th Street to Michael's, a popular spot where the very same wine goes for a mere $1,000. With the $4,000 your little stroll saved you, you might throw in a weekend in Bordeaux, even visit Chateau Petrus. That would be celebrating! 
 A bit farfetched? The trip, perhaps, but not the disparity in the price of Petrus. I, and plenty of other people who eat out regularly, have often been appalled not only by the staggering increase in restaurant wine prices but also by the seemingly arbitrary and capricious way prices differ from one restaurant to another in New York.
Nowhere does the chaotic state of the city's wine lists become more apparent than in a new study prepared by the Zagat Survey, the publisher of the restaurant and hotel guides. The three-month project, which was just completed, examined the wine lists of 64 restaurants drawn from the 1998 Zagat Survey of New York City Restaurants.
There are startling differences from top to bottom of the lists. For example, the moderately priced New Zealand Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc ranges from $29 at Jean Georges to $75 at Manhattan Ocean Club. But the most extreme disparities apply to highly touted wines, almost all of them from Bordeaux and Burgundy, that are in short supply.
Take the 1982 Petrus: At Le Cirque 2000, the wine sells for $4,000, up from $3,750 a few weeks ago. La Cote Basque and La Grenouille sell it for $2,400; Harry's at Hanover Square and the Four Seasons both have it for $1,750.
Chateau Petrus produces less than 4,000 cases of wine a year, so sales are by allocation. Ten years after the vintage, when it is mature, the wine is almost impossible to acquire, except for the few bottles that turn up at auctions. An established restaurant that bought the 1982 Bordeaux in 1983 got the lowest prices and can, if it wishes, sell the bottles at far lower prices than a restaurant that opened last year and had to set about acquiring a cellar at the top of the price market. And the most fashionable restaurants, like Lespinasse and Le Cirque 2000, cater to a clientele that demands famous labels, regardless of price.
The more prestigious a wine is, and the harder it is to acquire, the more some people will pay to get it, like season tickets to the Knicks or Giants games. Such wines are more often drunk by deal makers, film stars and rock musicians than by wine connoisseurs.
Beyond the Petrus example, others large disparities tumble out of the survey. At Le Cirque, a bottle of Chateau Latour 1982 sells for $2,400, or more than four times the $575 it costs downtown at Harry's at Hanover Square.
The 1993 Le Montrachet, Marquis de Laguiche, from Joseph Drouhin, $530 at La Grenouille, is $210 at Mark's.
Grange 1991, the famous Australian wine formerly known as Grange Hermitage, is $700 at Le Cirque and $245 at Chiam.
The 1993 vintage of Opus One, the California wine produced by Robert Mondavi and Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, sells for $225 at Windows on the World and $89 at Cite.
Krug Brut Champagne 1985, $320 at Oceana, is $160 at Barbetta and $150 at the Oyster Bar. Beaulieu Vineyards Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon, also from the 1985 vintage, is $196 at Maloney & Porcelli and $85 at Harry's at Hanover Square.
The longest list in the Zagat study was at Windows on the World, with 669 wines; the shortest was at Cafe des Artistes, with 44 wines. The lists were divided into three categories: bargains, expensive and moderate.
Without question, Harry's at Hanover Square, a well-known haven for Wall Street wine lovers, had the best prices in the city. According to the Zagat computations, Harry's had 62 of the lowest prices and none of the highest.
Some of Harry's wines that were priced lower than at any of the other restaurants polled were Calon-Segur 1982, at $110 ($300 at Le Bernardin; Cos-d'Estournel 1982, at $185 ($550 at La Grenouille); Cheval Blanc 1982, $795 ($2,600 at Le Cirque); 1983 Haut-Brion, $145 ($440 at La Grenouille), and the 1984 Jordan Cabernet Sauvignon, $55 ($175 at Park Avenue Cafe). There are 586 wines on Harry's list and, by the way, there is a Harry: Harry Poulakakos, the owner and a passionate wine enthusiast himself.
"I buy in quantity and I keep my margins low," Mr. Poulakakos said. "My customers are spenders, but they are intelligent spenders."
Among other restaurants with significant numbers of the lowest-priced wines were Chiam, which tied Harry's with 62 (but Chiam had one wine with the highest price); Sparks Steak House, with 35 of the best prices; Ben Benson's, 24; Union Square Cafe, 20; Michael's, 18; Windows on the World, 18; Cite, 17, and Aureole, 14.
The restaurants with the highest prices were invariably among those noted for the city's highest food prices. Topping the list with the largest number of the highest or, in Zagat's words, the worst, prices was La Grenouille, with 55, followed by Daniel, 43; Le Cirque, 34, and Lespinasse, 28.
Others on the highest-price list were Le Bernardin with 24; Gotham Bar and Grill, 22; Maloney & Porcelli, 22; Les Celebrites, 21; the Four Seasons, 20, and Jean Georges, 16.
Among restaurants with moderate prices, the Carlyle had 13 of the best prices and 37 of the worst; Smith & Wollensky, 24 of the best, 21 of the worst; La Cote Basque, 11 best, 14 worst, and Barolo, 9 best, 16 worst. At the most expensive places, wine bargains were as scarce as empty tables.
"Daniel and La Grenouille," Zagat's researchers reported, "feature very few items in the under $40 range, perhaps a Loire white here or an American red there but no Burgundies or Bordeaux." At Le Cirque, only Italian whites were cited as good buys. Lespinasse was cited for offering "quite a number of wines at $50 and under," hailing from the Loire Valley, Calif.; South Africa, and Chile, among other sources.
To a degree, prosperity is the culprit behind outrageous wine prices. Customers are willing to pay almost anything for the best wines, and the only place many of them can be found is at auctions, which means paying more than retail.
"A lot of it is just keeping current," said Ralph Hersom, wine manager at Le Cirque 2000. "When we reopened in April 1997, most of our stocks of good wines had been depleted, and we were forced to go back to the auctions to replenish.
"If you follow auctions at all you know some of the older Bordeaux go for $10,000 and $15,000 a case -- $18,000 for the 1982 Petrus. If we want the wines, we have to pay those prices."
Danny Thames, the wine manager for the New York Restaurant Group, agrees. His restaurants include Smith & Wollensky, Cite, Manhattan Ocean Club, Park Avenue Cafe, Maloney & Porcelli and the Post House.
"I can't keep Opus One in stock at the Post House," he said. "At one point I was down to four bottles. I was barely able to find some at an auction. And of course, I had to raise the price." Each restaurant in the group buys separately because of individual liquor licenses, Mr. Thames said, which accounts for different prices for the same wine.
The 1987 Opus One, for example, is $288 at Smith & Wollensky, $275 at the Post House, $272 at Park Avenue Cafe, $253 at Maloney & Porcelli, $283 at Manhattan Ocean Club and $203 at Cite.
The Zagat wine list survey was intended as an internal document, but the publishing company expects to make it available in several weeks on its Web site (www.zagat.com) and by telephone at (212) 977-6000; a price, if any, has not yet been determined.
The study did not go into the economics of wine buying, but one fact stands out: There is no strong customer resistance to these prices. A case in point: On March 10, a group of six men dined at Le Cirque. Their bill: $22,840. Mr. Hersom said they drank a bottle of Roederer Cristal Champagne, 1990; a bottle of Chateau Le Pin, 1988, and a Chateau Petrus 1982. Then came three bottles of Chateau Cheval Blanc 1961, a bottle of Chateau Margaux 1945 and a bottle of Taylor Port, also 1945. Their food bill was less than $3,000; the rest was wine.
Most New York restaurants are not involved in this status game. There are hundreds of restaurant wines priced at $20 or less, which means that given the effects of inflation over the years, many of these wines are less expensive than they were 20 years ago and are bargains even if there is some disparity in prices.
New Yorkers can be canny wine buyers, and if they stay alert, prompted by this latest survey and their own experience, they will find the places with the most attractive wine lists. They know there is life after Petrus.

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
Trade Associations Form Electricity Supply Deals

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
As property managers and owners in New York and Westchester Counties prepare for the April 1 changes in state regulations that will allow them to choose their supplier of electricity, a group of real estate trade associations has announced an agreement with two of the new power suppliers.
The Electrical Power Procurement Alliance said it had negotiated a deal with New Energy Ventures-East and with Con Ed Solutions, the unregulated subsidiary of Consolidated Edison, that would provide immediate savings on electrical costs when the first, modest phase of deregulation starts on June 1. 
 The organizations, which include the Building Owners and Managers Association, which represents mostly commercial properties, and Associated Builders and Owners, which includes residential properties, represent purchasers of about one-third of Consolidated Edison's total power generation capacity. Although individual owners and managers would not be required to purchase from companies selected by the alliance, the collective buying power of the group gave it more negotiating influence than any individual, officials of the group said.
"We came together to handle deregulation on the broadest base possible, representing the smallest users to the largest," said Peter DiCapua, president of the Owners Committee on Electric Rates and a spokesman for the overall group. He said the savings would be in addition to the one-time $50 and $75 incentives being provided by Con Ed under its agreement with the Public Service Commission to induce smaller customers to switch to other suppliers, including Con Ed Solutions.
He said the arrangements worked out with Con Ed Solutions and New Energy Ventures-East represented the most favorable terms that were offered by the 12 energy service companies, or ESCO's, that would sell electricity in Con Ed's service territory.
"We believe the deal we have made with these two ESCO's is the best in town, and if someone comes up with anything better, we can get out of this one in 30 days," Mr. DiCapua said. He said there was a guaranteed minimum savings of 5 to 6 percent, depending on individual circumstances, and incentives to shrink bills further.
The deregulation that will take place starting June 1 will be modest, involving only 500 of the approximately 10,000 megawatts of power Con Ed can produce, with 200 megawatts reserved for smaller customers and 300 earmarked for larger users. All power in the Con Ed service area is to be deregulated by the end of 2001.
Much of the initial savings in electrical bills will be the result of avoiding taxes, executives said. Power generated by Con Ed is considered a commodity subject to a state tax of 4 percent and a New York City tax of 4.25 percent. When power is purchased outside the city or outside the state and transmitted to users, it is not subject to the sales tax, because transmission is considered a service.
"The tax piece is very big in the initial phases of deregulation," said Gerald Lieberman, the president of New Energy Ventures-East, which is a subsidiary of a California-based company, New Energy Ventures. But over time, he said, savings in the purchase of power will be more important as less efficient generators are driven from the market.
Energy service companies do not typically own their own generation facilities, but buy electrical power where surpluses exist and favorable rates can be negotiated. Unlike oil or gas, which can be stored, electrical power must be consumed as it is generated or it is lost.
"If a company has a 1,000 megawatt plant, and it is only selling 700 megawatts, that 300-megawatt capacity goes down the drain," Mr. Lieberman said. He said companies with unused capacity are eager to sell, and use attractive prices to make deals. There are physical and economic restrictions on how far power can be transmitted, but an open market for power is expected to be more price efficient than the current situation, in which companies generate much of their power within their own service territories.
Nicholas LaPorte, executive director of the Associated Builders and Owners, said it was expected that New Energy Ventures-East would concentrate on commercial accounts, while Con Ed Solutions would focus on residential customers, although both would be free to seek whatever business they could find.
"Con Ed is a known entity with an infrastructure in place and a history," Mr. LaPorte said. "There is a comfort level there that should appeal to the residential customer."
Because of the way transmission and distribution facilities were built, all of Manhattan and some other parts of the city cannot be fully supplied with imported power. In these areas, power must be generated locally, even if the plants are more costly than those located elsewhere.
Earlier, the 12 energy service companies participated in an auction to buy generating capacity from Con Ed, with New Energy Ventures-East and Con Ed Solutions both purchasing 51 megawatts.
One issue that remains uncertain is what will happen to the price of steam, which many large buildings use for both heating and cooling. Steam was originally a byproduct of the generating process, but over time profits from sales of electricity were used to subsidize the price of steam, property managers have said.
More than 2,000 high-rise buildings are connected to Con Ed steam through a 102-mile system of pipes stretching from 96th Street to the Battery. Buildings connected to the steam system do not need their own heating plant, which makes space available for storage and other uses.
"Steam is an important energy source for customers in New York, and there may be a lot of volatility in steam prices," said John E. Boyd, the president of Con Ed Solutions, which is based in White Plains. He said that steam would remain a part of the regulated Con Ed, while his company would provide financial services to moderate the impact of changing steam prices.

HEADLINE: Montana Writers' Sessions Teach Language of the Land

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Like the old Federal Writers' Project of the Great Depression, which provided jobs for unemployed authors, Gallatin Writers Inc. of Bozeman, Mont., puts writers in harness to help uplift a depressed area.
Where the Writers' Project turned out still-useful guidebooks and local histories, the Gallatin writers examine local conflicts and try to come up with solutions. At 9 or 10 conferences a year, the organization chews over local issues, like how to cope with the depletion of natural resources. Then the writers go forth to spread their acquired knowledge, writing books or articles for a variety of Western newspapers and magazines. 
 The three- or four-day conferences are held at ranches around Bozeman, in Gallatin County in southwestern Montana, or at the Gallatin Gateway Inn, which was built in 1937 as a jumping-off point for visitors to Yellowstone National Park, a few miles south of Bozeman. If the conferees find time for trout fishing or bike-hiking in the spectacular Gallatin Range of the Rocky Mountains (and they invariably do), that only helps to sensitize them to the land.
The project was developed in 1991 when Gallatin County was in an economic decline. The local industries -- farming, mining and lumbering -- suffered from over-use of the land and had lost their competitive edge.
Along came John Baden, a retired college professor who had taught economics for 25 years, most recently at the University of Washington, where he had co-founded an M.B.A. program. Mr. Baden, 58, who has owned a sheep and horse ranch in Bozeman since 1970, retired to the ranch and came up with the idea of seeking to strengthen the literary culture and examine the local identity and conflicts.
His workshop has achieved remarkable success, receiving grants from the Ford Foundation totaling more than $300,000 since its founding. Gallatin, unlike the Depression project, is privately supported. Another important difference is that Gallatin does not ask literary artists to do utilitarian work but instead taps their creative talents. Mr. Baden recruits writers and others for the conferences, and their expenses are paid by the workshop. He selects the topics and matches writers to them, but the writers are obliged only to attend. Any writing they do afterward on issues of concern to the West is up to them.
Some contribute to the Gallatin Writers' syndicated column, which appears in The Seattle Times and at least a dozen smaller newspapers throughout the West.
Bill Wilke, editor of The Bozeman Daily Chronicle, which carries the column, said, "The Gallatin Writers can be counted on to address the key issues here -- timber, mining, ranching, agriculture and the environment -- and do so in such a way that causes people to soften their views or even adopt new ideas."
One thing writers are especially good at, Mr. Baden said, is debunking worn-out images and creating suitable new ones. For example, a view subscribed to by many old-fashioned environmental advocates, he said, holds that any land development is bad. A new concept that is helping to replace the old one argues that development can be good so long as it does not run roughshod over the values of those who are most affected by it.
The newer concept -- dreamed up for a Gallatin workshop by Donald Snow, executive director of the Northern Lights Institute, a nonprofit environmental organization in Missoula, Mont. -- has had an impact. Today, Mr. Baden said, it is discussed throughout the West.
Mr. Baden said he liked to bring together environmental advocates like Mr. Snow with the "hook and bullet" crowd, people like Datus C. Proper, a writer and editor for Field and Stream magazine who lives on a farm in Gallatin County.
Mr. Proper, who said his love for Montana centered on rainbow trout, gray partridges and white-tailed deer, likes to needle environmental absolutists at Gallatin workshops by arguing that hunters help to preserve wildlife. "Their licensing fees go to the maintenance of wildlife refuges," he said.
Has Mr. Proper ever swayed an adversary?
"Hard to tell," he said. "It usually takes a few days to sink in."
One of the sharpest -- and Mr. Baden says healthiest -- debates at a Gallatin workshop took place a year or two ago. Participants included Todd Wilkinson, a Western correspondent for The Christian Science Monitor; Ray Rasker, a resource economist interested in environmental protection; and Brett KenCairn, an anthropologist and community organizer from Ashland, Ore.
Mr. KenCairn bemoaned the influx of "modem cowboys," new arrivals in the West who have little connection with the land and make their living at computer stations in their homes. "They don't participate in the life of the community," he said.
Mr. Rasker shouted, "Bunk!" and accused Mr. KenCairn of "romanticizing the idea that people in the West are drawn together only because they all know how to sharpen a chain saw."
"What makes people form a community is much more complicated than that," he said. "It has to do with schools or with the fact that somebody plans to open a hog farm down the road and things like that."
Mr. Baden said the debate was precisely the sort of interaction he hoped to generate. "We're trying to sensitize people to the fact that there are no simple solutions to our problems -- only trade-offs," he said.

HEADLINE: About New York;
Wall St. Horde Gives Mongols Feel of Action

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
MONDAY, the Mongols hit Manhattan, descending first on the New York Stock Exchange. They strode past the clerks and brokers who stood on Broad Street smoking their morning cigarettes. They skipped the line of tourists waiting to enter the building, eliciting suspicious whispers before they passed through the revolving doors and metal detectors. Their progress was smooth, until an alert guard slowed them down.
"No pictures," he said to them as they entered the elevator. "If you take any pictures, I'll have to throw you out of the building." 
 That's no way to treat descendants of the Great Conqueror, Genghis Khan. Centuries ago, the Mongols did the tossing out, amassing a sprawling Asian empire. By this century, Mongolia had become a Soviet protectorate. Then, in 1990, the Mongols pulled a nonviolent twist on tradition and replaced their Communist government.
Ever since, the nation's leaders have been working to spread free markets and democratic rule. Choosing the economy over ideology, a delegation of two dozen Mongolian politicians and executives visited the city to promote both their country and its business climate. They were eager to meet American bankers and business people. They came, they saw and they conferenced.
"It is important to meet business people in New York because the city is the center of finance and business," said Radnaasumbereliin Gonchigdorj, the Speaker of the Mongolian Parliament and leader of the delegation. "When we were a satellite of the Soviet Union, we were under Communism, and capitalism was always painted black, with all the horrors of competition."
Now, competition means green, so he and his colleagues filed into the stock exchange balcony to watch as the floor jumped into action at the opening bell. A guide pointed out where trades were made in different industries, as the guests nodded. Jargalsaikhan Enkhsaikhan, the Ambassador to the United Nations, had already briefed some of them on the workings of the exchange.
"I told them how most of the trading decisions are made in 22 seconds," the Ambassador said. "I told them about the clerks, specialists and brokers. Actually, in Mongolia we have our own stock exchange. We have about 29 brokers."
The visitors were impressed by the array of monitors, tickers and computers that blinked the market's vital signs. One asked whether it was possible for Mongolian companies to be listed on the New York exchange. It was all part of their plan to continue the transition they had begun in 1990, with an emphasis on foreign investment incentives and the privatization of state-run businesses in manufacturing, food production and just about everything else.
GIVEN how city officials have done a little privatizing of their own with parks, health care and social services, the Mongols came to the right place. Mr. Gonchigdorj admitted that as a child, he knew little about the city, except for what he read in books.
"Of course, I had a certain understanding about New York, especially the sky-high buildings and the taxis," he said. "If I recall correctly, they were called 'Yellow Devils of New York.' "
The city he encountered filled him with new impressions, including one sure to hearten city officials intent on establishing the rule of order. "As a mathematician, I would like to say that this is the best city in terms of coordination," he said. "No one can be lost in this city. Everything is good. It is a square, coordinated system."
At a conference with American executives, he explained how new tax laws and incentives had combined with less bureaucracy to change his nation's economic system. The Americans seemed interested and their reaction buoyed the Mongolian delegation, which left later in the afternoon for meetings at the United Nations.
The schedule was tight, and it left Mr. Gonchigdorj with no time to do the touristy stuff that had been on his itinerary, like seeing "Cats" on Broadway. Nor could he visit the one place he had longed to see: the Statue of Liberty.
Some New Yorkers base their urban authenticity on avoiding the place, but to Mr. Gonchigdorj, it is the apex of art and independence. "There are people who are in a rush but not to see it," he said. "They do not visit it because it is always available. On the other hand, the symbolism is very important to Mongols."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Nasdaq Market Index Posts Its First Close Above 1,800

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Several major stock market indexes climbed to highs yesterday as investors used the previous day's selloff as an opportunity to buy stocks at lower prices. The gains pushed the Nasdaq composite index, a leading technology barometer, to its first close above 1,800.
A retreat in crude oil prices, which buoyed the Treasury bond market by diminishing fears of higher inflation, aided stocks as well. After rising almost $2 a barrel on Monday, oil prices slipped by more than 50 cents a barrel yesterday, reflecting investors' skepticism about whether oil producers would stick to a weekend agreement to curb production. Also sliding were prices of such oil shares as Chevron, British Petroleum and Mobil. Several oil-related indexes also faltered. The Oil Service Sector index fell 1.92 percent, the Amex Natural Gas index slipped 1.84 percent and the Amex oil index fell 1.36 percent. 
 The prospect of lower fuel prices lifted the Philadelphia Airline Sector index 2.18 percent, with such airlines as the UAL Corporation, Northwest Airlines, Southwest Airlines and British Airways gaining.
In addition, many stocks that had faltered in the previous session, including Disney, General Electric and I.B.M., rose.
And financial services companies, for which continued consolidations are expected, rose, aided by a strong earnings report from Goldman, Sachs. "These companies want to buy themselves, and as investors you want to see that," Alan Bond, chief investment office at Bond Procope Capital Management in New York, said.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 88.19 points, or 1 percent, to 8,904.44, just 1.99 points away from its record closing high of 8,906.43 reached last Friday.
But other indexes posted records, including the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which gained 10.10 points, to 1,105.65, and the Russell 2000 index, which gained 2.30 points, to 476.26.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 19.93 points, or 1.11 percent, to 1,812.44.
Among smaller-company shares. the Securities and Exchange Commission took the rather severe action of temporarily suspending trading yesterday in Shopping.com, an Internet-based retailer, citing concerns about a "lack of current and accurate information" about the stock; it said that recent market activity might be a result of "manipulative conduct."
Shopping.com went public in November, selling 1.3 million shares at $9 a share, for a total of $11.7 million.
Since then, the stock reached a 52-week high of 32 1/8 on March 12 and closed at 22 1/4 on Monday, down 6 5/8. The company does not expect to make a profit for several years, and the stock traded on the National Association of Securities Dealers over-the-counter bulletin board, which has no stock listing requirements.
The 10-day suspension came after problems with the company began to appear last week. The company's sole underwriter, Waldron & Company, stopped trading the stock after its clearing broker, Wedbush Morgan Securities, told the National Association of Securities Dealers that it would no longer process stock trades for Waldron, an N.A.S.D. official said.
Last year, the company withdrew its request for listing on the Nasdaq market after it learned that its application would be denied, said a person familiar with the procedure.

HEADLINE: Jakarta Dissident Questions U.S. Military Aid

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
Indonesia's best-known opposition leader has challenged President Clinton to explain why United States special-operations soldiers are training members of the Indonesian military.
"Who, in the view of the U.S. government, is the target or enemy for this specialised training?" asked Megawati Sukarnoputri in a March 18 letter to Mr. Clinton. Noting that her country faces no foreign threat, she suggested that the troops' real targets were Indonesians protesting against their Government. 
 The United States has been training Indonesian soldiers despite a 1992 Congressional ban intended to end the instruction. Under a little-known $10 million Pentagon program called Joint Combined Exchange and Training, United States special forces teach the Indonesians skills that include psychological warfare and urban combat techniques.
"The U.S. military is providing training in lethal methods of social control at a time when the Indonesian people are trying to build a more democratic system," said the letter, a copy of which was given to The New York Times. "It is the explicit policy of the Indonesia security forces to meet peaceful and unarmed demonstrators with force -- and thus military training from the U.S. directly undermines the democratic movement in Indonesia."
Indonesia's military has ordered its troops to police recent political protests against the Indonesian Government.
Pentagon officials say the commando training increases the United States' ability to influence the Indonesian troops' respect for human rights. Mrs. Megawati's letter questioned that argument. "In light of the U.S. government's stated support for democracy around the world, I respectfully request an explanation of this secret training program that contradicts this noble foreign policy goal," her letter concluded.
The Indonesian military is seen by many members of the Government and some of the people as the most stable institution in a nation whipsawed by political corruption, skyrocketing inflation and social unrest.
But the military is accused of a long series of abuses, including the disappearances of political opponents, and it engineered Mrs. Megawati's ouster as chairwoman of one of the nation's three sanctioned political parties in 1996. Mrs. Megawati, the daughter of the former Indonesian ruler, Sukarno, has become the leading symbol of dissent against the 32-year reign of President Suharto.
Congress cut off funds that went to Indonesia under a program called International Military Education and Training in 1992, after Indonesian troops massacred more than 270 civilians on the island of East Timor. But the Pentagon continued its instruction in Indonesia under the Joint Combined Education and Training program.
Representative Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat, said today that she would introduce legislation to end that instruction and ban the Pentagon from "training an army that has been implicated in cases of torture, murder and disappearances."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
In California, a Distant Mirror on Korea

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 24

 BODY:
Bong Koo Cho was once one of the wealthiest industrialists and biggest landowners in South Korea. He lived in a 14,500-square-foot mansion and owned five or six cars.
But in 1984 he lost nearly everything. He abandoned his country, never to return, and has lived quietly in the Los Angeles area ever since. 
 Now, at 78, Mr. Cho is seeking to avenge his losses. He and his family have filed a lawsuit in state court here demanding the return of their fortune, which they say was illegally seized from them by the military dictatorship of Chun Doo Hwan. The assets today would be worth $2 billion, Mr. Cho estimates.
The lawsuit, while no doubt a long shot, could cast light on the corruption and political meddling in South Korea's economic system, something the nation is trying to leave behind in the wake of its recent economic collapse. The case also shows that back in the 1980's Korea was dealing with a problem that seems very familiar today -- a huge industrial expansion, backed by the Government and fueled by heavy borrowing, that left many companies on the verge of bankruptcy and banks buried under bad debts.
Mr. Cho's company, Samho Group, one of the largest conglomerates at the time, was transferred to a rival company, Daelim Group, as part of a Government program to merge, sell or liquidate companies deemed to be insolvent. But Mr. Cho denies that Samho was insolvent and said the real reason was that he and his family had failed to pay enough bribes to President Chun. The owner of Daelim, meanwhile, was the brother of the Speaker of the National Assembly and a close ally of Mr. Chun.
Several other companies were also seized at that time, and there is some evidence that failure to pay off the President did play a role. In one well-known case, a Korean court ruled in 1993 that the dismantling of the Kukje Group in 1985 was illegal. Kukje's owner contended that the Government ordered banks to cut off all financing to his company after he failed to make a big contribution to President Chun.
The Cho lawsuit could be embarrassing to some prominent Koreans who were involved in the Samho case. The Minister of Finance at the time, Kim Mahn Je, is now chairman of the giant Pohang Iron and Steel Company. Another official involved was Lim Chang Yuel, the Minister of Finance who guided Korea through its recent negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.
No present or former Government officials, however, are targets of the lawsuit, which names Daelim and Cho Hung Bank, Samho's main bank, and their American subsidiaries.
A spokesman for Pohang said Mr. Kim preferred not to comment on the matter. Spokesmen for Daelim and Cho Hung in Seoul said nobody there could talk about an incident that took place more than a decade ago. Simon Hong, a lawyer in Los Angeles for the California Cho Hung Bank, said the bank believed the suit was "groundless."
Mr. Cho, who never finished high school, started in the sewing machine business and moved into textiles, glass and construction. Along the way he accumulated real estate, becoming a major holder in the southern part of Seoul, which later boomed, and on Cheju, a resort island.
In the mid-1970's, Korea's Government urged Korean construction companies to seek contracts in the booming Middle East. But many companies ran up huge debts doing so, and by the mid-1980's the Government decided to sell, merge or liquidate insolvent companies without allowing them to declare bankruptcy, which, it was thought, would alarm the public and cast an international spotlight on the huge bad debts in Korea's banking system.
Samho had debt of about $350 million in part because the Saudi Arabian Government had failed to pay it for a housing project owing to a dispute over the contract terms. Mr. Cho, who suffered a stroke in 1979, was in the United States seeking treatment in 1984 and the company was being run by his son Yong See. The son, who now calls himself Peter Cho, said that on Aug. 24, 1984, he was summoned by Finance Minister Kim and told that the decision had been made to confiscate Samho and the family's private property.
He was then sent to see the president of Cho Hung Bank, who, he recalled, chastised him, saying: "I told you to lobby top-level guys. What have you been doing?" He said the bank president also said that since Mr. Cho was going to lose everything anyway, he might as well take care of his health, a remark Mr. Cho interpreted as a threat that he would be tortured if he resisted.
While Daelim officials waited in the next room, Mr. Cho said, he was forced to sign three blank pieces of paper, which later became documents transferring virtually all the family's assets to Daelim. The Chos say the body of Peter's older brother, who had died at a young age from cancer, had to be removed from his grave because the family burial plot was taken as well.
The Chos also say they had enough assets to cover the debts. "We were simply not even given a chance," the elder Mr. Cho said in an interview through an interpreter. "The Cho family's assets were simply handed over on a platter to the Lee family," he said, referring to the Daelim owners. The Cho family moved to the United States, except for Peter, who was detained in Korea because of a tax dispute until 1990.
Father and son seem to partly blame each other for the loss of property. Peter Cho said that when he ran Samho he dispensed $700,000 to Government officials on holidays, three times a year. But his father resisted doing even more.
"I told him to get along with Chun -- sacrifice some of your assets, give him the golf course or the hotel," Peter Cho said. "He wouldn't listen to me."
Still, enough wealth seems to have remained that Mr. Cho and his son have survived without working since then. "After you are one of the top-ranking businessmen in Korea after you come here, it's hard to start a liquor store or dry cleaner," said Peter Cho, 47, who had gone to high school and college in the United States.
As democracy came to Korea in the late 1980's and early 1990's, the Cho family tried without much luck to retrieve some of their assets. But in late 1995, former President Chun was arrested and eventually sentenced to life in prison for amassing hundreds of millions of dollars of "donations"' from businessmen. "It dawned on us that this was the chance for the family," said Sally Cho, one of Mr. Cho's four daughters.
The family filed its suit in Los Angeles County Superior Court in December. The Chos say they chose a court in the United States rather than Korea because they are all United States citizens and because American lawyers are willing to work on contingency. But the difficulty of suing foreign companies -- the defendants have not even been served with copies of the lawsuit -- and the fact that the events occurred so long ago will make the case tough.
One week after the suit was filed, Kim Dae Jung, an ardent foe of the military dictatorship, was elected President of South Korea and promised to right the wrongs of the past. But Mr. Cho was disappointed that one of the President-elect's first acts was to agree to a pardon of Mr. Chun in the name of national unity.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Donor Won New York Contract As His Gifts Soared

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
In March 1997, a construction company owned by one of the biggest financial backers of Gov. George E. Pataki and the New York Republican State Committee learned that it was on the verge of losing the competition for a contract to repair the Queens-Midtown Tunnel that was worth as much as $100 million.
When officials of the Long Island company, Silverite Construction, complained to the state agency overseeing the contract, they were allowed to revamp their bid, according to interviews and state records. Two months later, Silverite was awarded the contract, even though state officials had initially determined that the company and its partner in the venture lacked the necessary experience, the records show. 
 In the days just before and after the contract was awarded on May 30, 1997, the Republican State Committee received a spate of donations from contributors linked to Silverite's owner, Angelo J. Silveri, totaling $100,000, records show. Of that, $40,000 was contributed by a political action committee that Silverite set up just nine days before the contract was awarded. Since then, the PAC has been virtually dormant.
Among the other contributors were Mr. Silveri's wife; an executive of Silverite; the wife of another Silverite executive, and an executive of another company that Mr. Silveri controls. Each gave $10,000, received on the same day, May 28, 1997.
Before the donations last spring, Mr. Silveri, his relatives, his employees and companies he controls had given about $210,000 to the state party and the Pataki campaign, most of it in late 1994 and early 1995, according to campaign records.
In a telephone interview last week, Mr. Silveri denied that anyone connected to him had made donations around the time the contract was awarded. But then, when presented with details of the donations, he said, "I hope you're not driving a nail into something that is not there."
Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that awarded the contract, said officials there did not know about the campaign donations. "This contract was awarded on the merits," he said.
Yet the timing of the donations underscores the success that the State Republican Party and the Pataki campaign have had at exercising an advantage of incumbency: collecting gifts from companies and others with a stake in decisions by the state government. Those gifts have helped the Republican leaders and Mr. Pataki raise money at a far more aggressive pace than any other politicians in state history. The Governor's campaign treasury now holds more than $11 million.
Silverite Construction was one of several bidders in early 1997 vying for the tunnel contract, a four-year project to replace much of the lighting, walls and ceiling.
The company, one of the largest privately owned general contractors in the state, has over the years worked for many government agencies including the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Mr. Silveri, 60, has been active in several building trade groups on Long Island, and was a trustee of Adelphi University until last year, when state officials ousted the board of trustees, charging that it had failed to oversee the university's president.
Mr. Silveri was on Mr. Pataki's inaugural committee and said in the interview that he was a friend of Charles A. Gargano, the Governor's senior economic development adviser and former chief fund-raiser.
"I speak to him an awful lot," Mr. Silveri said of Mr. Gargano. Mr. Silveri said he might have discussed the tunnel contract with Mr. Gargano, but he said he did not ask for assistance in getting the contract.
Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gargano, said he was no longer a political fund-raiser. She said that while "it's possible" that Mr. Gargano discussed the contract with Mr. Silveri, Mr. Gargano was not involved in the bidding.
Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said he had no role in the selection of Silverite by the transportation authority, which is controlled by gubernatorial appointees. Asked whether the Governor knew Mr. Silveri, Ms. Mucha said, "It's irrelevant whether the Governor knows him or doesn't know him."
The circumstances surrounding the Queens-Midtown Tunnel contract were pieced together from interviews, campaign finance records and court papers in lawsuits filed by two construction companies against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that contended that the competition was biased in favor of Silverite and its partner.
Silverite bid in a joint venture with another company, Frontier-Kemper Constructors of Evansville, Ind. Together, the two companies offered to do the work for $96.96 million. That proposal turned out to be the third lowest among seven bids for the job, court records show.
But the authority was basing its decision on more than price. The tunnel project is one of the most complicated it has undertaken in recent years, requiring a contractor that will do extensive renovations while not crippling the flow of traffic. The authority told the bidders that they had to prove that they had successfully completed a similarly difficult tunnel project to get the one at the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.
On March 11, 1997, the authority sent a letter to the Silverite venture saying that it had not "met the requirements" for prior experience, according to state records.
On March 18, 1997, Silverite and its partner sent a letter to the authority saying that they were "somewhat dismayed," and over the next two months, they repeatedly lobbied authority officials, trying to convince them that they were qualified.
The Silverite venture submitted new evidence that focused on Silverite's partner, Frontier-Kemper. They said the venture had the experience because of the work of construction companies in Europe that were connected to Frontier-Kemper through complex ownership arrangements. They cited the experience of the European companies even though those companies themselves were not bidding on the Queens-Midtown Tunnel project.
In May, the authority reversed itself and accepted Silverite's position. At the same time, the low bidder dropped out, and the authority disqualified the second-lowest bidder for lacking experience. That bidder -- a joint venture of Tap Electrical Contracting Service and Loduca Associates -- had offered to do the job for $83.92 million, $13.04 million less than the Silverite venture.
With those two bidders out, the authority awarded Silverite the contract. The fourth-lowest bidder, Grow Tunneling, which had bid $97.81 million -- only $850,000 more than Silverite -- protested, saying that the authority should not have let Silverite revamp its application and use the European companies to meet the experience requirement.
"Based on the rules, they did not satisfy the requirements and should have been turned down," said Charles E. Williams 3d, a lawyer for Grow Tunneling.
Grow Tunneling and the Tap Electrical venture sued the authority separately. Grow Tunneling said it was the lowest bidder with the proper experience. Tap Electrical said it had been wrongly disqualified, charging that the authority had undertaken a "campaign to improperly award the contract to Silverite."
In June 1997, the two companies asked Justice Charles E. Ramos in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to void the contract immediately. Justice Ramos declined to do so, but said he would rule on whether the bidding had been fair. He has not issued a ruling. The four-year project began in January, and the authority says it is going smoothly.
Donations were not mentioned in the lawsuits, and lawyers for the two losing bidders said last week that they had not known of Mr. Silveri's political activities.
It does not appear that either Grow Tunneling or Tap Electrical donated to the Republicans at any time during the bidding process.
Sayward Mazur, a lawyer for the Silverite venture, said there was not "one scintilla of evidence" to support the charges by the losing bidders. Mr. Mazur said the authority did not violate any rules by letting Silverite rely on the experience of the European companies, which he said would provide expertise.
Asked about contributions linked to Mr. Silveri, Mr. Mazur said, "I am totally not aware that there were any contributions."
The largest single contribution connected to Silverite, $40,000, came from the Old Country PAC, which was established on May 21, 1997, nine days before the contract was awarded, according to state records.
The committee apparently got its name from Silverite's address, 520 Old Country Road in Hicksville, N.Y. The Republicans received the $40,000 from the PAC on June 2, 1997. In the days before that donation, $40,000 had been deposited into the PAC's account -- $10,000 from Mr. Silveri himself and a total of $30,000 from six companies that he controls, each of which gave $5,000.
The Republican State Committee also received donations of $10,000 each from five people connected to Silverite, all on May 28, 1997.
They were Constance Silveri, Mr. Silveri's wife; two executives, Frank Chiodo and Stephen Cody; the wife of a third employee, Theresa Giorgi, and William Doremus, president of the James McCullagh Company, a contractor that has often worked with Silverite and was hired by Silverite to help on the tunnel project.
Ms. Giorgi and Mr. Chiodo did not reply to phone calls seeking comment. Ms. Silveri declined to comment. Mr. Cody and Mr. Doremus said they could not recall details of their contributions.
Two other contributors were Silverite itself and another company controlled by Mr. Silveri, Ontrac Construction. Each gave $5,000, also received on May 28, 1997.
Silverite and Ontrac had previously given $5,000 each to the PAC, so the donations to the Republicans appear to put both companies over the limit. Under state law, corporations can give up to $5,000 annually to all state and local candidates and committees, with few exceptions.
Terry O'Brien, a spokesman for the Republican State Committee, acknowledged the committee's receipt of the donations, but said no one at the committee had called the authority about the contract. "The name of the company just doesn't ring a bell," Mr. O'Brien said.
Mr. Silveri also contributed $1,000 to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's current re-election campaign on June 24, 1997.
After denying in the interview that donors connected to him had given money to the Republicans, Mr. Silveri conceded that Silverite had set up the PAC. But he declined to say why the company had done so or why it had not included its name in the PAC's title, as is customary.
"I really feel that this is something that I shouldn't be discussing with you," he said. "What's the point of that? Give me a break."
Soon after, Mr. Silveri hung up. He did not respond to three later telephone requests for further comment.

HEADLINE: U.S. and I.M.F. Delay Funds for Indonesia

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
The United States and the International Monetary Fund have agreed to delay billions of dollars in aid to Indonesia until President Suharto begins to act on a revised plan for economic reform being negotiated in Jakarta, according to American and I.M.F. officials.
But in an effort to alleviate the food riots that some Indonesians blame on the austerity measures required in the plan, the United States announced today that it would send more than $70 million in emergency food and medical aid. In recent days the United States and the fund have also agreed to allow some Indonesian subsidies on food and fuel to continue, easing the conditions imposed on Jakarta two months ago. 
 Officials said a larger emergency food and medicine program was being coordinated by the World Bank, with major contributions expected by Japan and Australia.
"We want to show that while the only long-term solution is to follow the I.M.F.'s plan, there are humanitarian issues that have to be addressed immediately," said Stuart Eizenstat, the Undersecretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs.
The carrot-and-stick strategy has emerged after lengthy debate over how to handle the potential economic disintegration of the world's fourth most populous nation.
Since the fund put together a $43 billion aid plan in October, Mr. Suharto has resisted many of the steps he had agreed to under two previous plans.
A third agreement is under negotiation that would impose strict budgetary controls and monetary policies on Indonesia and require the dismantling of many cartels.
After lengthy discussions with Mr. Suharto's new economic team, American officials say they now have some hope, in the words of one senior official, "that the Indonesians realize that if they don't commit to the reforms, they simply aren't going to get the money."
But Administration officials say it is still far from clear whether Mr. Suharto will go along with the changes the fund is demanding.
Payment of the next installment of funds has been delayed until the middle of April at the earliest, when the I.M.F. board will review both the agreement and the steps Mr. Suharto has taken to implement it, according to American and fund officials.
"We have had constructive discussions," David Lipton, a senior Treasury official, said today after returning from a week of talks with Mr. Suharto's economic advisers. "But it is a long road to economic recovery."
It is the I.M.F. that has been conducting talks with Indonesia, and it is the I.M.F. that will decide when the Indonesians have done enough to earn the next aid installment. But the United States holds a de facto veto over such decisions, and so the talks with Indonesia have been a delicate, three-way dance between Mr. Suharto, economists and top officials from the I.M.F. and American officials in Jakarta and Washington.
In the end the success or failure of the effort comes down to one man: President Suharto, who has repeatedly stated his willingness to work with the fund, and repeatedly undercut his commitments to break up monopolies run by his friends and deferred tough austerity measures.
"He is going to have to do the kinds of things that give people the sense that he is taking ownership of the reforms, the way the South Koreans, the Thais and the Mexicans did," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in an interview last week. "Only by doing that can he get the confidence of the markets back."
During the Administration's internal debates, Mr. Rubin has generally advocated taking a tough line with Mr. Suharto. He has argued that unless the Indonesian fulfills the reforms he has promised the I.M.F., the fund's credibility will be severely undercut, and other nations may be tempted to back out of politically unpalatable conditions set by the fund.
There is also a political calculation to Mr. Rubin's position: He is trying to convince Congress to approve $18 billion in additional funds to the I.M.F. to handle future economic crises. While the Senate appears ready to approve the money, a major fight looms in the House, where many Republicans and some Democrats have complained that the fund is not doing enough to deal with the corruption and crony capitalism that have become part of Mr. Suharto's hold on power.
There are some signs that the Indonesians are begining to act. The Government has dropped a plan for a currency board, a money-management technique to raise the value of the rupiah that the I.M.F. and the United States warned could sink the economy.
And though Indonesia announced a tax on most purchases of hard currency on Friday, the Government reversed itself on Monday after fund officials warned that the move would scare off foreign investors.
But there is mounting evidence that the country is running low on foreign currency reserves, the cushion that has allowed it to buy food abroad and keep the rupiah from falling even further. The current level of reserves is a closely guarded secret, but it appears to be less than $16 billion, and some put the figure at closer to $10 billion to $13 billion.
And hyperinflation is beginning to set in. One issue under negotiation is a move by Indonesia to stop printing money at the current furious pace to meet its obligations.
"It's conceivable they could simply run out of cash in a hurry," said Steve Radelet, an Indonesia expert at the Harvard Institute for International Development. "If they run out of reserves, if food prices continue to rise, if the drought intensifies, the pressure grows on the army to do something."
For the first time, the I.M.F. is dealing with the huge foreign debts owed by Indonesian companies, totaling more than $70 billion. Virtually all payments have halted, but the first two reform plans avoided the subject of working out a repayment plan with creditors, a prerequisite for convincing foreigners to make new loans.
American and I.M.F. officials have concluded, however, that they moved too hastily in insisting on breaking up food monopolies and ending subsidies on essentials like fuel. While the subsidies are expensive, they may be the only way to keep social unrest from seizing the country. The food monopoly also controls the distribution system.
"The trick," one I.M.F. offiical said, "is to phase them out more slowly."
Alexander Downer, Australia's Foreign Minister, who was in Washington last week to deal with the Indonesia crisis, said: "It's a very fine line we must walk. If you weaken the I.M.F. accord too much, the markets will not respond. If you press Suharto too much, he won't implement the program."

HEADLINE: Former Chief of Carpenters' Union Convicted of Stealing Funds

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
Frederick W. Devine, who campaigned against corruption to become one of the state's most powerful construction union leaders in the early 1990's, was convicted yesterday in Manhattan on charges that he stole more than $50,000 from a fund earmarked to create jobs for unemployed carpenters.
He was found guilty by a jury of siphoning the money to pay for lavish winter vacations in Florida from 1993 to 1996 for himself, his wife, his relatives, a female companion and some of his friends. He was also convicted of using the fund to cover the cost of using a private jet twice to visit another female companion in Rochester. 
 The president of the 25,000-member District Council of Carpenters and Joiners in New York City and Vicinity from 1991 to 1996, Mr. Devine showed no emotion as the jury announced that it had found him guilty of six counts of grand larceny and acquitted him of two grand larceny counts and one count of conspiring to defraud the fund.
During his five years as the head of the nation's largest regional carpenters' union, Mr. Devine -- with a salary of $410,000 a year -- was courted by political candidates who sought his union's endorsement and financial support.
Mr. Devine, 58, faces a maximum prison term of 15 years. He was freed without bail, pending motions by his lawyers to overturn the conviction.
The verdict came after a three-week trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan and was viewed by labor experts as a major triumph for prosecutors in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, who spent two years on the case.
"This is a significant victory against labor corruption," said James F. McNamara, the research director of the Association for Union Democracy, a group that monitors union activities. "Without informing his members, Devine used their money to create a slush fund for his personal use and glorification."
Paul A. Victor, Mr. Devine's chief lawyer, said he would ask the acting State Supreme Court Justice, Colleen McMahon, who presided at the trial, to set aside the guilty verdicts on the grounds of insufficient evidence and that there was no proof of criminal intent by Mr. Devine.
A grand jury indictment in 1996 accused Mr. Devine of misappropriating more than $200,000, but yesterday's verdicts left unclear how much the jury believed he had actually stolen. The jury found him guilty of one "C" felony count of grand larceny, which specifies a theft of more than $50,000. The five other guilty verdicts were for "D" felony counts, for thefts of amounts from $3,000 to $50,000 each.
Mr. Devine began working in a carpenters' local as a teen-ager, repairing and building docks and foundations for skyscrapers. Over the next 40 years, he battled for union posts saying he would extend democratic rights to rank-and-file members. In 1991, he ran for president of the District Council of Carpenters and Joiners, portraying himself as a reform candidate who would end corrupt practices in the union. He was elected, and then re-elected in 1995.
In June 1996, Mr. Devine was abruptly ousted from his posts by officials of the national carpenters' union who cited complaints by members of excessive spending and assertions by a court-appointed monitor that he had helped mobsters and their relatives get jobs at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
The criminal accusations stemmed from expenditures that he authorized from 1993 to 1996 as the district council's president and as the administrator of a regional Labor-Management Cooperation Trust Fund that was established to create union jobs in the city, the northern suburbs and on Long Island.
Michael Bixon, the lead prosecutor, cited the testimony of witnesses and a paper trail of financial records to argue that Mr. Devine's authorized improper payments for himself and others for hotel suites in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., limousine rentals, massages, beauty parlor visits and golf parties. Mr. Bixon said that Mr. Devine spent about $9,000 for two private plane trips in 1993 and in 1994 to Rochester to visit a female union official with whom he was having a romantic relationship.
Mr. Victor, the defense lawyer, contended that Mr. Devine and his associates went to Florida for annual conferences with other union officials. Mr. Victor said that Raymond O'Kane, a former top aide to Mr. Devine, was responsible for the misappropriations. Questioning Mr. O'Kane's credibility as the prosecution's star witness, Mr. Victor said that Mr. O'Kane brokered a lenient plea deal with prosecutors in 1996 after learning that he was being investigated for misusing union funds.
Mr. Victor, in his closing argument, said Mr. Devine's trips to Rochester were for legitimate purposes, not for romantic trysts.
"Prosecutors should stay out of the bedrooms and not prosecute sin," Mr. Victor told the jury. "That's God's jurisdiction."

HEADLINE: Piece of Penn Station's Past Is Found in Salvage

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Maybe it was the sunflower behind her ear. Or the silky folds of her robe. Or the gentle waves in her hair.
Whatever it was, the five-foot chunk of stone that arrived on a truck at the Bronx yard of the Con-Agg Recycling Corporation four years ago didn't look like typical salvage. So the workers set it aside. 
 Not much further thought was given to the piece until last month, when a photograph appeared in The New York Times of an allegorical figure from the old Pennsylvania Station. The building was adorned with eight such figures, four of "Day" and four of "Night," by Adolph A. Weinman. Only five had been accounted for since the station was razed in the 1960's.
Although the fragment of Knoxville marble at Con-Agg was missing its face, the sunflower clearly matched that shown in The Times.
A new "Day" had dawned in a stone-crushing plant at East 149th Street and Bruckner Boulevard. And yesterday, Con-Agg called officials of the Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation to let them know.
"This is our winged victory," declared Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the corporation, when he learned of the discovery. "And it could have been someone's patio."
Mr. Gargano, who is also New York State's chief of economic development, has more than an archeological interest in the statuary. The redevelopment agency hopes to incorporate as many original architectural details as can be salvaged from the old Pennsylvania Station into a grand new passenger concourse and ticketing hall that it is planning within the General Post Office on Eighth Avenue, directly over the Amtrak passenger platforms.
Actually, "Day" was in no danger of paving a patio, or even a highway or sidewalk, for which Con-Agg provides varying grades of recycled concrete.
"They did understand that it was a statue that was appealing and attractive, and on that basis they put it aside," said Charles R. Foy of Whitman Breed Abbott & Morgan, a lawyer for Con-Agg. He said it would be extremely difficult now to trace where the piece came from.
"Their basic motivation was to insure that the statue finds its way back to the proper place," Mr. Foy said, "which will hopefully be the new Penn Station."
New York State officials also hope to incorporate in the new station one figure from a "Day" and "Night" pair that is now in Ringwood State Park in Passaic County, N.J. Another pair is in Kansas City, Mo. And a lone "Night" can be found at the Brooklyn Museum. Perhaps it is the partner of the Bronx "Day."
"It is one of the most significant finds we could hope for," said Alexandros E. Washburn, president of the redevelopment corporation, who has been known to don hip waders and slog through the bogs of the Meadowlands, where parts of Pennsylvania Station were dumped as landfill, in search of artifacts.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN AFRICA: THE REGION;
A New Model for Africa: Good Leaders Above All

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: KAMPALA, Uganda, March 24

 BODY:
When President Clinton walks into a conference with East African leaders here on Wednesday afternoon, he will do what American Presidents usually do in the third world. He will preach the virtues of free markets, democracy and civil liberties.
But Mr. Clinton's decision to hold the conference in Uganda has already sent another strong signal: that the United States is embracing a new generation of leaders in the region who care less about establishing full-fledged democracies than they do about developing their countries. 
 The unofficial standard-bearer for this group is Yoweri K. Museveni, a former guerrilla who rescued this Central African country from political chaos and economic collapse but does not allow party politics. The others in the group include the Presidents of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Congo, the former Zaire.
These leaders say they want more trade and investment from the United States, but they do not want to be told how to govern. Nor do they wish to be chastised for delaying democratic reforms. And while American officials maintain they are still advocating democracy, they acknowledge that their overriding goal in the region is to support leaders who not only manage their governments well but also can somehow staunch the seemingly endless rebellions, famines, refugee crises and economic disasters that have cost the West billions to fix over the years.
From this perspective, Mr. Museveni is a model leader. His style of self-reliant government, fiscal discipline and free-market economics has made him the darling of United States diplomats, who are trying to remold America's role in Africa to replace costly and paternalistic aid programs with more trade and investment.
"You have a new type of leadership, particularly on the economy, and he has more of a regional vision," an American diplomat said. "You're looking at a group of people who find African solutions to African problems." But the American support in recent years for Mr. Museveni and the others in this generation has opened up the United States to charges of double standards from older allies, especially Kenya.
A staunch ally of America during the cold war, Kenya has a much more advanced democracy than Uganda. Still, Washington has battered President Daniel arap Moi recently because he has done a poor job managing the economy and has not cleaned up the rampant official corruption. This has put questions in the minds of some East Africans about how deep America's professed commitment to encouraging democracy runs. Indeed, most of the countries to which the United States has moved closer in recent years -- Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Rwanda -- have yet to set up bona fide pluralistic political systems.
Worse, some of these new American allies, notably Rwanda and Congo, have checkered records on human rights. The Rwandan Army has been accused of massacring Hutu civilians during counterinsurgency operations against rebel groups. Congo's new Government has jailed opposition leaders and held dozens of summary executions after military trials.
Finally, while Uganda itself has experienced its longest period of peace and economic development in decades, the region as a whole is far from peaceful. One reason for this is that Mr. Museveni and the other leaders in this group have not been shy about supporting armed rebellions in neighboring countries.
The war in southern Sudan is entering its 15th year with no sign of abating, partly because recent rebel advances have been helped along by Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea. In Rwanda and Burundi, civil wars between the Hutu majority and Tutsi minority, which in a sense were touched off when Uganda-backed Tutsi rebels invaded Rwanda in 1990, continue to take hundreds of lives a week.
Here in Uganda, a terrorist campaign by Christian fundamentalist rebels in the north has also persisted with heavy Sudanese support. In eastern Congo, the self-proclaimed President, Laurent Kabila, who came to power last year with Ugandan and Rwandan support, is facing new uprisings from rebel movements allied with Hutu insurgents in Rwanda and Burundi. Somalia remains a fractured mess of warring clans with no central government.
Even in Kenya political and tribal tensions have remained high since the re-election of President Moi in January.
It is against this backdrop that Mr. Clinton will meet with these heads of state at Entebbe on Wednesday afternoon. Neither the Burundi military leader, Pierre Buyoya, nor the Sudanese President, Omar el-Bashir, are invited. Nor will there be any Somali representatives. As a result, little progress on solving the region's many conflicts can be expected.
Still, most American policy-makers see Mr. Museveni and the others in the new generation as the best hope for East Africa's future. They argue that these leaders have supported insurrections in other countries only when they would create greater stability in the long run.
Also underlying the new American policy is a desire to work with leaders who will not plunder what foreign aid they do receive and will manage their governments well, taking care of basic services, diplomats said.
As long as these African leaders, like Mr. Museveni, make some headway toward democracy, or show a willingness to keep working toward it, America can live with them, American officials said.
"It's not that we have a double standard," a United States Government official said. "It's that we have varying standards based on historical context."
But there is another reason for the United States' stance. With the cold war won, Islamic fundamentalism has become the new perceived threat to American interests in the region, and the Islamic Government in Sudan has been harboring Muslim terrorists and financing rebel movements throughout the region.
By backing Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea, the United States has isolated the Sudan. All three countries are now receiving American military aid and are in turn helping rebels in southern Sudan.
But for better or worse, the leaders Mr. Clinton will meet with here are not likely to take orders from him. They are too independent for that, diplomats said.
"It has to be recognized that we are not dictating the shape of things out here," a Western diplomat said. "We are increasingly being forced to work with the situation on the ground."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN AFRICA: THE OVERVIEW;
IN UGANDA, CLINTON EXPRESSES REGRET ON SLAVERY IN U.S.

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: MUKONO, Uganda, March 24

 BODY:
President Clinton expressed regret today for the role of the United States in African slavery, as he reeled off a list of errors in American policy toward this continent that included turning to ruthless dictators as allies during the cold war.
Mr. Clinton has been under some pressure at home to issue a formal apology for slavery, but he stopped well short of such an explicit statement. 
 "Going back to the time before we were even a nation, European-Americans received the fruits of the slave trade and we were wrong in that," he said in what his aides called an impromptu remark, which strayed into a political territory that the White House has been trying to avoid.
The President's remarks seemed addressed as much to his audience back home as to those who heard him speak today in Uganda. Although some slaves were taken from this region, West Africa was the real center of the slave trade in the 18th and 19th centuries.
In raising the subject of slavery on what the White House is billing as the most ambitious African tour ever undertaken by an American President, Mr. Clinton chose to elevate an issue that he has largely avoided, except when questioned by reporters.
He made his comment while speaking before more than a thousand children in a meadow by a school in this rural hamlet. Under a brilliant sun, the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton toured the school, then sat as the children danced and sang before briefly joining in the dancing themselves, bouncing and swaying to the drums, the rattles and the bright, high voices.
In his 13-minute speech, Mr. Clinton gave the children a brief history lesson. "It is as well not to dwell too much on the past," he said, "but I think it is worth pointing out that the United States has not always done the right thing by Africa."
Uganda suffered during the 1970's under the brutal regime of Idi Amin, who ruled for years unchallenged by the United States. Without referring specifically to Uganda or any other country, Mr. Clinton said today that during the cold war, "very often we dealt with countries in Africa and in other parts of the world based more on how they stood in the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union than how they stood in the struggle for their own people's aspirations to live up to the fullest of their God-given abilities."
But in keeping with the themes of his trip, Mr. Clinton went on to say that "perhaps the worst sin America ever committed about Africa was the sin of neglect and ignorance."
While trying to encourage democracy and open markets, Mr. Clinton is also trying to alert Americans to hopeful changes in Africa and to direct more investment here. "I came here to listen and to learn," Mr. Clinton said, "to offer my help and friendship and partnership."
Administration officials criticized reporters this evening for focusing on the President's remarks about history, saying Mr. Clinton's purpose in Africa was to envision the future, not exhume the past.
Mr. Clinton, who has been trying to encourage Americans to discuss race for the last nine months, appointed a commission that has been traveling the country for a series of public discussions on the issue.
But he has tried to prevent that discussion from dwelling on slavery and its legacies, an issue that created a small political storm when Mr. Clinton created the commission.
At the time, Representative Tony P. Hall, Democrat of Ohio, called for an official Government apology to Americans whose ancestors were slaves. The idea gained some currency when Mr. Clinton did not quickly rule it out as a goal of the commission.
He later did so, after some of his political advisers argued that an official apology, while seemingly uncontroversial more than a century after slavery was outlawed in the United States, would have run the risk of reigniting tensions over the issue. In the view of some analysts, it also might have needlessly angered some centrist white voters who have been dependable supporters of Mr. Clinton.
Moreover, an official apology for slavery never received a push from the Congressional Black Caucus or from major civil rights organizations, which have considered the issue less important than other matters on their policy agenda.
Calling Mr. Clinton's comment on slavery "statement enough on that matter," the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Mr. Clinton's special envoy to Africa, said, "The question is where shall we go from here?"
But Mr. Jackson, speaking at press briefing tonight arranged by the White House, nevertheless provided a lengthy description of how slavery had operated for centuries as an African subsidy to the American economy.
On his visit here, Mr. Clinton tried today to highlight the efforts of President Yoweri K. Museveni to expand Uganda's economy and educate its people. In addition to speaking here, Mr. Clinton met with Mr. Museveni and later joined Mrs. Clinton to tour another village, Wanyange, to spotlight a lending program that provides small amounts of credit to poor women.
Mr. Clinton, who is clearly relishing the enthusiastic crowds he has encountered in Africa, posed in the village with a 2-day-old baby named Bill Clinton, the son of Betty Namugosa, a shopkeeper. "Look at all this hair!" the President said. "I was completely bald until I was 2."
The infant yawned, and Mr. Clinton pronounced him "the smartest person here."
When reporters touring the village with Mr. Clinton asked if he was invoking executive privilege in the Lewinsky matter, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton ignored the question. President Museveni called after them, saying, "They're asking a question" -- to no avail.
Mr. Clinton had no audience today like the several hundred thousand he addressed in Ghana on Monday. For this portion of the trip, the White House arranged for more intimate speeches in rural settings. The children in Mukono had rehearsed specially written songs for Mr. Clinton, in which they praised Mr. Museveni's education initiatives.
"Universal primary education benefits the majority," they sang in one song, while noting in another that Mr. Museveni's signature program was short on resources. "Mishandling funds, misinterpretation, shortage of classrooms and teachers prevent U.P.E. from flourishing," they sang.
The Kisowera Primary School, which Mr. Clinton visited, crams 760 students into 10 rooms, with 14 teachers in all. There is no electricity, and there are no panes in the windows. Several students from Kisowera and nearby schools said they had never seen a computer, but Mr. Clinton envisioned in his speech a future in which they would communicate with American students on the Internet.
Mr. Clinton announced today that he would seek to spend $120 million in the next two years to improve the quality of African education, through community resource centers, partnerships between African and American schools and programs focused on educating girls, who are often left out when officials plan for schooling.
He also announced another two-year initiative, this one for $61 million, to improve farming techniques and food distribution.
On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton plans to fly to Kigali, Rwanda, for an airport appearance to deplore the violence in that country. White House aides said Mr. Clinton would declare that the world community should have responded sooner to the Rwandan mass killings in 1994, without naming any countries, including the United States.
Then Mr. Clinton is to return here for a meeting of Central and East African leaders before flying on to South Africa on Wednesday night.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN AFRICA: THE RWANDANS;
Why Washington and the World Largely Failed to Act to Head Off the Blood Bath

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
Nearly four years ago, Rwanda and its neighbors dissolved into genocidal violence, and today President Clinton is expected to say the world should have responded sooner to head off the killings.
Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans and others perished in the ethnic conflict. It is still not over. 
 Tragically for the people of Rwanda, both Hutu and Tutsi, their moment of greatest peril occurred too close to the United States debacle in Somalia, in which 18 American soldiers died, setting off a political storm in Washington.
At the time, the Clinton Administration was concerned that there was no clear strategy, viable goal or exit plan for a military mission in Rwanda. It was also divided over how to respond to fast-moving events, with Madeleine K. Albright, then the American representative at the United Nations, arguing for some kind of international response, and the Pentagon and White House opposing any United Nations peacekeeping force.
Ms. Albright ultimately prevailed, but the force created was a very small one of only 270 troops. She has since said repeatedly -- most recently in December on a visit to Africa as Secretary of State -- that the United States and other Western nations did too little too late in Rwanda.
A senior United Nations official said this week that Washington had been "absolutely paralyzed by Somalia." Other nations, already mired in Bosnia, were also reluctant to intervene in the small Central African country.
"The Security Council was traumatized by what had happened," a European diplomat recalled, "but Washington was more traumatized than the others."
Mr. Clinton is not expected to name any country today for a failure to act, but diplomats involved in the United Nations debate in 1994 say they now doubt, despite all the praise and promises of economic assistance for Africa now, that Washington would join or support a peacekeeping operation if a similar crisis arose.
Rwanda descended into genocide in 1994 after years of ethnic tensions. A guerrilla army, the Rwandese Patriotic Front, had been attacking from Uganda. In August 1993, an agreement between the country's minority Tutsi, represented by the front, and the Hutu majority promised to end the ethnic war and introduce a power-sharing system.
By the fall of that year, the Rwanda agreement was already in danger, and the United Nations sent a peacekeeping mission to the country. But early in 1994, the United Nations commander in Kigali warned that Hutu militias were plotting to kill large numbers of Tutsi.
The Security Council, with the United States as its most powerful member, did not act. On April 6 and in the weeks that followed, those Hutu plans were put into horrific effect. The trigger was a plane crash, which many believe to have been an act of sabotage, that killed Rwanda's Hutu President, Juvenal Habyarimana, along with the President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira.
Among those who died in the rampage that followed were 10 Belgian peacekeepers guarding the Prime Minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana. The peacekeepers had laid down their arms only to be butchered, as she was. Belgium decided to withdraw all its troops. On April 21, the Security Council dramatically cut the peacekeeping force to a bare 270 soldiers. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of Tutsi were trying to flee the country to Tanzania as their communities -- and those of Hutu opposed to the massacres -- were decimated.
Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, called the Security Council action at the time "a thin veil over another massacre."
Late in April and into May, as the toll of massacred Tutsi mounted into the hundreds of thousands, Bourtos Boutros-Ghali, the Secretary General of the United Nations, went repeatedly to the Security Council to ask for a credible force for Rwanda.
When the Council finally agreed to a force of 5,500, the United States and other Western nations balked, and Washington forced the United Nations to delay sending any soldiers until there were moves toward an end to the violence.
Mr. Boutros-Ghali, trying vainly to recruit Africans or anyone else for a force, called the situation "a scandal." Eventually, Ghana, Ethiopia and Senegal volunteered.
Events then moved beyond the Security Council. As the Tutsi-led guerrillas of the Rwandese Patriotic Front began a march of conquest across Rwanda, France decided to field a force, which established sanctuaries in southwestern Rwanda, largely for Hutu fleeing the R.P.F.
Many more Hutu chose flight. By mid-July 1.5 million refugees had entered what was then Zaire, which is now Congo.
Again the United Nations asked the Security Council for help. Although Washington was prepared to provide some relief aid, the Administration turned a deaf ear to pleas from Sadako Ogata, High Commissioner for Refugees, for a force in the camps to separate out Hutu leaders who had committed acts of genocide and who would no doubt rearm for a return to Rwanda.
"We asked for help in getting those people out of the camps," Mrs. Ogata told an audience at the Holocaust Museum in Washington last year. "No country offered to get help. My staff had to continue feeding criminals as the price for feeding hundreds of thousands of innocent women and children."
The rearming took place as predicted. By late 1996, when the pro-Tutsi forces of Laurent Kabila, now Congo's President, were emptying the camps of Hutu and forcing them back into Rwanda, a Canadian-led mission to provide security for the displaced was only reluctantly supported and then in effect undermined by the United States.
Tens of thousands of Rwandans are still missing, Mrs. Ogata said recently. She believes that they perished in the absence of a protection force. Mr. Kabila's Government, now being wooed by the United States, is blocking investigations into reports of massacres by victorious Tutsis or their supporters among his troops.
To bring the story full circle, Hutu gangs are now killing Tutsi again in remote areas of Rwanda, and Hutu in turn are being attacked by Rwandan Government troops.

HEADLINE: Patients' Lives on the Line In Battle Over Transplants

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24

 BODY:
For two years and one month, Mindy Ervin has waited in uneasy limbo for a new liver. Too well to be ushered to the top of the transplant list, yet so sick that she has already planned her own funeral, she spends her days in bed, hoping the telephone will ring with news of an available organ.
A former nurse who suffers a rare autoimmune disease, Mrs. Ervin, of Portsmouth, R.I., lives in the region with the nation's longest wait for livers. She cannot have her transplant in Florida, where waiting times are shorter; her insurance company will not permit it. Five weeks ago, she endured a devastating false alarm. She dashed to the New England Medical Center in Boston for the long-awaited operation, only to learn that the donated organ was unsuitable. 
 "I told my husband, 'This is not living,' " said Mrs. Ervin, adding that she no longer expects to see her 37th birthday, which is in July. "I'm just existing, waiting for it to happen, and nobody can tell me if it is going to happen. Emotionally, I don't know how much longer I can hang on."
Now the Ervins must contend with an additional uncertainty: The Clinton Administration is about to dismantle the regional system for distributing donated organs and replace it with a national list in which the sickest patients would get priority. In a recent letter to 89 members of Congress, Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, sketched her proposal, saying the change would even out waiting times and insure that very sick people do not die waiting while those who are less acutely ill receive transplants.
But Dr. Shalala's plan, which is expected to be made an official Federal regulation this month, has done little to ease the minds of patients like Mrs. Ervin and even less to settle the Solomon-like debate about how organs -- and in particular livers, which are in extremely short supply -- should be distributed. Rather, it has exposed a nasty political and economic fight between large and small transplant centers, each vying for its share of the lucrative transplant business, in which an operation can cost $250,000.
Surgeons who trained side-by-side are accusing one another of putting money ahead of patients' interests. The fight is so venomous that Dr. John Fung, chief of liver transplant surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and an outspoken opponent of the current system, complained that he has been "blackballed from administrative positions" in scientific societies by doctors who disagreed with him.
Small transplant centers, fearing that a national list could put them out of business, have argued that a national list would concentrate organs in big cities, hurting poor patients who do not have the means to travel. Big hospitals have complained that their smaller counterparts are trying to hoard organs for patients who are not desperate.
In Washington, the lobbying is intense. The Pittsburgh hospital, which pioneered liver transplants, has hired a Little Rock, Ark., lawyer who also represents President Clinton to press its case that the regional system should be scrapped. A coalition of mid-size medical centers, including Vanderbilt University and a doctors' group from the Medical University of South Carolina, is fighting back with its own lobbyists.
"I wish we were having an open-ended debate about what's fair," lamented Dr. Arthur L. Caplan, a bioethicist and the author of "Am I My Brother's Keeper" (Indiana University Press, 1998), a book about transplants. "Unfortunately, what I suspect we are seeing is a political squabble among transplant centers about what's in their interest."
Many Patients Baffled
By Proposed Changes
Caught in the middle of this fracas are patients like Mindy Ervin, who said she has no idea how the rules would affect her. With more than 10,000 people waiting for a liver and only 4,000 livers available each year, she noted, "some of us are going to die." The question that is dividing transplant surgeons and patients is what system will make the best use of organs and save the most lives.
"It's among the thorniest issues I've dealt with here," said one official at the Health and Human Services Department who is involved with the proposed rules and who spoke on condition of anonymity. "A lot of things we do involve people's lives, but changing the system of distributing organs alters who lives and who dies, or how long you live and when you die."
While a sickest-first national policy might seem to make the most sense, some experts, including Dr. Caplan, said it might not be the best use of organs. Sicker people are more likely to die after their transplants, or to need second and even third transplants. The problem is especially acute with liver patients; unlike people in kidney failure, they cannot be kept alive through dialysis or other medical means.
"It's as if we were in a lifeboat," Dr. Caplan said, "and instead of trying to figure out how many of us might survive a shortage of food and water, we said, 'Let's pick the people who are closest to dead and save them.' "
At the same time, projections of how the new policy would affect patients conflict. An analysis performed for the Pittsburgh hospital by Consad Research Corporation found that Dr. Shalala's proposal would save as many a 200 lives a year by offering organs to people who would not otherwise get them.
But a competing study by the United Network for Organ Sharing, the nonprofit organization that runs the distribution system, found that Dr. Shalala's plan would result in 761 additional repeat transplants each year, and that the overall survival rate after transplants would drop to 68 percent from 75 percent.
"Do we want to transplant the sickest patients first, or the most people possible?" asked Walter Graham, the network's director who favors the current system. "Those are two conflicting objectives. Our answer is that you want to do both, but you can't do both."
So vexing is this issue that the effort to draft new rules has languished in the bureaucracy since 1989, five years after the passage of the National Organ Transplant Act. The law spawned the organ sharing network, a collection of 63 independent organizations that procure organs in their local areas and assign them to hospitals.
The network's distribution plan works this way: Patients are given a rank of one, two or three, depending on the severity of their illness. When an organ becomes available, it is offered to people in the area, starting with the sickest. If there are no local patients, the organ is offered regionally, then nationally.
But donation patterns, as well as waiting lists, vary greatly throughout the nation's 11 regions. In New England, for instance, the wait for a liver is roughly two years, five times as long as in the Southeast.
In 1996, Dr. Shalala noted in her letter, more than half the livers used locally were given to patients who were well enough to be at home. Yet that same year, nearly 400 of the 953 patients who died while awaiting transplants died in the hospital.
With competition for organs fierce, many patients "game the system," said Dr. Caplan, the bioethicist. Some sign up at more than one transplant center, which is permitted under the network rules. Others switch to a hospital where the wait is short.
That is not an option for Mrs. Ervin, whose husband works in a boat yard painting yachts. "People tell us, 'List down in Florida, the wait is shorter,' " Michael Ervin said, "But we don't have the money, and our insurance won't pay for it."
 Mistrust among doctors and patients runs deep. Goldsby Margiotta, a Virginia woman who has been waiting three years for a liver, stopped going to a patient support group when the husband of another transplant candidate began calling her home with prying questions. "He thought I was some kind of interloper trying to get his wife's liver," she said.
To complicate matters, the lists are fluid, with patients' ranks changing constantly depending on their health. "Everybody just thinks you put your name on this big list and when your number comes up they call you," Mrs. Ervin said. "It's not like that at all. People constantly ask me, 'What number are you?' I have no idea."
 
Current Problem Is Testament to Success
The high demand is, in a sense, testimony to the success of transplant medicine, particularly liver transplants. Nearly every liver transplant surgeon in the United States has trained at the University of Pittsburgh, or trained under someone who has. Over the past decade, the Pittsburgh-trained surgeons fanned out across the United States, starting programs at local hospitals.
In 1990, there were an estimated 50 liver transplant programs in the country; today, there are 120. As the number of programs grew, the number of operations done in Pittsburgh fell by more than half, to 230 last year from 569 in 1990, said Dr. Roger Evans, a health policy analyst at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who studies organ allocation.
"Pittsburgh created its own competition," Dr. Evans said.
In 1991, the organ sharing network made a crucial change in its distribution policy that set the stage for the current dispute. Earlier, patients facing imminent death had priority for organs, no matter where they lived. When that provision was eliminated, the number of patients dying on Pittsburgh's waiting list ballooned, said Dr. Fung, the hospital's liver transplant chief.
In 1993, after pressing unsuccessfully for the organ network to rescind the rule change, Pittsburgh officials turned to the Government, which by that time was considering setting standards for organ allocation. They enlisted David Matter, a Pittsburgh real estate developer and college friend of President Clinton, who said he wrote and talked to the President several times. And Pittsburgh hired a Little Rock lawyer, John R. Tisdale, who said last week that he was encouraged to see Dr. Shalala "leaning in our direction."
Also encouraged were transplant surgeons at the University of California at San Francisco and other large hospitals, including Mount Sinai Medical Medical Center in New York. Dr. Charles Miller, Mount Sinai's director of transplantation, said the current system was so Balkanized that a patient in his intensive care unit might be denied a liver that goes to someone waiting at home in Fort Lee, N.J., just across the Hudson River.
 
Organ Network Favors Existing Regional Plan
But officials of the organ sharing network are not going to abandon their policy without a fight. They have hired their own lobbyist and hinted at a lawsuit, saying the Government has no right to impose rules.
"Where does all this come from?" asked Mr. Graham, the executive director. "The only answer I can come up with is that it came as a result of political influence."
Mr. Graham contends the current system encourages organ donation, because donors want to know that their organs will help their neighbors, a view Dr. Miller describes as "beyond bunk."
But doctors from smaller transplant centers agree with Mr. Graham. They say liver transplant candidates are dying across the country and that replacing the regional system will simply change where people die.
"This national sharing plan is not going to bring organs to Cincinnati," said Dr. Douglas Hanto, director of the adult liver transplant program at the University of Cincinnati. "Livers will be taken from Ohio and sent to Pittsburgh. I think Pittsburgh is just flat out very interested in their own program."
To which Dr. Fung, the Pittsburgh surgeon, retorted: "Call Doug Hanto back. Ask him what I did for him three or four years ago when he had a very sick patient in Ohio. Ask him if I sent him a liver from Pittsburgh."
As the debate rages, Congress is considering jumping in. Senator Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican and heart surgeon who practiced at Vanderbilt University, said he would consider holding hearings once the final regulations are announced.
"The Secretary cannot play doctor," Dr. Frist said.
For her part, Dr. Shalala said in her letter that she did not intend to "interfere in the practice of medicine"; she simply expects the organ sharing network to devise new rules to meet the Government's standards.
As for patients, they can do little more than wait. Mrs. Ervin's surgeon, Dr. Richard Rohrer, chief of the division of transplant surgery at New England Medical Center, is optimistic about her prospects.
But his patient is frightened and feels herself getting weaker. She is nauseated, jaundiced and rarely goes out. The weeks since her false alarm have been especially tough.
"I hope I get the call again," she said. "But I hope it comes before I'm so ill that I won't be able to survive the surgery. That's my biggest fear. Will it come soon enough?"

Chart/Map: "Waiting for a Liver Transplant"
The wait for a new liver varies greatly from region to region. The following shows the median wait for all liver transplant candidates in 1995, from the most urgent patients, who will die within a week without a transplant, to the least urgent, who may wait two years or more. Figures on map indicate median wait for each region in days. (pg. A18)

HEADLINE: Amending Tobacco's Sweet Deal

 BODY:
The tobacco industry is waging a fierce campaign to win Congressional approval for the agreement it reached with 40 state attorneys general last summer. The industry's desperate pitch is a good indication that the settlement is good for the tobacco industry and not good for everyone else. The deal would give the industry what it desires most -- protection from future class-action lawsuits and other legal shields, with relatively little impact on future profits. Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, now has the tough job of producing better tobacco legislation that can meet public health goals, give the states their expected payoff and persuade the industry to accept voluntary advertising controls.
A bipartisan plan sponsored by Senators Bob Graham, John Chafee and Tom Harkin has already won favorable reviews from President Clinton and public health experts such as former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. It contains many crucial elements that must be included in any legislation that reaches the Senate floor. 
 Public health experts have long argued that raising cigarette prices is absolutely necessary to curb teen-age smoking. The Graham plan would extract roughly $25 billion a year out of the industry, or $630 billion over 25 years -- raising the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.50 over the next two years, an amount most health economists believe would make a significant reduction in youth consumption. The agreement with the attorneys general, by contrast, would raise the per-pack price by only 62 cents, achieving very little impact on smoking rates.
The Graham proposal is also far stronger in other ways. It would preserve the Food and Drug Administration's full authority to regulate nicotine. It would not grant the industry any immunity against future lawsuits, and would impose stiffer penalties of up to $10 billion a year on the industry if youth smoking rates do not fall by 65 percent over the next 10 years. It would also end outdoor cigarette advertising, ban the use of cartoon characters and other promotional activity.
In exchange, the bill would cap the industry's financial exposure to lawsuits in any given year to $8 billion. The industry would pay $4 billion annually into a separate victims' compensation fund. Money not spent would be rolled over to the next year. This mechanism would give the industry financial predictability, but would not shield it from any liability.
The industry, faced with damaging exposure about its past efforts to sell to teen-age smokers, is on the defensive. But it is by no means an impotent force in Congress. Its power to push through legislation is substantial, particularly since both the White House and the Republican leaders are eagerly eyeing money from any tobacco settlement to pay for their favorite programs. As the Senate takes on tobacco, it must remember that this issue is not about protecting the industry or plugging holes in the Federal budget. The aim here is improving public health, and any legislation has to be measured by that yardstick alone.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
As the Panthers Lose Money, Their Fans Enrich Huizenga

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
H. Wayne Huizenga cannot make money in the sports business. Or so he has claimed.
As the owner of three of South Florida's four professional sports teams -- football's Miami Dolphins, baseball's Florida Marlins and hockey's Florida Panthers -- Huizenga has spent the last several years insisting that his baseball and hockey franchises are losing money. 
 But like many of the owners of sports franchises who plead poverty, Huizenga has found ways to turn a profit from his teams, no matter what his financial statements have to say about gate receipts and player salaries. Borrowing a page from Ted Turner, Huizenga has used his sports teams to anchor a cable television station. And like Rupert Murdoch, who bought Dodger Stadium along with the Dodgers last week, Huizenga owns Pro Player Stadium, where both the Marlins and the Dolphins play.
But Huizenga, one of America's richest businessmen, has also come up with a new twist on the familiar story of how to turn a supposedly money-losing sports franchise into a financial bonanza: sports team as investment tool.
Capitalizing on his hockey team's 1996 drive to the Stanley Cup finals, Huizenga sold stock in the Florida Panthers to the public. Public enthusiasm persuaded civic leaders in Broward County, Fla., to use public money to build a new stadium for the team. Then, Huizenga used the hockey team's stock as currency to begin building yet another diversified enterprise. The company's first move: to buy two resort hotels owned partly by Huizenga and other Panthers officials, a move that enriched Huizenga, his friends and others who have invested with him.
It has all worked out grandly for Huizenga, whose original investment in Florida Panthers Holdings has nearly tripled in value, to $150 million. But those riches have won Huizenga few fans in South Florida, some of whom rate the maneuvering as a clever but cynical manipulation of loyalty to a local team.
Investors who bought the stock in its first month of trading have done well, but many of those who bought subsequently have, at best, broken even. The Panthers, having traded away some of their top players, including Dave Lowry and Esa Tikkanen, have fallen from the Stanley Cup finals to having the second-worst record in the National Hockey League this year.
Even some profitable investors who got in early have expressed outrage, believing that Huizenga and his friends profited improperly. Three class-action lawsuits seeking damages have been filed by shareholders.
Huizenga, through a spokesman, declined to be interviewed. But J. Ronald Castell, a senior vice president at Florida Panthers Holdings, defended the company's new direction. He said the move into the resort business was not contemplated until Huizenga had come to despair over the stock's failure to rise much above its initial price in the opening days, as usually happens with an initial public offering.
The filings made as part of the stock offering said that the company could acquire other businesses or properties, including some owned by Huizenga or his affiliates. And other Panthers executives note that the purchase of the resorts was approved by "disinterested" members of the company's board of directors and was ruled fair by a Wall Street investment bank.
 
For Team Owners, An Elusive Bottom Line
Those assertions give little comfort to Bernard Kalishman, a 67-year-old Miami resident and Panthers shareholder. Kalishman said he had got caught up in the short-lived hockey mania in 1996, but he is now angry that Huizenga sold stock to hockey fans and then started buying his own hotels.
"It was not an ethical thing to do," said Kalishman, who filed one of the three suits charging that Huizenga and other insiders misled investors, enriched themselves through self-dealing and violated securities laws against insider trading. "Now, he has started to cut the Panthers' payroll, like he did with the Marlins."
Fans have long expressed skepticism when owners say they are losing money on sports teams. They read of lucrative television contracts, then get hit with higher ticket prices. They see teams bought and then resold for double what the owners paid. And this is not the first time such complaints have been voiced against Huizenga.
In fact, fan disgust with owners crying fiscal distress reached its climax last fall when, barely days after Huizenga's Marlins won their first World Series, the club dismantled the team, saying it had to trade away expensive stars -- left fielder Moises Alou and pitcher Kevin Brown among them -- because the team was losing too much money.
Huizenga is not alone in crying financial duress. For one, George Steinbrenner, the owner of the Yankees, has done his share of poor-mouthing over his club's financial performance, eager to get public financing for a new stadium and threatening to move the team otherwise.
But many economists agree that few, if any, sports teams truly lose money for their owners, who typically employ creative accounting and use their other businesses -- like stadium operations or cable television networks -- to make money off the team.
"Unless you buy the argument that a large number of people are willing to pay ever-higher prices for a depreciating asset, you're not looking at folks who are losing money," said Mark Rosentraub, director of the Center for Urban Policy and the Environment at Indiana University.
Because most sports teams are privately held, outsiders are unable to tell much about their financial situation. While a few teams have opened their books in order to sell stock to the public -- the Boston Celtics being the most famous -- none have done so with the panache, or the sense of timing, of the Panthers.
In June 1996, on the eve of the team's first appearance in the Stanley Cup finals, Huizenga announced he would sell 50 percent of the team to the public. The sale was intended in part to help raise support for a new arena: "You buy these stocks because you love the sport or want to be part of owning a team in your local community," Huizenga said in a television interview.
At the time, Wall Street was booming, and stocks of newly public companies typically soared. The buyers of those shares, though, typically would be the corporate pension funds and other institutions that do big business with the Wall Street firms that underwrite stock offerings.
Florida Panthers Holdings was an exception. "The financing was targeted at the loyal fans of the Florida Panthers, and to my knowledge it was sold exclusively to South Florida residents," said Budd Bugatch, a financial analyst at Raymond James & Associates, a Florida-based brokerage firm that led the offering.
Clearly, some of the ordinary buyers were drawn to the company by Huizenga's stunning history of success. In the 1970's, he built Waste Management into the country's largest garbage hauler, and later made Blockbuster Video the nation's biggest video outlet. Most recently, he has built Republic Industries into a giant of auto sales and rentals. Forbes Magazine said last year that Huizenga's accumulated fortune is $1.7 billion.
Panther fans snapped up 2.7 million shares at $10 each, while company insiders bought another 4.6 million at about the same price, together contributing $71.4 million to the new company. With the stock price staying near its offering price, several members of the company's board of directors soon bought an additional 345,000 shares in the open market.
"I've been watching Huizenga's progress through the companies he's owned, and when he came out and decided to build a new stadium for the Panthers, I decided to get on the bandwagon," said Paul Susser, a 76-year-old fan of the Panthers from Plantation, Fla., who bought stock in the offering. "But there was nothing in there saying Huizenga wanted to run a hotel company."
 
A Quick Change Of Direction
But that is the road Huizenga took barely a month after the stock offering, stunning Wall Street by transforming Florida Panthers Holdings into "a diversified leisure time based sports and entertainment company."
To do so, the company announced it would acquire two South Florida resorts, the Hyatt Regency Pier 66 Hotel and Marina and the Radisson Bahia Mar Beach Resort and Yachting Center, issuing 8.4 million new shares of stock, then worth $84 million, to the resorts' owners. Those owners included Huizenga and three other members of the Panthers board of directors, who received 2.4 million, or 28 percent, of the new shares.
The deals, unrelated to the hockey club, sent the price of Panthers stock soaring. But despite the sharp increase, the company did not adjust the number of shares it had offered to exchange for the resorts before the deal closed in March 1997. By ignoring a common practice when acquisitions are paid for with shares of stock, the company ended up paying $225 million for the two resorts, three times the original price.
The big winners in the deal were the Panthers insiders who owned the resorts, and the directors who bought the 345,000 shares of Panthers stock before the announcement of the deals. Three of those insiders also owned part of the resorts; the fourth is Huizenga's brother-in-law, one of the "disinterested" directors who approved the deal.
No Federal or state securities regulators have brought any charges of improper conduct against the Panthers directors. Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor the Florida Division of Securities would comment on whether it had been or were investigating the situation, and Panthers officials said they did not know of any inquiries by the authorities.
In the past year, Florida Panthers Holdings has continued to expand its resort business, buying two more Florida resort properties, a South Florida golf course and the Arizona Biltmore, a luxury resort near Phoenix.
Its newly purchased properties have begun to brighten the company's bottom line. In the six months ended Dec. 31, for example, the resorts earned $6.9 million. But the hockey team has continued to lose money -- $7.3 million in the six months ended Dec. 31 -- despite selling out most games.
Despite the team's losses, the market value of Florida Panthers Holdings has increased sixfold since the company went public, to $750 million. The gain is due to the millions of shares of new stock the company issued to make its resort purchases. Traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the company's stock currently trades at about $22, well below its high of $32.50, reached shortly after the first resort purchase was announced.
Perhaps the hockey team can start turning a profit after moving next season. The new arena boasts 4,385 more seats than the Miami Arena, where the Panthers now play, and plenty of the luxury boxes that Huizenga covets. The company will also reap the benefit of managing the arena, which can be used for myriad other events.
Even so, the profits from the hockey and arena-management operations, which now account for only about 10 percent of the company, will be but a blip on the company's financial screen. For Huizenga, little about Florida Panthers Holdings has to do with hockey.

Study Shows Power Savings

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Electricity users in Connecticut would save hundreds of millions of dollars if lawmakers open the state's electric markets to competition, a study for a business group has showed.
If electric rates are cut 10 percent, the state's 1.4 million residential customers will have an additional $132 million in their pockets each year, said the study for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, the state's largest business group. 
 The study, released yesterday, said almost all of those savings would be spent on other things, from pizzas to clothes.
There would be similar benefits for industrial and commercial customers, while a failure to pass the bill this year could hurt businesses, said Donald Klepper-Smith, president of DataCore Partners, a Middletown, Conn., market research firm that did the study.
The study estimated that Connecticut could lose 19,000 manufacturing jobs if neighboring states lower their electric rates but Connecticut's remain at their current level -- up to 72 percent higher than the national average.
The study showed that industries could save $46.5 million a year with a 10 percent electric rate cut and that industries would pump nearly half of that savings into the economy.
For commercial customers, $114.9 million could be saved, and that money could be spent to generate $54.6 million for the economy.
A bill that had been before the General Assembly proposed a guaranteed 10 percent rate cut starting in 2000 and continuing for three years. After that, the free market would determine the rates. A legislative committee had replaced the measure with a bill that would start the deregulation process but delay action for another year while the issue is studied. But legislative leaders have said that work on the original bill will continue, and that a final bill will be ready for a vote in April.

Sport Utility Toasting

BYLINE: By Phil Patton 

 BODY:
RUGGED, retro, British and expensive, the Dualit professional toaster has a bulldog look. Essentially unchanged for a half century, the Dualit ($359 for the four-slot model, $269 for two slots) resembles a Land Rover -- the original 1948 Land Rover, the one on which Joy Adamson's lions draped themselves. There's the same combination of curves and lines, the same rugged metal surface (though the toaster comes in colors like sea green, yellow and blue as well as chrome) and the same utilitarian shape -- the same look right down to the slotted grill.
Rough country bread is for these toasters what rough country roads are to sport utility vehicles. "I call it the S.U.T. -- the sport utility toaster," said Steve Holt of Frogdesign, a Silicon Valley company that styles toasters for Sunbeam. "You get the same exaggeration of features." 
 Why would anyone need such an appliance?
Americans have ventured beyond the regulation two thin slices of Sunbeam bread in their Sunbeam toasters. Now, American toasting has moved to three and four wide slots at a time. While couples in the 1940's and 50's used to toast at the breakfast table -- the toaster being a tamed version of the hearth -- they now park their toasters on their kitchen counters and eat breakfast there, if they eat breakfast at all. The toast itself includes not only Pop-Tarts but also thick English muffins, wide bagels and great hunks of peasant bread. And when it comes to toast slices, two are never enough.
The Dualit is only the high end of the new generation of high-testosterone, wide-slot toasters. Big chrome Cuisinart four-slicers cost $80, brag of electronic sensors, and protrude from those counter-top kitchen "appliance garages" the way Chevy Suburbans protrude from real garages. Krups offers a wide-slot model, the $50 Sensotoast Deluxe -- the equivalent of the sleek Mercedes M-Class sport utility vehicle. Brenda Cooper, a sales associate at Broadway Panhandler, says that a British model, the Russell Hobbs, $74, has sold well recently. It appeals, she said, to those who like rough-cut slices of fresh bread and bagels.
A decade ago, toaster sales fell. "A toaster oven was the hot new item to have," said Carolyn Scott, an economist and partner in McCoy, Scott & Company, a consulting firm that follows the small-appliance market. "Now," she said, "it might be the three-or-more-slot toaster."
The toasters rated best by Consumer Guide magazine -- the Krups, Cuisinart and Kitchenaid ($120) -- get points for offering seven different settings, perhaps a few more than absolutely necessary. The Krups and the Cuisinart have microprocessors to control doneness. Some toasters boast higher "pop up"; others tout the superiority of their removable crumb trays. All of them toast the toast.
The toaster emerged in the 20's as a symbol of American prosperity and modern domestic life. The design historian Russell Flinchum has said that because toaster technology was largely mature by 1930, the way to distinguish toasters is through looks. So toaster design has been fiddled with almost as much as car design -- and it's hard to come up with anything new. Frogdesign's Sunbeam toaster, which has a little window allowing a peek at the toast, echoes Henry Dreyfuss's "look while you cook" Birtman toaster of 1932.
The prestige of the Dualit is that it conveys an air of European expertise. Just as professional stoves like the Garland became status symbols in the late 70's, Dualits are (more affordable) status symbols today.
But what's the difference between a Dualit (offered exclusively in the United States by Williams-Sonoma) and, say, the $15 Proctor-Silex?
The Dualit is pure utility, and looks it. It comes with a sandwich basket for lowering complex bread constructions into the wide slots. It uses a mechanical timer, and it does not even pop the toast up automatically. Instead, the heating element switches off and the toast remains inside. To release the toast, you flip down a sturdy knob-and-rod device that lifts its toasted cargo with a solid "chunk," reminiscent of the sound of a siege catapult.
A rugged toaster like the Dualit announces that its owner has stepped beyond the vagaries of mere toaster styling. "It looks like the toaster for the ages," Mr. Flinchum said. "The implication is, This is the last toaster you'll ever buy."

The strongest economy in a generation leaves most Americans with stagnant wages, record debt, reduced benefits and longer workweeks. Who's better off?

HEADLINE: Teen-Age Suicide

 BODY:

To the Editor:
During the 15 years in which suicides among black teen-agers increased dramatically, so has the availability of handguns. Your March 20 front-page article on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study omits this essential fact. The study says that "firearm-related suicides account for 96 percent of the increase in the suicide rate among black children and teens." 
 Your article's focus on the theory of black middle-class depression reflecting the strain some families feel in making the transition to middle-class life may hold true in general, but there is no evidence for it in the centers' study, which did not consider the economic status of victims. What we do know is that the availability of handguns in the home increases the risk of suicide fivefold. And to stem the tide of suicides, we need to regulate the availability and accessibility of handguns.

You're All Fired!

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Bored? Depressed? Stumbling and coughing a lot? Fearful your public is tiring of you, but unwilling to gamble on vigorous reforms? Take the Yeltsin Cure: grab world headlines by firing your whole Cabinet, and then hire most of them back.
A week before Russia's President flexed his shake-up muscles, Gen. Alexandr Lebed was here campaigning for governor of a region in Siberia by speaking in the U.S. That may sound odd, but it's the new Russian politics: "See this cameraman?" he said to me after telling Congress that NATO expansion is no big threat. "His film goes on television back home. I'm being pragmatic." 
 He's gambling his national future on a regional race. If Lebed loses in Krasnoyarsk, he's finished; if he wins, he'll be a prospect for president in 2000. Last time out, Yeltsin pumped money into Lebed's campaign to split the large anti-Yeltsin vote, then paid him off with a short-lived appointment before dumping him.
The formerly arrogant general must be happy about Yeltsin's latest reshuffle. Lebed's archenemy in the military, Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov -- whose botched war in Chechnya Lebed ended -- is out on his ear. And Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Gore's Gazprom gasbag, has also been cut adrift.
"Chernomyrdin's like a sunflower," Lebed opined through an interpreter before the P.M. got the sickle, meaning his power was purely derivative. "When Yuri Luzhkov is no longer Mayor of Moscow, he's still Luzhkov; but take Prime Minister from Chernomyrdin, and he's nothing."
He sees Luzhkov as "a serious candidate, with money, organization." What about the Communist leader, Gennadi Zyuganov? "A scarecrow -- his ceiling is 29 percent." And Boris Nemtsov, the handsome young democrat said to be Yeltsin's favorite, soon to be reappointed? "He gets the unpopular assignments, along with taking care of the bones of the last czar. Finished."
I presumed that Yeltsin won't seek a loophole in the Russian Constitution that would enable him to run again. Lebed disagreed: "Yeltsin will run again. He's running already."
Gee -- that's what Grigory Yavlinsky, the only reformer building a national political party, has been saying all along. "There's a Russian saying, 'fools agree,' " smiled Alexandr Ivanovich. (The more pompous American expression is "great minds think alike.") What about Yavlinsky?
"Intelligent man, attracts smart people around him. Controls 8 percent of the Duma. I don't know what's the matter with Yavlinsky -- he doesn't engage but doesn't resist. Still, there's an affinity between us. Everybody says he could be kingmaker, not king."
Yesterday I reached Yavlinsky on his cell phone in Moscow (Kremlinology is easier now). The putative kingmaker gives Lebed a good chance of making a comeback in Siberia. He, too, is relieved at the fall of General Kulikov, and will not miss Chernomyrdin; he's glad his reformist ally Nemtsov remains in place.
"Firing the Government is positive," says the leader of the Yabloko party. "Yeltsin did it himself, with no advice." Wasn't Boris Berezovsky, the billionaire capitalist at odds with Chernomyrdin over a gas deal, behind the shake-up, as he has hinted? "No," says Yavlinsky flatly. "This was Yeltsin being Yeltsin, wanting a tabula rasa. He showed the seven bankers their power was not absolute. Now we'll see if he follows through."
Yavlinsky, unlike most of the bears dancing to Yeltsin's game of musical chairs, has a clear direction in mind: "Gaining people's confidence with a fair and simple tax system; ending nontaxpaying monopolies like Gazprom; breaking the criminal oligarchy, and privatizing property, including land."
That would take steady, purposeful leadership at the top, but I don't see sustained vision in a fits-and-starts reformer like Boris Yeltsin.
Yeltsin is splashing around a lot, but when it comes to building a free economy he's treading water. His only policy consistency is wrongheaded, coming from Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Saddam Hussein's loyal K.G.B. friend, whose shortsighted nationalism discourages investment from abroad.
Yeltsin will serve until he drops because he needs to stay in office to stay alive. But to struggle out of its swamp, Russia needs the daring Yeltsin of a decade ago.

HEADLINE: Home Resales Soar by 8.7% As Slowdown Proves Elusive

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25

 BODY:
Home resales rose at a record pace in February and factories continued to receive orders for big-ticket items at healthy rates, signs of strength that confounded predictions of slowing economic growth.
"What slowdown?" said John Ryding, senior economist at Bear, Stearns & Company in New York. "There's no evidence of a slowdown in the overall economy," 
 The National Association of Realtors said today that sales of existing single-family homes rose 8.7 percent last month, to a record annual rate of 4.75 million units, up from January's 4.37 million units.
In another economic report, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods fell 1.7 percent in February. But that was chiefly because of a big drop in aircraft orders to the Boeing Company; excluding aircraft orders, which often change sharply from month to month, durable goods orders rose half a percent in February, the seventh increase in nine months. Also, February shipments, a gauge of current activity, increased.
Because of the Asian economic crisis, policy makers at the Federal Reserve had predicted that a decline in demand for American exports would cause economic growth in the United States to slow to less than 2.75 percent this year. But most private economists have now revised their estimates for first-quarter growth to well above that pace, and some say the stronger-than-expected performance will extend into the following three months.
"We're looking at a very healthy first two quarters," said Michael Englund, chief economist at Standard & Poor's MMS in Belmont, Calif. "The Fed is going to find it increasingly difficult to use Asia as a reason for assuming a slowdown this year."
Rather than holding down the American economy, Asia has been a net benefit so far, analysts say. Because investors have flocked to the safety of American Government securities, interest rates have fallen. That has caused consumers to spend more on housing and other items.
Today's housing data showed that home resales gained in all regions of the country during February. The president of the National Association of Realtors, R. Layne Morrill, said, "We had expected demand to stay strong, but this is exceptional."
Resales account for about 85 percent of all single-family home sales in this country. The figures are based on actual closings, which reflect contracts signed a month or two earlier.
With little change in mortgage rates over the last three months -- rates have remained close to 7 percent for the average 30-year fixed loan -- the housing outlook remains healthy. The Mortgage Bankers Association of America reported today that applications for mortgages rose 7 percent last week.
Rising home sales, in turn, mean growing domestic demand. "Spending on household durables is set to get even stronger as people seek to furnish and improve their new homes," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at HSBC Markets Inc. in New York.
Durable goods orders and shipments reflect that demand. In a sign that factories were expanding capacity, orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft rose 1.3 percent last month. And orders of industrial machinery, a category that includes computers, rose 3.2 percent. Over the last three months, industrial machinery orders are up 33 percent.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
In the economy's success, don't forget somy lucky breaks.

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle 

 BODY:
NO ONE can argue with a straight face that the American economy is damaged or even threatened by what happened to oil this week. Sure, the producing countries announced that they intended to cut production. And in response, oil prices jumped for a day. They might even go a bit higher. But oil is still remarkably cheap, clearly a break for the national economy.
Much is made of America's current economic success. While Europe and Japan wallow, the United States economy surges ahead. To many economists, politicians and executives, that demonstrates the superiority of the American model. Ever more efficient companies, these boosters say, have generated strong profits and full employment, without having to raise prices. And in such noninflationary conditions, robust economic growth can go on indefinitely. 
 But this explanation leaves out good luck, which has played a big role in the economy's success, maybe even the decisive role. "There are some real improvements," said William Dudley, director of domestic economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company, "but we have had a lot of blind luck, and that can change."
Three items appear on nearly everyone's list of lucky breaks for the American economy since the last recession ended in 1991 and the present expansion began. In chronological order, the first was the Soviet Union's disintegration and the end of the cold war, which unleashed a much greater worldwide output of goods and services -- more, in fact, than people wanted to buy. Then came the Asian crisis, which suppressed demand in Asia without suppressing supply. And finally, there is the year-long decline in oil prices, also a case of more supply than demand.
None of the three qualifies as all good news, of course. The Asian crisis may in time bring trouble to America. What they have in common, however, is that each has held down the inflation rate in the United States. That, in turn, has kept the Federal Reserve from slowing the economy by raising interest rates. The goal of such Fed action is to prevent the inflation rate from rising, but often a recession has resulted.
The oil phenomenon promises another respite from inflation fighting. Since autumn, the decline in oil prices has probably reduced the inflation rate by 20 percent, the Labor Department estimates. Cheap oil means lower costs, and higher profits for any company that uses oil, or oil-based materials such as chemicals and plastics. That is a huge group of companies ranging from airlines and truckers to chemical plants, utilities and manufacturers. Airlines alone have seen their fuel costs drop by 23 percent in the last year, a saving of more than $1 billion.
"The airlines are keeping some of these savings as profit, and they are passing along some to passengers," said Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst for Salomon Smith Barney. "You are seeing some significant airline ticket sales right now."
The American household, through its cars, is the biggest benefactor. The average price of a gallon of gasoline has declined to $1.06 or $1.07 from $1.25 a year ago, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. And even if this week's jump in oil prices to $16.35 a barrel from $13.35 earlier this month is not rolled back, the average gasoline price is still unlikely to get above $1.10 a gallon. After all, just six months ago, West Texas crude sold at more than $22 a barrel.
"The downturn in Asia and the unseasonal warm weather in America have really chopped out the anticipated growth in demand for oil," said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge.
When gasoline and heating oil prices fall, consumers quickly shunt their savings into other spending, stimulating the economy. That helps to explain the current brisk spending seven years into an economic expansion, says Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's Consumer Surveys. "Gasoline price fluctuations are something people notice simply by driving into a service station," he said, "and they incorporate changes right away into their budgets."
The oil price decline is not without damage, of course. Texas and Alaska, to take two examples, depend heavily on taxes derived from oil production for their state budgets, and tax revenues have declined drastically, particularly in Alaska. Still, there is serendipity in the announcement this week of production cuts to force up the price.
At less than $14 a barrel, oil industry profits were threatened. The rebound this week to more than $15 removes that pressure and preserves profitability. "There will be pain for the oil companies," said Ann-Louise Hittle, an industry analyst with Cambridge Energy Research, "but we are not going back to disaster scenarios, unless prices go lower."
Which may make this week's uptick in price yet another stroke of good luck.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN AFRICA: THE NEXT STOP;
A Touchy South Africa Takes Pains Not to Kowtow

BYLINE: By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, March 25

 BODY:
President Clinton is spending 11 days on this continent, but he is really making two different trips: one to Africa and one to South Africa.
South Africa is of Africa, but different too. It is no hardship case dependent on foreign aid. 
 Its economy dwarfs that of any other African country. In fact, its gross domestic product is nearly half that of the rest of sub-Saharan Africa's 48 countries combined. Some 300 American companies do business here. And in Nelson Mandela, South Africa has a President whose international stature rivals Mr. Clinton's.
While the United States may be able to tell Jerry Rawlings of Ghana or Paul Kagame of Rwanda what subjects will be on the agenda, the relationship with South Africa is, if not one between equals, one between a world superpower and a regional superpower.
Yet despite its status, South Africa remains a pretty touchy country. Mr. Clinton's visit will be examined carefully here for signs that the United States is showing due respect to a nation that is wary about its sovereignty, doesn't ask for much outside help -- it does not owe the World Bank a dime -- and is unwilling to kowtow to a superpower.
The new black-led Government is hypersensitive about being told what to do, especially by the Americans. The Government sees the United States as an essentially white country that repressed its own blacks for centuries and was a tacit ally of the old apartheid state and the chief foe of African liberation struggles.
All this is not to say that South Africans are indifferent to Mr. Clinton's attentions. American companies have already invested more than $2 billion here since 1994, according to Business Map, a private group that tracks business trends here. And the Government would certainly like to see more American investment.
Moreover, officials here see the Presidential visit as helpful even in their efforts to persuade businesses from other countries to invest in South Africa. While the United States is the country's largest foreign investor, Malaysia, Britain, Germany and Japan are also big players. For days officials have been urging South Africans to take in stride the inconveniences that might arise from the Clinton visit, pointing out the potential benefits of the international attention he will bring with him.
Mr. Clinton will whip through most of the six countries he is visiting, but he will spend four days here accompanied by pomp and pageantry that other African countries cannot afford. Some, like Ghana, do not even have enough hotel rooms to accommodate the nearly 1,000 diplomatic, security and communications personnel and reporters accompanying Air Force One. Here though, Mr. Clinton plans to visit Johannesburg, the country's financial hub, and Cape Town, where he will address Parliament, be a guest at a state banquet and visit Robben Island, the prison where Mr. Mandela was held for 18 of the 27 years he spent in prison. Had he wanted, he could easily have gone to Pretoria or Durban too.
Apart from the pageantry , high-level officials on both sides are planning a host of meetings during Mr. Clinton's trip. But these get-togethers do not carry the sense of urgency and one-shot opportunity of the meetings in the other countries. The United States and South Africa have a bi-national commission, led by their Vice Presidents (they are said to get along well), which regularly meets to discuss trade, economic issues, cultural and scientific exchanges.
There is one sticky issue at the moment, though: A new South African law aimed at lowering drug prices. The South Africans say it lets them import legal drugs from wherever they are least expensive. But American drug makers say it destroys their patent rights and legalizes piracy.
Indeed, if Americans ever expected an easy relationship with the new South Africa, they have by now learned otherwise. President Mandela has proved tough-minded and independent, several times loudly and clearly rejecting American suggestions.
Last October, for example, when State Department officials protested his visit to Libya, saying it violated United Nations sanctions, President Mandela made no secret of his fury. He went ahead with the trip, lashing out at America at every stop. He said it would be immoral not to acknowledge the role that countries like Libya played in the struggle against apartheid, "one of the most brutal systems in the world."
"How can they have the arrogance to dictate to us where we should go or who our friends should be?" he said at one point. "Can you imagine if I said Boris Yeltsin should not visit Albania? They would say that I am the most arrogant black."
Other American entreaties have also fallen on deaf ears.
South Africa ignored United States displeasure with its decision to import Cuban doctors to rural areas where medical help was needed and went ahead with a deal to store Iranian oil.
South Africa's cautious relationship with the United States is no doubt influenced by the shadow of United States policy during the apartheid years.
During the Reagan and Bush Presidencies, America was no friend to the African National Congress, which in those days clung to the Socialist and one-party line.
Meanwhile, the United States -- busy with cold-war strategy -- was aligned with South Africa's white-minority Government in supporting Unita guerrilla fighters in Angola.
Many African National Congress officials from that era remember the United States as the enemy and have not taken the United States to their bosom so easily.

HEADLINE: CLINTON IN AFRICA: A SHOWCASE;
Uganda Could Be Model For 'New' Africa's Goals

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: KAMPALA, Uganda, March 25

 BODY:
Winston Churchill called this lush, landlocked country "the pearl of Africa." Idi Amin turned it into a charnel house. Now it is a display window for an African renaissance.
Of the six countries President Clinton is visiting during his 12-day African trip, Uganda has achieved the most stunning transformation. (South Africa has replaced government by a repressive minority with government by an enlightened majority -- an extraordinary achievment. But it never experienced the economic disintegration and lawlessness that once gripped Uganda.) 
 "Ours is a country that has had a long and, in the main, sad history," said a leading Kampala newspapers, The New Vision, in an editorial welcoming the President. At the nadir, in the late 1970's, Uganda was synonymous with mindless savagery.
In his book "The Africans," written only 15 years ago, David Lamb painted a grim picture. He wrote: "Uganda no longer exists as a viable nation. Its government is a collection of outcasts and misfits serving only themselves." Only its agricultural potential, he added, "holds out any hope that Uganda could, in a generation or two, forge some kind of meaningful nationhood."
Yet Uganda's economy, little noticed by most of the world, has become the fastest growing in Africa. Security has been re-established in most of the country. Kampala is again a handsome, hilly city with lovely gardens, and a framework for democracy has been created -- including a new constitution, a free press and an independent judiciary. Two years from now, Ugandans will decide in a referendum what form of government they want.
Major American investments of the kind Mr. Clinton wants to encourage are already visible. The AES Corporation, a United States power producer with worldwide interests, is the majority shareholder in Nile Independent Power, which is building a $500 million hydroelectric plant near Bujagali on the Nile. The Coca-Cola company is building a $23 million bottling plant with African partners.
All this has come at a price.
President Yoweri K. Museveni, who took power in a coup in 1986, runs what he calls a no-party state: opposition voices are muted and the police still use strong-arm methods. A rebel movement in the north kidnaps children and sends them into battle against Government forces. Corruption remains intractable.
Nor has Mr. Museveni made much headway against the old enemy, poverty: two-thirds of all Ugandans still live lives of grinding destitution. His support appears widespread, but people still worry about the future.
"When he goes, what do we get?" a shopkeeper asked this week. "The rest are corrupt and incompetent. It's hard to plan for the future."
Mr. Museveni was described by Mr. Clinton as a model, and Administration officials often cite him as the kind of leader, along with Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and Alpha Oumar Konare of Mali, that they would like to see in other African capitals.
One reason is geopolitical. Islamic fundamentalism has replaced militant Communism as the bugbear of American diplomacy, and Ethiopia and Uganda form a bulwark against their turbulent neighbor to the north, the Sudan. Mr. Museveni has even used his troops to support animist and Christian rebels in southern Sudan who oppose the Islamic Government in Khartoum.
Another is personal. American officials are impressed by President Museveni's tireless efforts to combat AIDS, a scourge in this country. He has tripled spending on education, especially teachers' salaries, while also beefing up his military forces.
But it is more than that. With the cold war over at last, Washington is in a mood to admit past mistakes in Africa and to make amends.
"Very often we dealt with countries in Africa and other parts of the world based more on how they stood in the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union than how they stood in the struggle for their own people's aspirations to live up to the fullest of their God-given abilities," Mr. Clinton said at Mukono.
He might have been talking about Idi Amin, the crude, hulking dictator who ruled here from 1971 to 1979. With the United States and its European allies looking the other way, almost to the end, more than 300,000 Ugandans were murdered on his orders. Mr. Amin expelled 50,000 Asians with British passports, mostly of Indian origin, who had been Uganda's shopkeepers. Coffee plantations stood idle, shops and factories closed and the tourist industry disintegrated as roads crumbled and game herds were slaughtered for meat. Not a single hospital or school was built during Idi Amin's rule. Makerere University, once known as the Harvard of East Africa, fell into intellectual ruin.
Apolo Milton Obote, who preceded and followed Mr. Amin, was not much more of a bargain. A hard-drinking tyrant, he held power through his secret police and finished the job of dismantling the economy that Mr. Amin started.
For those who know where to look, there are reminders in today's Uganda of the bad old days. Mr. Clinton stayed at the Sheraton Hotel, once the Apolo, built during the Obote regime and named for him. And part of the press corps stayed nearby at the Nile Hotel, formerly known as the Nile Gardens, an address once feared by every Ugandan: Mr. Amin's enemies were taken there to be tortured.
